0,"Governor Corzine told a Senate committee considering climate change legislation that moving to cleaner energy will create jobs in nearly every sector of the economy.\Critics of the proposal to cap emissions of carbon dioxide and create a marketplace to trade credits say many of the ""green jobs"" touted by proponents are government subsidized and ignore jobs being lost in more traditional industries.\""We're in the midst of a real revolution right before our very eyes,"" Corzine told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""It's happening, its positive, it's creating jobs. The transformation will produce tens of thousands of jobs.""\Testimony he submitted to the committee cited investment bankers helping to fund innovations in solar energy, construction firms modernizing ""our aging energy infrastructure"" and scientists at Rutgers University developing ways ""to convert algae into a renewable energy fuel.""\Corzine told the committee New Jersey laws have set the stage for the revolution, by putting the state in a regional pool that trades credits for emitting carbon dioxide and by requiring power companies to develop 30 percent of the state's electricity from renewable sources such as offshore wind farms and solar arrays.\Building wind farms will create jobs for electrical engineers, steel workers and longshoremen, Corzine said. And the state Labor Department has launched a Green Jobs Partnership Training Program to train 300 entry-level workers over the coming year on how to make homes and businesses more energy efficient. Public Service Electric and Gas has committed to hiring 100 of the graduates, Corzine said.\On the same panel as Corzine, North Dakota Gov. John Hoeven criticized the ""cap and trade"" strategy in a bill to combat global warming that passed the House and is now before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Hoeven, a Republican, pointed out that technology to reduce emissions from electric power plants fueled by coal, which the United States has in abundance, are still in the developmental stage.\Republicans on the committee agreed with him, and said ""cap and trade"" would eliminate many jobs through new mandates and regulations.\""You pass this bill, you're going to get an unemployment program with it because it's going to lose jobs,"" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. He said states along the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines were advocating programs that would disproportionately harm states in the center of the country.\Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said ""green jobs"" are also heavily subsidized.\""Wind and solar jobs are not so much created as bought,"" he said.\Kevin Roberts, spokesman for the New Jersey Republican Party, questioned why Corzine would be asked to testify about job creation when the state ""is losing clean jobs at the fastest rate in the nation.""\""Perhaps Governor Corzine has called in yet another favor from his Washington friends in an attempt to raise his profile and distract voters from his record as governor,"" Roberts said.\***\E-mail: jackson@northjersey.com\***"
1,"CHRIS CHRISTIE could be ""Mr. October."" No one could confuse New Jersey's governor for a calendar boy. But to a die-hard Yankees fan, which Christie is not, ""Mr. October"" was Reggie Jackson. And ironically, it is something called ""RGGI"" that could propel Christie into a national campaign that will hinge on a strong October showing.\On Thursday, Christie pulled New Jersey out of the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, commonly known as ""RGGI."" It is a ""cap and trade"" program. My understanding of these types of energy policies is only slightly greater than my understanding of baseball stats.\RGGI is designed to limit the amount of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. A power company buys a carbon allowance from a participating state for every ton of carbon it emits. If it emits below a pre-set cap, it can sell its surplus allowance in a quarterly auction. The credits are traded like pork bellies.\The program encourages companies to go green. It also generates green, in the form of dollars, to the states participating in the program, which ideally should go toward green projects, but often goes for other things, like plugging holes in the state budget.\Environmentalists like ""cap and trade"" and Big Business does not. Big Business sees the purchasing of a carbon allowance as another tax, stifling economic growth and investment in the states participating in RGGI. Christie backed out of RGGI because he said it has been ineffective in reducing carbon emissions, a debatable point.\In a recession, there is less manufacturing, a reduced need for energy and, with that, a reduction in carbon emissions. When the economy improves, the energy needs will grow and RGGI would be a safeguard for the environment. Allowing power companies to self-regulate would be as smart as clustering as many nuclear plants onto one site as possible. Hmm.\Allowing power companies to self-regulate also opens doors to a national campaign.\Charles and David Koch control Koch Industries Inc., a vast business empire rooted in petroleum. They have lots of money, real power. Through foundations, the Brothers Koch are exerting great influence on American politics and domestic policy.\Americans for Prosperity is one such recipient of Koch largess. In New Jersey, former Bogota Mayor Steve Lonegan is the face of AFP, and he has been lobbying loud and hard against RGGI.\""[T]he RGGI cap and trade scheme has been exposed as nothing less than a devious and deceptive tax. This is a program that has been stained by secrecy and open to exploitation by speculators looking to profiteer on the backs of ratepayers all while driving up electricity rates and contributing to the continued exodus of jobs and industry from our state,"" Lonegan said in a statement after Christie backed out of RGGI.\Meanwhile, the New Jersey Sierra Club said: ""Christie is giving a tax cut to polluters while jeopardizing the health and environment of New Jersey. This is all about national politics, not the best interests of our economy, environment, or residents.""\While I believe the governor remains independent and not entirely predictable, the people pushing to kill RGGI are self-interested parties. Metaphorically speaking, when a tree falls in the forest, the Brothers Koch not only hear it, but collect it, mulch it and turn into a roll of paper towels. And the Brothers Koch can have a huge impact on the next presidential election. And they will.\It is ridiculous to expect energy companies to self-regulate. And it is equally foolish to not expect energy companies to do everything they can to fight back regulations. Energy policy - not abortion or gay rights -- is the real litmus test for conservative financial backing in the coming 2012 campaign.\Most Big Money people don't care what you do in your bedroom or with your body. What they care about is making money on heating your home and powering the medical clinic. Energy is the ""new black."" It is the thing we all need, few understand and even fewer are willing to pay more for in the short-term to protect the environment for future generations. Perhaps the joke is on us. We may become the fossil fuel polluting the skies of the 31st century. The Brothers Koch may end up as product in one of their own refineries.\But that is an October far, far away. It is October of 2016 that interests me most. And I expect, interests New Jersey's governor as well.\Reggie Jackson had an up-and-down relationship with fans, but there was a moment in his career when it all came together. Mets fan Christie will hardly look for guidance from a long-ago Yankee, but if sports and politics could truly mix, I would not be surprised to see Christie bound onto a stage in October of 2016 in the final weeks of a presidential campaign, while the Brothers Koch shouted ""RGGI! RGGI!""\Reggie Jackson got a candy bar. Chris Christie could get something sweeter.\Credit: Alfred P. Doblin is the editorial page editor of The Record. Contact him at doblin@northjersey.com.

2,"ENERGY GREENHOUSE GAS\TRENTON When Gov. Chris Christie says New Jersey is withdrawing from a cap-and-trade greenhouse gas program, he means it.\That's how the Republican governor explained his veto Friday of a bill advanced by Democrats requiring the state to remain in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\Christie wrote in his veto message that the legislation was ""a political response to my administration's announcement on May 26, 2011, that the state withdraw from RGGI.""\Christie also repeated his reasons for bailing out of the 10-state program, which caps carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants and charges the plants for the emissions they produce.\""While I acknowledge that that the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere are increasing, that climate change is real, that human activity plays a role in these changes and that these changes are impacting our state, I simply disagree that RGGI is an effective mechanism for addressing global warming,"" he wrote. ""RGGI does nothing more than impose a tax on electricity.""\Christie said greenhouse gas emissions must be addressed on a national and international scale.\The New Jersey Sierra Club's Jeff Tittel said Christie's wishes can be countered by a long-shot override vote in the Legislature, or in the regulatory process also needed to allow exit from RGGI.\The Democratic chairman of the Assembly Environment Committee, John McKeon of Essex County, said he'll try for an override, though no similar second-try votes have worked since Christie took office.\""We must stand up and fight to protect our environment and clean-energy economy from the shortsighted decision by Gov. Christie to pull New Jersey out of RGGI,"" McKeon said.\Bob Jordan: 609-984-4343; bjordan@\njpressmedia.com"

They said the market for pollution permits had generated $159 million in sales in New Jersey during three years of participation, including $125 million for the state to use toward energy efficiency and renewable projects.\The lawsuit filed by Environment New Jersey and the National Resources Defense Council claims Christie and other state officials acted unilaterally in pulling New Jersey out of the program.\A spokesman for Christie, Michael Drewniak, disagreed.\""There was nothing illegal about our withdrawal from RGGI. Participation in the RGGI consortium was via a contractual arrangement with provisions for any state to pull out with notice and without penalty,"" Drewniak said. ""No one was locked into RGGI, which was a failed public policy that taxed businesses and residents and left New Jersey at a competitive disadvantage.""\Christie is also being pressured by state lawmakers. A resolution approved May 24 compelling the state's return to RGGI sits on Christie's desk.\He has until July 8 to sign it, but Drewniak said, ""No, we will not be rejoining RGGI.""\The lawsuit filed in the Appellate Division of Superior Court in Trenton contends that Christie and the state Department of Environmental Protection violated the state's rulemaking process by failing to take public comment.\""Governor Christie unilaterally made his decision to leave RGGI without taking any input from stakeholders or the public,"" said Matt Elliott, clean energy advocate for Environment New Jersey.\""As we contend today, his actions are not only bad public policy, but also illegal.\The people of New Jersey have spoken out overwhelmingly in support of RGGI.

11,"A LANDMARK decision by the Environmental Protection Agency is cause for celebration today, Earth Day 2009.\After eight years of being known for ignoring science and hindering progress in the fight against global warming, the United States finally has the leadership we urgently need. Precious time has been lost, but this nation will no longer take a back seat to the rest of the world in addressing climate change.\Last week, the EPA officially declared carbon dioxide and several other gases to be dangerous pollutants that damage public health and welfare. This unprecedented and long-awaited action is the first step in the eventual regulation of these gases under the Clean Air Act. The reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is essential to limiting the damage already done to the environment and preventing even more.\Three years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court said the government has an obligation to regulate greenhouse gas if it is a threat to public health. That order was ignored until recently, but no longer.\This is just the first salvo in what will be a long and difficult process. The EPA will regulate carbon emissions, particularly from cars and trucks, if it has to, but it would rather Congress set the ground rules. The problem is Congress is divided, and not just along partisan lines. Republicans tend to oppose rules that will set controls on business and industry, while Democrats from states with coal-burning plants tend to want to protect them from increased costs.\But the thinking in Congress must change, and self-interest must give way to thinking globally. Lawmakers can look to New Jersey for guidance. Two years ago, Governor Corzine signed the Global Warming Response Act, which pledges to reduce carbon emissions 20 percent by 2020.\As Staff Writers Scott Fallon and James M. O'Neill report in today's Record, New Jersey has begun to participate in a 10-state cap-and-trade auction system designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by forcing companies that pollute to pay for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit.\Corzine also wants the state to get almost one-third of its electricity from renewable resources by 2020. And New Jersey is becoming a leader in wind power and off-shore wind farm technology.\Earth Day began 39 years ago as an effort to call attention to the needs of the planet, at a time when environmental issues were not widely known or understood. Advocates for the environment were dismissed as ""tree huggers."" But today, ""green"" is everywhere: green hotels, green cleaning products, green clothing and food. Much progress has been made in making our air and water cleaner, in public acceptance of recycling and in preserving open space and protecting wetlands.\However, far too many people are still using too much electricity. They are not engaged enough in conservation, not taking mass transit to work and not driving energy-efficient cars. Perhaps we can say that the second era of Earth Day's celebration begins today, with the federal government finally accepting its responsibility to label carbon emissions a threat to the planet and taking the first steps to regulate them. Eventually, the result will be cleaner cars and factories, cleaner air and water -- and healthier people.\No more time can be lost in addressing climate change and global warming. Fortunately, this Earth Day, America is ready to take its place at the forefront of that fight.\***"

Tod Delaney, president of First Environment in Boonton, overlooks the layout of the company's office. The firm aims to help companies meet environmental standards.\Boonton firm's mission:\A cleaner, greener world\Global companies boost\First Environment as they\cope with overseas rules\by tim o'reiley\daily record\BOONTON -- In the cavernous main room of its office, First Environment punched a row of nine ground-level windows -- plus two at the height of what would be the second floor -- in what previously was the solid south wall.\Those windows, plus skylights and several other design features, helped slash the firm's energy consumption by about one-third when it moved in three years ago.\That's an important practice-what-you-preach talking point for selling its green engineering.\But the original plan of extending the top tier of windows as long as the bottom was aborted because of the expense, said James T. ""Jay"" Wintergreen, assistant to the president at First Environment.\In many ways, this encapsulates the hurdles that First Environment confronts as it tries to build its practice of advising companies about how to limit consumption of raw materials and emit fewer greenhouse gases.\Everybody likes the idea of protecting the environment by wasting less, and some practices can save money.\But the costs of re-engineering basic production methods often limit how much companies will do voluntarily and prompt them to lobby against legislative mandates.\Perhaps the highest-profile battle has been waged for years by automakers resisting moves in Congress to raise the mandatory mileage requirements for new cars.\First Environment President B. Tod Delaney sees attitudes among major multinational companies changing, in part to comply with much stricter regulations in the European Union, as well as with smaller economies, such as Canada and Australia.\""The rest of the world is embracing things like environmental management systems,"" Delaney said, referring to comprehensive assessments of how company practices affect the environment and how to make improvements.\""The more progressive companies realize they have to do something.""\Greenhouse gases goal\BASF, which has its North American headquarters in Florham Park, is in the second year of a decade-long program to reduce its greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, by 10 percent.\The driving force for the program is that the corporate headquarters are in Germany and 60 percent of its sales originate in European Union countries, spokesman Robert Guenther said.\""When you operate globally, you don't want to operate by two standards,"" he said. ""It makes things much more complex.""\The problem for First Environment is that among mid-sized companies that do business only in the United States, its customer base, the acceptance of taking environmental steps is ""basically zero,"" Delaney said.\Large companies earn public relations points for their programs, but smaller ones do not have much luxury built into their budgets for being enthusiastically green.\""There is not yet an economic driver except good corporate citizenry,"" said Mark Nardolillo, president of the engineering firm BEM Systems in Chatham. ""And as we all know, economic performance trumps that, absent regulation.""\However, that could change as the rising cost of energy ripples through the economy, Nardolillo said.\For example, Toyota, followed by Ford, has pledged to sell a rapidly rising number of cars with hybrid power trains that get higher mileage than conventional gasoline engines.\Without legal requirements to measure and limit greenhouse gas emissions to try to stop global warming, an approach embraced by the Kyoto Accord but shunned by the Bush administration, corporate acceptance could come slowly.\""Voluntary is not going to get the kind of reductions people want,"" Delaney said.\When asked whether adopting a compulsory approach would require a regime change in Washington, he replied, ""That's rather obvious.""\Even if the political momentum swings in 2008, business groups will continue to fight new laws.\""We don't think you can regulate your way out of this,"" said William Kovacs, a vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\Rather than turn to a cap-and-trade system, where businesses receive permits for greenhouse gas emissions that they could sell or buy on exchanges, such as the stock market, Kovacs advocates allowing new energy-efficient technologies to emerge.\Cap-and-trade ""tries to put limits on the amount of energy you can use,"" he said.\First Environment is staking part of its future on its belief that cap-and-trade will emerge in the next few years as a national standard.\In August, the company was approved to certify power plant emissions levels for the voluntary California Climate Action Registry.\It also was approved for similar status by the Chicago Climate Exchange, a nascent effort to build a cap-and-trade market.\Soon, First Environment plans to open two offices in Canada, where the government has implemented greenhouse gas rules much more stringent than in the United States.\Delaney is betting that the experience in the early days will give the company a head start if cap-and-trade takes hold in this country, although larger engineering firms will be able to put work for Fortune 500 companies on their resumes.\Financial trends, as much as tree-hugging instincts, have driven the strategy.\Currently, First Environment's revenue base is split roughly in thirds, with one part coming from examining and cleaning up sites that have some underground contamination, another from pollution litigation and investigations done for companies involved in takeovers, and the rest from a variety of sources.\In the next few years, Delaney expects much of this traditional work to decline as more and more contaminated sites are cleaned up.\For the previous three years, company revenues have been stuck at $4.9 million to $5 million as a result.\Greenhouse gas and other types of environmental consulting that fall under the umbrella term of ""sustainability"" could account for as much as 60 percent of revenues in five years, with the rest split between site work and litigation, Delaney said.\That could propel the company to double in size, he added.\Even if the political climate does not move in the direction he foresees, he expects enough work to make a big impact on a company this size.\Delaney expects a better than 10 percent gain in revenues this year, to about $5.6 million, with the increase flowing in part from the greenhouse gas initiatives.\Still, Kovacs cautioned, ""Betting on climate change is like going to Las Vegas or Atlantic City.""\Tim O'Reiley can be reached at (973) 428-6651 or toreiley@gannett.com."

Bill Baroni, chairman of McCain's New Jersey campaign, disagreed.\""Senator McCain has been a lifelong conservationist and that's what led him to stand up to his own party on climate change,"" Baroni said. ""John McCain is a strong believer in energy independence and developing alternative fuels, such as solar and wind, which fits hand-in-glove with what New Jersey is doing on wind power.""\Although the troubled economy has overshadowed environmental issues in this election, both candidates say tackling energy issues and climate change is essential to the future of the United States.\Obama calls it ""one of the biggest challenges of our times.""\""It is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create 5 million new jobs, easily,"" Obama said in his second debate with McCain.\McCain says his plan to promote clean energy would also create millions of jobs.\***\WHERE THEY STAND\Global warming\McCain's stance on global warming has set him apart from his party. He broke with President Bush in 2001 when he and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat at the time, announced that the United States should set limits on the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. In 2003 and 2007, the two pushed bills to create a cap-and-trade system to mandate reductions in emissions.\""When we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration,"" McCain said in one of the debates.\McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, appears less convinced global warming is caused by man-made pollution.\""There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet,"" Palin said in the vice presidential debate. ""But there are real changes going on in our climate. And I don't want to argue about the causes. What I want to argue about is how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts?""\Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden countered: ""This probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. ... If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution. We know what the cause is. The cause is man-made. That's the cause. That's why the polar icecap is melting.""\Like McCain, Obama is promoting a cap-and-trade plan to force industry to reduce emissions. The program would set a yearly cap on carbon emissions nationally, and companies would obtain credits to emit a certain amount. Because companies can sell unused credits, there is an incentive to pollute less.\Each year, the number of pollution credits is reduced to curb emissions. Obama wants to reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050; McCain is calling for a 60 percent reduction by 2050.\Obama would auction all the emissions credits each year. McCain has not indicated how many of the credits would be sold and how many given away.\It's an important issue for New Jersey, which is already in a regional cap-and-trade program with 10 Eastern states. Much of the bad air that plagues New Jersey drifts in from the Midwest -- states that are not part of the group and are doing little to curb pollution.\""We'd like to see a national program as opposed to a piecemeal one where the rest of the U.S. gets a free pass,"" said Michael Egenton, vice president for environment and transportation issues at the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce.\National program\A national program would also level the playing field for businesses in New Jersey. Companies in the regional plan have to pay for credits, which raises the price of doing business. Competitors in Pennsylvania and the Midwest don't have those costs, said Anne Hoskins, vice president for federal affairs and policy for Public Service Enterprise Group, parent company of the state's largest utility.\Both McCain and Obama would use revenue from the cap-and-trade auctions to develop wind, solar and other alternative power sources.\Obama would also use another potential source of revenue for energy-related programs: a five-year tax he has proposed on oil company profits. It also would pay for energy cost rebates of $500 for individuals and $1,000 for married couples.\McCain opposes a ""windfall tax"" on domestic oil companies, saying it would ""result in increasing our dependence on foreign oil and hinder investment in domestic exploration.""\However clean energy efforts are funded, New Jersey could benefit. This month, New Jersey approved a $1.1 billion pilot project to build 96 wind turbines off the coast of Atlantic City and Avalon.\""New Jersey has always been a progressive leader on the environment, and the state is very well-situated to take advantage of new investments in developing renewable energy,"" said David Pringle, of the New Jersey Environmental Federation.\New Jersey, already ahead of the curve on wind power, will have a workforce with experience in renewable energy and the technology to produce the hardware required nationwide for solar and wind power generation, he said.\Offshore drilling\But on another issue -- offshore drilling -- New Jersey might not fare so well.\Offshore oil and gas drilling, which has been heating up as a national issue, could endanger the state's 127 miles of coastline and the tourism industry New Jersey depends upon.\Governor Corzine, environmental groups, fishermen and mayors of the beach towns have all vehemently spoken out against offshore drilling.\McCain, however, believes the drilling would reduce the price of oil and America's dependence on foreign oil. ""We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now,"" McCain has said.\Obama has said offshore drilling would be an option and has said the government needs to pressure companies that hold the drilling rights for 68 million acres to exercise those rights or give them up. But as he said in one of the debates: ""We can't simply drill our way out of the problem. And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.""\One of the more memorable exchanges of the campaign occurred at the vice presidential debate, when Palin corrected Biden on the Republicans' chant about drilling.\Biden had criticized McCain for voting numerous times against funding for alternative energy sources, saying McCain's ""only answer is drill, drill, drill.""\Palin responded: ""The chant is 'drill, baby, drill.' And that's what we hear all across this country in our rallies because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into.""\Palin added: ""Barack Obama and Senator Biden, you've said 'no' to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we're in. You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally friendly drilling offshore -- as raping the outer continental shelf.""\Superfund\On another issue critical to New Jersey -- lagging cleanups at some of the state's 114 Superfund sites -- the two candidates also diverge.\The Superfund program originally imposed a tax on certain industries to pay for cleanups at sites where no polluter could be identified to fund the work. The tax expired in 1995, and Congress has not reinstated it. With that tax revenue gone, Pringle and other New Jersey environmentalists argue that taxpayers have been burdened with paying for cleanups. Cleanups have slowed during the Bush administration because less money is available, they said.\McCain has voted against reinstating the tax.\Obama says he would seek to reinstate it. Biden voted for it in the Senate.\Egenton, of the Chamber of Commerce, said businesses are worried about reinstating the tax because they feel too much of the money went to legal fees rather than cleanups.\""If we can actually clean these sites up, it's a win-win-win,"" he said. ""We're protecting the environment, putting these properties to productive use, and adding them back to the tax rolls.""\***\E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com\***"
14,"Of the 34,000 words spoken between President Obama and Mitt Romney during the first two presidential debates, pollution, air quality and clean water were not among them.\But while the environment has taken a back seat in the rhetoric, it is an underlying issue in the candidates' vigorous debate over energy.\Romney's platform centers on fossil fuels, with support for offshore oil drilling, continued use of coal, approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and backing of natural gas in his bid to make North America energy independent by 2020. Romney said it would add 3 million new jobs, reduce the trade deficit and add $500 billion to the gross domestic product. Environmentalists say it would lead to more pollution and threaten public health. Romney has said he wants to ""modernize"" and promote a more ""rational approach"" to environmental regulations to ensure public health but has not given specifics about what changes would be made.\Obama has put more emphasis on renewable energies such as solar and wind, which he expanded greatly in the last four years. But his goal of 5 million green jobs over 10 years has come up short. He has strengthened air quality by placing tougher standards on coal-fired power plants and vehicle emissions. But, disappointing many environmentalists, he has also made moves to increase natural gas production. His administration approved two expansions of pipelines that cut through large swaths of the New Jersey Highlands.\""Their plans are like night and day. Actually they're even more dramatic than that,"" said Charles Drevna, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, long a critic of Obama's energy policies.\New Jersey falls squarely in the middle of their competing platforms.\'Real consequences'\The state is at the forefront of renewable energy with the second-most solar installations in the U.S. and plans for wind turbines off the coast of Atlantic City. Coal-fired power plants in New Jersey have been retrofitted to emit much less pollution, but about one-third of the state's air pollution comes from emissions from aging power plants in other states.\With the recent expansion of its pipeline system, New Jersey has also become a major conduit for natural gas extracted from Pennsylvania through a controversial process known as fracking, one of the few energy issues that does not completely divide Obama and Romney.\And with offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean back on the table as part of Romney's platform, the state's 127 miles of beaches and $30 billion tourism industry are also part of the discussion.\""New Jersey may have some of the strongest environmental protections, but it is not an island,"" said Doug O'Malley of Environment New Jersey, an advocacy group that endorsed Obama. ""There are real consequences with this election.""\Drevna agrees, but while his organization has not endorsed a candidate, he backs Romney's plans.\""We're going to be a nation driven by fossil fuels for a long time,"" he said. ""Are we going to make ourselves energy independent or are we going to continue to invest in an area that hasn't shown to be effective?""\In the past four years, Obama has required coal plants to cut mercury emissions and the substances that produce smog and soot. Those efforts were considered a huge step toward cleaner air in New Jersey, which lies downwind of some of the worst-polluting plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Industry groups say it kills jobs because it costs so much for plants to retrofit.\Obama has also twice increased fuel economy standards, with the latest almost doubling the average gas mileage of cars and light trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The moves reduce emissions and curb oil consumption, but Republicans criticized them because they raise the cost of cars by about $2,800.\Obama has tacitly supported the expansion of natural gas extraction, which is supported in the swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. His administration has approved the expansion of Tennessee Gas' pipeline through the Highlands, a move environmentalists say has scarred one of the few remaining large forests in North Jersey.\Obama has also doubled renewable energy generation from wind, solar and geothermal sources since taking office. But the effort doesn't appear to be on pace to produce the number of jobs once hoped. And healso faced a major stumbling block when Solyndra -- a California solar panel company once held up by the administration as a cornerstone of its green jobs initiative -- went bankrupt despite receiving a $535 million federal loan guarantee.\The efforts could shift if Romney wins, O'Malley said.\""Everything [Obama] has done would be at risk under a Romney administration,"" he said. ""You have one of the strongest environmental records with this White House, and you have a candidate in Romney who is doubling down on dirty, antiquated fossil fuel.""\Global warming\Drevna said the oil, coal and natural gas industries have done enough to ensure less pollution.\""Mitt Romney is not going to roll back our environmental standards,"" he said. ""He's also not going to cede our economic and national interests to foreign oil. He will keep American jobs here. He's been a man of his word in everything he's done.""\While global warming has not been a centerpiece of the campaigns, Obama considers it an urgent threat to the world and supports cap-and-trade efforts to lower carbon emissions. Romney believes that global warming is real and that humans contribute to it, bucking the more conservative corner of the GOP. He has been against cap-and-trade policies, claiming they America at a competitive disadvantage to countries like China that don't have such regulations.\Shortly after becoming governor of Massachusetts, Romney stood outside a Boston-area coal plant in 2003 and criticized management for not meeting the state's mandated pollution rules, saying that the plant ""kills people."" But he became a strong proponent of fossil fuels towards the later part of his governorship.\Romney said his energy platform is crucial to pulling the country out of its long economic slump. His plan, he said, will create jobs, reduce the trade deficit and lower gas and electricity prices.\In the debate and elsewhere, Romney says he supports renewable energy like solar and wind, but he has criticized Obama for putting $36 billion in grants and loans from the stimulus bill into the sector with little job growth to show for it. Of the $21 billion spent so far, 28,854 people have been employed in 3,960 projects, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek analysis. Overall, the President's Council of Economic Advisers said federal recovery spending had ""saved or created"" 225,000 clean-energy jobs by November 2010.\Fossil fuel advocates say that was a poor use of taxpayer dollars.\""Everyone is for more efficiency, but you don't come into office with a preconceived notion about flicking some switch from fossil fuels to something that either doesn't exist or is too costly,"" Drevna said.\Romney wants states to oversee the development of all forms of energy on federal lands within their borders, saying states know what their constituents want and have the ability to fast track projects through permitting.\He wants to start a five-year offshore leasing plan for oil off the coast of Virginia and the Carolinas. But he says he supports state-of-the-art safeguards that would prevent a repeat of 2010's BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, which spilled 206 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. About six months after the accident, the Obama administration allowed 13 companies to resume deepwater drilling off the coast of the U.S.\Virginia has bipartisan support for offshore drilling because it would bring thousands of jobs and millions of tax dollars to the state, but Obama has blocked those efforts. Those plans have also been met with widespread opposition in New Jersey with fears it puts the lucrative Shore economy at risk.\For both Romney and Obama supporters, it's just another example of the gap between the candidates.\Email: fallon@northjersey.com\Sidebar: \Fast facts\Here are a few environmental issues that either Obama or Romney will have to tackle in the next four years:\Oil drilling off the Atlantic Coast\Romney wants to start a new five-year offshore lease that begins with projects off the coast of Virginia and the Carolinas, which opponents say puts the New Jersey coastline at risk.\Obama had proposed opening part of the Atlantic to drilling in 2010, but changed the proposal and kept the Atlantic closed after the BP Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico.\Natural gas fracking\Obama supports continued natural gas mining through fracking and has proposed safeguards to protect against water contamination and air pollution at some sites. His administration has also approved the recent expansion of pipelines carrying fracked gas through New Jersey, including the Highlands.\Romney is also a supporter of fracking. He believes Obama is putting too many regulations in the way of the natural gas industry.\Wind, solar and renewable energy\Obama staked much of his energy policy and a sizable portion of his economic recovery plan on advances in renewable energy with about $36 billion investment in stimulus funds. That may pan out in the long run, but job growth in the sector appears to be sluggish.\Romney said he supports renewables, but puts them well behind expanding fossil fuels to reach his goal of an energy independent North America by the end of the decade.\Credit: Email: fallon@northjersey.com"
15,"Today's question: Would you vote to support a cap-and-trade system on carbon emissions to control global warming?\DISTRICT 5\SCOTT GARRETT, Wantage\Republican incumbent\""No. I believe that so far we've seen, as far as cap and trade, that it will have such a degrading impact upon the economy and that it would be devastating to states such as New Jersey and that's not the right way to go. ... There's no fair and clear, transparent mechanism to put in place with regard to a cap and trade.""\DENNIS SHULMAN, Demarest\Democrat; psychologist and rabbi\""Yes, I would, and I do believe that one of the things that really has been kind of remarkable about this administration, both on the national level but also within this congressional district with Scott Garrett, is that both have not taken global warming seriously. ... The evidence is quite conclusive global warming is man-made and it's real. ... When we talk about protecting the world and being able to have the world around for our children and grandchildren, I think there's no question in my mind that this is an ethical concern as well as a political concern.""\DISTRICT 8\BILL PASCRELL JR., Paterson\Democratic incumbent\""Yes. ... Our goal is to steadily reduce carbon dioxide or else we're only kidding ourselves. Greenhouse gas emissions, we need to reduce them in a cost-effective manner, slow down the dangerous man-made global climate change which threatens the world as we know it.""\ROLAND STRATEN, Montclair\Republican; small-business owner\No. I don't support that at all. I think it's a really silly gimmick which is just adding more regulation and another market that probably will screw things up. ... We really need to look at this and attack it in a more logical way rather than having a whole 'nother set of regulations on it. I think if we just develop some sound energy conservation methods and some sound energy policies, we would not need cap and trade.""\DISTRICT 9\STEVE ROTHMAN, Fair Lawn\Democratic incumbent\Yes. And I'm the proud co-sponsor of a bill which would do just that, HR-6316. For a coastal state like New Jersey, the consequences of global warming would be especially dire. A cap-and-trade program would represent a temporary transitional step until we could develop clean, renewable energy sources that do not pollute our environment and endanger our planet.\VINCE MICCO, Rutherford\Republican; mortgage banker\""Not unless our major trading partners did the same. Otherwise I would be absolutely opposed to ... further putting the United States at an unfair advantage while other countries exploit the fact that they're not subjected to such restrictions. The United States already self-imposes the highest standards of environmental protection in the world ... [and] it just seems unfair to me for the United States to continue to self-impose the burdensome regulations on our businesses while our trading partners like China just continue to conduct business the way they do.""\***\Audio recordings of full responses are online on the Capital Games blog at northjersey.com/herbjackson.\Next: Would drilling for oil or gas off the coast of New Jersey threaten the Shore environmentally?

16,"Tim Eustace, an assemblyman and former Maywood mayor, is already driving his second electric car. His Maywood residence and his Jersey Shore home are both festooned with solar panels. He also walks each day to his chiropractic office, further reducing his carbon footprint.\And now Eustace, a Democrat in his third term representing District 38 in central Bergen County, is the new chairman of the Assembly's Environment and Solid Waste Committee. He replaces Grace Spencer, who resigned her Assembly seat to accept a Superior Court judgeship in Essex County.\Eustace's appointment has drawn praise from environmental groups.\""He's a real good guy on the environment and is always right there with us on our issues,"" said Bill Sheehan of Hackensack Riverkeeper. ""I'm pretty excited he's been named chair and we look forward to working with him.""\Doug O'Malley, executive director of Environment New Jersey, agreed. ""This couldn't happen to a better guy from our perspective,"" O'Malley said. ""He's a great pick. He's the real deal, and we will need his leadership to fight back against the Christie administration's environmental rollbacks and advocate for a green agenda.""\Assemblyman Scott Rumana, a Republican and former mayor of Wayne, is one of six members of the Assembly's environment committee. ""I really like Tim -- our relationship has always been very cordial since he came to the Assembly,"" Rumana said.\""He and I both have similar concerns on flooding issues that impact our respective districts, and that lends itself well to advancing legislation to alleviate flooding in our region,"" said Rumana, a strong advocate for a potential $4.7 billion, 20-mile tunnel project to drain storm water from the upper Passaic River basin out to Newark Bay.\O'Malley said the fact that Eustace represents a portion of Bergen County gives him unique insight into many of the environmental issues the state faces.\""Bergen County is a microcosm of the environmental battles across the state, from Superfund sites to oil trains to the proposed Pilgrim Pipeline to impacts of flooding,"" O'Malley said. ""Assemblyman Eustace represents one of the most competitive districts in the state, and his leadership on the environment is a reminder that green issues resonate with voters across the political spectrum.""\Eustace said that flooding issues are a top priority. He has already played a role to help make it easier for towns to get state permission to remove branches and other debris from streams and rivers to reduce flooding.\But Eustace and the Democrats also cite some other environmental priorities, including the need for New Jersey to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, a multistate cap-and-trade program to cut emissions of carbon, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Governor Christie pulled New Jersey out of the program in 2011 and has since vetoed two bills designed to have the state rejoin.\Eustace also said he wants to prod the Christie administration to help the state develop an offshore wind industry. Although the federal government has auctioned nearly 350,000 acres of ocean floor off the New Jersey coast to wind farm developers, the Christie administration has yet to finalize an essential regulation that would determine how offshore wind farm developers get paid for the energy they produce. Without it, the developers will have a hard time persuading investors to lend money for the projects.\""We've been playing defense in the Legislature the past seven years of the Christie administration as he has tried to undo much of what had been done in the past to protect our environment,"" said Assemblyman John McKeon, D-Madison, who is vice chairman of the environment committee and a prior chairman. ""I'm sure Tim will do a great job in his leadership position ... so we can set the table for what we can accomplish when we have a new administration in a year.""\Eustace said his environmental awareness was sparked at an early age. He grew up in Ringwood, Kinnelon and Wanaque.\""My brothers and I were always playing in the woods,"" he said. ""And it has made me want to try and protect New Jersey's natural beauty.""\Credit: Email: oneillj@northjersey.com"
17,"For eight years, New Jersey sat on the environmental sidelines, unable to show any leadership in promoting clean energy and combating climate change because its governor didn't want to.\That's changing rapidly under a new governor, however, with Phil Murphy already moving to reverse some of the environmental mistakes of his predecessor. New Jerseyans should be thankful, because Murphy's efforts may one day help save a lot of homes and businesses, and a lot of lives.\Former Gov. Chris Christie wasn't a climate change denier. But he also didn't believe New Jersey should bother doing much of anything about it. Conservatives like Christie just don't think it's worth the cost to fight Mother Nature, regardless of how much human activity may be pushing global warming along. Countless scientists dispute that argument, of course, and there are many interpretations of the actual short- and long-term ""costs"" of tougher environmental standards. But the sentiment to throw up our hands in resignation and assume we'll enjoy lower energy prices in the process remains strong.\New Jersey, however, is headed back in the right direction. Murphy's actions to date include:\An executive order to restore the state to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a multistate effort to reduce carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade program. Christie said years ago that RGGI was ineffective, but the program has endured, helping fund carbon-reducing programs with revenue generated by auctioning off carbon ""allowances"" to power companies. Murphy said Christie's decision has cost New Jersey nearly $300 million, and he wants future funds to be primarily devoted to so-called ""environmental justice"" communities — lower-income urban areas suffering from pollution.\Supporting a ban on hydraulic fracturing — fracking — within the Delaware River Basin. Governors from neighboring states are on board as well, with the hope of protecting a water supply serving more than 15 million people among four states. Fracking — injecting a powerful mixture of water and chemicals into the ground — has helped to unlock vast new natural gas supplies, but the process comes with significant environmental risk. New Jersey jumping into the fray can only help prospects for a ban.\Removing the state from a lawsuit challenging President Obama's Clean Power Plan. This one isn't likely to have much impact; many other states continue to fight the plan's goals of reducing carbon pollution by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, which critics — including Christie — have maintained will drive up costs and unduly control energy markets. But it's a stand on principle.\This is just a start for Murphy. Christie was at best neglectful and often aggressively opposed to environmental causes, and the administration in Washington will do nothing for the environment under Trump.

20,"The lame-duck Legislature's flurry of 11th-hour bills yielded more than 150 signatures and vetoes from Gov. Chris Christie Tuesday, and the overall results were largely predictable. Gun-rights advocates were pleased; Christie blocked anything with the scent of gun control. Elementary school kids probably won't be happy; Christie didn't approve a bill mandating 20 minutes a day for recess.\Many of the rejections were ""pocket vetoes,"" meaning Christie took no action at all and didn't bother explaining himself. It's a cowardly approach, but lawmakers share some of the blame; trying to jam through that many bills during the lame-duck period guarantees minimal consideration of the proposals. Even a governor spending all of his time here can't be expected to provide meaningful analysis of so many proposals in such a short time. And there's no opportunity to respond to conditional vetoes or consider overrides with the expiration of the Legislature that approved the measures. Lawmakers will have to start all over in the new session.\The governor did sign off on more bills from the Democratic legislature than he rejected -- 93 new laws, compared to 65 rejections. Young snow shovelers, for instance, will be comforted knowing they don't have to register with their towns to be paid for helping neighbors.\But among the overriding negative themes was Christie's dismissal of nearly every bill with a pro-environmental angle.\Among the most consistent elements of Christie's gubernatorial reign has been his environmental insensitivity and focus on supporting Big Fossil Fuels. In 2011, Christie pulled New Jersey from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade coalition of northeast and mid-Atlantic states designed to reduce carbon emissions, but denounced by Christie as nothing more than a new tax.\Since then, his sellout to ExxonMobil on a massive pollution settlement affecting the entire state, and his scheming support of pipeline projects, including the Pinelands debacle, have been notable lowlights.\So it's easy to imagine Christie barely giving any thought at all to some of the latest environmental bills before scuttling them. He blocked a plan to devote $10 million to lead abatement. He scrapped a proposal to help facilitate offshore wind farms, continuing ongoing efforts to stymie that promising industry. A plan to expand electronic waste recycling died on Christie's desk -- and that one even had support from the Department of Environmental Protection. Christie couldn't even bring himself to ban possession and transport in New Jersey of animal trophies of endangered species.\The only modest bright note on a bleak day was the governor's decision to re-establish the ability of the DEP to regulate beach and waterfront access in the state. A recent court ruling tossed out existing DEP rules, creating an authority vacuum that left environmental groups worried the absence of state control could unduly limit public access.\But we were reminded once again that any meaningful environmental progress in New Jersey will have to await another governor."
21,"Gov. Christie is no friend of the environment. The national conservatives Christie is courting for his presidential run are also apathetic to environmental concerns, which helps to explain why the governor pulled New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2011.\Exactly what that move has wrought isn't entirely clear. Activists say the state has lost more than a hundred million dollars in revenue that RGGI would have created through cap-and-trade auctions, a number that will continue to grow. They also argue that the state hasn't curbed its carbon emissions as much as it might have otherwise, although all across the Northeast those emissions have declined, thanks primarily to recessionary pressures and the growing abundance of more carbon-friendly natural gas. Of greater concern, environmentalists project significant increases in emissions within New Jersey in the decades ahead if the state stays out of the regional agreement.\Christie's original argument was that RGGI was too weak to be effective and that it amounted to a carbon tax on polluters that would be passed down to public ratepayers. He did add, however, that he conceded the likelihood of global warming and mankind's contribution to it -- perhaps to separate himself from the more unhinged element of the far right. Christie also did something very Christie-like in the process -- he tried to do what he wanted without necessarily following some rules that might get in the way. Now the Legislature may be on the verge of successfully calling him on it.\On Monday, the Senate Environment Committee approved a resolution that would effectively prevent Christie from changing regulations to finalize New Jersey's departure from RGGI. Earlier this year, an appeals court found that the governor erred in simply telling power-plant operators they were no longer bound the by RGGI rules, even though no formal repeal process had been completed. Lawmakers are now trying to stop that repeal by claiming it's inconsistent with legislative intent. If the legislative measure succeeds, however, the path ahead is still unclear. It won't return New Jersey to the regional initiative, at least not immediately. Christie would have time to respond with changes to the rules, and the prospect of potential legal action looms beyond that if an impasse develops.\The absence of an obvious end game is partly due to the uncertain environmental effects. While there is a certain common-sense logic to the fact that restrictions on carbon emissions will reduce those emissions, RGGI's role is just one piece of broader clean-energy initiatives. It is telling that Jeff Tittel, the executive director of the New Jersey Sierra Club who is never bashful about criticizing the powers that be, this week placed far more emphasis on Christie's careless administrative maneuverings in trying to scuttle RGGI than the actual environmental impact of those actions.\But we do know a few things. Leaving RGGI does nothing to help the environment. It is costing New Jersey money, although Christie has tried to dismiss the numbers as relatively meaningless. And in the long run, such indifference to carbon emissions will be harmful to the state in some fashion.\The plus side of scrapping RGGI? There really isn't one, aside from giving some marginal boost to Christie's conservative credentials. Sorry, but we find the environment and the state's bottom line to be a bit more important."
22,"For eight years, New Jersey sat on the environmental sidelines, unable to show any leadership in promoting clean energy and combating climate change because its governor didn't want to.\That's changing rapidly under a new governor, however, with Phil Murphy already moving to reverse some of the environmental mistakes of his predecessor. New Jerseyans should be thankful, because Murphy's efforts may one day help save a lot of homes and businesses, and a lot of lives.\Former Gov. Chris Christie wasn't a climate change denier. But he also didn't believe New Jersey should bother doing much of anything about it. Conservatives like Christie just don't think it's worth the cost to fight Mother Nature, regardless of how much human activity may be pushing global warming along. New Jersey, however, is headed back in the right direction. Murphy's actions to date include:\On Tuesday, he appointed NY/NJ Baykeeper Debbie Mans as the second in command at the state Department of Environmental Protection. Her appointment as deputy commissioner is one of the top spots ever held in recent years by an environmental advocate\Last week, he signed an executive order to restore the state to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a multistate effort to reduce carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade program. Christie said years ago that RGGI was ineffective, but the program has endured, helping fund carbon-reducing programs with revenue generated by auctioning off carbon ""allowances"" to power companies. Murphy said Christie's decision has cost New Jersey nearly $300 million, and he wants future funds to be primarily devoted to so-called ""environmental justice"" communities — lower-income urban areas suffering from pollution.\He supported a ban on hydraulic fracturing — fracking — within the Delaware River Basin. Governors from neighboring states are on board as well, with the hope of protecting a water supply serving more than 15 million people among four states. Fracking — injecting a powerful mixture of water and chemicals into the ground — has helped to unlock vast new natural gas supplies, but the process comes with significant environmental risk. New Jersey jumping into the fray can only help prospects for a ban.\He removed the state from a lawsuit challenging President Obama's Clean Power Plan. This one isn't likely to have much impact; many other states continue to fight the plan's goals of reducing carbon pollution by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, which critics — including Christie — have maintained will drive up costs and unduly control energy markets. But it's a stand on principle.\This is just a start for Murphy. Christie was at best neglectful and often aggressively opposed to environmental causes, and the administration in Washington will do nothing for the environment under Trump. Some of Murphy's desire to undo Christie's overall legacy may be misplaced, but on the environment there should be little doubt.

23,"As a former mayor of New York, I don't often weigh in on events in New Jersey. But as someone who's active in the fight against climate change, it's great to see New Jersey get back in the ring, thanks to Governor Phil Murphy.\A dozen years ago, New Jersey had been a founding member of one of the country's most important climate change partnerships: the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program that sets carbon emission limits for power plants. Former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, launched the group with support from numerous governors in the region, including several other Republicans.\Unfortunately, short-sightedness is all too common in politics, and former Gov. Chris Christie pulled the state out of the agreement in 2011, despite its considerable success. A recent report found that the climate initiative has saved consumers $618 million on their energy bills, spurred $2.9 billion in economic growth, created thousands of jobs, and – with fewer air pollutants to inhale – generated more than $5 billion in health benefits. Those results are a big reason why Governor Murphy announced this week that the state is rejoining the pact. Virginia has also begun the process of signing on. If both join, it will bring the number of states to 11, representing 20 percent of the U.S. economy. Or, to put it another way, these 11 states would form the world's fourth-largest economy – even larger than Germany's.\Gov. Murphy deserves credit for recognizing the pact's benefits for the state – and for understanding what many critics of environmental action do not: fighting climate change and growing the economy go hand in hand.\Here's why: People want to live in communities with clean air, and the most effective way to clean the air is to invest in projects that make people healthier, put more money in their pockets and attract private-sector investment.\Investing in mass transit is another way to fight climate change while also promoting economic growth and healthy communities. Strong, reliable train and bus networks make it easier for people to get to work, they attract private investment that creates jobs, and, of course, they help reduce carbon emissions.\The United States lags behind other nations in creating modern mass transit networks, particularly our railways. Governor Christie's decision to pull the plug on a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River in 2010 was a blow not only to NJ Transit riders, but also to drivers, who face more congested roads – and to the whole region's economic health. Traffic congestion and train delays cost our region billions of dollars each year. It's great to see that Governor Murphy is making the tunnel a top priority.\When President Trump announced his intention to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, many proponents of climate change action despaired. They believed – wrongly – that America would not be able to uphold our end of the agreement. The truth is that our ability to meet the Paris Agreement has never depended on Washington. It depends on actions by cities, states, communities and businesses. Thanks to these groups, over the past decade, the U.S. has reduced its carbon emissions more than any other developed nation – with almost no help from the federal government.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a prime example of the kind of work that has driven our national progress – and New Jersey now has an opportunity to expand it. By working with other states, Trenton could help lead the way in expanding the initiative to include transportation emissions. The revenue from the sale of emission credits from heavily polluting vehicles could help improve mass transit and fund other transportation improvements.\Last June, after the Trump administration's announcement, I helped organize a national coalition of leaders committed to fulfilling the Paris Agreement. Called ""America's Pledge,"" more than 2,300 businesses, cities, and states have signed-on – and Governor Murphy has pledged that New Jersey will be next.\Michael Bloomberg is the founder of Bloomberg LP and served as mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013.\Your Turn\Michael Bloomberg\Guest columnist\CAPTION: \Gov.

25,"Inch by inch, over the next several decades, the Atlantic Ocean is going to claim more of the barrier islands and low-lying coastal areas.\Monsoon-like rainstorms will become more commonplace, as will heat waves in the summer. The Pinelands will be under attack by tree-killing bugs from the South, and commercial fishermen will have to adapt to hunting new species of fish.\This is how climate change will manifest in New Jersey, a predicted reality that Gov. Phil Murphy, unlike his predecessor, acknowledges and has pledged to both resist and prepare for.\""Unless we do more (to counter climate change), the question isn't whether we'll see another superstorm like Sandy, but simply a question of when,"" Murphy said during a speech in Highlands two weeks after his inauguration. ""As the densest state in the nation, we can ill-afford to keep our heads in the sand when it comes to climate change.""\One year into his term, environmentalists and proponents of climate action say Murphy has acted with an urgency that matches his public statements. However, there are some areas where they see stunted progress, such as using technology to reduce energy demand and addressing the carbon emissions from the cars and trucks that clog New Jersey's busy highway system.\""I think there was a lot of ambition and a lot of commitment, and it's a challenge to do everything, but that this administration has met a lot of those challenges,"" said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters. ""They've been walking and chewing gum.""\That's the consensus sentiment from the green lobby, which has enjoyed a level of access and influence that it was never afforded during the eight years under former Gov. Chris Christie.\But not every advocate feels that way. Notably, the New Jersey Chapter of the Sierra Club recently announced a grade of ""D"" for Murphy's environmental progress.\On the specific issue of climate change, NJ Sierra Club director Jeff Tittel told USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey that the governor has fallen flat.\""What we've seen is a record that is mixed at best,"" he said. ""Disappointing is the word I would use.""\Murphy has made bold promises to reform how we generate electricity in New Jersey in order to slow the accumulation of greenhouse gases, but has been silent on what to do about the creeping sea level and coastal development, Tittel said.\""I am very worried that this administration is more concerned with making speeches on climate change than doing anything about it,"" he said.\The Governor's Office pushes back on that characterization, saying that Murphy in his first year fulfilled an impressive set of climate promises, including:\Prepared to rejoin in 2020 the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a successful cap-and-trade program with nine other Northeastern states, and set a target to reduce carbon emissions in New Jersey by 36 percent in 10 years.\Established an aggressive clean energy mandate that requires all the electricity sold in the state to be sourced from renewable fuels by 2050 and 50 percent by 2030.\Created an offshore wind subsidy that hopes to attract at least 3,500 megawatts of capacity — enough power for 1.5 million homes — by 2030.\""All of those things in one year is massive,"" said Mary Barber, who runs the New Jersey Clean Energy program for the Environmental Defense Fund.\Murphy devoted little time to the topic during his State of the State speech in Trenton on Tuesday. Although he took a few moments to talk about offshore wind, Murphy spent more time stumping on NJ Transit fixes and corporate tax breaks.\""Today, New Jersey is leading the nation in fighting climate change, from promoting clean energy alternatives to rejoining RGGI,"" he said, in his only direct reference to the climate change predicament.\But climate activists say that Murphy's messaging on the issue has been effective in marshaling public opinion.\""The attitude is the right one,"" said Dale Bryk, an energy and climate change expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""We are going to demonstrate why this change is the absolute best package for New Jersey — for the environment, for jobs, for the economy.""\The Governor's Office told the Network that 2019 would be an active year for the administration on the climate front, including the creation of a master plan for coastal protection from rising seas and enabling a new subsidy for solar power.\Still, some of those same people wonder if he couldn't move faster on certain initiatives, such as energy efficiency.\Many view energy efficiency as the linchpin of any serious effort to switch to carbon-free electricity. These new sources of generation — wind and solar — require an initial investment that is ultimately paid for by the consumer through inflated electricity costs.\Finding ways to reduce the amount of electricity used can help defray some of that extra upfront spending that clean energy requires of residents and business owners.\""The Governor's Office still voices its commitment, but it's January and we have not seen movement on energy efficiency,"" Bryk said.\New rules on energy efficiency are coming this year, according to the Governor's Office.\There is concern within the environmental movement that Murphy already may have hobbled the typical ratepayer's ability to afford clean energy by agreeing to bailout the nuclear power industry in May.\The average household will pay $30 to $40 more per year to prop up Public Service Enterprise Group's nuclear plants in the state after the company claimed it wasn't able to compete on a level-playing field with natural gas-fired power.\With a subsidy framework in place for offshore wind power and something similar being developed for solar this year, will New Jersey soak ratepayers with higher electricity costs and turn them off from supporting clean energy?\""There may be a point where the Legislature and the governor or whoever gets scared of rate shock,"" Tittel said. ""(The nuclear subsidy) is money that could have gone to renewable energy.""\The Murphy team notes that if the nuclear plants would have shut down that would have opened up a larger market for natural gas here in the short term.\""Nuclear power is the largest source of zero carbon energy for the state and an important piece of our transition to 100 percent clean energy,"" reads a statement from Murphy's spokeswoman.\It's not just the nuclear plants that are causing drama, but also the discussion of new fossil fuel infrastructure in New Jersey, including pending proposals for five new power plants and eight natural gas transmission pipelines.\""The state should use its full authority and deny permits for projects that don't meet New Jersey's strict environmental standards, because there is greater urgency with each passing day of climate inaction on the part of the Trump administration,"" said Tom Gilbert, campaign director of ReThink Energy NJ and New Jersey Conservation Foundation, in a statement.\Projects like those would run counter to the clean energy goals in a very direct way, but they would also — like the nuclear plants — siphon away investment from wind turbines and solar fields.\The Murphy administration has been publicly silent on ventures including the North Bergen Liberty power plant and the Southern Reliability Link pipeline, but it acknowledged to the network that it is considering blocking these projects.\""The Governor's Office, (the state Department of Environmental Protection), and Attorney General's office are reviewing the state's authority to institute a moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure,"" reads a statement from Murphy's office. ""We take the request very seriously and want to ensure any decisions are informed by the law and the best available science.""\But even the governor's supporters have grumbled that his climate approach has been too focused on electric generation and does not do enough to address where the bulk of carbon emissions originate: the 39,000 miles of roadways that criss-cross New Jersey.\""A lot of the focus has been on the electricity sector, but the biggest contributor in NJ continues to be fossil fuel use in the transportation sector — roughly 45 percent of the state's emissions,"" Marjorie Kaplan, head of the Rutgers Climate Institute, told the Network.\Under Murphy, the state has committed to reaching 330,000 zero-emission vehicle registrations by 2025 through the Multi-State ZEV Task Force. Some $10 million from the Volkswagen settlement will go toward building charging stations around the state.\The state also pledged last month to join the Transportation and Climate Initiative, another regional effort similar to the ZEV task force and RGGI, that has broad goals of slowing carbon emissions on our roadways by reducing traffic congestion, improving public transit and encouraging electric car usage.\Russ Zimmer: 732-557-5748, razimmer@app.com, @russzimmer\Gov.

26,"THE OIL spill in the Gulf of Mexico is one of those truly dire situations. Sadly, there are no winners here - it is a tragedy for those who lost loved ones, destructive to the people of the region, devastating to the environment and certainly negative for BP as a company.\President Obama missed his moment and is now faced with a significant political problem. He did not take control of the situation early enough. In his prime time speech on June 15 (Day 56 of the spill), he emphasized that he was leading the charge to bring justice and, with it, a major cleanup for the region. But all of these efforts were too little, too late.\By not having called in the heads of BP, Transocean and Halliburton right from the beginning and putting them on notice that they were responsible and that he would be watching, as well as mobilizing the unified response team from the federal government, he lost the chance to display leadership.\But there is much more at stake with the president's handling of the oil spill than approval ratings. Our nation desperately needs a discussion about a consistent, reliable and safe national energy policy.\With electricity demands slated to rise 23 percent by 2030, we need to get serious about exploring clean energy solutions. The BP spill is, after all, a problem partially caused by our nation's dependence on oil and the reality that acquiring this scarce resource carries inherent risk.\By ceding leadership on the spill at the beginning, Obama lost the credibility to address the broader problem. Now it appears as if he is using the spill as a backdoor approach to pass ""cap and trade"" -- seemingly in line with the desire of Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, to ""never allow a crisis to go to waste.""\Our national energy policy can and should be about more than just cap and trade. That is why Sens. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., Lisa Murkowski, R-Ark., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have put forth the Practical Energy and Climate Plan, which takes a broader, more comprehensive view of our energy needs.\This bill seeks to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions without placing additional burdens on our struggling economy.\Specifically, the bill includes greater energy efficiency incentives for new construction, industries and appliances, a national building retrofit program and low-interest loans for rural areas to better leverage energy-efficient technologies. The bill will aim to reduce dependence on foreign oil by incentivizing greater fuel efficiency for automobiles, as well as the production of more flex-fuel vehicles.\Of course, the bill promotes a more diverse energy sector -- from greater state-level investment in domestic electric generation to expanded use of nuclear power.\If nothing else, Lugar's bill shows us that there is more to energy policy than simply cap and trade, which has its share of political pitfalls. Cap and trade can certainly be painted by its opponents as a large tax, so it was unlikely to pass this year, just a few months before a congressional election.\To halt the national energy conversation because of the oil spill or the controversial element of cap and trade is a disservice to our country. I hope members of Congress from both sides of the aisle can look past the political third rails in the news today and move forward with a comprehensive energy policy.\Christie Whitman is a former governor of New Jersey and a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator.\Credit: Christie Whitman is a former governor of New Jersey and a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator."
27," WASHINGTON By 2030, Illinois will feel like Arkansas now, with longer and hotter summers but with more storms and unpredictable weather, climate researchers predict. By the end of the century, parts of the Midwest could be as steamy as Texas today.\ ""One thing we clearly know is that it will be a whole lot warmer, and the rainstorms probably not as gentle as when I was growing up on a farm in Carlyle, Illinois,"" said Donald Wuebbels, a climate researcher and director of the School of Earth, Society and the Environment at the University of Illinois.\ Wuebbles and other scientists will tune in this week for the release of a new international report that is expected to make the strongest link yet between the burning of fossil fuels and global warming.\ The report will follow key developments in Washington that appear to build momentum for a national plan to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases. But despite a new push by congressional leaders and agreement on the issue by President Bush, big battles are brewing, with powerful politicians likely to resist dramatic changes that would pain their constituents.\ The new report comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the main international body studying the issue. It represents the latest thinking from more than 2,000 of the world's leading scientists in what is billed as the largest scientific analysis of peer-reviewed literature ever. The report will analyze how the climate has changed over centuries and predict how it will change in the future.\ Sources familiar with the report said last week that it will conclude there's roughly a 90 percent certainty that most of the planet's warming since the mid-20th century can be traced to human activities.\ The report also will affirm previous reports that glaciers are melting even more quickly than had been believed, while fine-tuning predictions about how much oceans will rise in coming years, according to U.S. experts and leaked information. It will be released in Paris on Friday.\ Experts say the findings will reinforce the widely held belief that the planet is rapidly warming, something three in four Americans already think, polls show.\ ""Mild winters or the lack of winter, melting glaciers these are the things that get people's attention and are driving the political system,"" said Vicky Arroyo, director of policy analysis at the non- partisan Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.\ The new report will be embraced by some in Congress as further evidence of the need for mandatory limits on emissions from factories and cars, a highly contentious goal that will draw opposition from members with coal, oil and automotive interests in their districts.\ Protecting constituents\ An example is Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., a member of the House Energy Committee. Shimkus said he would be looking for allies in both parties to help prevent undue damage to the Illinois coal industry.\ ""There were communities in southern Illinois devastated by the Clean Air Act,"" he said. An aide to Shimkus later cited Pinckneyville as one of the Illinois towns that suffered because of a downturn in the coal industry that followed Clean Air Act amendments aimed at reducing the use of high-sulfur coal.\ ""The public as a whole thinks we ought to start addressing this issue, and you don't want to be the guy who blocks it,"" Shimkus said. ""But we need to ensure that as we move to address the global warming debate that we don't react so strongly that we shut down industries.""\ Consensus building\ The movement toward a full-fledged congressional debate, dormant as recently as late last year, picked up steam last week when an alliance of U.S. corporate leaders gathered in Washington to declare their support for new air-pollution limits and a ""cap-and-trade"" system giving industries flexibility to comply. Under cap-and- trade, companies have the right to buy and sell pollution rights within an overall limit decreasing over time.\ The CEOs represented 10 companies that produce a host of products from heavy equipment to chemicals to electricity. They concluded that the scientific evidence about climate change and its causes is sound and that their industries need to make investments now to prepare for what was described as a ""carbon-constrained"" future.\ The executives said they expected their alliance to grow, and they were right: They won an early and significant endorsement from Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer.\ President Bush, who had questioned the link between rising planet temperatures and the burning of fossil fuels, referred to ""the serious challenge of global climate change"" in his State of the Union address last week.\ Bush's main focus was energy security and reducing dependence on foreign oil. He proposed using more ethanol and promoting fuel efficiency to reduce gasoline consumption by 20 percent in 10 years, a goal that also addresses climate change.\ Even though the president did not embrace carbon emission limits or broader solutions, climate-change experts viewed his statement as another breakthrough.\ ""It is clear that the country is moving rapidly to some sort of national greeenhouse gas emissions regimen, a dramatic shift accelerated by both the science and the elections,"" said Philip Sharp, president of Resources for the Future, a think tank in Washington that explores environmental and social topics.\ Turf battles arising\ This year, signs of discord and turf battles are appearing.\ Some House Energy Committee members, for example, don't like Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement earlier this month that a new Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming would play a role in legislation.\ ""There's a lot of dissension,"" Shimkus said, referring to committee members' concerns about the special panel. Pelosi, D- Calif., has said that it will not encroach on the jurisdiction of the Energy Committee.\ Phil Clapp, a former congressional staff member and president of the National Environmental Trust, a Washington-based advocacy group, said the chances of reaching agreement are enhanced by the strong environmental credentials of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\ Clapp said he is convinced that many Republicans, like the Democrats who now run Congress, are eager for an agreement.\ ""Where we are is that public and congressional leadership have reached a consensus and major business leaders have gone public saying that we want action now. We have reached the tipping point,"" he said."

29,"TRENTON Gov. Chris Christie, calling the nation's first market-based effort to control greenhouse gases ""a failure,"" announced his intention to pull out of the agreement Thursday, prompting opponents to say the governor is more interested in burnishing his national image than protecting the environment.\Christie during a Statehouse news conference Thursday said he will issue an executive order to allow for New Jersey's exit from the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by the end of the year.\There have also been strong pushes within Delaware and New Hampshire to get out. The program had been praised by Christie during his 2009 gubernatorial campaign.\The Republican governor hinted for months that the change was coming, prompting critics to label him a climate change skeptic, but Christie said he is committed to a strong environmental policy.\Christie also said he will roll out a new energy master plan soon that will include ""safe operation of nuclear plants"" as a key component.\RGGI -- a cap-and-trade program that places limits on overall greenhouse gas emissions and establishes a market of carbon credits that companies can purchase -- is being shelved because the credits ""were never expensive enough to change behavior as they were intended to and ultimately fuel different choices,"" Christie said.\""Given that we now have laws that provide significant market incentives for wind, solar, and instate natural gas generation, any benefits that the RGGI tax may have had are miniscule,"" he said. ""RGGI does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens, tax our businesses, with no discernable or measurable impact upon our environment.""\""The future for New Jersey is in green energy,"" Christie said. ""In the past I've always said climate change is real and it's impacting our state. There's undeniable data that CO2 levels and greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere are increasing. I've taken some time to better understand the role that humans play in global warming and what impact human activity has on our climate.""\The governor's decision drew immediate condemnation from environmental groups.\""I'm glad to hear the governor went to climate change school but he didn't learn his lessons,"" said David Pringle of the New Jersey Environmental Federation.\Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said Christie is trying to build his credibility with conservatives, most of whom have panned programs such as RGGI as ""cap-and-tax"" schemes.\""Christie is taking the side of corporate polluters and the coal industry over the environment and health of the people of New Jersey,"" Tittel said. ""As part of his attempt to become a national politician he would rather pander to the National Republican Party then do what is right for the people of New Jersey.""\A Democratic assemblyman agreed.\""Quite simply, this decision reeks of a governor desperate to boost his radical conservative credentials to distract from his failing policies,"" said Assemblyman John McKeon, D-Essex.\A Morris County Republican, Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll, called it a smart move.\""The tax and spend program run by a secretive private entity has nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with driving up energy prices,"" Carroll said. ""Instead, we should unshackle the nuclear industry, explore more domestic sources of energy, look to more hydropower, and, perhaps provide tax credits for energy efficient projects and vehicles.""\Christie said he wants to examine whether new nuclear plants ""make sense."" New Jersey is home to four nuclear generators, Oyster Creek in Lacey Township and Salem 1 and 2 and Hope Creek in Lower Alloways Creek where the Delaware River meets the bay.\""I still think nuclear has to play a role here,"" Christie said. ""I think the safe operation of nuclear plants has to play a role in our energy needs.""\RGGI initially won wide praise as a groundbreaking environmental project, but some called it a colossal hindrance to business development.\""RGGI's cap-and-trade provisions increase costs to New Jersey businesses and consumers who are already paying some of the highest electricity rates in the nation,"" said New Jersey Business and Industry Association President Philip Kirschner. ""New Jersey's participation in RGGI, however, has virtually no positive impact on the environment.""\Dale Bryk, director of the Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, questioned whether New Jersey will ultimately leave the program. She said a new poll of state residents show ""overwhelming"" support for RGGI.\""This is far from a foregone conclusion. The governor must complete a rigorous regulatory process before the deal is signed that requires him to listen to the concerns of his constituents and there's no guarantee.\Gov. Christie should do right by the Garden State and heed their call to stick with the program,"" Bryk said.\""The future for New Jersey is in green energy."" GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE"
30,"It's about 1,300 miles from Belmar to Biloxi, but the issue of off-shore drilling in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster has spilled into the political campaigns in New Jersey's coastal congressional districts.\In pivotal races, Democratic incumbents hope to use the spill against Republicans whose party preached ""Drill, Baby, Drill."" The GOP challengers say drilling should be up to the states.\Even with the BP spill temporarily staunched and an operation to plug it for good moving according to plan, its implications could resonate into November.\A recent Monmouth University/Gannett poll found 63 percent of residents oppose drilling off the coast of New Jersey.\It was backed by 56 percent two years ago, when gas was $4 a gallon.\""Your environmental positions are something that's going to be considered,"" said poll director Patrick Murray, noting that New Jersey is tops in Superfund sites.\Issue for Pallone\In the 6th District, which runs along the Monmouth County bay shore before turning inland, 22-year incumbent Democrat Frank Pallone favors reinstating a moratorium on drilling along the entire East Coast, while his Republican opponent, Tea Party favorite Anna Little, thinks states should decide.\""Airplanes crash. We don't stop flying,"" Little said. ""Whatever we do with regard to drilling has to be done with a mind towards protection of the environment.""\Five days before an explosion on the oil platform Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and touched off the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Pallone and other Democratic members of the House from New Jersey wrote Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to oppose the Obama administration's proposed expansion of oil and gas development and exploration between Delaware and Florida.\""A spill off the coast of Virginia would close all the beaches in New Jersey,"" Pallone said.\Exploration sites\The administration proposal, now under review, would open up areas for drilling just south of New Jersey, and one possible exploration site is less than 20 miles from Cape May.\In South Jersey's 3rd District, freshman Democratic Rep. John Adler attacked Republican Jon Runyan on the issue moments after he won the GOP primary, saying Runyan favored drilling off New Jersey's coast.\Adler, however, did not sign Pallone's letter, as his spokesman, Ryan Carbain, said he thought that would hurt the chance of convincing senators to pass a ""cap-and-trade bill."""
31," New Jersey was one of the first states to join a multi-state effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, but it may be one of the last to put a program in place, advocates say.\ Two more states Maine and Massachusetts in the 10-state regional pact recently unveiled rules spelling out how their programs will work. But New Jersey is months away from even drafting its regulations.\ Instead, New Jersey lawmakers are poised to do more haggling in the fall over the so-called cap-and-trade program, which would force power companies to install new emission controls or buy ""credits"" from other plants that do more than their share of smokestack reductions.\ Environmentalists fear that decisions other states in the region have already made such as how much companies should be able to sell their credits for and how to make sure the program doesn't cause a spike in out-of-state power purchases could turn into a political battle.\ ""New Jersey is behind all the other states, but at the same time New Jersey has made a commitment to these other states,"" said Matt Elliott, an advocate for Environment New Jersey. ""I'm a little bit worried.""\ Assemblyman John McKeon, D-South Orange, however, said he is confident that a bill resolving the outstanding issues concerning the state's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative will pass soon after the Legislature returns for a lame-duck session in November. Rule-making could begin soon afterward, he said.\ McKeon, chairman of his chamber's environment committee, said he has been working with the Corzine administration on drafting the legislation and getting feedback from environmental groups and power company representatives.\ The sticking point still to be resolved is whether the state should allow companies that make smokestack upgrades to sell credits to other companies at prices that reflect 100 percent of the cost of the repairs made, or instead sell them at a reduced amount so as not to drive up utility bills.\ New Jersey signed on to the regional pact in December 2005, agreeing to a joint goal of a 10 percent reduction of the global warming-causing gases emitted from power plants by 2019. Rule- making was supposed to begin the next year.\ Lawyers for the state decided this spring that more legislation would have to be approved to give the Department of Environmental Protection authority to administer the program.\ New Jersey in July just signed on to another global warming goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all sources to 1990 levels by 2020 and by 80 percent in 2050.\ *\ E-mail: diskin@northjersey.com"
32,"Not as green as we think\Regarding ""Test-driving the future"" (Editorials, June 18):\Who are we trying to kid? Electric cars are probably no more ""green"" than our gasoline-powered ones. Indeed, they may actually be less green.\In New Jersey, we suffer from the NIMBY syndrome, and we don't want to look at towering wind turbines or acres of solar cells. Thus the need for more electricity will likely only be met by building more coal-powered plants in the Midwest, which will spew more pollutants and result in more acid rain.\However, since getting more high-capacity power transmission lines into New Jersey is opposed by our own Sen. Bob Menendez, as witnessed by his no vote against an energy bill because of his ""concern"" for private property, we may not even have that option.\The batteries in these electric cars contain heavy metals and other poisonous chemicals that, if not properly handled and disposed of, can become sources of toxic pollution. Will accidents result in toxic sites? In New Jersey, we already have enough Super Fund sites.\So are electric cars really green, or are we just kidding ourselves? There can be no electric cars without more power generation, and for the foreseeable future that will require more, not less, use of fossil fuels. Wind, solar, nuclear and other sources will not meet that demand if we continue our NIMBY attitude.\Bruno J.

She cites her coalition of 38 groups that includes tenants, labor, environment and others. Tenants don't pay property taxes. And who could ever forget the bang-up job labor did for General Motors and Chrysler? And environmentalists? Their push for cap-and-trade laws will sap the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers abroad while driving up costs for every family in America.\Instead of suggesting that it's fair for those of us who are working harder and longer each day to keep ahead of the ever increasing tax burden to ""chip in more,"" why not get those who produce little or nothing to take less, or for that matter work a little harder to earn more?\Mark R.

When I finally merged down to one lane, I saw a Hawthorne police officer texting on his phone while sitting in his patrol car.\Call me crazy, but shouldn't he have been directing traffic? I've grown accustomed to seeing officers sitting in their cars while ""directing"" traffic, but usually only on cold, rainy, hot, cloudy, breezy or overcast days. Yesterday, the weather was beautiful.\Traffic is a nightmare we all have to live with.

Is this the way for my fellow community members to act?\President Obama was elected on a platform that promised everyone the choice of private insurance or a public health plan like Medicare, with lower premiums and better benefits, a plan estimated to save us up to 30 percent through more efficiency and lower prices across the board.\But the insurance lobby is spending tons of money (one can only guess where it got the cash) to ""convince"" Congress to exclude the public health insurance option.\I thought insurance companies believed in competition; they say it always lowers costs; if so, why are they trying so hard to eliminate competition, through a public health option, from the national reform plan?\Martin Cohen\Ridgewood, June 8\***\Ill-considered tax hike on health care\Regarding ""Health care tax hike of 130% up for vote"" (Page A-4, June 17):\The arrogance of state Sen.

""Just by having the opportunity to move forward on this legislation, we will continue to put pressure on the federal government to act.""\ The bill faces more committee hearings and votes before the full Assembly and Senate. But after marathon talks Thursday involving some top legislators, its ultimate passage seemed assured.\ ""The deal got cut today,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the state Sierra Club.\ The bill would authorize the state to take part in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the pollution-cutting program announced by 10 Northeastern states in 2005. Under the so-called ""cap and trade"" system, power companies would have to buy emissions allowances for each ton of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse pollution they produce. Companies could buy and sell emissions credits from one another, creating a financial incentive to cut emissions.\ It's one of the key planks of Governor Corzine's campaign to sharply limit global warming emissions in the state, an effort that's won the governor praise from environmentalists and world leaders.\ But at the start of the day Thursday, the administration was facing a revolt.\ Environmentalists were incensed by a provision inserted into the bill that would effectively limit the amount power companies had to pay for the allowances to $70 million a year.\ But limiting the cost to companies would remove the economic incentive for them to clean up, critics said. They also said it would cripple energy efficiency and conservation efforts that were to be funded by the program. None of the other RGGI states had added such a twist, environmental groups noted.\ The groups threatened to pull their support and there were rumors the Corzine administration itself would testify against the bill. Jackson, the environment commissioner, spent more than five hours in closed-door talks with legislators.\ Finally, an hour after the hearing was to have started, they emerged with a bill that was stripped of the $70 million limit.\ ""I think some of the policymakers understood that New Jersey would be embarrassed in the region for putting forward the bastard version of RGGI,"" said Dena Mottola, executive director of Environment New Jersey, an advocacy group.\ Jackson said the administration wanted to make sure the final bill would ""let the market work.""\ ""There were some issues that quite frankly, if not addressed, were going to be walk-away issues,"" she said. ""But it didn't come to that.""\ The final bill also softened language that would have allowed power companies to get into the business of selling energy- efficient appliances and other conservation measures to customers. The bill would have let utilities increase electric rates to cover the cost of those projects as well as recoup profits lost if electricity demand goes down. Power providers said it was just another financial incentive to reduce energy use and thus cut pollution. Critics complained it was a giveaway to the utilities.\ ""We need to make this work, but not by giving money away to utilities,"" said Stefanie Brand, director of the state's Division of Rate Counsel, an agency that represents utility ratepayers.\ In the end, the bill said only that state regulators could let utilities into the efficiency business if they choose to.\ North Jersey's main power provider supports the cap and trade system, said Rick Thigpen, a vice-president for PSEG Services Corp. But the program will raise the cost of electricity, so it's also vital to help customers conserve, he said.\ The state ""needs to strike a balance between protecting our environment, protecting businesses and jobs and protecting people's pocketbooks,"" he said.\ The bill next goes to the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee on Monday. A hearing is also expected in the state Senate.\ Final votes in both chambers could come before the end of the year.\ ***\ What it all means\ What is cap and trade? A system designed to let the free market find global warming solutions. The state would cap greenhouse emissions from power plants and then sell or give away credits, one for each ton of emissions. Companies that find a way to cut pollution could sell credits to those that can't get below the cap.\ Who's involved? New Jersey is part of a 10-state compact of Northeastern states that have promised to cut power company emissions 10 percent. New York, Maryland, Delaware and the six New England states are also on board.\ What's at stake? The state says it will cost companies about $40 million a year to buy the credits. That will mean higher bills for customers. But officials say they'll devote revenues to solar and wind projects, energy conservation and other measures that could cut bills in the long run.\ Why utilities? They're one of the major generators of greenhouse pollution, though experts say bigger cuts will be needed from vehicles and other sources to solve the problem.\ ***\ E-mail: nussbaum@northjersey.com\ ***"
34,"Power companies have been turning off pollution control equipment at coal-fired plants and allowing massive amounts of contaminants to escape through the stacks -- a practice that is perfectly legal and saves the plants money but ends up contributing to chronic air and health issues in New Jersey.\Over the past decade, power companies in Eastern states spent hundreds of millions of dollars to install pollution control equipment to meet federal rules intended to improve air quality. But those companies have found it is cheaper to buy credits -- allowances to emit a specified amount of pollutant -- that let them pollute rather than operate the equipment.\As a result, some plants logged dramatic increases in nitrogen oxide emissions between 2009 and 2013 -- even though the facilities have equipment that could capture up to 90 percent of the pollutant. FirstEnergy's Harrison plant in West Virginia, for instance, emitted nearly 18,700 tons of nitrogen oxide in 2013, a nearly threefold increase from 2009. The Keystone plant in Pennsylvania, co-owned by Exelon and New Jersey-based PSEG Power, released nearly 16,650 tons of the pollutant in 2013, up about 350 percent from 2009.\The nitrogen oxide gets swept by prevailing winds and travels hundreds of miles east to New Jersey, where in warmer weather it reacts in the atmosphere with other pollutants to form ozone, a component of smog.\This summer, New Jersey is expected to see many high ozone days, which can be brutal for children, the elderly, and anyone with chronic respiratory disease, such as asthma. Some experts have equated the effect of breathing ozone to a sunburn on the lungs.\""It makes me very disappointed that some plants in Pennsylvania are turning off their equipment at probably the worst time for ozone -- during the summer,"" said Bob Martin, commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection. ""Some of these plant owners are New Jersey companies, and they're affecting New Jersey air quality.""\Though it is only the start of ozone season, New Jersey has already issued one high-ozone alert warning, on May 8. And with more likely on the way, the state's air quality will continue to fail federal health standards.\Studies have shown that when ozone levels rise, so do emergency room visits for respiratory problems. ""People will feel difficulty breathing -- they will experience wheezing and their chest may feel tight,"" said Dr. Marjorie Slankard, an allergy expert at Columbia University Medical Center and allergy director at The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood.\Ozone can stunt lung function growth in children and it can make a person's airways more responsive to allergens. ""So it makes people do worse with exposure to pollen than they normally would,"" she said.\In the 1990s, New Jersey and other Eastern states pushed the federal Environmental Protection Agency to force upwind states to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. The EPA responded with rules intended to cut emissions that crossed state borders, prompting many companies to install pollution control equipment that can capture nearly all the nitrogen oxide before it escapes the stacks.\Overall emissions east of the Mississippi have declined by 53 percent since 2005. But in New Jersey, there is still a chronic problem with ozone -- one that officials say will not go away if power plants in neighboring states continue to shut off pollution controls.\Many coal-burning power plants with the largest nitrogen oxide emissions nationwide are in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, upwind of New Jersey. Some of these plants individually emitted as much as 18,000 tons of nitrogen oxide in 2013. By contrast, New Jersey's 21 power facilities emitted a small fraction of that -- a combined total of 2,890 tons that year.\Pollution credits\New Jersey's DEP has estimated that on days when the prevailing wind blows from the west, Pennsylvania pollution sources can contribute up to 30 percent of the ozone recorded at air monitors in New Jersey -- and that's when power plants are operating their pollution control equipment. When plants turn off the equipment, the impact on New Jersey is far greater.\""A number of plants with advanced controls are not using them to full effect,"" said Tom Schuster with the Sierra Club's Pennsylvania chapter. ""They're not reducing emissions enough.""\Power plants can legally turn off pollution controls and still remain in compliance because federal regulations let them buy credits that allow them to pollute. The EPA rules employ a strategy called cap and trade, which lets companies that decrease pollution sell their unused credits to companies whose emissions are above a certain threshold.\Under the cap and trade provision, every year the EPA ratchets down the overall cap on emissions for each state covered by the rule. Companies need one credit, or allowance, for each ton of nitrogen oxide their facilities emit. If a company can cut emissions below its permitted amount, it ends up with extra allowances it can sell or bank for the future.\The problem is the market price of those credits has plummeted in recent years and it now costs far more per ton to operate pollution control equipment than to buy an allowance.\The price of a credit is currently about $130 per ton, while studies suggest it costs plants $3,000 to $7,000 per ton to operate a common type of pollution equipment, called selective catalytic reduction, or SCR.\At those prices, a large power plant could save tens of millions of dollars a year just by shutting off the pollution controls.\In the early 2000s, PPL, which operates several large facilities in Pennsylvania, spent about $215 million to equip its Montour plant with pollution controls. The company was using its SCR equipment in 2009 to reduce emissions as part of a strategy to accumulate allowances it could sell or use later. But when the price of allowances went down dramatically, PPL ""chose to rely more on the purchase of emission allowances as permitted by the federal trading program,"" said George Lewis, a spokesman with PPL.\As a result, emissions rose significantly at the Montour facility -- up more than 140 percent between 2009 and 2013, to 13,121 tons.\""Using installed controls or buying emission allowances both are valid strategies for compliance, and support the EPA's objectives of reducing overall nitrogen oxide emissions,"" Lewis said. ""Today, the cost of using installed controls far exceeds the cost of obtaining allowances in the trading market.""\One PPL facility near Harrisburg, Pa., is the only large plant in the state that has not installed SCR equipment. A loophole in state law allows the facility, known as Brunner Island, to continue without the technology, and the facility emitted more than 12,200 tons of nitrogen oxide in 2013.\Not making PPL install the equipment gives Brunner Island ""an unfair competitive advantage and could actually make it operate more,"" Schuster, of the Sierra Club's Pennsylvania chapter, recently told a state committee. He worries that the situation sends a signal to ""plant owners that it is better to stall than to invest in upgrades to protect public health.""\Lewis, the PPL spokesman, said the Brunner plant is in compliance with current regulations even though it doesn't have the equipment. PPL has concluded that ""there are more cost-effective means of complying"" with the state's standards ""than spending hundreds of millions of dollars to install SCR technology,"" he said.\Meanwhile in Ohio, another state whose emissions foul New Jersey's air, emissions have doubled or tripled at some large plants operated by Duke Energy.\Jennifer Jabon, a spokeswoman for the company, said ""any increase in a plant's nitrogen oxide emissions data would have been offset by another site to ensure compliance with our allowance.""\The steep decline in the cost of nitrogen oxide allowances began in 2008, caused by a number of factors. For one thing, as power plants installed and ran their equipment, emissions declined, freeing up more allowances for sale and glutting the market. More recently, new supplies of natural gas being extracted from the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania have caused the price of natural gas to drop, leading power companies to switch from coal to gas to fuel their plants. Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, releasing fewer emissions.\The EPA is aware of the situation and is working on a new version of the cross-state pollution rules. It could set more stringent emissions caps for nitrogen oxide, revise the cap and trade system, or possibly do away with cap and trade altogether, said Richard Ruvo, air programs bureau chief for the EPA region that includes New Jersey. The new rules could be proposed this fall.\Calls for lower caps\Some argue the EPA's yearly emissions caps for nitrogen oxide should be set lower to better control emissions.\Dave Foerter, executive director of the Ozone Transport Commission, a 12-state coalition that aims to cut ozone, said that aggressively lowering the emissions cap could lead to an increase in the price of allowances -- to the point that companies wouldn't find it so financially beneficial to turn off the equipment. Alternatively, officials could consider imposing a floor on the price of allowances. The cost of each allowance probably needs to be about $1,700 for the cap and trade system to work more effectively, he said.\Allowing a power plant's pollution control equipment to go unused is like buying a Prius and leaving it in the garage while driving an old, high-emission gas vehicle, Foerter said. ""It doesn't make a lot of sense,"" he said.\Kevin Stewart, a director of environmental health at the American Lung Association of the Mid-Atlantic, agreed. ""Weak emission standards result in utilities making this choice even more likely,"" he said.\Beyond the problem of causing low allowance prices, health and environmental advocates also argue that the EPA's current caps on nitrogen oxide emissions are too lax for another reason. They were based on 1997 ozone health standards, but medical research has since shown ozone to be even more hazardous to human health than previously thought. The EPA adopted more stringent ozone health guidelines in 2008 -- but the agency never revised the caps downward to accommodate that change. The new rule the EPA is working on would address that.\""New Jersey's air quality is still in crisis for ozone in the summer,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey. ""This is a real cautionary tale about using cap and trade for air quality pollutants. It can create hot spots of air pollution. Clearly, we need the EPA to reexamine this system so we don't have pollution control equipment sitting idle.""\Credit: Email: oneillj@northjersey.com"
35,"Power plants started paying Wednesday for the right to pollute in New Jersey as the state participated in its first auction designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\New Jersey officials had been scolded back in September when the state was not ready for the initial auction by a 10-state coalition called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This time, New Jersey joined the auction, held online.\In the market-based cap and trade program, companies have to pay for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit into the air. Companies from 10 states bid Wednesday for more than 31.5 million carbon dioxide emissions allowances.\""Today, New Jersey makes a strong statement by holding power plants accountable for their pollution,"" said Matt Elliott of Environment New Jersey.\Through the program, the 10 states aim to stabilize the amount of carbon emissions from their power plants at a capped level through 2014. The cap will then be reduced by 2.5 percent in each of the following four years for a total reduction of 10 percent by 2018.\Power plants in New Jersey currently produce about 20 million metric tons of carbon emissions a year, the state Department of Environmental Protection said.\Environmentalists have said the process is a good first step, but that the reduction goals are not nearly ambitious enough. ""What's most important about this is that it provides a model for a national cap and trade system,"" said Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club.\Under the plan, power plant operators must purchase allowances from their host states to cover each ton of carbon dioxide emissions they are likely to produce. The companies can then buy, sell or trade their permits. Companies that reduce their emissions and don't need all their allowances might sell them to a company whose emissions exceed their allowances.\""These state initiatives are very important to long-term efforts to deal with climate change,"" said Rena Steinzor, a law professor at the University of Maryland who writes extensively on environmental regulation. She said such regional initiatives need to be protected with national legislation, because ""a large industry coalition, beginning with domestic carmakers and utilities with coal-fired plants, is trying to exact extinction of state initiatives as part of any federal climate deal.""\The coalition's executive director, Jonathan Schrag, said details about yesterday's auction, including how much it raised, would be released Friday.\In the first auction on Sept. 25, all of the 12.5 million allowances were sold at a clearing price of $3.07 each. The demand for allowances was four times the supply.\The September auction raised $38.5 million. Today's auction was expected to generate about $100 million. States are supposed to use that money to improve energy efficiency and develop more renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar power.\PSEG Power participated in Wednesday's auction, as well as the one in September, said spokesman Mike Jennings.\The coalition intends to hold quarterly auctions through the end of 2011.\President-elect Barack Obama has called for a national cap and trade program, something New Jersey business officials would prefer.\""It's better to have a national program that provides a level playing,"" said Michael Egenton, vice president for environment issues at the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce. New Jersey power companies are at a competitive disadvantage because they must pay for pollution credits, while neighbor Pennsylvania is not participating, so its power companies don't have the extra cost, Egenton said.\""We're a big backer of cap and trade systems and we support a national program,"" PSEG's Jennings said ""A national program provides regulatory assurance - everyone is playing under the same rules. A problem like global warming needs a global solution.""\In addition to New Jersey, the other states in the coalition include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.\***\E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com"
36,"An attempt to prevent Governor Christie from taking New Jersey out of the nation's largest regional effort to reduce greenhouse gases is making its way through Trenton.\But the Christie administration says the Legislature doesn't have the authority to keep the state in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state pact that is designed to reduce fossil fuel use and promote renewable energy initiatives through a cap-and-trade program.\The package of bills was approved by the Senate environment committee this week while identical bills were greenlighted by a similar Assembly panel last week. Supporters say a bill passed by both houses in 2007 and signed into law by Gov. Jon Corzine called the Global Warming Response Act requires New Jersey to join RGGI.\Christie plans to remove New Jersey from the program by year's end.\""By disregarding the intent of the legislature, which required New Jersey to be a member of RGGI, Governor Christie is ignoring the will of the people,"" said Assemblyman John McKeon, D-South Orange, head of the Assembly environment committee and a primary sponsor of the bills.\Administration officials say the act allows the state to join RGGI but doesn't compel it to.\""There's nothing in the act that prohibits us from leaving,"" said Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. The decision rests solely with Christie, he said.\Regardless of the legal wrangling, Christie would likely veto any bill seeking reinstatement to RGGI.\Business groups and conservative activists like Americans for Prosperity have long called for New Jersey to get out of RGGI. They say cap-and-trade programs drive up energy rates because energy producers who are forced to buy credits for the carbon they emit pass that cost along to their customers.\Environmental advocates say the rate increase is very small. They have blasted Christie, saying his move was short-sighted.\New Jersey has earned $102 million through RGGI auctions. Although Christie took $65 million of RGGI money last year to help balance the budget, the state has awarded at least $30 million in grants for 12 large-scale renewable energy projects.\RGGI money has helped pay for solar panels at William Paterson University, which at the time of its announcement in 2010 was touted as the largest solar installation at a U.S. college.\A report released Thursday by Environment New Jersey said clean energy investments from RGGI will lead to nearly $90 million in energy savings and contribute $209 million in economic activity growth in New Jersey.\The Assembly and Senate have until next Thursday to vote on the bills before this year's legislative session closes.\Credit: E-mail: fallon@northjersey.com"
37," LAST WEEK'S Supreme Court decision concerning carbon dioxide emissions from cars was welcomed by all who regret that the United States has lagged far behind in addressing this serious environmental challenge.\ The decision gives the Environmental Protection Agency two choices. It could develop, implement and enforce rules to regulate carbon dioxide emissions as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. Or it can seek to demonstrate, using science (real science, not political science) why carbon emissions do not contribute to climate change or bad air quality.\ This ruling should herald the beginning of a carbon-constrained U.S. economy. For a moment last Tuesday I thought President Bush might agree. When he said that ""whatever we do must be in concert with what happens internationally,"" I thought the administration might adopt a position on carbon emissions that would bring us closer to the regulation efforts being made by the rest of the developed world.\ Then the president continued, ""Unless there is an accord with China, China will produce greenhouse gases that will offset anything we do in a brief period of time."" True, China will outpace our emissions level, but there was a time when the United States led the world in environmental protection. I hope we are not following China when it comes to environmental policymaking.\ Of course, the president is right that we must find a way to reduce our carbon emissions without cutting back on economic prosperity. However, environmental protection and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive. Over the past 10 years, for example, United Technologies, on whose board I serve, has reduced its absolute energy use by 19 percent while its revenue has grown more than 80 percent.\ Market-based solution\ For guidance on which to base a policy, we can look to the results from the last time the Clean Air Act was amended, in 1990. Those amendments required substantial reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), the primary component of acid rain. There was broad agreement that acid rain was seriously damaging our environment. There was less unanimity about the method to be used to achieve the reduction in emissions a market-based cap-and-trade system.\ Controversial among environmentalists and businesses, the trading program had government-set standards for safe concentrations of SO2, a clear timetable for achievement and strict penalties for non- attainment. In a break from previous approaches, the government said it didn't care how businesses reached the goals, only that they do it on time.\ In addition, if a company lowered its emissions below the required level, it could keep the difference for future development or sell the credits to others that hadn't met the standards. The government cared only that the air was cleaned to required levels. If the profit motive spurred private-sector actions, fine.\ Before I left the EPA, we checked how effective that program had been. The results were startling. Not only had there been nearly universal compliance across all emitters, the levels of SO2 in the atmosphere were lower than the regulation had required, and the feat had been achieved in about half the time called for at much lower cost than anticipated.\ This program was a success because there was a national standard set by the government, certainty on timelines and penalties, and flexibility in how the targets were achieved. While voluntary programs are good, they are not good enough, and we need national caps on greenhouse gases.\ In January, the leaders of 10 of America's largest energy, manufacturing and financial services companies including Duke Power, DuPont and Lehman Brothers held a news conference with leaders of several environmental groups. They called for government- required action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, using a market- based system similar to that employed in fighting acid rain. Their call has increasingly been echoed.\ Going back on pledge\ Back when he was governor of Texas, Bush enacted mandatory caps on carbon emissions in his state. During the 2000 presidential campaign, he promised to regulate carbon emissions nationwide. Shortly after taking office, though, he backed away from that pledge. There were good domestic reasons at the time, but those reasons are no longer valid.\ Neither the American people nor the rest of the world want this debate to be delayed until the 2008 elections. The temptation to postpone the issue will be great but must be resisted.\ Over the past several years, calls for mandatory caps on carbon emissions from environmentalists, scientists, business leaders, evangelical Christians have grown. Now the Supreme Court has joined in. Delay is no longer an option. The president and Congress must act.\ ***\ Christie Todd Whitman, former governor of New Jersey, was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from 2001 to 2003. This appeared in The Washington Post."
38,"Upon reading Peter F. Boyce's letter regarding Rep. Frank LoBiondo's support of the Cap and Trade bill (DJ, 6/29), I was appalled.\I do not side with LoBiondo, or any politician for that matter, on every issue. However, I do know a weak, biased argument when I see one, and on the issue of ""cap and trade"" and environmental standards I'll take the LoBiondo's side as opposed to the negligent side.\This petition -- www.petitionproject.org -- that Boyce supports is known as the Oregon Petition. It was started around 1999 in an effort to oppose the Kyoto Protocol and rears its ugly head every time cap and trade legislation is set forth. A May 1998 report in the Seattle Times said some of the ""eminent American scientists"" that signed the petition include ""Perry S. Mason"" (the fictional lawyer?), ""Michael J. Fox"" (the actor?), and ""Dr. Geri Haliwell"" (the Spice Girl?) among a list of other ""scientists"" that share the same name as notable celebrities. There are several duplicate names listed, corporate names, and several other dubious names that undercut the authenticity of this petition. In 2001, Scientific American reported after scanning the petition, supporters include only ""about 200 climate researchers -- a respectable number, though rather a small fraction of the climatological community.""\The fact is that many of the people who signed the petition may indeed be practitioners of a science, but the number of those specializing in climate research is too week to warrant an argument against the overwhelming number of scientists that agree global warming is a reality.\It is generally known that many scientists receive a great deal of payoffs from political suitors and campaigns to fabricate evidence that supports a politician's platform. Obviously, a meteorologist (to give an example) who is receiving rewards from a political party that believes global warming to be a fallacy will go ahead and sign a petition such as this.\Overall, I think that if you are to believe people like Peter F. Boyce who believe ""increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide may produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth,"" you are supporting the slow death of humanity and our planet.\I think that if our Founding Fathers, who were bound by logic and rationalization, envisioned a world in tatters by excessive consumption and mounting evidence of its effects on the world, they would agree there must be a limit and some sort of mediator. The cap and trade bill gives us the sort of legislation that is not a quick-fix solution to our present economic woes, but it is a step in the direction for a possible future for myself and future generations who will inhabit this planet long after detractors such as Peter F. Boyce are gone.\Derrick Miller\Vineland"
39,"In a Closter basement, Philip Gotthelf is trying to turn noxious gas into gold.\Eight months ago, Gotthelf, a 55-year-old commodities trader, launched a computerized trading system that he believes will help reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions -- and make a buck, too.\Global Emissions Exchange (GEX) allows carbon dioxide generators such as manufacturers and coal-burning power companies to offset the pollutants they pump into the atmosphere by purchasing carbon offsets or credits from homeowners who cut their emissions.\The exchange is one of several initiatives around New Jersey aimed at using market forces to cut carbon dioxide emissions by putting a price tag on pollution.\Today, New Jersey power plants will take part in an auction for carbon offsets, part of the state's ""cap and trade"" agreement with nine other states to curb their pollution. Elsewhere, companies such as Boonton-based First Environment Inc. buy carbon offsets privately.\On the GEX system, the credits signify the number of tons of carbon dioxide that someone else -- say, a homeowner or small business -- prevented from entering the atmosphere. Credit prices are determined by trading, and last week they were selling for $5 to $9 a ton.\Gotthelf believes polluters, faced with the cost of buying offsets, will reduce their emissions. And he thinks people will take steps to cut their carbon footprint -- the amount of greenhouse gas they generate -- if they can sell the amount saved.\""All of a sudden you are giving them an incentive to reduce their emissions,"" said Gotthelf, who co-founded GEX with Nathan Guedalia of Fort Lee. The company charges a use fee of half the value of an offset sold retail on the exchange, and lower fees for wholesale.\Slowly, the business is finding customers. Last week, the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau agreed that its members -- farmers, equipment companies and others -- would register their carbon savings on GEX, Gotthelf said. Some power companies such as Exelon are interested in buying on the exchange, he said.\First Environment, a consultant on environmental management issues, buys offsets direct from the source -- landfills that prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere. The move is part of the company's effort to be ""carbon neutral,"" or to match the carbon dioxide it generates with an equal amount of emissions reduction.\Each year, First Environmental calculates its carbon footprint by looking at the mileage traveled by its vehicle fleet, the number of employee air miles traveled and the gas used to heat the company's offices. The company then buys an equal amount of carbon offsets from landfills that capture and burn methane gas generated from rotting trash, which would otherwise generate carbon dioxide.\The company said it generates about 400 to 500 tons of carbon annually and spends between $2,000 and $5,000 in offsets.\""First Environment likes to lead by example,"" said President B. Todd Delaney. ""As a company, we are not able to reduce all emissions internally, so purchasing offsets demonstrates environmental leadership. Even though this is voluntary at this time, it won't be for much longer -- President-elect Obama has committed to get our nation on board.""\Critics of voluntary systems say they offer polluters no incentive to cut emissions and real carbon reductions will require a nationwide mandate.\Yet companies are participating, for a variety of environmental or public relations reasons.\One is that ""they think it's the right thing to do in terms of corporate social responsibility,"" said Emilie Mazzacurati, a senior analyst in the Washington, D.C., office of Point Carbon, a Norwegian information and consulting company.\Another reason, she said, is that companies believe a federal mandate is inevitable and that companies that offset emissions now will later get credit from the government.\That may be why participation in the world's first carbon exchange, Chicago Climate Exchange (CXX), which is also voluntary, has grown steadily since it began in 2003 with 13 members.\Exchange members buy and sell carbon credits in much the same way Wall Street trades stocks and bonds. The 300 corporate members now include Ford, IBM, Honeywell International Inc. and Bank of America. A similar exchange in Europe, created in 2005, now boasts 90 corporate members.\But those exchanges cater mainly to large businesses and organizations. Gotthelf believes his is the first to allow small businesses and individuals to trade gas reduction credits, such as those generated when someone uses energy efficient light bulbs or a fuel-efficient car.\""We are trying to create a grass-roots incentive to conserve energy,"" he said.\New Jersey's purchase of carbon credits is part of a more systemic approach to cutting emissions. The state aims to cut power plant emissions by 10 percent by 2018, a goal set in the agreement with nine other states called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or RGGI.\The agreement sets out mandatory emissions limits for power plants -- there are 43 in New Jersey -- and requires them to buy an ""allowance"" or credit for each ton of carbon dioxide released. The credits are sold in an auction, the proceeds of which go to the state for energy conservation and the promotion of clean energy sources.\The first auction, which took place on Sept. 25, raised $38 billion and set the price of a carbon offset at $3.07 a ton. New Jersey didn't participate.\After the auction, companies can buy and sell offsets over the counter as part of the program's multi-pronged approach to curbing emissions, said Chris Sherry, a research scientist with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.\""The cap establishes the limit on emissions,"" he said. ""The market prices of those allowances, and the ability to trade, place a price on carbon emissions. So companies then factor in that cost to emit, in both operating their facilities and how they evaluate new investments.""\***\How Global Emissions Exchange works\People looking to buy or sell carbon credits register with the site, www.the-gex.com. Small customers go through a retail section of the site, and larger ones go on the wholesale side. Prices are set by the market or through bidding.\Sellers\* Companies or individuals that reduce their CO2 emissions say they use a hybrid car or install compact fluorescent light bulbs register their CO2 savings.\* The seller inputs the sales receipt number and address and certifies to the truth of their CO2 reduction.\* The registrant accumulates ""carbon credit points"" with each registration, much like airline miles.\* The registrant can then sell, trade or donate the points.\Buyers\* Company or individual calculates how much CO2 they need to offset.\* They input the amount into the Web site. The retail side automatically calculates the cost of the offsets and matches a seller or sellers.\* Wholesale purchasers submit a bid and wait for response from sellers.\* Retail buyers pay for the offsets through the site with a credit card. Wholesale buyers pay with a bank wire.\Source: Global Emissions Exchange\***\E-mail: morley@northjersey.com\***"
40,"The state Assembly passed a resolution Thursday pushing the Christie administration toward joining a cap-and-trade program to cut emissions of carbon, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.\The resolution likely will be ignored by the administration -- Governor Christie pulled New Jersey out of such a program in 2011 and has since vetoed two bills designed to have the state rejoin.\Christie has also recently attacked federal efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The administration joined 23 other states in October in a suit against the Obama administration to block new rules that will cut carbon emissions from power plants.\The state had been a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a coalition of nine New England and mid-Atlantic states that requires utilities in those states to buy credits for each ton of carbon they emit. The credits are sold in auctions, and the states use the revenue to promote renewable energy.\Christie argued that the program does not alter the behavior of energy producers; instead, he said it raised electric rates for New Jersey residents and businesses. Environmentalists have said the cost is meager -- about $6 a year per average household.\After Christie withdrew New Jersey from RGGI, the state Department of Environmental Protection repealed the rules governing the state's involvement in such cap-and-trade programs.\The Assembly resolution that passed Thursday, by 46-32, says the DEP ignored the intent of the Legislature when it repealed the rules, since the Legislature wants the state to participate in a cap-and-trade program.\The DEP has 30 days to change course and reinstate the rules -- or it could simply ignore the Legislature, the more likely scenario.\In that case, the new Legislature, with a simple majority, could pass another resolution early next year to reinstate the rules outlining the state's participation in a cap-and-trade program.\The state Senate passed a companion resolution last year.\Environmental groups praised Thursday's vote by the Democratic-controlled Assembly.\""Governor Christie clearly thumbed his nose at the Legislature by pulling out of the rules governing RGGI,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey. ""The Assembly took the first step to assert legislative intent [and] can't be conveniently ignored. Three years after Sandy, Governor Christie says that our climate isn't in crisis. It's time for the Legislature to remind Governor Christie he can ignore climate science, but he can't ignore legislative intent.""\When Christie vetoed legislation designed to rejoin RGGI several years ago, he acknowledged that climate change is real, that human activity contributes to the changes and that greenhouse-gas emissions are increasing. But, he said, ""I simply disagree that RGGI is an effective mechanism for addressing global warming.""\In their minority statement on Thursday's resolution, Republican assemblymen made a similar point. They argued that it ""seeks to force the state to re-enter a program that places yet another tax on energy, likely to be passed along to ratepayers, purportedly to reach an emission reduction goal that was achieved years ago. As a measure that has a cost but no benefit, we cannot support the resolution.""\New Jersey policies have cut carbon emissions in recent years. But emissions shot up 14 percent in 2014, in part because of a resurgent economy, a cold winter and power plants shutting down in other states, all of which pushed up demand for energy from New Jersey plants."
41,"New Jersey raised more than $15 million from power companies and other bidders this week through its participation in a regional auction designed to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\The auction is part of the first market-based cap and trade program in the nation to make polluters pay for the right to emit carbon dioxide and ultimately lower emission amounts. Each power company in the 10-state coalition must purchase allowances for every ton of carbon they emit each year. The proceeds will be invested by the states in energy efficiency projects and developing renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.\The results of Wednesday's auction were released Friday by the 10-state coalition, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The states sold more than 31.5 million carbon allowances at a clearing price of $3.38 per ton - slightly higher than the $3.07 clearing price for the coalition's first auction, held in September. New Jersey and three other states, including New York, did not participate in that initial auction. New York raised nearly $42 million in this week's auction.\The auction raised $106.5 million overall for the 10 states, and the coalition said the demand was three times higher than the supply of allowances. There were 69 participants in the bidding from the energy, financial and environmental sectors.\""Once again the results prove that distributing allowances via auctions in a carbon dioxide cap and trade program can be successful,"" Pete Grannis, chairman of the coalition's board, said in a statement. ""We look forward to developing a partnership with the Obama administration to create a strong federal climate action plan.""\During his presidential campaign, President-elect Barack Obama called for a cap and trade program on a national scale.\That appeals to industry advocates, who say that a regional approach in which only some states charge or tax power companies for emissions creates an uneven playing field and leaves some power generators at a competitive disadvantage.\PSEG Power, which has power plants in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, participated in both of the regional coalition's auctions and supports a national approach.\Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club said the coalition expects the price for allowances ultimately to rise to about $7, which would generate more than $40 million a year for New Jersey to invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy, forestry projects and low-cost loans to build cogeneration plants.\The current price per allowance works out to about a half a percent sales tax on energy generation or just under 2 percent on coal-fired power, Tittel said. ""That's not enough of a pinch to prod power companies to shift away from using coal, because coal is still a lot cheaper to use at that rate than natural gas and renewable energy,"" he said. The price would have to rise to about $20 per allowance to push companies away from coal.\The real benefit of the coalition's project is its usefulness as a model on which to build a national cap and trade program, Tittel said. A second benefit is the money it raises to invest in other projects that will reduce emissions.\Through the program, the 10 states aim to stabilize the amount of carbon emissions from their power plants at a capped level through 2014. The cap will then be reduced by 2.5 percent in each of the following four years for a total reduction of 10 percent by 2018. Power companies that reduce their emissions can resell their allowances to other companies who need them.\Power plants in New Jersey produce about 20 million metric tons of carbon emissions a year, the state Department of Environmental Protection says.\""Until now we've essentially been giving power plant owners freedom to pollute,"" said Dan Sosland, executive director of Environment Northeast, a non-profit that participated in forming the coalition. ""Now states can use the funds from these carbon allowances to make our homes, schools and businesses more energy efficient. These are critical elements that should be incorporated into a national carbon dioxide cap and trade program.""\In addition to New Jersey and New York, the coalition includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.\***\Auction results\A 10-state coalition has held two auctions so far to sell allowances to power companies that emit carbon dioxide. Through the program, the states aim to stabilize the amount of carbon emissions from their power plants at a capped level through 2014. The cap will then be reduced by 2.5 percent in each of the following four years. Listed below is each state with the number of allowances auctioned in September and this week and the money each raised.

44,"Aggressive policies adopted by New Jersey and other states could reduce carbon emissions by nearly 540 million metric tons per year by 2020 - or about 7 percent of all U.S. global warming pollution emitted in 2007, a new report says.\Six states, including New Jersey, have adopted caps that would reduce emissions 13 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, says the report, issued Thursday by the citizen advocacy group Environment America and its local chapter, Environment New Jersey.\Put another way, the potential yearly reductions in emissions from the states' new policies would be equivalent to the annual emissions from 105 million cars or 163 coal-fired power plants.\""States have great power to reduce global warming pollution within their borders and many states are now using that power to implement clean-energy policies that rival those anywhere in the world,"" Environment New Jersey's Matt Elliott said at a news conference unveiling the report.\Combined, the six states - which also include California, Massachusetts and Maryland -- produce nearly a quarter of the nation's economic output and 13 percent of its carbon emissions.\""Many states, including California, New Jersey, Hawaii and Washington, have definitely been leaders in greenhouse gas reduction policies,"" said Glen Andersen, an expert on climate change and renewable energy with the National Conference of State Legislatures. He said Congress has looked to some of the state programs as they craft national climate change legislation.\Dozens of states have adopted clean-energy policies to reduce global warming, the report says:\* 29 states require some of their electricity to come from renewable energy - an effort that will cut carbon emissions by 79 million metric tons, the report estimates.\* 22 states require a share of their energy needs to be met through improving energy efficiency - policies that could cut emissions by 67 million metric tons.\* 14 states adopted appliance and lighting efficiency standards that are being replicated at the federal level.\* 14 states adopted a Clean Cars Program to reduce emissions from vehicle tailpipes.\""New Jersey has been one of the leaders to bring global climate change to the forefront,"" said Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of Bergen County. ""As states move forward, the federal government will follow our lead.""\States are primary regulators of electric and natural gas utilities, and 10 Northeastern states, including New Jersey, have targeted their emissions. They have created the first market-based cap-and-trade program in the country to make polluters pay for the right to emit carbon dioxide. Each power company in the coalition must purchase an allowance for every ton of carbon it emits.\The program, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, was cited in the report.\The RGGI states aim to stabilize the amount of carbon emissions from their power plants at a capped level through 2014. The cap will then be ratcheted back by 2.5 percent in each of the following four years for a total cut of 10 percent by 2018.\""RGGI was established in part to be a national model,"" Elliott said.\The Obama administration wants to implement a similar program at the national level. A national cap-and-trade program appeals to industry advocates, who say a regional approach in which only some states charge or tax power companies for emissions creates an uneven playing field.\Christopher Sherry, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's staff lead on RGGI, said one goal of RGGI was to accelerate movement on a cap-and-trade program at the national level.\With three such programs now in place covering more than half the country, it has brought industry to the table to discuss a national program, Sherry said. He said New Jersey and other states have also received direct inquiries from committee staff in both House and Senate as the Congress moves to write and pass legislation for a national cap-and-trade program.\The 10 RGGI states combined have earned $433 million from five RGGI auctions over the past year. New Jersey has so far earned $51.5 million by selling 16.1 million carbon allowances at auction. It uses the money to provide grants and loans for projects that reduce energy use.\Despite the initiatives, progress on cutting carbon emissions has been elusive for New Jersey. Environment America released a report last month indicating that New Jersey continued to emit more carbon dioxide into the air each year between 2004 and 2007 even as New York and Pennsylvania cut their emissions.\New Jersey emitted 133 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2007 alone, an all-time high. The state ranked 16th-worst among states in emissions, according to the report.\***\E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com"
45,"For the second time in less than a year, Governor Christie on Thursday vetoed legislation that would have kept New Jersey involved in a nine-state program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - a program that Christie called a ""futile policy.""\Christie pulled New Jersey out of the coalition, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, last year, and the Legislature had tried to force him to rejoin by passing similar legislation. This year's version of the bill was a virtual do-over -- with the same result.\Christie's second veto drew the ire of environmental groups, two of which last month filed suit against the governor over the issue.\RGGI is a cap-and-trade program that requires utilities in participating states to purchase credits for each ton of carbon they emit. The credits are sold through public auctions, and the states use the revenue to pay for programs that promote renewable energy and clean-energy technology.\Christie has argued the program does not alter the behavior of energy producers; instead, he has said it raises electric rates for New Jersey residents and businesses.\Environmentalists have said the cost is meager -- about $6 a year per average household.\""Numerous independent studies have shown that RGGI delivers benefits to the economy and the environment, creating a win-win for every resident of our state,"" said Matt Elliott of Environment New Jersey.

46,"STATEHOUSE BUREAU\A former mayor of Bogota in Bergen County, Steve Lonegan ran in the Republican primary for governor in 2009, losing to Chris Christie. He has since spent much of his time criticizing the Republican governor for not being conservative enough.\Lonegan is the state director of the New Jersey chapter of the Americans for Prosperity, a group pushing a pro-business, smaller government agenda. Recently, it has received growing national attention as an organizer and promoter of the Tea Party movement.\Lonegan minces no words about what he thinks about Gov. Christie, the cause of the nation's economic problems and the need to scale back government programs.\Q: Since Chris Christie entered the Governor's Office in January, your organization has mostly criticized him. What do you think of Christie's job in office so far?\A: I have not been happy with the performance. We expected him to cut the size of government, cut taxes, create a pro-business environment, and that's simply not happening. The things I'm seeing, from a failure to oppose Obamacare to advancement of a cap-and-trade scheme in New Jersey, combined with tax hikes, do not give me comfort to think we're going to see economic growth as a result of these policies.\Q: Is Christie a conservative in your view?\A: No. You've seen someone who has adopted the Obama healthcare plan, someone who has failed to join the lawsuit against Obamacare, who was the first governor in the country to join the catastrophic healthcare pool, who is advancing a cap-and-trade scheme like Barack Obama's.\We've seen legislation that attempts to take away unused gift cards from restaurants as well as retail stores when they're not used. What gives the government the right to do such a thing? All in all, I have not seen any cutbacks in the size of state government. I've seen no tax cuts for New Jersey's property tax payers, businesses or anyone in between. None of that points to a conservative agenda.\Q: Christie's budget calls for cutting 1,300 state workers and cuts in a number of departments. Does that qualify for you at all?\A: I haven't seen any state layoffs as a result of the Christie budget. In fact, I've seen every Democratic hack appointed under Jon Corzine just staying in their positions. There has been some rhetoric about privatization. That hasn't happened. Perhaps it will. We've heard local mayors told to tighten their belts and perform better, yet the state government has failed to do so. The entire bureaucracy has remained intact and continues to sap the taxpayers of this state.\Q: An article in last week's New Yorker profiled David and Charles Koch, leaders of Americans for Prosperity. The article noted that the brothers are billionaires with widespread corporate interests, including oil, and it contended that the populist Tea Party and AFP are, in fact, financed in an effort to advance business interests. True?\A: The Kochs are a model for American industry and success. These guys are unbelievable. They are responsible for the biggest public-private buyback with George Pacific, which had been a publicly traded company. They own Dixie Cups. These guys are great leaders of industry and job creators. I am proud to have them as the heads of the board of AFP national.\I run this state's operations. I raise all the money for this chapter, which is $1.5 million a year. I've never gotten a single penny from the Kochs, unfortunately. Believe me, I want to. But they've had a terrific vision in trying to build an organization that would defend free enterprise and free markets in an environment where people can grow and prosper.\They are diametrically opposed to George Soros and the liberal left, which is looking for more big government, higher taxes and a government takeover of our lives. So, of course, the left is fighting back.\As far as the Tea Party, I don't see that. I'm very familiar with the Tea Party movement. It's very spontaneous, very bottom up. I don't see the Kochs as having any involvement in that.\Q: According to public records, you are paid $24,000 as the state chapter coordinator for Americans for Prosperity and another $108,000 for the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. What is your role there?\A: The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is focused on education. We educate people on policy efforts and whatnot. That's our 501(c)3. Our 501(c)4 effort is our attempt to advocate on federal policies. For example, calling Christie and telling him to stop cap-and-trade. We do not advocate for or against candidates. We may say, call Sen. (Jim) Whelan (D-Atlantic) or call Sen. Sean Kean (R-Monmouth) and tell them to join the effort to repeal cap-and-trade. As the state director for the foundation, I raise the money. I spend probably half my time raising money.\Q: It has been said that the Tea Party is a hostile takeover of the Republican Party.\A: The Tea Party is an eclectic mix of different groups that has come together as a visceral reaction to the agenda of Barack Obama, not always having the same message but knowing in their hearts that the country is moving in the wrong direction.\The impact they have in the next election will be important, but I think it is the Republican Party that will do everything it can to annex the Tea Party groups and sort of mollify them and -- bring them in line. I hope that doesn't happen. I hope the Tea Parties stay independent and put pressure on Republicans and Democrats.\Q: What does it mean to be a conservative? What views do you need to hold to be one?\A: Conservatives are concerned primarily with the rights and responsibilities of the individual; limited government, meaning the most minimal government necessary; being free of the encumbrances of big government so one can grow and achieve one's possibilities, without being dragged down by government regulations or propped up by government supports.\Under the Christie administration, we've seen a lot of that. We've seen the expansion of food stamps to 185 percent of the poverty level, up from 135 percent. We've seen the expansion of New Jersey Family Care, which is the state's version of Obamacare, the public option. We're not seeing a return to core conservative principles. We're seeing a lot of bluster, and a lot of rhetoric, but we're not seeing the real thing.\We're moving in the wrong direction, stupid government policies on every level, expanding unemployment to 99 weeks. That's not unemployment, it's welfare. I think unemployment should be scaled back to what it used to be -- 13 weeks. There are numerous studies out there, including one by the Cato Institute, that show that people go out and look for a job the last two weeks of unemployment.\People have to start lowering their sights. I'm sorry if you used to be a, whatever, a high-paid vice president of something. If you have to go work at Wal-Mart again to start over, then so be it. We're no longer going to create a whole bunch of government jobs for people in capacities that they can't find positions in.\Q: What did you think of the firing of Bret Schundler?\A: I've never seen another Cabinet member on any level fired in that manner. I think Bret Schundler deserved to be handled more appropriately, given more time to sort things out. I think the man's integrity was impugned and I think it was unnecessary the way Schundler was treated.\I don't see why this governor couldn't have taken two or three weeks to digest everything, to sit down with his people and come up with a plan. Maybe Schundler still would have gone, but he would have gone under much better circumstances so his career wasn't destroyed.\Q: Christie has been discussed in the national media as a possible presidential contender, and Peggy Noonan recently wrote a column that declared he is a model for America. Do you think he should be considered a contender, and if not, whom would you favor as a presidential candidate?\A: What we're seeing is the moderate wing of the Republican Party trying to prop up a moderate candidate. You've got the moderate and liberal Republicans who want to control the agenda. They've always disliked conservatives. They've adopted a new strategy. Rather than opposing conservatives, they call themselves conservatives.\Now you've got a guy like (Gov.) Rick Perry in Texas, who came out in the beginning and said, ""I do not want Race to the Top educational money. I'm not going to have government bureaucrats telling us how to educate our kids. We're not even going to apply for it."" Here in New Jersey, we've just had a huge scandal over this governor's efforts to chase that money.\Q: Are you interested in running as a gubernatorial candidate in 2013?\A: No. It's not my plan. I'm very content in the work I do, where I can advance policy in a nonpartisan way, where I can hold both parties accountable, which we've done effectively at Americans for Prosperity.\Q: So you are absolutely ruling it out?\A: Yes.\Q: The New Jersey's Taxpayers Budget, produced by your chapter of Americans for Prosperity, called for broad tax cuts as well as significant reductions in social service spending. What state government programs do you think are necessary?\A: The state government needs to maintain the state's roads and bridges, the judicial system, the State Police and, to some extent, the state parks, though I think they should be run by private operators. Beyond that, state government should be minimized.\We've seen the expansion of government entitlement programs. We've seen the growth of state government programs under the Christie administration. We've seen the expansion of food stamps to government funded pre-K programs. We've seen a record amount of money being poured into the Abbott districts. I still expect dismal results there anyway. And at the end of the day, the state's economy is suffering because of it. We're less competitive, taxes are way too high. Businesses have left New Jersey and will continue to leave New Jersey.\Q: Your Taxpayers Budget called for income tax cuts, but it anticipated the same amount of revenue from income taxes as Christie's plan. Do you think tax cuts pay for themselves?\A: Oh, I absolutely think tax cuts pay for themselves. You can increase revenue. That's been a common theme of conservative economic policy for years, beginning with Calvin Coolidge right up through Ronald Reagan. I also believe government should be cutting spending and reducing its massive debt, which is another issue for the state.\Q: When you ran as a gubernatorial candidate in the Republican primary last year, you called for a 2.9 percent flat tax. Would that have been enough to fund the budget?\A: Our projections on the 2.9 percent flat tax showed that it would have been revenue neutral. It would have resulted in increased job growth, increased economic growth and, actually, increased revenue. Under a 2.9 percent flat tax, New Jersey would be the most competitive state in this region of the country. We would be under Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware, Maryland. It would result in phenomenal growth for New Jersey.\Q: That flat tax would have required those earning the median state salary or less to pay more in taxes. The wealthy often complain they are paying a disproportionate share of the tax burden. Do you think that low and moderate-income people are paying too little in taxes?\A: When you take into account that people earning less than $25,000 are not paying taxes, then they are going to pay more. Sure. But you know what? The premise for the economic argument for this is that economic growth benefits absolutely everybody. Those people now on the low end of the earnings spectrum have nowhere to go in this state. They can expect nothing. They can see no economic growth. Under my plan, with a flat tax, they'll have a much better chance to move up the income bracket.\Everybody pays too much in taxes. The government is taking too much money. It's not just that they (low-income workers) are not paying enough. They're getting off the hook for bearing their share of responsibility for a government that's overspending. They don't have an interest in voting on spending. When you have a simple flat tax where every single taxpayer has a piece of the action, where they're impacted when the government spends money, then everyone would vote on the economic policies of this government.\We're making this a magnet state for low-income people and welfare recipients and driving out upper-income wage earners. The state cannot survive that economic formula.\Q: The Taxpayers Budget also criticized NJ FamilyCare as subsidized health insurance that is a ""replica of the Obama health care takeover model."" Should New Jersey or the federal government offer government-subsidized health insurance to those who do not have it?\A: New Jersey's family care is a replica of the Obama public option. That's what this is. It is a response to the fact that New Jersey has one of the highest healthcare insurance costs in the country. The real answer is to deregulate insurance, drive competition, allow people to buy health insurance across state lines. Cut the cost of health insurance, don't subsidize it. This is a clear example of the old Reagan line: ""If it moves, tax it, if it keeps moving, regulate it, and if it stops moving, subsidize it."" It puts more pressure on the taxpayers of New Jersey.\There should not be a government option for people who don't have health insurance. There should be a highly competitive environment that offers all kinds of options for health insurance.\Q: Should there be food stamps, Medicaid or general assistance programs?\A: This is where we get into the area of feel-good politics. This country has led the world in charitable giving for the truly needy. Churches, synagogues and civic organizations have always met the needs of our communities far better than the government. I think that's the system we should be following. I think food stamps are one of the most corrupted and ridiculous programs out there.\Should we have a safety net in place for those who fall through? Yes, but we've gone way beyond that. When we expand food stamps, as under the Christie administration, from 135 percent to 185 percent of the poverty level, we're creating a bigger population of people relying on government. Food stamps are being accepted as the norm. It shouldn't be the norm. We're moving far too close to an entitlement state.\Q: Your Taxpayers Budget also criticized economic development expenditures and said, ""The concept of supporting industries at the exclusion of others is a flawed concept."" Does the government have any role to play in economic development, and what would it be?\A: Get out of the way and let them grow and flourish. In the private sector, picking winners and losers, such as the (proposed) Xanadu bailout, is wrong. The government needs to get out of the way of the private sector. Let people compete and win and lose.\Q: In your book ""Putting Taxpayers First,"" you lament the increase in government jobs in New Jersey while noting the deep cuts in manufacturing. Is this all a result of taxes, or does global competition play a role here?\A: It is the result of government policy that has grown government to some extent and of the ridiculous mindset that government needs to employ people to make up for the private sector. It is the result of those same failed polices driving down New Jersey's competitiveness. Everything always ties back to failed state government policy.\Q: Your organization has attacked the regional cap-and-trade program, which New Jersey is a part of, that is similar to the proposed national program. Do you believe global warming is a real problem?\A: I personally do not believe that the carbon dioxide of human beings is going to affect our climate. But putting the science issue aside, the fact is that many can agree that this approach to global warming is astronomical. Barack Obama himself said that under his plan of cap-and-trade, energy costs would ""necessarily skyrocket."" What people do not know is that New Jersey is participating in a plan identical to Obama's.\Q: Is there any value, in your view, to wind mills or solar power?\A: Scrap metal. I've heard people refer to New Jersey as the solar suckers. History will prove this be nothing more than a hair-brained scheme.\Q: You have been reluctant to discuss your degenerative eye disease. Still, if you will, in what way has this disease strengthened you or helped you in other ways?\A: It's one of the things each individual deals with in life. You meet the challenges that come on. It goes back to my whole philosophy on entitlement programs. Once you get people into an entitlement program and they get used to relying on it or whatever, they fall into line. I believe in people standing on their own two feet. That (disease) has given me better insight in being able to speak about these issues, more than most.\Jason Method: 609-292-5158; jmethod@app.com"
47,"| @ReporterBMakin\A report by Environment New Jersey Research & Policy Center indicates that the state remains a leader in carbon pollution controls, but has work to do to address emissions of its five dirtiest power plants, three of which are in Central Jersey.\They are PSEG Linden Generating Station, the Linden Cogeneration Plant, and Red Oak Power, Sayreville, said the report, entitled ""America's Dirtiest Power Plants.""\The five dirtiest plants, which include Bergen Generating Station and PSEG Hudson Generating Station, produce 35 percent of the state's carbon power but generate 65 percent of its carbon pollution, according to the report.

""If we want a cleaner, safer future for our kids, we can't afford to ignore power plants' overwhelming contribution to global warming. For New Jersey and America, tackling the problem means cleaning up the dirtiest power plants.""\The report shows that New Jersey's power plants emit as much carbon pollution as 3.7 million cars. But that's less than the most carbon-polluting power plant in the nation, Georgia Power Company's Scherer Plant, which emits as much as 4.4 million cars, the report said. America's power plants are its single largest source of carbon pollution, responsible for 40 percent of emissions nationwide, DeRosa said.\During the introduction of the report on Tuesday in Jersey City, DeRosa was joined by Democratic gubernatorial candidate state Sen.

49,"A former mayor of Bogota in Bergen County, Steve Lonegan ran in the Republican primary for governor in 2009, losing to Chris Christie. He has since spent much of his time criticizing the Republican governor for not being conservative enough.\Lonegan is the state director of the New Jersey chapter of the Americans for Prosperity, a group pushing a probusiness, smaller government agenda. Recently, it has received growing national attention as an organizer and promoter of the Tea Party movement. Lonegan minces no words about what he thinks about Gov. Christie, the cause of the nation's economic problems and the need to scale back government programs.\Q. Since Chris Christie entered the Governor's Office in January, your organization has been mostly critical of him. What do you think of Christie's job in office so far? A. I have not been happy with the performance. We expected him to cut the size of government, cut taxes, create a pro-business environment, and that's simply not happening. The things I'm seeing, from a failure to oppose Obamacare to advancement of a cap-andtrade scheme in New Jersey, combined with tax hikes, do not give me comfort to think we're going to see economic growth as a result of these policies. Q. Is Christie a conservative in your view? A. No. You've seen someone who has adopted the Obama healthcare plan, someone who has failed to join the lawsuit against Obamacare, who was the first governor in the country to join the catastrophic healthcare pool, who is advancing a cap-and-trade scheme like Barack Obama's.\We've seen legislation that attempts to take away unused gift cards from restaurants as well as retail stores when they're not used. What gives the government the right to do such a thing? All in all, I have not seen any cutbacks in the size of state government. I've seen no tax cuts for New Jersey's property tax payers, businesses or anyone in between. None of that points to a conservative agenda. Q. Christie's budget calls for cuts of 1,300 state workers and cuts to most state departments. Does that qualify for you at all? A. I haven't seen any state layoffs as a result of the Christie budget. In fact, I've seen every Democratic hack appointed under Jon Corzine just staying in their positions. There has been some rhetoric about privatization. That hasn't happened. Perhaps it will. We've heard local mayors told to tighten their belts and perform better, yet the state government has failed to do so. The entire bureaucracy has remained intact and continues to sap the taxpayers of this state. Q. An article in last week's New Yorker profiled David and Charles Koch, leaders of Americans for Prosperity. The article noted that the brothers are billionaires with widespread corporate interests, including oil, and it contended that the populist Tea Party and AFP are, in fact, financed in an effort to advance business interests. True? A. The Kochs are a model for American industry and success. These guys are unbelievable. They are responsible for the biggest public-private buyback with George Pacific, which had been a publicly traded company. They own Dixie Cups. These guys are great leaders of industry and job creators. I am proud to have them as the heads of the board of AFP national. I run this state's operations. I raise all the money for this chapter, which is $1.5 million a year. I've never gotten a single penny from the Kochs, unfortunately. Believe me, I want to. But they've had a terrific vision in trying to build an organization that would defend free enterprise and free markets in an environment where people can grow and prosper. They are diametrically opposed to George Soros and the liberal left, which is looking for more big government, higher taxes and a government takeover of our lives. So, of course, the left is fighting back. As far as the Tea Party, I don't see that. I'm very familiar with the Tea Party movement. It's very spontaneous, very bottom up. I don't see the Kochs as having any involvement in that. Q. According to public records, you are paid $24,000 as the state chapter coordinator for Americans for Prosperity and another $108,000 for the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. What is your role there? A. The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is focused on education. We educate people on policy efforts and whatnot. That's our 501(c)3. Our 501(c)4 effort is our attempt to advocate on federal policies. For example, calling Christie and telling him to stop cap-and-trade. We do not advocate for or against candidates. We may say, call Sen. (Jim) Whelan (DAtlantic) or call Sen. Sean Kean (R-Monmouth) and tell them to join the effort to repeal cap-and-trade. As the state director for the foundation, I raise the money. I spend probably half my time raising money. Q. It has been said that the Tea Party is a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. A. The Tea Party is an eclectic mix of different groups that has come together as a visceral reaction to the agenda of Barack Obama, not always having the same message but knowing in their hearts that the country is moving in the wrong direction. The impact they have in the next election will be important, but I think it is the Republican Party that will do everything it can to annex the Tea Party groups and sort of mollify them and -- bring them in line. I hope that doesn't happen. I hope the Tea Parties stay independent and put pressure on Republicans and Democrats. Q. What does it mean to be a conservative? What views do you need to hold to be one? A. Conservatives are concerned primarily with the rights and responsibilities of the individual; limited government, meaning the most minimal government necessary; being free of the encumbrances of big government so one can grow and achieve one's possibilities, without being dragged down by government regulations or propped up by government supports. Under the Christie administration, we've seen a lot of that. We've seen the expansion of food stamps to 185 percent of the poverty level, up from 135 percent. We've seen the expansion of New Jersey Family Care, which is the state's version of Obamacare, the public option. We're not seeing a return to core conservative principles. We're seeing a lot of bluster, and a lot of rhetoric, but we're not seeing the real thing. We're moving in the wrong direction, stupid government policies on every level, expanding unemployment to 99 weeks. That's not unemployment, it's welfare. I think unemployment should be scaled back to what it used to be -- 13 weeks. There are numerous studies out there, including one by the Cato Institute, that show that people go out and look for a job the last two weeks of unemployment. People have to start lowering their sights. I'm sorry if you used to be a, whatever, a high-paid vice president of something. If you have to go work at Wal-Mart again to start over, then so be it. We're no longer going to create a whole bunch of government jobs for people in capacities that they can't find positions in. Q. What did you think of the firing of Bret Schundler? A. I've never seen another Cabinet member on any level fired in that manner. I think Bret Schundler deserved to be handled more appropriately, given more time to sort things out. I think the man's integrity was impugned and I think it was unnecessary the way Schundler was treated. Q. Christie has been discussed in the national media as a possible presidential contender, and Peggy Noonan recently wrote a column that declared he is a model for America. Do you think he should be considered a contender, and if not, whom would you favor as a presidential candidate? A. What we're seeing is the moderate wing of the Republican Party trying to prop up a moderate candidate. You've got the moderate and liberal Republicans who want to control the agenda. They've always disliked conservatives. They've adopted a new strategy. Rather than opposing conservatives, they call themselves conservatives. Q. Are you interested in running as a gubernatorial candidate in 2013? A. No. It's not my plan. I'm very content in the work I do, where I can advance policy in a nonpartisan way, where I can hold both parties accountable, which we've done effectively at Americans for Prosperity. Q. The New Jersey's Taxpayers Budget, produced by your chapter of Americans for Prosperity, called for broad tax cuts as well as significant reductions in social service spending. What state government programs do you think are necessary? A. The state government needs to maintain the state's roads and bridges, the judicial system, the State Police and, to some extent, the state parks, though I think they should be run by private operators. Beyond that, state government should be minimized. Q. Your Taxpayers Budget called for income tax cuts, but it anticipated the same amount of revenue from income taxes as Christie's plan. Do you think tax cuts pay for themselves? A. Absolutely. You can increase revenue. That's been a common theme of conservative economic policy for years, beginning with Calvin Coolidge right up through Ronald Reagan. I also believe government should be cutting spending and reducing its massive debt, which is another issue for the state. Q. When you ran as a gubernatorial candidate in the Republican primary last year, you called for a 2.9 percent flat tax. Would that have been enough to fund the budget? A. Our projections on the 2.9 percent flat tax showed that it would have been revenue neutral. It would have resulted in increased job growth, increased economic growth and, actually, increased revenue. Under a 2.9 percent flat tax, New Jersey would be the most competitive state in this region of the country. We would be under Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware, Maryland. It would result in phenomenal growth for New Jersey.\Jason Method: 609-292-5158; jmethod@app.com."
50,"All drivers should be retested\Regarding ""Road rage cited by police in fatal parkway accident"" (Page L-1, July 2):\Losing a loved one under any condition is hard; losing someone in what appears to be an act of criminal stupidity makes the death particularly tragic. The victim of this crime might still be alive if it were not for the drivers that witnesses described as driving ""erratically, tailgating, making numerous lane changes and traveling in excess of 65 mph.""\New Jersey drivers are becoming worse than at any time since I first started driving many years ago. I've observed a complete disregard for the law, a lack of respect for other drivers and a complete failure to follow common sense.\While construction is ongoing on the Garden State Parkway, drivers regularly cross the solid white line when changing lanes without using turn signals. They think nothing of tailgating. More are weaving in and out of traffic. They drive so close to your car that should you ever need to stop suddenly you are all but guaranteed to be struck from behind. Yield signs are seen as only a suggestion, one to be ignored. Drivers who miss their exits think nothing of backing up on the parkway until they have reached the missed exit, putting us all in danger.\I see drivers speeding down the parkway with their cellphones up to their ears and have witnessed female drivers applying nail polish and male drivers shaving as well as reading the newspaper while steering with their knees.\Many seem to feel that they may use our roadways as a trash receptacle. Once when I was driving home on Route 17 in Paramus, the front of my car was hit by a banana skin.\Bus drivers are even worse, driving erratically, speeding and cutting off cars as they change lanes, without signaling.\All drivers should be retested at certain time intervals to ensure they are still qualified. Driving is a responsibility, not a right.\Bruce Mitchell\Waldwick, July 2\What's in a name?\We all know now that Savannah Guthrie will be greeting us daily on the ""Today"" show. Though Savannah was born in Australia, her name suggests another place.\Many New Jersey parents name their children for other places: Montana, Dakota, Jordan. The list goes on. It is time new parents get back to New Jersey.\We have lots of places to use for strong and original first names. Some are grand. Some are familiar. Bring back Wayne and Clifton. Those are star names. Go British with Camden, Franklin, Rutherford, Somerset, Trenton or Waldwick. Want original? Use Dover. We have wonderful names for girls with Asbury, Brielle, Lavallette, Oradell, Leonia and Verona. Kearny is cute. Take the elegant French, Montclair -- Claire for short.\Just think, if Michael Jackson had ventured to this coast, his son Prince could have been Princeton. Had Spider-Man creator Stan Lee been from here, he could have been Stanhope. If Julia Roberts had a New Jersey sensibility, her child, Hazel, could have been Hazlet.\And you just can't go wrong with the Oranges. If Beyonce and Jay Z were into New Jersey, might their baby, instead of Blue, be Orange Ivy?\Karel Littman\Teaneck, June 30\Two views on Roche's relocation\Regarding ""Roche closing N.J. plant"" (Page A-1, June 27):\While Governor Christie attacks environmental regulations, Roche is moving to places that have stricter environmental laws and regulations than New Jersey. In fact, California, Switzerland and Germany have some of the strictest standards in the world. The reason companies move to places with environmental regulations is that they know their investment will be protected. They know that a new facility will not be built next door polluting the surrounding water and air.\Switzerland and Germany are part of a regional cap-and-trade program. Switzerland has a set goal of one-third of its energy coming from renewable sources by 2020, while Germany is looking to reach 80 percent by 2050. California's target is 33 percent by 2020, and they also participate in the western states' regional carbon pollution reduction compact. These governments understand investment in renewable energy will reduce pollution and energy cost long-term because they are no longer dependent on fossil fuels and that they will create jobs and spur new technologies in the clean-energy field. Meanwhile in New Jersey, Christie rolled our renewable goal back from 30 percent to 22.5 percent by 2020 and pulled out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, costing our state jobs and funding.\All of these places have much stricter standards for air and water pollution, storm water and recycling. Germany has the toughest land use regulations in the world. A farm or forest is zoned as such and cannot have another use. Switzerland and California both have strict land use controls. In California, every project has to pass environmental scrutiny for greenhouse gases and environmental impacts. There are 17 agencies in California that regulate the environment. Their local approval process is tougher than in New Jersey.\Green equals green. Companies want to invest in places where the environment is protected because it not only helps to protect their investment, but it means these areas are developing new, innovative technologies that will help grow their bottom line.\Jeff Tittel\Trenton, July 2\The writer is director of the New Jersey Sierra Club.\*\Regarding ""Roche closing N.J. plant"" (Page A-1, June 27):\I read with amusement that Roche is relocating operations to California from New Jersey because it is less costly to operate. California, a state that has teetered toward bankruptcy more than once and struggles to provide essential services, has astronomical housing costs, some of the nation's worst traffic, little public transportation, gang- and drug-related activity that is exacerbated by its proximity to a porous border with Mexico and a pollution problem that requires cars to have a special catalytic converter.\Middle-class employees of Roche who relocate will not find it cheaper to live in California. Perhaps the executives of Roche want a lifestyle change, as the wealthy do find California to be a nice place to live and work.\However, any Roche executives who try to make a business case as to why California is a better place to operate than New Jersey need drug testing, because they must be taking something produced in their labs.\Stephen Gigante\Hackensack, July 2\Political campaigns should be taxed\I have an idea for a new tax that everyone would be behind. I believe we should tax all political campaigns at a minimum of a 50 percent rate. For every dollar spent by either party, PAC or Super PAC, a dollar would go to the treasury. We are told that the wealthy do not have any additional money to spend and they need it all to create jobs, yet they have no problems paying $10,000 for a picture with Mitt Romney or $40,000 for a dinner with President Obama.\I am just curious what jobs these people are creating. So, people would now understand if they donate $1 million to a campaign, half of that will go to the Treasury. Would this solve our deficit? No, but it will help create a few jobs at the very least. An added bonus to this tax: There would be fewer advertisements on TV that usually have half-truths at best. I see this as a win-win for everyone. Congress should pass this tax as quickly as possible.\Doug Flower\Wayne, July 2"
51,"Governor Christie vetoed legislation late Friday that would have required New Jersey to remain in a 10-state program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- a program Christie had previously called a ""failure.""\Christie announced in May that the state would withdraw at year's end from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, saying the program had not changed behavior or reduced greenhouse gas emissions but that it had raised the cost of electricity for state residents and businesses.\In late June, the Legislature tried to force Christie's hand by passing a clutch of bills that would have required him to keep New Jersey in the program, and one of the bills' key sponsors said Saturday that he would now push for a legislative override of Christie's veto.\""Governor Christie's veto of our measure is a giant step backwards in our march toward a clean-energy economy and the creation of thousands of clean jobs,"" said Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee Chairman John F. McKeon, D-Essex. ""RGGI has also protected the environment from global warming pollution by reducing greenhouses gases.""\Environmentalists also blasted Christie's veto. ""Leaving RGGI will cause New Jersey to lose jobs and increase pollution in New Jersey's air,"" said Jeff Tittel of the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter. ""The governor continues to move to the right and appease corporate polluters and the Tea Party to promote his national political profile.""\RGGI is a cap-and-trade program that requires utilities in the 10 participating states to purchase credits for each ton of carbon they emit. The credits are sold through public auctions, and the states use the revenues to pay for programs designed to promote renewable energy and clean-energy technology.\In his veto message, Christie said he acknowledges ""that the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere are increasing, that climate change is real, that human activity plays a role in these changes and that these changes are impacting our state."" But, he added, ""I simply disagree that RGGI is an effective mechanism for addressing global warming.""\He said the program did not change energy producers' behavior. Instead, he said, ""RGGI does nothing more than impose a tax on electricity. Moreover, it creates an unlevel playing field for our resident businesses that must compete from the fourth-highest energy-cost state in the country.""\Business and conservative groups have pressed for New Jersey to leave RGGI, saying it drives up energy rates because utilities pass along the cost of their carbon credits to customers. Environmentalists have said the rate increases are minimal.\The auctions have earned the states a combined $886 million so far, and New Jersey has received $106 million of that. Christie took $65 million in RGGI auction money last year to help balance the state budget, while at least $30 million has been used for its intended purpose, in the form of grants for 12 large-scale renewable-energy projects.\Credit: E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com"
52,"ONE POLICY victory that eluded President Obama in the last days of the outgoing Congress was a substantive piece of climate change legislation. The bill, which early on had a measure of bipartisan support, would have limited heat-trapping greenhouse gases and allowed companies to buy and sell pollution permits under that ceiling, using a system commonly known as ""cap and trade.""\Like many other worthy measures that failed to reach the finish line in the last legislative session, the so-called ""cap-and-trade"" bill stalled in the Senate this year after narrowly clearing the House. Republicans called it ""cap-and-tax,"" and said it would raise energy prices.\So it is in this political climate, and the end-of-year-tradition of granting pardons and giving gifts, that the federal Environmental Protection Agency last week issued some common-sense guidelines meant to accomplish a small bit of the ""cap-and-trade"" bill's objectives, and in the process perhaps give us all a little cleaner air to breathe.\""We are following through on our commitment to proceed in a measured and careful way to reduce GHG [greenhouse gas] pollution that threatens the health and welfare of Americans,"" EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said in a statement posted on the agency's website. ""These standards will help Americans attract private investment to the clean energy upgrades that make our companies more competitive and create good jobs here at home.""\The EPA's plan for establishing greenhouse gas pollution standards is aimed primarily at two industrial sectors: fossil fuel-fired power plants and petroleum refineries. According to the EPA, these industrial sources represent nearly 40 percent of the greenhouse gas pollution in the United States. They should be moved, whenever possible, to keep pollution controls current with changing technologies.\Certainly, we believe wholeheartedly in three branches of government, and that the legislative, judicial and executive branches all have their jobs to do. Yet when it comes to the environment and conservation, lawmakers have often been slow to act, and it has been left to the White House to enact change, as President Obama has done here, unilaterally.\Indeed, timing is everything. Republicans who will move to the majority in the House in the coming Congress have vowed to make life unpleasant for Jackson and for the programs her agency oversees, up to and including parts of the Clean Air Act. Jackson, who distinguished herself as commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection during the administration of former Gov. Jon Corzine, has shown a pragmatic streak as EPA chief that hasn't diminished her agency's role as watchdog.\In regard to the plan on updating greenhouse gas standards, Jackson stresses that the EPA will show flexibility, and will allow plenty of time for public scrutiny and input before moving forward.\Under the agreement reached last week with multiple states and environmental groups that had sued the EPA over failure to update pollution standards for these two industries, Jackson said the agency will host listening sessions with the business community, states and other stakeholders in early 2011, before moving ahead with proposed standards later in the year.\We are sorry that the climate-change debate fell into the realm of partisan bickering in the just-closed session of Congress. The issues and challenges it sought to address remain with us. The Obama administration understands the urgency, and last week the EPA made clear it wasn't ready to abandon efforts to cut the level of pollution in our air."
53,"HOW MUCH are we willing to spend to save the planet? And just how much does saving a planet cost these days, anyway?\Those will be two of the hottest questions in politics as Earth Day is marked this week. They will persist over the coming year as Congress attempts to craft legislation to slow global warming by reducing U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases.\But these two big questions have also driven the environmental movement to try its most delicate balancing act: pushing for legislation that slaps a price on greenhouse gases that's high enough to change corporate and individual behavior, while at the same time arguing that the costs of such a law wouldn't cause too much economic pain.\Listen to John Engler, former Michigan governor and president of the National Association of Manufacturers, and you'll hear that the price of the leading legislation cosponsored by Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn. will be far too steep. ""It would be like every month having a press conference announcing that you were closing another 1,000-person plant,"" Engler says. ""I think you end up with a lose-lose proposition for the American worker and the environment.""\Then listen to Nathaniel Keohane and Peter Goldmark of the Environmental Defense Fund, and you'll hear that the cost to the economy would be barely noticeable. After looking at scenarios done by five respected economic-modeling groups in government and academia, they note that the median projected impact on annual growth of slowing greenhouse-gas emissions is three-hundredths of a percentage point. Instead of reaching a GDP of about $23 trillion in January 2030 without greenhouse gas limits, Keohane and Goldmark say, the United States would get there in April of the same year if it took the greener path.\But look beyond this sharp, albeit predictable, divide between industrialists and environmentalists. The question of cost isn't simply a matter of money but also one of metaphor. Is slowing climate change a vital matter requiring shared sacrifice, along the lines of the everybody-pitch-in ethos of World War II? Or is it more like the Apollo space program, a noble national project in which ordinary citizens were basically spectators? Is the fight against global warming a question of setting limits or expanding horizons?\One set of answers demands that we all pull together to do our bit; the other requires little involvement from most citizens. One metaphor calls for Washington to set up a framework of limits and incentives like those in the Lieberman-Warner bill; the other favors major government spending on research and development. So who's right? The answer will help determine how green a world the United States is willing to pay for.\Let's start by thinking about the cost of doing nothing. Former Vice President Al Gore admits that policies limiting greenhouse gases would have a serious price tag. ""This is one of the most difficult things we've ever done,"" he says. But ""there will be a much larger cost if we do not deal with it.""\That's what the World Bank's former chief economist, Nicholas Stern, said in a 2006 British government report that jump-started the debate over the costs of slowing global warming. Stern called climate change ""the greatest market failure the world has ever seen,"" warning that it could shear 5 percent off world GDP and perhaps much more.\Future costs could include more severe hurricanes and flooding from New Orleans to Florida, from the Netherlands to Bangladesh. That worries corporate and financial elites who might quibble with some of Stern's methods for arriving at his estimates, but not his underlying point. Paul Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, calls the costs of addressing climate change ""manageable"" unlike the costs of inactivity. ""If we don't do anything,"" he adds, ""I think there will be very likely great costs.""\The price of action\That brings us to the price of action. The main bill on the legislative table is the 548-page Lieberman-Warner proposal for a ""cap-and-trade"" system.\The very phrase cap-and-trade is a pithy marketing gimmick to explain a complex system, favored by many environmentalists, that aims to control thousands of emissions sites worldwide, from pig farms to power plants.\Here's how cap-and-trade works. The government gives companies allowances that is, permits to emit greenhouse gases based on their past emissions, but set at lower levels than in the past (this is the ""cap"" part). Companies can then simply cut their emissions levels, or buy allowances from more efficient companies in order to let a less green firm keep spewing greenhouse gases (this is the ""trade""). They can also buy extra allowances at government auctions.\Another wrinkle: Firms running over their greenhouse-gas quotas can also buy ""offset credits,"" pouring money into fume-cutting companies or projects in the developing world in order to compensate for the firms' own excess polluting at home. (It's a bit like buying absolution.) The underlying premise is that it doesn't much matter whether emissions are cut in Cleveland or Beijing, just that they're reduced overall.\As time goes on, the government would give away fewer allowances and auction off more, creating a vast revenue stream (and, potentially, a huge pork barrel). By 2050, if all went according to plan, U.S. emissions would be 71 percent below their 2005 levels.\No one can say exactly how much the proposed system would cost consumers or industries. That might actually help its chances in Congress. It's a harder target to assail than a straightforward tax on carbon emissions an option favored by many economists but virtually no politicians.\Some sort of cap-and-trade system has a genuine shot; in large part because the partisan lines on climate change are blurred. All three remaining presidential candidates support the cap-and-trade approach. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., even co-sponsored two earlier versions with Lieberman, although both were defeated. Moreover, a lot of the country's leading industrialists, utility executives, technology pioneers and financiers are lining up to promote the Lieberman-Warner bill. And last week, President Bush, a longtime foe of cap-and-trade, said he might accept some kind of plan that covers utilities only.\But if a new U.S. political consensus is emerging about the need to do something about climate change, the major stumbling block to legislation is still its potential cost.\Any cap-and-trade system would raise the price of many common purchases, from plastic bottles to tanks of gas, by upping the cost of anything containing carbon. One U.S. government study says that Lieberman-Warner would add about 35 cents a gallon to gasoline prices in 2030 about the same amount that prices have risen in the past two white-knuckle months. The Energy Information Administration, the analysis wing of the Energy Department, estimates that the bill would mean the loss of 60,000 jobs by 2030, out of a total workforce of 170 million, since some energy-intensive businesses would relocate to countries that won't cap their greenhouse-gas levels.\On the other hand, environmentalists say that Lieberman-Warner could prove much cheaper than expected. Companies innovate when there's an economic incentive to do so, they argue, so good old-fashioned capitalist logic should drive them to find greener, cheaper ways to produce their products while spewing less carbon dioxide.\Too expensive?\If Big Coal has its way, the country will dismiss cap-and-trade as too expensive, because of both higher prices and lost jobs. (The mining industry pegs the overall cost of Lieberman-Warner at $5.3 trillion over 40 years.) So what's the alternative? Bush and the major coal companies argue that the United States should put money into research and development instead, in hopes of finding greener ways to run the economy and thereby cut emissions.\Ultimately, the cost of acting to cool the planet along either major route is not just a matter of accounting but one of politics and perspective. Climatologists have made real political headway in arguing that Earth's polluted, roiling atmosphere must be close to the top of the U.S. and global agenda. To them, the question isn't whether we can afford to do something to slow down climate change; it's whether we can afford not to.\Yet energy, green or otherwise, is an expensive business; the International Energy Agency says that the world will spend more than $20 trillion on energy projects over 25 years. And when you consider that the United States has just spent, depending on how you count it, anywhere from $1 trillion to $3 trillion on the Iraq war, perhaps it's not a question of what we can afford as much as what our priorities are.\***\Steven Mufson writes for The Washington Post."
54,"The Christie administration did not properly withdraw New Jersey from a multistate program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a state appellate panel ruled Tuesday.\But the ruling does not reinstate New Jersey into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\Instead, the panel ordered the state Department of Environmental Protection to formally repeal the regulations that secured membership in the program, often referred to as RGGI.\If there is no further appeal of the appellate decision, the DEP will have to set up a public comment period and hearing on the issue within 60 days.\""The court ruled that the public needs to be involved,"" said Susan Kraham, an attorney who argued against the state on behalf of two advocacy groups, Environment New Jersey and the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Neither Governor Christie nor the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection can simply repeal state laws by fiat.""\A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, which handled the case for the state, said the decision is under review and declined to comment further.\RGGI is a cap-and-trade program originally adopted by 10 Eastern states to cut greenhouse gas emissions like carbon. The program requires power companies like Public Service Enterprise Group to purchase credits through public auctions for every ton of carbon their plants emit while generating electricity.\The program has brought in almost $1.7 billion to the states from the sale of credits. New Jersey had earned $116 million before Christie pulled the state out at the end of 2011, and other states continue to reap tens of millions each year.\When Christie made the announcement, he acknowledged that climate change is real, that human activity contributes to the changes and that greenhouse gas emissions are increasing. But he said RGGI only caused higher electricity rates for New Jersey residents and businesses.\'Unfair tax'\""Our position hasn't changed; we believe it's an unfair tax on business,"" Larry Ragonese, a DEP spokesman, said Tuesday. ""We already have one of the cleanest power sectors in the country.""\New Jersey power plants cut their carbon-based emissions by 11 percent in 2012, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It was the second consecutive double-digit decline.\Many business groups supported the pullout, along with Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group that has waged much of the opposition in New Jersey and other states. AFP's national foundation is headed by and receives funding from billionaire David Koch, an owner of Koch Industries Inc., a private energy conglomerate that has refined oil for more than 70 years.\Neither Environment New Jersey nor the Natural Resources Defense Council challenged Christie's right to withdraw from RGGI. Instead, they contested the way he did it. But representatives of both organizations hope their victory will provide a groundswell of support for rejoining the program.\""This is an issue where the governor is clearly out of step with the public,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey. ""The governor's stance on this issue becomes harder and harder to justify.""\Credit: Email: fallon@northjersey.com"
55,"A day after President Obama called on Congress to pass cap and trade legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Republicans and Democrats on a key Senate committee argued over the merits of the latest research about global warming.\They sparred about whether science indicates carbon dioxide emissions are growing faster than predicted and the impact of global warming on America.\""Many of the latest findings suggest that the situation is more urgent than previous stated,"" Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said during a hearing Wednesday in Washington. ""The science makes it clear that we must not wait any longer to get started.""\Republicans on the committee, such as Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, argued that scientific thinking is constantly changing. He pointed to studies that indicate volcanic eruptions might be as much a factor as anything else. A national cap and trade program ""could be an outdated solution,"" Barrasso said.\A cap and trade program would create limits on industry emissions. Companies that reduce emissions could sell unused emission rights to those that exceed limits.\The Senate committee heard from a panel of scientists who summarized the latest research on global warming and its potential impact - including the rise in sea level that could affect New Jersey and other coastal states.\If greenhouse gases cause global temperature to rise by 2 degrees Celsius -- 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit -- the sea level could rise along the East Coast of the United States by as much as 4 or 5 feet, said Christopher Field, director of the department of global ecology at Stanford University. Extreme weather such as storms, flooding and heat waves would occur more frequently, the scientists said.\Oklahoma Sen. James M. Inhofe, the ranking Republican on the committee, dismissed those presentations as ""speculative computer model predictions"" about ""man's supposed effect on his climate.""\Inhofe said there was a ""growing body of scientific studies and scientists who are openly rebelling against the so-called 'consensus.' ""\William Happer, a physics professor at Princeton University who supervised the Department of Energy's work on climate change from 1990 to 1993, said the ""increase of CO2 is not a cause for alarm."" Carbon dioxide ""is not a pollutant and it is not a poison,"" Happer said. ""Our exhaled breath contains about 4 percent CO2, or about 100 times the current atmospheric concentration. CO2 is absolutely essential for life on earth.""\He said man's primate ancestors evolved when carbon dioxide levels were 1,000 parts per million - well above the current 380 parts per million.\When asked by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., if he disputed the consensus of scientists about the existence and impacts of global warming, Happer argued that ""consensus has often been wrong.""\Boxer said that if Congress doesn't act now to reduce global warming, ""people are going to die.""\***\E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com\***"
56,"New Jersey is dropping out of the nation's largest regional effort to reduce greenhouse gases in a move announced by Governor Christie on Thursday that was praised by business groups and criticized by environmental advocates.\Christie called the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative a ""failure"" and said it has been ineffective in battling global warming.\""RGGI has not changed behavior and it does not reduce emissions,"" Christie said at a news conference in Trenton.\""RGGI does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens, tax our businesses, with no discernable or measurable impact upon our environment,"" he said.\Christie's decision to withdraw by year's end comes after similar efforts in New Hampshire, Maine and Delaware were met with resistance in recent weeks. New Jersey is the first state to opt out of the program, and some environmentalists fear Christie's decision could provide momentum for other states to withdraw.\Executives at RGGI, however, said the program has ""widespread support across the region"" and would continue.\The move was applauded by business leaders who said RGGI, a cap-and-trade program, drives up energy rates because energy producers who are forced to buy credits for the carbon they emit pass that cost along to their customers.\""High energy costs, like taxes, just make New Jersey a tougher state in which to do business,"" said Philip Kirschner, president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association.\Federal environmental regulators on Thursday urged Christie to reconsider his decision. Brendan Gilfillan, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said the program helps reduce air pollution, promotes clean energy and creates jobs.\""This is a disappointing step given New Jersey's legacy of leadership on environmental issues,"" Gilfillan said. ""We hope the governor will reconsider.""\Environmentalists and some Democratic lawmakers blasted Christie, saying his move is short-sighted and that RGGI has produced tens of millions of dollars for New Jersey that the governor never used for clean energy grants as mandated by state law. Christie took $65 million from RGGI last year and used it to balance the budget.\""It's completely disingenuous,"" said Dale Bryk of the National Resources Defense Council.\Not all the money has gone to balance the budget. New Jersey has earned $102 million of the $860 million raised through RGGI auctions for the 10 states. The state has awarded $30 million, most of it in no-interest loans, to 12 large-scale projects intended to help businesses install solar panels and other renewable energy technology. The projects will generate enough electricity to meet the annual needs of more than 19,600 households and are projected to avoid 84,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, according to a report this year by RGGI.\The Sierra Club says the increase in electric rates is less than half of 1 percent of the average household bill.\""RGGI is a very modest proposal when it comes to dealing with climate change, but it is important because it was the first program to actually reduce greenhouse gases,"" said Jeff Tittel, head of the New Jersey Sierra Club.\Thursday's announcement was a victory for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group that has waged much of the opposition in New Jersey and other states.\""By pulling the plug on New Jersey's participation in the RGGI cap-and-trade scheme, Governor Christie has stood up for New Jersey's struggling taxpayers and sent a strong signal that New Jersey is, once again, open for business,"" said Steve Lonegan, AFP's state director and a former mayor of Bogota.\AFP's national foundation is headed by and receives funding from billionaire David Koch, an owner of Koch Industries Inc., a private energy conglomerate that has refined petroleum for more than 70 years. Lonegan said he doesn't take any money from Koch. But the foundation gave $2.7 million to 26 state chapters including New Jersey in 2009, according to its latest tax filing.\A withdrawal from a program viewed unfavorably by many Republicans could only help any presidential ambitions the governor may have. Christie has continually denied he wants to run for president in 2012 despite calls from many GOP power brokers.\After expressing skepticism at a town hall meeting in November, Christie said Thursday that he believes humans are contributing to climate change. He said New Jersey is committed to investing in renewable energy such as solar and wind power.\Christie said the state wouldn't let another coal-fired power plant be built, but said natural gas and an additional nuclear reactor will probably be part of the state's future energy mix. PSE & G wants to build another reactor at its facility in Salem County, where it already operates three. The state's fourth reactor -- Oyster Creek in Ocean County -- is set to close by 2019. A revised energy master plan may be released within a month, a Christie spokesman said Thursday.\""Part of our long-term plan will look to see whether additional nuclear units in the state make sense as well,"" Christie said.\The withdrawal from RGGI undoes one of former Gov. Jon Corzine's signature issues. Corzine signed on to RGGI in 2008 and even touted it at a 2007 European Union meeting in Portugal.\It was originally pushed by former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican.\This report contains material from The Associated Press.\Sidebar: \The back story\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a cap-and-trade program that New Jersey participates in with nine other Northeastern states with the goal to reduce carbon emissions 10 percent by 2018.\Former Gov.

The allowances are purchased through a periodic auction, and the rate fluctuates based on market conditions. Combined, the states have earned more than $860 million through the 11 auctions held so far. Of that, New Jersey earned $102 million.\Under state law, those revenues are supposed to be used for greenhouse gas emissions programs, such as those that promote energy efficiency, reduce electricity demand, and preserve forest and tidal marshes.

57,"""America's dirtiest power plants are the elephant in the room when it comes to global warming.""\Dan DeRosa, Environment New Jersey\A report by Environment New Jersey Research & Policy Center indicates that the state remains a leader in carbon pollution controls but has work to do to address emissions of its five dirtiest power plants, three of which are in Central Jersey.\They are Public Service Enterprise Group's Linden Generating Station, the Linden Cogeneration Plant and Red Oak Power in Sayreville, according to the report, titled ""America's Dirtiest Power Plants.""\The five dirtiest plants, which also include the Bergen Generating Station and Public Service's Hudson Generating Station, produce 35 percent of the state's carbon-fueled power but generate 65 percent of its carbon pollution, according to the report.\""America's dirtiest power plants are the elephant in the room when it comes to global warming,"" said Dan DeRosa, field organizer for Environment New Jersey. ""If we want a cleaner, safer future for our kids, we can't afford to ignore power plants' overwhelming contribution to global warming. For New Jersey and America, tackling the problem means cleaning up the dirtiest power plants.""\The report shows that New Jersey's power plants emit as much carbon pollution as 3.7 million cars. But that's less than the most carbon-polluting power plant in the nation, Georgia Power Co.'s Scherer plant, which emits as much as 4.4 million cars, the report said. America's power plants are its single-largest source of carbon pollution, responsible for 40 percent of emissions nationwide, DeRosa said.\During the introduction of the report on Tuesday in Jersey City, DeRosa was joined by Democratic gubernatorial candidate state Sen. Barbara Buono, D-N.J., and Carolyn Fefferman from the office of U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J. Both echoed the report's suggestion to Gov. Chris Christie to rejoin nine northeast states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which announced efforts to make deeper cuts in power plant carbon emissions this spring. Christie pulled out of the program in May 2011.\""Chris Christie claims he acted in the name of fiscal responsibility in pulling out of RGGI,"" Buono said, ""but the fact of the matter is that sustaining our environment and advancing our economy can go hand-in-hand. New Jersey should be leading the nation in efforts to reduce pollution.""\Buono's support of RGGI makes her no friend to New Jersey ratepayers, said Americans for Prosperity, a taxpayer watchdog group based in South Jersey and founded by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan.\Buono often has aligned with environmentalists across the state at the expense of taxpayers and ratepayers, said Daryn Iwicki, deputy state director of Americans for Prosperity.\""Hard-working families in New Jersey are suffocated enough by high taxes and high electric bills, yet Sen. Buono wants to pile on even more by reimposing the job-destroying RGGI electricity tax,"" Iwicki said. ""Cap-and-trade was dead and buried at the national level for a reason. Every economist worth their salt warned legislators on Capitol Hill that President (Barack) Obama's cap-and-trade scheme would kill jobs and damage our economy.""\While the state may be sitting on the sidelines of RGGI, ""America's Dirtiest Power Plants"" coincides with the Obama administration's new set of rules designed to tackle global warming, DeRosa said.\This summer, President Barack Obama directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to propose limits on carbon pollution from new and existing power plants. The EPA is expected to propose an updated rule on Sept. 20, DeRosa said. Americans have submitted 3.2 million public comments in support of limiting carbon pollution from power plants, he said.\""Millions of New Jerseyans have endured extreme weather causing extremely big problems for New Jersey's health, safety, environment and economy,"" DeRosa said. ""Given that global warming will likely fuel even more extreme weather, we need to cut dangerous carbon pollution now.""\Menendez agreed.\""We must support the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to combat global warming, including their work to develop carbon pollution limits for both new and existing plants,"" he said. ""We also should act legislatively to renew and improve incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency and put a price on carbon so polluters pay for the damage they cause to our environment.""\Staff Writer Bob Makin: 732-565-7319; bmakin@njpressmedia.com\""America's dirtiest power plants are the elephant in the room when it comes to global warming.""\Dan DeRosa, Environment New Jersey"

These jobs were a path to the middle class for the poor and immigrants.\The claim that we can't make clothing, consumer products or industrial equipment in the United States is false. We have the technology, or can quickly develop it, to make the products we use safely and efficiently without polluting our environment. The American worker just needs a fair chance. The imported goods we use every day are made in countries where these conditions do not exist. It won't be easy, but the longer we wait, the more difficult it will be to accomplish.\The area where we can't compete is in the quality of our government leadership. Ours is horrible. At our inception, the government was primarily funded by tariffs on foreign manufactured goods. That allowed us to develop our own industries and create jobs and wealth. Maybe we should return to that.\It could lead to the return of a strong middle class in America.

59,"Gov.

The program had been praised by Christie during his 2009 gubernatorial campaign.\The Republican governor hinted for months that the change was coming, prompting critics to label him a climate change skeptic, but Christie said he is committed to a strong environmental policy.\Christie also said he will roll out a new energy master plan soon that will include ""safe operation of nuclear plants"" as a key component.\RGGI -- a cap-and-trade program that places limits on overall greenhouse gas emissions and establishes a market of carbon credits that companies can purchase -- is being shelved because the credits ""were never expensive enough to change behavior as they were intended to and ultimately fuel different choices,"" Christie said.\""Given that we now have laws that provide significant market incentives for wind, solar, and instate natural gas generation, any benefits that the RGGI tax may have had are miniscule,"" he said. ""RGGI does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens, tax our businesses, with no discernable or measurable impact upon our environment.""\""The future for New Jersey is in green energy,"" Christie said. ""In the past I've always said climate change is real and it's impacting our state. There's undeniable data that CO2 levels and greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere are increasing. I've taken some time to better understand the role that humans play in global warming and what impact human activity has on our climate.""\The governor's decision drew immediate condemnation from environmental groups.\""I'm glad to hear the governor went to climate change school but he didn't learn his lessons,"" said David Pringle of the New Jersey Environmental Federation.\Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said Christie is trying to build his credibility with conservatives, most of whom have panned programs such as RGGI as ""cap-and-tax"" schemes.\""Christie is taking the side of corporate polluters and the coal industry over the environment and health of the people of New Jersey,"" Tittel said. ""As part of his attempt to become a national politician he would rather pander to the National Republican Party then do what is right for the people of New Jersey.""\A Democratic assemblyman agreed.\""Quite simply, this decision reeks of a governor desperate to boost his radical conservative credentials to distract from his failing policies,"" said Assemblyman John McKeon, D-Essex.\A Morris County Republican, Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll, called it a smart move.\""The tax and spend program run by a secretive private entity has nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with driving up energy prices,"" Carroll said. ""Instead, we should unshackle the nuclear industry, explore more domestic sources of energy, look to more hydropower, and, perhaps provide tax credits for energy efficient projects and vehicles.""\Christie said he wants to examine whether new nuclear plants ""make sense."" New Jersey is home to four nuclear generators, Oyster Creek in Lacey Township and Salem 1 and 2 and Hope Creek in Lower Alloways Creek where the Delaware River meets the bay.\""I still think nuclear has to play a role here,"" Christie said. ""I think the safe operation of nuclear plants has to play a role in our energy needs.""\RGGI initially won wide praise as a groundbreaking environmental project, but some called it a colossal hindrance to business development.\""RGGI's cap-and-trade provisions increase costs to New Jersey businesses and consumers who are already paying some of the highest electricity rates in the nation,"" said New Jersey Business and Industry Association President Philip Kirschner. ""New Jersey's participation in RGGI, however, has virtually no positive impact on the environment.""\Dale Bryk, director of the Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, questioned whether New Jersey will ultimately leave the program. She said a new poll of state residents show ""overwhelming"" support for RGGI.\""This is far from a foregone conclusion. The governor must complete a rigorous regulatory process before the deal is signed that requires him to listen to the concerns of his constituents and there's no guarantee. Gov.

60,"Two views on global warming\""Flooding near rivers is expected to worsen"" (Page A-1, July 29) is an embarrassing combination of scientific and historical inaccuracy and global warming alarmism. The Passaic and Hackensack river basins have been the scenes of flooding equal to or worse than the floods of 2007, 2005 and 1999 mentioned in the article. Severe floods occurred in 1810, 1865, 1878, 1882, 1896, 1902, 1903, 1936, 1945, 1955, 1961, 1969 (five times), 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1977. Clearly, the frequency of flooding now is no greater than it was in the past, especially the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\Northern New Jersey, particularly Bergen and Passaic counties, has been built up and ""paved over"" in the last 30 to 40 years, which has increased the run-off from storms. That can easily explain the one-inch increase over 50 years in waterway levels referred to in the article.\Also, to compare the costs of flood mediation and damage on a non-inflation adjusted basis is misleading. With a greater population and higher property values, the same flood in 2009 will certainly result in greater dollar cost. Finally, to quote studies that predict that ocean levels will rise two feet by 2100, using computer models that have failed to accurately predict temperatures (level or falling since 1998) and sea level rise (currently averaging one foot per century and flat since 2006), is irresponsible guesswork at best and unconscionable alarmism at worst.\The Record's readers deserve better than agenda-driven, poorly researched articles such as this.\Charles Lampert\Tenafly, July 30\*\I wasn't there when that giant step for mankind was taken, but on the 40th anniversary of the landing of Apollo 11 I am looking forward to our next step. As a 21-year-old student, I believe that next step is to stop global warming. This is my generation's cause. Baby steps will not resolve this issue.\With record-breaking heat in Texas and a mild summer in the Mid-Atlantic, Earth is sending us an urgent call for help. It is time for another giant step for mankind. I urge President Obama to lead the world this December at the International Climate Negotiations in Copenhagen.\Kennedy put a man on the moon. Obama can stop global warming.\Terrence De Jesus\Spotswood, July 30\***\Israel and Palestine\Regarding ""Israel won't suspend housing project"" (Page A-6, July 20):\What else can the international community expect? This is the same Israel that started two wars within two years of each other (the Lebanon war in 2006 and the Gaza war in 2008) and used every weapon it could muster.\It is the same country that has made of the Gaza Strip a big jail, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians are under siege from land, air and sea, and no Palestinian is allowed in or out unless the Israeli Army allows it.\It's the same country that (in the name of security) had established more than 657 concrete check-points in the occupied West Bank. These check-points are manned by Israeli soldiers. Palestinian teachers and students can't reach their schools, patients can't reach their hospitals (some Palestinian women deliver their babies at these check-points) and worshippers can't reach their mosques and churches.\It's the very same country that built an apartheid wall on confiscated fertile Palestinian lands in a scheme that was labeled racist and illegal by the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 2004. The court also ordered Israel to demolish the wall and compensate the Palestinians for all the horror that has befallen them as a result of its construction. Israel refused.\It's also the same country that established more than 220 colonial settlements on the occupied Palestinian land, against international law as spelled out in Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which explicitly prohibits the annexation of land consequent to the use of force, a principle restated in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter.\Hani Awadallah\Paterson, July 25\The writer is president of the Arab American Civic Organization.\***\Garfield Democrat and Christie\I write to you as a former mayor of Garfield and as a lifelong Democrat. I read your coverage recently concerning the endorsement of Christopher Christie by Councilwoman Tana Raymond (""Democrat gives Christie a foothold in Garfield,"" Page L-1, July 17). The article indicated that Raymond is a Democrat and a former chair of the Garfield Democratic Party. In the article, Raymond criticized the administration led by Governor Corzine for failing to provide sufficient economic support to Garfield and its residents.\I must take issue with two points. Raymond may be a registered Democrat, but she has always endorsed Republicans. In the past, she has endorsed a Republican candidate for county executive, a Republican candidate for the Assembly, a Republican candidate for state Senate and a Republican candidate for governor (Christie Whitman). Raymond was removed as chair of the local Democratic Party due to her constant and regular endorsement of Republicans.\Second, I take issue with the alleged lack of financial support from the state government in Trenton. During the last eight years under a Democratic governor, Garfield has received the following funding:\* Extraordinary aid of $4,110,000;\* Green acres grants of $3,890,000;\* NJ Department of Transportation funding for a riverfront walkway of $550,000.\And this past year, the Garfield School District received over $48 million in state aid. In fact, since 2004, the district has received in excess of $237 million. The facts speak for themselves. Corzine and the Democratic Legislature continue to deliver for Garfield.\James Krone\Garfield, July 21\***\Preserving Paterson's past\There were two uplifting articles in the July 27 edition of The Record: ""Barnert getting Jewish collection"" (Page L-1) and ""Ancient stone fits bill for vets honor"" (Page L-6).\Three men -- Jerry Nathans, Tony Vancheri and Anthony Sgobba -- seek to preserve parts of Paterson's past. Nathans is president of the city's Jewish Historical Society and custodian of a trove of 19th and 20th century Judaica and accounts of daily Jewish life in the city. Vancheri is president of the Paterson Veterans Council. He and Sgobba are working to install a new Korean War Monument to honor Patersonians of all creeds and colors who served during that conflict.\Yet there is a sad aspect to what these men are doing. One of Mr. Nathans' photos depicts the spray paint graffiti on the front of the former Ahavat Joseph Synagogue on Godwin Street. And Vancheri and Sgobba have found it necessary to replace a vandalized war monument. It had graffiti. The vandals tried, but failed, to steal the plaque on the monument.\James D. Storozuk\Fair Lawn, July 27\***\Corzine made the right decision\Governor Jon Corzine made the right choice in choosing Senator Loretta Weinberg as his running mate. As Lieutenant Governor, Loretta will deliver results for Bergen County and all of New Jersey.\Having worked with Loretta in the Legislature for over eight years, I have seen time and again her dedication to ethical leadership, passion for social justice and steadfast service to the residents of our state. Loretta's legislative legacy is ever-present in the quality of life we all enjoy. When a family sits down for a smoke-free meal at a restaurant, or when a mother and newborn child receive postnatal care in a hospital, or when our citizens are protected from drunk drivers and illegal handguns, credit is owed to Loretta. She has been a champion of providing property tax relief for senior citizens, affordable healthcare for working-class families, and quality education for children. Her presence in the Executive Branch of State Government will only strengthen her advocacy of these issues.\It does not take a political insider to know that Loretta and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye on every issue. She had the guts to stand up to party leadership and say publicly what many of us would only say privately. But through it all, I have never doubted Loretta's conviction or integrity. I am proud to call her my friend and, after Election Day, I'll be even prouder to call her Lieutenant Governor.\Paul A. Sarlo\Wood-Ridge, July 30\The writer is a senator serving the 36th District.\***\Gun rights in New Jersey\I agree with Bergen County Sheriff Leo McGuire that out-of-state gun owners should not have the right to carry concealed weapons in our state when citizens of New Jersey do not have the same right (""Dodging a bullet,"" Opinion, July 26). However, I disagree totally with him when he compares New Jersey's overpopulation with what he described as rural country locales.\Certainly one would not call Phoenix, Miami or Dallas rural locales; they far outnumber any of New Jersey's cities in population.\There are, I believe, 36 states that allow ""concealed carry"" -- Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Vermont and others.\Are the residents of those states smarter, less volatile, less hostile and more passive or more law abiding than the people of New Jersey? Are they having shootouts over traffic accidents and parking spaces? Are there gunfights in the middle of Main Street at sunup? I have not heard of any. Perhaps you can check your sources. On the contrary, police in those states feel more protected with citizens carrying guns. They feel they are a second line of defense to back them up.\I believe anyone who wishes to hold a concealed carry permit must first pass a training program (there are many schools in New Jersey). Don't just give a permit to anyone who wants one.\James Raymond\Clifton, July 26\***\Code enforcement cuts hurt citizens\Sharing services is supposed to save towns and taxpayers money. This is probably all well and good with equipment and some services, but not when it comes to code enforcement. Sharing local code enforcement services was tried in Bergen County and failed miserably. Know your history. Cutting code enforcement in any town will only cost the taxpayers.\How much does it cost to educate a child in your town? $10,000 to $20,000 per student? If you find just one illegal apartment that has two children in your school system, think of that as tax money saved.\You will suffer when code enforcement is reduced in your municipality. Why? Because people will know exactly what days your local code enforcement person is ""not in town"" and work will be done without getting the proper permits. Illegal apartments will be created that will cost you money when ineligible children go to your schools.\Illegal apartments and work on homes and businesses without proper permits and safety inspections put the owners, tenants and emergency personnel who respond to unsafe conditions all at risk.\I am asking all mayors and councils to think long and hard before combining or cutting back their code enforcement departments.\John Buonanno\Waldwick, July 23\The writer is president of Bergen Passaic Municipal Inspectors Association.\***\'Cap and trade' is harmful\When it comes to basic economics, I trust The Wall Street Journal over New Jersey's own ""Wall Street Wizard"" every time.\Predictions made by Governor Corzine before a U.S. Senate committee on July 21 that the ""cap and trade"" strategy being promoted by Democrats as an answer to global warming (a condition some scientists still dispute) will create ""green"" jobs and stimulate the economy is a gross exaggeration that is not supported by the facts.\The bill passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate that would ""cap"" greenhouse gases and give electric utilities the ability to ""trade"" (buy and sell) emission permits would obliterate more jobs than it would create. That was the conclusion of an analysis by the Journal. Why would it cause so much harm? Because the bill ""defies the laws of economics.""\The end product will be the biggest federal tax in American history. The Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank, projects the cost to an average family of four as $1,870 by 2020 and $6,800 by 2035. In contrast, a Congressional Budget Office report ludicrously claims the cost to the average household would be only $175 by 2020.\What Corzine and his fellow Democrats conveniently ignore is the fact that the price of the emission permits established by ""cap and trade"" would be enormous and passed on to consumers in the form of higher electric and gas bills. It would also force the price of all manufactured goods to rise. Consumers would cut back on spending, which would trigger a cutback in production, resulting in a cutback in jobs. The cycle ends with higher unemployment and a tempting incentive for companies to move their operations - and jobs - overseas.\Alex DeCroce\Whippany, July 28\The writer is Assembly Republican Leader.\***\Cutting officers would be wrong\Regarding ""44 sheriff's officers could lose jobs"" (Page L-1, July 26):\The state Department of Personnel's order to the Bergen County Sheriff's Department is absurd. Transferring sheriff's officers from the county jail to the county courthouse has been a longstanding practice within sheriff's departments in New Jersey.\Why is Bergen County being singled out, with the possibility of officers losing their jobs one to two years after the alleged rules infraction? If necessary, the state should have intervened when the transfers occurred, not now.\If this order stands, it could possibly put 44 officers out of work, only to hire 44 new officers to replace them. This is not a financial decision, it is a bureaucratic decision that could possibly affect the lives of 44 families, and it is wrong.\Leonard Curcio\Hasbrouck Heights, July 28\***\Reserve needs more transparency\It's generally accepted that chronic increase in the money supply leads to loss of value of the currency, decreased investment, higher interest rates, higher inflation, and a decrease in economic activity. However, the Fed has greatly expanded the nation's debt and money supply itself through the repurchase of federal debt, through the banking system and through federal guarantees to entities, public, private, and newly defined. But Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke doesn't foresee financial problems.\He stated recently that ""...the extraordinary policy measures...can be withdrawn in a smooth...manner, thereby avoiding the risk that policy stimulus could lead to a future rise in inflation"" (""Bernanke believes Fed can handle role of cop,"" Page B-4, July 22). Does Bernanke know something the rest of the economists don't know?\Let's look at the beneficiaries of the largesse of the Fed. Goldman Sachs received $10 million in TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) money in 2008 to carry it through tough financial straits. Goldman issued FDIC-backed debt under the TLGP (Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program), which enabled Goldman to generate $3.44 billion in profits in the second quarter of this year by making markets for customers at a time when rivals were scaling back.\Was the policy of the Fed a success, or was there an immediate benefit for those banking and investment houses with close ties to the Fed while the true costs are still in the line?\As the economist George Reisman stated: ""When the government need not obtain its funds from the people, but instead can supply the people with funds, it can no longer easily be viewed as deriving its powers and rights from the people.""\It's time for Congress to pass HR 1207, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act.\Thomas MacDonnell\Washington Township, July 23\***\N.J. politics in the gutter\In the gutter, politics disgrace us.\Over the course of 10 years, the U.S. Attorney's Office conducted a sweeping investigation of systemic corruption that resulted, I believe, in the federal arrests of extremely arrogant, recklessly dangerous, utterly disgusting and morally reprehensible elected public officials. The old adage holds true: Birds of a feather stick together.\This is certainly not what the sacrificial, visionary and dignified Founders had in mind.\Kathy Ann Callahan\Closter, July 23\*\Regarding ""Builders call the shots"" (Page A-1, July 26):\Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph Marra came out with the quote of the year. He dubbed our latest corruption scandal an ""ethics-free zone."" In honor of this quote, I suggest New Jersey create two new political parties to compete with our existing system.\The first new party shall be named the New Jersey Demorats, who work relentlessly to give developers everything and anything they ask or don't ask for, a few times even without being bribed. The other new party shall be called the New Jersey Republican'ts, who, in spite of trying to win against the most corrupt party in the history of the state, can hardly ever manage a victory. These two new groups can more effectively represent our sad state of affairs and, of course, more easily identify us to the outside world.\Peter W. Kruimer\Harrington Park, July 26\*\Certain groups in our society tell us that the reason that we cannot post the Ten Commandments on our public buildings is that there must be a separation of church and state.

64," Environmentalists won a major round in the battle over the nation's skies Wednesday, but New Jersey officials remain worried about Bush administration policies they believe will allow industries to continue polluting for years to come.\ President Bush's environmental agenda suffered a severe setback when the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee rejected his Clear Skies bill. The committee deadlocked, 9-9, on the measure, which would have given power plants and refineries more time to reduce their smokestack emissions.\ ""Clear Skies would have been very bad news for New Jersey,"" said Samuel Wolfe, assistant commissioner for environmental regulation at the state Department of Environmental Protection.\ The stalling of the Clear Skies legislation, however, won't end the running philosophical war over the best strategy to reduce smokestack pollution. The EPA is about to introduce new rules that will mimic some of the provisions contained in Clear Skies, setting emission reduction standards that New Jersey officials and environmentalists say are too lenient.\ New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg was among the nine senators to vote against the measure, saying he thought it might dilute protections offered under the 35-year-old Clean Air Act and weaken the state's ability to sue out-of-state polluters.\ ""Taking away a state's rights to protect the health of its citizens is something I cannot support,"" said Lautenberg, referring to a provision requiring states to wait years to see if new pollution targets are met before filing suit to force improvements to industries outside their borders.\ New Jersey considers litigation an important leverage tool against out-of-state polluters. Currently, the state is involved in lawsuits against four power plants and has filed two other suits against the federal government, seeking to have carbon dioxide regulated as a pollutant and contesting the EPA's revision of a rule that requires modern pollution controls be installed when plants upgrade.\ On Wednesday afternoon, industry groups said they were holding out hope that the Clear Skies bill will resurface, either by being proposed directly to the full Senate or being attached to the energy bill the administration is crafting. ""To quote Mark Twain, reports of its death are greatly exaggerated,"" said Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council.\ Meanwhile, the cheers over the bill's rejection were muted in New Jersey, because state officials and environmental groups are concerned about proposed regulations the EPA will announce today on emissions of smog and acid rain. The EPA is also set to announce regulations on airborne mercury Tuesday.\ State officials say those rules will not be tough enough on out- of-state power plants and industries that emit pollution that travels hundreds of miles before settling over New Jersey, choking the air and poisoning the fish.\ The proposed regulations, which won't have the weight of law that Clear Skies could have had, will set emissions reductions goals that are smaller and take longer to achieve than what New Jersey officials and environmental groups have sought.\ The first regulation, called the Clean Air Interstate Rule, will set stricter caps on emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Although not as fiercely criticized as the Clear Skies bill and the upcoming caps on mercury emissions, the SO2 and NOx rule will not do enough to help New Jersey meet federal deadlines to reduce ozone pollution, Wolfe said.\ The EPA is expected to propose phasing in reductions over the next 10 years, Wolfe said, while New Jersey is facing a five-year deadline to meet federal ozone standards.\ The penalty of not meeting those standards could be the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal highway funds.\ ""But it's not just that the reductions come too late, they are also far too little,"" said Wolfe, noting the proposed rule wouldn't cut enough emissions from power plants and factories in other states, which New Jersey blames for one-third of its air pollution.\ Without stronger federal measures to curtail out-of-state pollution, New Jersey will have to force its power plants, factories and refineries to employ ""less cost-effective emissions reductions"" that could place New Jersey's businesses at a ""competitive disadvantage with other states,"" Wolfe said.\ An even bigger uproar awaits on Tuesday, when the EPA is expected to announce its plan to curb smokestack emissions of mercury, a pollutant that rains down on rivers and streams. New Jersey waters are so contaminated by mercury that there are health advisories in place, warning pregnant women and young children against consuming fish caught locally because mercury levels are high enough to cause neurological damage and developmental delays.\ Two competing strategies for regulating mercury are being considered.\ The Bush administration has stated a preference for curbing mercury pollution through a so-called cap-and-trade program that sets an overall goal of reducing all emissions by 70 percent. Under such a scenario, plants that emit less mercury than allowed could sell those ""pollution credits"" to other plants that choose not to install costly smokestack controls. The administration has argued that such a strategy will clean the air faster because industry will be less likely to shrug off an incentive-fueled program.\ But New Jersey advocates prefer the other strategy of requiring all smokestacks to employ technology to curb mercury emissions, saying it will avoid having ""hotspots"" of contaminated lakes and streams near plants that opt out of the improvements.\ In addition to the hoots from environmentalists, the methodology being used to compare the two mercury strategies was criticized this week by the General Accounting Office for putting too-good of a spin on the cap-and-trade scenario.\ Industry groups, however, say that environmentalists are exaggerating the improvements that could be achieved through current technologies.\ ""Environmentalists like to portray this as if it's a rollback,"" said Frank Maisano, a spokesman for the electric reliability council. ""But they forget to mention that mercury is not regulated at all today and this is proposing a 70 percent reduction. Seventy percent is a lot.""\ * * *\ Next on the agenda\ Clear Skies has been rejected, but there are more air pollution battles ahead:\ * Today, the EPA will announce proposed new curbs on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that critics say will fall short of what's needed.\ * Next week, the EPA will announce its first-ever regulations on mercury emissions from smokestacks. Environmentalists have promised to sue to block their implementation if the administration uses a controversial strategy that allows some industries to buy and sell pollution credits.\ * New Jersey is involved in lawsuits with four out-of-state plants it accuses of polluting the state's skies.\ * New Jersey is suing the EPA over changes to a rule requiring industry to install modern pollution controls when upgrading plants.\ * New Jersey is also suing five industries that are the leading emitters of carbon dioxide, seeking a court ruling that would treat CO emissions - believed to contribute to global warming - as a pollutant, something the Bush administration opposes.\ * * *\ E-mail: diskin@northjersey.com"

66," A plan to combat global warming in New Jersey could end up subsidizing power plants that put more greenhouse gases into the air, environmental groups complained on Thursday.\ The legislation has been rewritten to allow power plants to get anti-warming funding and to remove a requirement that recipients prove they would cut greenhouse emissions, environmentalists said during a Trenton news conference.\ It's a giveaway to power companies and one of the many reasons the groups said they no longer support New Jersey's first serious effort to crack down on heat-trapping pollution.\ ""How do you get money to reduce greenhouse gases when you're becoming a new source of greenhouse gases?"" asked Jeff Tittel, director of the state Sierra Club. ""This bill is not about the environment anymore; it's about lobbying and special interests.""\ A spokesman for one of the electric producers that could benefit, however, said developing more efficient power plants that replace older, more polluting versions could help in the climate fight.\ ""We're already short on electricity production in New Jersey, and until we build more of it at the lowest greenhouse intensity, we're just going to extend the life of coal plants outside of New Jersey,"" said Matthew Held, a spokesman for New Brunswick-based LS Power Inc.\ The so-called ""cap and trade"" bill (S2976) would allow New Jersey to join nine other Northeastern states seeking to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants.\ The program would limit overall emissions and require companies to buy ""allowances"" for each ton of carbon they emit. Utilities that cut pollution could sell allowances to companies that need to emit more, creating a financial incentive to clean up, the theory goes.\ The program would cut emissions 10 percent by 2019 and do nothing about vehicles or other major greenhouse sources, but supporters see it as a first step that could encourage the federal government to start a national effort.\ But those goals could be jeopardized by the state legislatures' attempt to rewrite the program, environmentalists said.\ The allowance trading system is expected to generate $40 million a year or more for anti-warming efforts by the state.\ But instead of dedicating that money to energy efficiency and renewable energy, the legislation would now allow it to go toward new ""state of the art"" power plants. And unlike other potential recipients of the funding, the plants would no longer have to show that they'd lead to a ""measurable reduction"" in carbon pollution or energy use.\ The change was pushed by state Sen. Stephen Sweeney, the Senate majority leader from Gloucester County, and written to benefit a gas- fired plant proposed in his district by LS Power, Tittel said. Critics said it could also give a green light to fund other coal or gas-fired plants, though they're among the highest carbon emitters.\ Efforts to reach Sweeney were unsuccessful. Held, the LS Power spokesman, said he knew nothing about the new provision in the bill, though he said ""cleaner burning"" power plants deserved more state support.\ Activists had more criticism for Governor Corzine and state legislators, who have promised to make New Jersey an international leader in tackling climate change.\ The Legislature has yet to move on two bills to make new buildings and appliances more energy efficient, they noted. And the Energy Master Plan being developed by the Corzine administration is likely to encourage more nuclear power instead of relying on conservation, solar and wind, they said.\ ""The governor in particular has said a lot about giving New Jersey a better energy future, and the policies that would realize that vision just haven't moved forward,"" said Dena Mottola Jaborska of the group Environment New Jersey.\ ""We haven't seen enough leadership from the Governor's Office and we haven't seen enough leadership from the Legislature.""\ Corzine on Thursday threatened to sue the federal government over its decision to bar New Jersey and 16 other states from adopting new emissions limits for automobiles. But Tittel wasn't impressed.\ ""It's easy to sue the Bush administration,"" he said. ""What counts is what you do here at home.""\ In a statement, a Corzine spokeswoman didn't address the cap and trade bill but cited other environmental efforts, such as lawsuits against out-of-state power plants, upgraded drinking water standards and increased parks funding.\ ""Rhetoric and condemnation don't move us forward,"" Lilo Stainton said. ""Environmentalists need to be realistic about the scope of the problems we face and the successes we've had.""\ Lisa Jackson, Corzine's environmental protection commissioner, testified in support of the bill in recent weeks but was noncommittal when asked about the latest version.\ ""We're in the middle of the legislative process, and that process means that nothing is done until the process is over,"" she said.\ The bill has also taken fire from some of the state's top businesses, who worry about provisions that would let electric companies raise their rates even if they conserve more energy in the future.\ ""In its current form, the bill remains a colossal consumer rip- off,"" said Steven Goldenberg, an attorney for several pharmaceutical companies and other large energy-users ""The utilities are attempting to use the Legislature to obtain significant financial perks and competitive advantages that are denied them under current law.""\ The measure is expected to come up for a vote before the current session ends on Jan. 8.\ *\ What it means\ What's new: Environmental groups in New Jersey withdrew their support for legislation to cut greenhouse emissions from power plants, saying it had been watered down.\ What's next: The state Senate and Assembly could take final votes by Jan. 8.\ *\ E-mail: nussbaum@northjersey.com"
67,"PSE&G's Bergen Generating Station in Ridgefield releases more greenhouse gases into the air each year than any other large industrial source in New Jersey, according to a new federal report.\The Environmental Protection Agency's report is the first-ever list of how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases are released by large industrial sites and landfills nationwide. There are 98 such facilities in New Jersey, which release a combined 26.2 million metric tons of gases each year.\The Bergen power plant topped the list, emitting 2.6 million metric tons per year.\That equates to the same annual emissions from more than 500,000 passenger vehicles. It would take a pine forest covering nearly 850 square miles to capture all that carbon each year - an area as large as Bergen, Passaic and Morris counties combined.\The new data are available to the public on the EPA website. The data, self-reported by more than 6,700 facilities nationwide, ""provides a critical tool for businesses and other innovators to find cost- and fuel-saving efficiencies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and foster technologies to protect public health and the environment,"" said Gina McCarthy, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation.\Largest sources\In New Jersey and nationwide, power plants were the largest stationary sources of direct emissions, with 2.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions, followed by petroleum refineries, with 183 million metric tons.\Carbon dioxide accounted for 95 percent of all emissions nationwide, followed by methane at 4 percent.\""This data should be eye-opening for the people of New Jersey showing how much pollution is being spewed each year,"" said the New Jersey Sierra Club's Jeff Tittel.\The EPA data include information on nine industry groups, from power plants and landfills to chemical, paper and metals manufacturers. The EPA will require 12 additional industries to start reporting emissions in 2012. The data do not capture all emissions -- only facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons per year must file.\The list includes some of New Jersey's most well-known entities, from pharmaceutical companies and petroleum refineries to the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Newark (56,500 metric tons) and the Mars chocolate factory in Hackettstown (37,363 metric tons).\In North Jersey, seven facilities made the list, including two power plants and two Meadowlands Commission landfills in North Arlington. Landfills emit greenhouse gases as the garbage breaks down beneath the soil cap. The 1-E Landfill released more than 70,000 metric tons of gases and the Kingsland Landfill emitted 24,000 metric tons.\The two power plants - PSE&G's Bergen and Jersey City facilities -- emitted nearly 5 million metric tons of gases combined.\Environmentalists used the release of the new data to again hammer at Governor Christie's decision last year to remove New Jersey from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, a multi-state consortium that uses a cap-and-trade program to force power plants in those states to reduce their carbon emissions.\Christie's view\Christie ""would rather appease the right wing and the polluters instead of looking out for the best interest of New Jersey and our future,"" Tittel said, arguing that a coastal state such as New Jersey should be in the lead on combating greenhouse gas emissions, since scientists predict that carbon emissions will raise global temperatures, melt polar ice caps, raise sea levels and inundate low-lying coastal areas.\Christie had called the cap-and-trade program, which requires power plants to buy credits for each ton of carbon they emit, a ""failure.""\The Legislature tried to force Christie to keep New Jersey in the program, but he vetoed a bill to that effect last August. In his veto message, Christie acknowledged ""that the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere are increasing, that climate change is real, that human activity plays a role in these changes and that these changes are impacting our state."" But, he added, ""I simply disagree that RGGI is an effective mechanism for addressing global warming.""\He said the program did not change energy producers' behavior. Instead, he said, ""RGGI does nothing more than impose a tax on electricity.""\Credit: Email: oneillj@northjersey.com"
68,"President Obama is expected to unveil an unprecedented plan on Monday to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's coal- and gas-burning power plants -- many of whose provisions are already in effect in New Jersey.\The state, which already has one of the nation's cleanest fleets of power-generating plants, is not expected to face a major challenge meeting whatever emissions cuts are in it, environmental and business representatives predicted.\""We've felt comfortable all along with this, because New Jersey is one of the cleanest power sectors in the country,"" said Bob Marshall, the state Department of Environmental Protection's assistant commissioner for sustainability and green energy. ""We're already way ahead of most other states.""\Sara Bluhm, the vice president for energy and environment of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, agreed. ""Our electric-generation sector is in good shape to deal with any new emissions rules involving coal,"" she said.\At the same time, as a coastal state that is already feeling the impact of climate change -- from sea-level rise to more-intense storms -- New Jersey would benefit from efforts to reduce the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.\""The cost of climate disruption in New Jersey is expected to be extremely high,"" said Thomas Schuster, the Sierra Club's ""Beyond Coal"" campaign representative for the region. ""So it's a major step forward to start holding power companies accountable for the pollution that causes those damaging effects of climate change.\""Currently there are no controls on climate-disrupting pollution, so this rule is historic,"" Schuster said of the president's plan.\That plan, developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to give states flexibility in how they achieve the cuts in emissions, using such tools as energy-efficiency programs, greater reliance on renewable-energy sources like solar and wind power, and cap-and-trade programs that rely on market forces to encourage emissions reductions.\New Jersey is already investing in energy-efficiency programs, it ranks third in the country in solar generation, and it participated in -- though it later dropped out of -- a cap-and-trade program.\In 2007, through the Global Warming Response Act, New Jersey adopted statewide limits on greenhouse gas emissions from all sources. The act committed the state to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and 80 percent below 2006 levels by 2050.\The state has already dipped below the 1990 levels.\Electric generation accounts for nearly a quarter of the emissions. Transportation accounts for nearly half.\Carbon pollution, rather than affecting air quality directly, works like a blanket to trap heat in the atmosphere and prevent its escape. The trapped heat raises air and ocean temperatures, which melt polar ice, raising sea levels. More energy in the atmosphere can also produce more intense storms.\In New Jersey, sea levels have risen along the coast about a foot and a half over the past century and are expected to rise another foot by 2050.\New Jersey's mix of electric plants is useful when facing carbon emissions cuts. Half of its electric generation comes from nuclear plants, which do not emit carbon. And there has also been a shift from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas.\Governor Christie has said he won't allow new coal-fired power plants in the state, and has promoted more use of natural gas.\New combined-cycle natural-gas-fired plants are 75 percent more efficient than coal, the DEP's Marshall said, meaning fewer carbon emissions.\Several new combined-cycle gas-burning plants are in the works in West Deptford, Woodbridge and Newark.\In addition, about 3,700 megawatts of power produced in New Jersey by older, high-emission gas- and oil-burning units, used when demand peaks, will be retired by next year.\New Jersey's electric power industry cut carbon emissions by 27 percent between 2005 and 2012.\Other states that rely more heavily on coal-burning plants may have a harder time meeting the new carbon emissions requirements.\Nationwide, the 1,587 power plants monitored by the EPA emitted more than 2 billion metric tons of carbon in 2012. New Jersey's 44 plants emitted less than 1 percent of that -- 15 million metric tons.\New Jersey's 44 plants emit less carbon combined than several of the worst-polluting plants do individually.\The biggest carbon polluter in New Jersey is PSEG Power's Bergen Generating Station in Ridgefield, a natural gas-fired plant that released 2.5 million metric tons in 2012.\The power industry says there is currently no commercially viable technology to capture carbon emissions from power plants. Instead, emissions reductions would come from an array of actions, such as using natural gas plants more and coal plants less, using more solar and wind power, and financing projects that reduce demand for electricity, such as more energy-efficient buildings and appliances.\Another tool that states might use to reduce emissions is a cap-and-trade program. New Jersey participated in such a program with other Northeast states for several years.\The program, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, could be a model for other states. RGGI requires power companies in the participating states to buy credits for each ton of carbon they emit. Each year, the emissions cap gets tighter, and fewer credits are available, driving up their price. Power suppliers have to decide whether it's more economical for them to keep buying the credits or to reduce emissions by switching to cleaner-burning fuel or more efficient facilities.\""You leave it up to the market how you're going to get the emissions reductions,"" said Peter Shattuck, director of market initiatives with Environment Northeast, an environmental advocacy group.\The credits are sold through public auctions, and the states use the revenue to pay for programs that promote renewable energy and reduce electric demand by making buildings, lights and appliances more energy efficient.\New Jersey already has the sixth-most-expensive electricity in the country, and Christie pulled out of RGGI in part because he said it raised those costs even more without getting power plants to reduce emissions. He argued the emissions caps were too lax to make a difference. Since then, the RGGI states have ratcheted down their emission caps an additional 45 percent.\The power plants in RGGI states cut carbon emissions by 40 percent between 2005 and 2012, but it's hard to say how much was directly linked to the RGGI program.\Energy efficiency programs are the main recipients of the revenue that RGGI states earn from the sale of carbon credits.\New Jersey's energy efficiency programs are paid for with revenue from a societal-benefits charge added to gas and electric bills. Through the programs, some companies have retrofitted their buildings, and others are becoming more resilient to storm disruption by investing in on-site power generation.\""It's a good bang for the buck,"" said Bluhm. She said every dollar spent this way results in $11 saved in energy costs and regulatory compliance.\""We are encouraging the state to invest even more in these programs,"" she said.\Credit: Email: oneillj@northjersey.com Twitter: @JamesMONeill1"

Speaking in the most general terms this country's political parties have each taken up one side in the climate debate; with Democrats typically in favor of policies to reduce emissions and incentivize renewable forms of energy to mitigate climate change, while Republicans typically arguing that these policies just add more taxes and hurt the economy. Underlying this is the basic assumption that Democrats believe climate change is really happening, is a real threat, and the science behind it is undisputable. Conversely the perception is that Republicans think man made climate change is all a bunch of hogwash and either can't be proved or is completely debatable at this point that there is no reason to act.
\
Whether or not all Republicans politicians and elected officials believe this, well only they know that, but when they say these things, with the aim of growing support from their conservative base, we can only take their comments on face value.
\
However not all Republicans are of this opinion, in fact several very prominent figures in that party have acknowledged that man made climate change is real, or at least the science seems to add up, and its a real problem. Among those are our own governor; Chris Christie, and also former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, who is angling for the GOP Presidential nomination in 2012.
\
In the case of the always controversial Christie, he has an interesting track record in this area. He has come out saying that human activity is impacting the climate and that this isn't a good thing, he has show strong support of developing offshore wind energy in New Jersey, as well as continue other progressive energy policies in the state. However he has also pulled New Jersey out of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (also known as RGGI). The Governor stated when withdrawing NJ from its commitments to RGGI that it was still important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to the potential impacts of climate change. He followed up by saying he simply did not feel the benefits of RGGI and its emissions reduction goals outweighed the economic impacts it would have on businesses and residents of NJ through higher energy rates.
\
Christie was slammed by many environmentalists for withdrawing from RGGI, and many thought it was a clear sign that despite some things he may say about climate science, he either really doesn't believe them or that he is putting big business ahead of the environment. Judging from Christie's track record thus far, perhaps he is simply taking an approach that we aren't used to. If Democrats are typically strongly in favor of policies based on doom and gloom climate forecasts, and Republicans typically act like nothing is happen at all with the climate, maybe Christie represents the middle of the road in policy towards climate change and our energy portfolio's role in it?
\
Christie backed out of RGGI, a cap a trade system. Cap and trade is often criticized as a shell game when it comes to reducing emissions and developing a clear climate policy. Where are funds going? Is there a clear benefit? Are emissions reductions in one sector simply covering up emissions from another? There are certainly legitimate questions and criticisms when it comes to cap and trade, not to mention how effective really is a regional cap and trade system when state a few hundred miles away can pollute all they want? Leaving RGGI might not have been Christie displaying a lack of concern on climate policy, but simply a lack of confidence in the ability of RGGI to substantially achieve anything.
\
Meanwhile NJ remains strongly behind the offshore wind industry, such that it is very likely that the first offshore wind farm in the U.S. will be in NJ waters within the next two years. Many conservatives, especially those in the Tea Party movement have blasted offshore wind as a scam that is only viable with heavy government subsidy coming from your tax dollars. Christie it would seem thinks differently; realizing the ACTUAL reduction in fossil fuel that can come from offshore wind energy and the potential boom in manufacturing jobs that could by positioning NJ as the hub of this industry.
\
Christie might be demonstrating that he is going to just ignore what scientists are telling us about climate change, but maybe he is just not ready to tie us down to every policy out there to reduce emissions. He wants to pick winners and losers when it comes to the solutions, winners that are not just good for the environment, but also good the economy.
\
Being our current governor, it is easier to make inferences about Christie than it is about current Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman. However Huntsman has made news recently that everyone wants to point out as him flip flopping or backtracking on climate policy. So while many want to point to this as him changing stance to fit the whims of the broader Republican base (and that's probably true), I would not say it is as cut and dry as many make it out to be.
\
Previously Huntsman has said he trusts scientists when it comes to global warming (or climate change, whichever you prefer at this point). However as reported by many national sources including Time and The Atlantic he came back with the following statement while speaking before a conservative group on December 6th;
\
""I don't know - I'm not a scientist, nor am I a physicist. But I would defer to science in that discussion. And I would say that the scientific community owes us more in terms of a better description or explanation about what might lie beneath all of this. But there's not enough information right now to be able to formulate policies in terms of addressing it overall.""
\
I guess some see that as backtracking, but to me its saying what anyone with a moderate stance on climate policy would say; that they aren't a scientist, so making sense of all the various data sources and models isn't something they are qualified to do. And furthermore, that there are lots of conflicting models and data sets. So maybe, just maybe, it not as cut and dry to make incredibly sweeping policy points on climate change right now.
\
Detractors would claim his comments have the unabashed climate denier / anti-science slant to them. But that's not what I make of it. I don't think Huntsman is flat out saying we aren't sure of the science of climate change, because yes we are pretty sure on that. What it looks like he is saying is that nobody is sure just to what extent our actions are impacting the climate and what amount of change will actually occur.
\
To me this sounds like a very reasonable position. Now that does not mean you sit on your hands if you are in a position to make policy, which Huntsman clearly wants to be when Inauguration Day 2013 rolls around. But I would think, or at least hope, that he is taking much the same approach that Christie has in NJ. That there are some policies related to climate change that we should move on, such as creating a clean energy industry and economy. And there are also other policies that mitigate climate change, but also can slow economic growth, and maybe we shouldn't be so willing to jump into those yet.

Polls right now show that it's unlikely that Huntsman will be the nominee come campaign season next year, so in some ways there isn't a big need to pick apart his comments. And I really haven't formulated an opinion on him one way or the other. However when you see Republicans like Christie and Huntsman get blasted as being a typical conservative burying their head in the sand, it's not as simple as them just being conservative deniers. There are some in the middle of the road on climate policy, and that's actually a good thing.
"
70,"A letter to the editor criticizing Gov. Chris Christie for remarks expressing skepticism about humans being responsible for global warming spurred a heated debate on the topic among our on-line readers. In part, the letter read, ""Science had no interest in defending itself against those who can't grasp its complexities. It is not subject to the interminable, meaningless yammering that now defines religion, sports, politics, entertainment and fashion. Personal opinions don't count.\""Intellectually challenged public personalities undermine science and jeopardize America's future when they blame their own ignorance on some fabricated inability of the scientific community to provide answers appropriate to their simplistic capabilities.""\Here's a sample of the responses to the letter:\appalled:The Earth's climate goes through natural cycles about every 12,000 to 15,000 years. And as history has a very bad habit of repeating itself, the last Ice Age ended about 12,000 years ago, which means we are beginning a new cycle. Very simple if you had paid attention in school.\jeolsz:The proof is out there. All one needs to do is Google reputable scientific sites such as National Geographic, NOAA and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to read about it. Thousands of scientists in more than 100 countries have done research and conclude that manmade global warming is a fact. Why is it so difficult to believe this to be true? Why do people continue to deny the facts? Facts don't cease to exist because they are ignored.\mcovey36: What peers reviewed the IPCC report? Additionally, there are\now more than 700 scientists who were originally of the belief that manmade global warming was occurring that have now changed their professional opinion. I say opinion because that is what both sides of the debate have. It is not proven that something that is 0.0318 percent of the atmosphere causes or will cause the Earth to warm an average of 3 to 6 degrees fahrenheit in the next 100 years. Water vapor has more of a warming effect than anything else in the atmosphere. Should we all stop taking showers or washing our cars?\Everydayguy:Billions of dollars, dozens of satellites and countless global agencies are devoted to studying short-term global weather patterns, and what we get for the investment are imperfect predictions about the weather today. Global warming involves the convergence of variables, some known, some assumed and some probably as yet unimagined -- a long-term, complex problem that is difficult to model. Knowing full well by daily example the unpredictability of complex systems like short-term weather, it amazes me that people are willing to claim with certainty they know the cause of global warming. The only reasonable position on\global warming is that we are all guessing. If nobody knows for certain, how can\Christie be wrong? If you think you know all the answers on global warming, you are ignorant.\OrdinaryAverageGuy:The governor admits he is not a scientist, has done no independent research on the subject and does not understand the conflicting data. So, he offered no endorsement, and said he remained skeptical. The scientific methods employed by scientists are based on skepticism. One should be skeptical until the evidence is conclusive. Christie, along with many scientists, remains skeptical.\voteforanewboard: I believe these were calculated remarks. Gov. Chrispie\Creme is setting himself up to run for president. The same conservative blue-collar Republicans who think our country would benefit by extending the Bush tax cuts to people making more than $250,000 eat this type of talk up. It never ceases to amaze me how the Republicans can talk about conservative social values to get these uneducated voters to vote against their own self-interest.\ForestLaw:I would like to remind the letter writer that Al Gore, hero to the\far left and narrator of the propaganda film ""An Inconvenient Truth"" -- essentially an hour and a half of Gore doing his best Chicken Little impersonation -- is also not a scientist and lacks the credibility to be taken seriously on environmental issues. Global warming skepticism continues because of insufficient evidence and\hacks like Gore.\mamsita:I believe the science. Global warming is real. Let's just say for a\second that it is unclear if it is manmade or not (though I believe it is): I would still support efforts to reverse the devastating effects and clean up the environment, even if futile. Why? Because if we do try and it turns out that we didn't need to, we were simply investing in alternative energy sources and methods. If we don't try and are wrong, the Earth slowly dies, and no amount of money will reverse it. The ""scientists"" who claim that global warming is harmless are probably some of the same industry-paid ""scientists"" who used to shill for the cigarette companies or claimed DDT was good for you.\courdeleon02:Ten thousand years ago, the Earth entered a warming cycle\that melted the glaciers, and this was at a time few humans existed. Natural\forces are the reason. Solar activity is the determining factor that accounts for the\warming and cooling cycles the Earth has experienced. Over eight such cycles can be verified by modern science, all of which occurred when humans were in short supply.\hackemup:Why is it that the other thousands of scientists who disagree with\Al Gore are ignored?\DIXIEDINER:Yes, there is global warming. Yes, it is cyclical, as all weather is. If World War II did not affect the weather, if global slash and burn agriculture\did not affect the weather, if the above-ground nuclear tests did not affect the weather, if previously uncontrolled forest fires did not affect the weather, if volcanoes did not affect the weather, if the burning of oil wells in Kuwait by Saddam Hussein did not affect the weather, if Chernobyl did not affect the weather, then why have we locked in on greenhouse gases and the like?\It is probably a good idea to try to reduce our imprint on the environment, but let us take baby steps and stop all the hysteria. As yet, we do not have an alternative fuel, but everyone is working in that direction. Hydrogen will probably be a major step but we need to make it safe, from extraction to end use.\jeolsz:The evidence is out there. The proof has been laid out for all to see. The facts are in. Problem is, someone always has an agenda, whether it's stem cell research, evolution, religion, immunizations causing autism, solving the world's food shortage with genetically engineered food. Scientists put the facts out there and politicians and major corporations spin it.\commie8er:Anyone who believes that global warming is manmade is ready to believe just about anything. The scientists are as corrupt as our own politicians. Review the data manipulations and e-mails trying to cover it up from the IPCC. And then, when asked to present the raw data, it somehow gets lost. The globe warms and the globe will cool again, and let's hope it gets warmer because another small Ice Age will kill many humans. If we didn't have global warming before SUVs we would still have a glacier over New York City and most of the northern continental United States.\GBA123:Every day, the conservative right-wingers lap up stories, like a dog\with a steak, that try to poke holes in manmade global warming. Joe Schmoe could write a story, and if you are one of those people who think everything in this country is a conspiracy to defraud the great American people, you believe it. Why is it so\hard to believe we are destroying this planet? It has been proven that swimming after eating will not cause you to cramp up and die, yet people still believe it. It just goes to show, people will continue to believe what they will, screw the science and documentation. If Sarah Palin says it's so, it's so.\courdeleon02:I would like to know what qualifies the letter writer to criticize\our governor's opinions. Is he a scientist? What are his credentials that allow him to be so sarcastic and superior to those who claim that global warming induced by humans is questionable? What I see is the arrogance of those who are so easily led that they fall in line with every media myth presented to them.\tazzyboy1:It is extremely common for reviewers to have different opinions\and recommendations for a manuscript. In cases such as this, editors usually bring in another reviewer or two to achieve other recommendations. I have gotten papers back from reviewers that had diametrically opposed comments and suggestions, which is not such a bad thing. It forces one to look at their work more closely and make sure his or her findings are valid. Of course there is dissent in the scientific community. There usually is, and that is a part of scientific inquiry and growth. But the fact remains that the majority of scientists believe human activity is increasing the rate of global warming.\ThaTooz72:I believe in climate change, not global warming. Science has\proven that before our Industrial Revolution there had been a warming of the planet, followed by a gradual cooling period. Can we be better to our ""Mother?"" Absolutely. Having said that, how would cap and trade benefit the planet? The cap and trade scam is nothing more than the wealthy finding an untapped ""commodity"" to trade in. If you choose to subscribe to the theory cap and trade will save the planet, consider this: Do you need to be warm in the winter? Would you prefer to be comfortable in the summer? Do you want the convenience of an automobile? If you answered yes\to these questions, think about the prices of the fuels used to accommodate\our needs rising by some 18 to 42 percent. You can't afford to pay the prices for\the fuel, while the innovators of this scam continue to live in comfort and luxury.\NYRBlue:Global warming is real regardless of what Christie thinks. He should defer to the expert opinion of the scientific community on this issue, which\has come to the consensus that it is real and has a human cause. Unlike him,\scientists base their opinions on evidence. The increased concentration of\greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere caused by burning of fossil fuels\and deforestation is at least contributing to global warming. The fact there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is not a matter of dispute. And the\insulating property of greenhouse gases is no more a theory than that copper is electrically conductive. The more human population increases and our current energy usage patterns continue to rise, the worse it will get. While mitigating factors do exist, the factors that make the Earth's climate temperature rise outweigh those\that make it fall."
71,"In the 1970s and early '80s, having seized control of the U.N. apparatus (by power of numbers), Third World countries decided to cash in. OPEC was pulling off the greatest wealth transfer from rich to poor in history. Why not them? So in grand U.N. declarations and conferences, they began calling for a ""New International Economic Order."" The NIEO's essential demand was simple: to transfer fantastic chunks of wealth from the industrialized West to the Third World.\On what grounds? In the name of equality -- wealth redistribution via global socialism -- with a dose of post-colonial reparations thrown in.\The idea of essentially taxing hard-working citizens of the democracies in order to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies went nowhere, thanks mainly to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (and the debt crisis of the early '80s). They put a stake through the enterprise.\But such dreams never die. The raid on the Western treasuries is on again, but today with a new rationale to fit current ideological fashion. With socialism dead, the gigantic heist is now proposed as a sacred service of the newest religion: environmentalism.\One of the major goals of the Copenhagen climate summit is another NIEO shakedown: the transfer of hundreds of billions from the industrial West to the Third World to save the planet by, for example, planting green industries in the tristes tropiques.\Politically it's an idea of genius, engaging at once every left-wing erogenous zone: rich man's guilt, post-colonial guilt, environmental guilt. But the idea of shaking down the industrial democracies in the name of the environment thrives not just in the refined internationalist precincts of Copenhagen. It thrives on the national scale too.\On the day Copenhagen opened, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over the regulation of carbon emissions by declaring them an ""endangerment"" to human health. Since we operate an overwhelmingly carbon-based economy, the EPA will be regulating practically everything. No institution that emits more than 250 tons of CO2 a year will fall outside EPA control. This means more than a million building complexes, hospitals, plants, schools, businesses and similar enterprises. (The EPA proposes regulating emissions only above 25,000 tons, but it has no such authority.) Not since the creation of the Internal Revenue Service has a federal agency been given more intrusive power over every aspect of economic life.\This naked assertion of vast executive power in the name of the environment is the perfect fulfillment of the prediction of Czech President (and economist) Vaclav Klaus that environmentalism is becoming the new socialism, i.e., the totemic ideal in the name of which government seizes the commanding heights of the economy and society.\Socialism having failed so spectacularly, the left was adrift until it struck upon a brilliant gambit: metamorphosis from red to green. The cultural elites went straight from the memorial service for socialism to the altar of the environment. The objective is the same: highly centralized power given to the best and the brightest, the new class of experts, managers and technocrats. This time, however, the alleged justification is not abolishing oppression and inequality but saving the planet.\Not everyone is pleased with the coming New Carbon-Free International Order. When the Obama administration signaled (in a gesture to Copenhagen) a U.S. commitment to major cuts in carbon emissions, Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote the president protesting that he lacks the authority to do so unilaterally. That requires congressional concurrence by legislation or treaty.\With the Senate blocking President Barack Obama's cap-and-trade carbon legislation, the EPA coup d'etat served as the administration's loud response to Webb: The hell we can't. With this EPA ""endangerment"" finding, we can do as we wish with carbon. Either the Senate passes cap-and-trade, or the EPA will impose even more draconian measures: all cap, no trade.\Forget for a moment the economic effects of severe carbon chastity. There's the matter of constitutional decency. If you want to revolutionize society -- as will drastic carbon regulation and taxation in an energy economy that is 85 percent carbon-based -- you do it through Congress reflecting popular will. Not by administrative fiat of EPA bureaucrats. Congress should not just resist this executive overreaching, but trump it: Amend existing clean air laws and restore their original intent by excluding CO2 from EPA control and reserving that power for Congress and future legislation.\Do it now. Do it soon. Because Big Brother isn't lurking in CIA cloak. He's knocking on your door, smiling under an EPA cap.\Charles Krauthammer is a nationally syndicated columnist."
72," LISBON, Portugal Governor Corzine dashed across the Atlantic on Monday to join an international coalition that is waging a battle against global warming and to vault New Jersey into the forefront of the fight.\ Corzine says he was compelled to make a deal with European nations signing New Jersey up for a system that trades pollution credits for energy savings because the federal government hasn't effectively confronted the looming threat to American lives and livelihoods.\ ""The penalties of inaction grow more severe and more irreversible each day, and I am quite certain that if we do not meet this challenge, the alternative is too hard to imagine,"" Corzine told a gathering of European officials and some representatives from North America.\  Corzine signed onto a pact with Britain, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain that supporters say confronts head-on the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. Other members of the new International Carbon Action Partnership are California, New York and British Columbia.\ ""We are enthusiastic signers of this partnership that will really attack this issue of global climate change,"" the governor said on a warm and breezy day in Portugal's capital city.\ The goal of the new partnership is to foster information-sharing among countries and states facing climate change. Organizers said this will include best practices for more efficient energy production and more use of renewable energy sources, two areas where Europe is ahead of the United States.\ Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and other emissions largely from the use of fossil fuels, are believed to be increasing global temperatures. Those gases block harmful solar radiation, trap heat in the atmosphere, and help to promote a livable environment. But an overabundance, most scientists now argue, has tipped the system into retaining too much heat and caused wild swings in temperature.\ The new partnership should also lay the groundwork for a global carbon market that would feature the buying and selling of credits based on caps for greenhouse gas emissions that will be established for energy companies in the future.\ Companies would be encouraged to lower emissions. Those that did not would be forced to purchase credits for their higher emissions, thus creating a market for low-emission operations and energy- saving technologies.\ The idea is to let market forces drive energy companies to become more efficient using basically the same model the United States designed to fight acid rain in the 1990s. The European Union established a cap-and-trade carbon market in 2005.\ ""Not everyone in the United States does [agree that action needs to be taken on global warming],"" Corzine said, ""but certainly our group of governors do, and we recognize that we must act expeditiously to reduce the rate of accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere, and we recognize where we are and where we're going is a dangerous situation.""\ Corzine later told The Record that the effort to combat global warming should not be pursued just for environmental reasons. There is economic opportunity for New Jersey energy companies if they become more efficient and find new ways to produce energy such as the wind, water and solar powers outlined during the summit, the governor said.\ He also said New Jerseyans could ultimately see their energy bills drop after the new policies are implemented.\ ""In the long run, it could actually save us [money],"" Corzine said, moments before he returned to Lisbon's international airport for his return trip to New Jersey.\ Whirlwind visit by Corzine\ To attend the summit personally, Corzine laid out an aggressive travel schedule, one he paid for himself.\ Corzine left Sunday evening from Newark Liberty International Airport and landed in Lisbon just as the sun came up Monday.\ The governor, traveling with a small security detail and an aide, left the airport and drove to the home of the U.S. ambassador to Portugal for a breakfast meeting. Corzine then headed across town for the summit meeting hosted by the European Union. New York Gov. Elliot Spitzer also attended, as did a representative from California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's office.\ Schwarzenegger had planned to attend, but stayed home to deal with the fallout from the deadly wildfires in California. Many at the session pointed to those wildfires as evidence of the danger of global warming and the need for action.\ At the summit, Corzine participated in a roundtable discussion with officials before the signing ceremony and speech.\ Less than 12 hours after landing in Portugal, Corzine was headed back to New Jersey.\ Last year, New Jersey signed up for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state cap-and-trade cooperative that includes New York.\ The cooperative, formed in 2003, researches ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote strategies to stem global warming. So far, one of the main efforts has been developing a pollution credit program for power stations in the cooperative, which covers most of the Northeast.\ Corzine said Monday that he's hoping to see new legislation for New Jersey's cap-and-trade program come out of the lame duck session of the state Legislature scheduled to get under way next month.\ He said he would like to see the entire policy go into effect in 2009.\ California is leading a similar effort that includes several other Western states and British Columbia and Manitoba in Canada.\ Slow action at federal level\ In both cases, the states, rather than the federal government, are leading the way in trying to reduce the effects of global warming, officials at the Lisbon conference said.\ Spitzer said the states have to take the lead because the Bush administration has failed to do so. A federal bill that would create a national market in the United States has yet to pass Congress.\ ""We are disappointed that our federal government is not here,"" Spitzer said, just before the formal signing ceremony at Parque das Naces, a sprawling waterfront complex in Lisbon built for the 1998 World Exposition.\ Scientists and environmentalists have been pressing for more work to be done to combat climate change on a global scale and counteract a warm-up they predict could have drastic consequences.\ In North Jersey, weather could end up more like steamy South Carolina's by the century's end, with more flooding in towns around the Meadowlands if the trend isn't checked, experts have warned. New Jersey farmers may also be facing severe consequences. The revenue- producing Jersey Shore would also be at risk.\ David King, a scientist who is the British government's chief adviser on climate change, said the time has passed to question whether humans are causing global warming. He showed several slides during a roundtable discussion and used scientific models to map both prior warm-ups and those still coming.\ ""The climate system is now being determined by our own activities,"" King said during the summit.\ ***\ How does it work?\ A cap-and-trade program sets a limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed to be produced within a region. Different companies within a region are allotted various levels of emissions. The companies are allowed to trade permits for emissions, which should allow the region to reduce emissions in a cost- effective way. For example, a company that has figured out a way to reduce its emissions may sell its surplus permits to another company that needs them.\ ***\ What it means\ How Governor Corzine's agreement with the European Union to help promote lower emissions will affect New Jersey:\ * Corzine hopes to promote the fight against global warming and develop new business opportunities for companies that use energy- saving technologies.\ * Utility companies would be encouraged to use renewable energy sources.\ * Consumers ultimately could see lower bills.\ ***\ E-mail: reitmeyer@northjersey.com\ ***"
73,"Just because the environment is getting short shrift this election season due to our nation's lingering economic woes doesn't mean that President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney can ignore the issue.\Environmentalists have cheered several of Obama's moves during his first term, including: passage of the Recovery Act and its funding for environmental and habitat restoration and water quality improvements; passage of the first comprehensive National Policy for the Stewardship of the Ocean, the Coasts and the Great Lakes; and the signing of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, which expanded land protections and water conservation across two million acres of federal wilderness.\Obama also formed the Partnership for Sustainable Communities to bring together federal agencies to help communities nationwide improve access to affordable housing and increase low cost transportation options while protecting the environment. He also established new rules to reduce the negative impacts of mountain-top removal coal mining, set historic standards limiting greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, made substantial investments in clean energy, proposed the first-ever carbon pollution limits for new fossil-fuel-fired power plants, and reduced carbon emissions within the federal government.\On the downside, green leaders dismay Obama's lack of follow-through on a 2008 campaign promise to label genetically modified foods so that consumers know what they are getting when they buy corn, sugar or breakfast cereal. Also, a 2011 Obama decision to deregulate the planting of genetically modified alfalfa and sugar beets incensed organic farmers and environmental leaders. Greens also worry about Obama's enthusiasm for an ""all-of-the-above"" energy policy that includes the practice of hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") to access natural gas in shale beds under wide swaths of the northeast and western U.S.\If re-elected, Obama would no doubt work to expand U.S. leadership on setting emissions limits in unison with other nations, and has pledged to continue to reduce our dependence on oil so as to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Conservationists are also hopeful that Obama will set aside threatened lands for protection from development as both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did soon before leaving the White House.\While Mitt Romney doesn't have much of an environmental track record from his days as Massachusetts' governor, he did get kudos for being open minded to both regulatory and market-based policy ideas. He also supported a 2003 northeastern states agreement to reduce carbon emissions from power plants via a regional cap-and-trade emissions reduction plan. But in 2005 Romney abruptly pulled Massachusetts out of the plan, telling reporters that it didn't protect businesses and consumers from increased energy costs.\Romney is now pitching an energy plan that embraces all the options, including fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewables. But he recently told ScienceDebate.org that he opposes any kind of carbon tax or cap-and-trade system ""that would handicap the American economy and drive manufacturing jobs away,"" adding that economic growth and technological innovation, ""not economy-suppressing regulation,"" are key to protecting the environment in the long run.\EarthTalk is written and edited by Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss and is a registered trademark of E - The Environmental Magazine."
74,"The Assembly passed a bill Thursday that would require New Jersey to rejoin a nine-state program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\The legislation is similar to bills Governor Christie vetoed last summer after calling the program a failure. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a cap-and-trade program designed to reduce carbon emissions by power companies in nine northeastern states. It requires utilities to buy credits for each ton of carbon they emit. The credits are sold through public auctions, and the revenue raised is used pay for renewable energy and clean technology programs.\Christie pulled New Jersey out of the coalition last year, saying it had only raised the cost of electricity. He is likely to veto the bill.\Jeff Tittel of the Sierra Club's state chapter said his group would work to override any gubernatorial veto. ""Requiring continued participation in RGGI is critical to protect New Jersey's interests, economy and environment,"" Tittel said.\-- James M. O'Neill"
75,"The endorsement of Chris Daggett for governor by the NJ chapter of the Sierra Club, as well as the non-endorsement of any candidate by Environment N.J., clearly demonstrates that our state's environmental leaders do not automatically endorse Democratics.\It's high time that Democratic politicians realize that our state's environmental organizations cannot be taken for granted.\Also, more than just a few Republican politicians should be taking a stand for environmental progress.\They would be doing just that if they followed their party's environmental history instead of listening to loudmouth talk show hosts.\The creation of the national parks, the passage of the Clean Air Act and the highly successful cap-and-trade of SO2 all occurred under Republican presidents.\There are also the following lesser known facts:\1. C. Boyden Gray, a staunchly conservative attorney for the Reagan administration, introduced the concept of cap-and-trade to policymakers.\2. New Jersey's incentives for solar energy were spearheaded by state Sen. Peter Inverso, a Republican, and signed into law by a Republican governor.\New Jersey Republicans who maintain this tradition consistently earn the endorsement of our state's nonpartisan environmental organizations.\Politicians who take a stand for the environment will earn what our state's environmental organizations already enjoy -- respect and credibility.\Dan Aronson\Associate Professor of Economics\Raritan Valley Community College"
76,"Effort to rejoin cap-and-trade\Legislators worried about global warming launched an attempt Thursday at rejoining a cap-and-trade program from which Governor Christie withdrew in 2011.\It was one of dozens of measures that advanced in Assembly and Senate committees as lawmakers hurried to get their bills passed into law before the Legislature's session ends next month. Among the other bills taken up on Thursday were a proposed requirement for new homes to have sprinkler systems and an update to the state's sex offender law that accounts for teenage sexting.\* Greenhouse gases\State lawmakers' latest effort to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative -- which Governor Christie pulled out of in 2011 -- advanced in a Senate committee on Thursday.\The Legislature, controlled by Democrats, had previously passed two measures aimed at rejoining the initiative. But the Republican governor vetoed both.\On Thursday, Democrats tried to go around Christie. The committee advanced a resolution asking voters to approve a constitutional amendment requiring the state to participate in the initiative.\Much of the debate in the Senate Environment Committee centered on whether a constitutional amendment was the right way to advance global warming policy.\""I think our constitution is sacred, and if this is just simply politics, then I think it's wrong,"" said Sen. Jennifer Beck, R-Monmouth.\Sen. Bob Smith, the panel's chairman and the resolution's sponsor, agreed that an amendment ""is not a scalpel, it's a sledgehammer."" But, he said, ""you can't trust governors"" to keep the state in the program or to dedicate the resulting revenue to clean energy programs.\""The reason we need to do a constitutional amendment is because in New Jersey, not just this governor, but all governors, are thieves"" and use the revenue for unrelated expenses, said Smith, D-Middlesex.\The initiative, commonly referred to as RGGI, is a cap-and-trade program that requires utilities to buy credits for each ton of carbon they emit. The credits are sold through public auctions, with the revenues going back to the states.\Nine states in the Northeast participate in it. New Jersey did, too, until Christie pulled the state out in 2011. He said the state's participation had failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but had driven up electricity costs.\Smith argued Thursday that participating in the initiative is an important step toward fighting a larger problem.\""Climate change is the crisis of the century, and we're just not addressing it worldwide,"" he said. ""So New Jersey needs to do its part.""\The resolution passed the committee in a 4-1 vote. But many steps remain before the amendment can be added to the constitution. Both chambers of the Legislature must pass the resolution twice -- in two successive years - before the amendment is put on the ballot for voters to decide.\* Sprinklers\New Jersey might soon require new single-family homes to have fire sprinklers, expensive systems that supporters of the measure say will save lives.\New homes already must have hard-wired smoke detectors in every bedroom and various other areas, and existing homes that are resold are required to have battery-operated detectors on each floor.\Lawmakers said sprinklers will add an important additional protection.\""Anything we can do to protect our residents and emergency responders is worth the price tag,"" said Sen. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, the bill's sponsor. ""This is an investment in public safety that will ultimately cost less than rebuilding after a terrible tragedy.""\Republicans, though, criticized the requirement's costs and said it could threaten the recovery of the state's housing market.\Legislation requiring sprinklers passed the state Senate Community and Urban Affairs Committee by a 3-0 vote Thursday. Another version of the bill passed the full Assembly in January in a vote of 44-30, with Democrats supporting it and Republicans opposing it.\The bill heads to the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee.\* Sexting\The Assembly Appropriations Committee cleared legislation that would make several changes to New Jersey's nearly 20-year-old Megan's Law, including making it clear that teenagers found guilty of sending sexually explicit photos of themselves to another teen -- a practice commonly called ""sexting"" -- do not have to register as sex offenders.\Other proposed changes include upgrading the crime that sex offenders commit when they fail to report a new address to law enforcement from a fourth-degree offense to a third-degree offense and forcing sex offenders to pay a $30 monthly fee to help cover the cost of supervising New Jersey sex offenders who aren't in prison.\Parole officers who monitor sex offenders would also receive training to ensure that offenders aren't using smartphones or other devices to view child pornography or commit other offenses.\The legislation cleared the Assembly committee unanimously. Earlier this year, the full Senate approved it in a 35-0 vote."
77,"RGGI program did not deliver\We got a large serving of baloney from Kate Millsaps of the Sierra Club in ""Quitting RGGI wrong move for New Jersey"" (Other Views, June 2) -- hard-to-believe benefits from the regional greenhouse gas initiative like ""18,000 jobs saved or created"" and ""$2.3 billion added to the region's economy"" and ""global warming pollution down 30 percent."" I'd like to see the facts behind those claims.\Like other green dreams, this cap-and-trade program was sold as an economic boon that would create thousands of new jobs in ""clean"" energy. New Jersey joined the greenhouse compact in 2007 and discovered the opposite.\New Jersey's bill for cap and trade has already exceeded $100 million -- mostly imposed on power plants and businesses and largely passed on to families and businesses.\Industrial electricity costs in New Jersey in January averaged 12.04 cents per kilowatt hour, almost 50 percent higher than in Pennsylvania and almost twice the national average. Because of these higher costs, Ocean Spray (of cranberry fame) announced it will abandon its plant in Bordentown and build a new plant in Pennsylvania. The move will cost New Jersey 250 jobs.\Governor Christie's decision shows that politicians are learning that imposing a unilateral tax on businesses is no way to create a prosperous economy, balance the budget or even do anything about global warming.\Emil J. Travalia\Park Ridge, June 4\*\Regarding ""Christie shifts goals on energy"" (Page A-1, June 8):\In a state that is second only to California in its progressive and positive business and policy stance on the environment, Governor Christie -- a ""clean energy advocate"" on the campaign trail -- is pulling New Jersey from a more than 20-year commitment to clean energy.\He has already withdrawn the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a successful program that supports renewable energy development. Now, Christie is sending a strong message that he is looking to score short-term political points, not long-term solutions for our children's future.\Choosing nuclear as a ""renewable choice"" is a false option, given the years it takes to build a plant, the lack of support by New Jersey residents and the recent events in Japan.\Natural gas, Christie's ""clean option,"" is a fossil fuel that not only adds to greenhouse gas emissions but also threatens to poison neighbors in Pennsylvania where it is produced by the process of fracking.\Instead of supporting development of infrastructure to harness and transmit renewable wind and solar energy, Christie supports the Tennessee Gas Pipeline, owned by a Texas-based company that wants to build natural gas pipelines across critical watershed areas in our state.\New Jersey residents want a clean and renewable future for their children. What does Christie want?\Harriet Shugarman\Wyckoff, June 8\Conservation is best policy\With extreme weather occurrences on the rise, many wonder about the cause. Although no single flood or heat wave can be traced back to global warming, the science is clear that a warmer world will bring more extreme weather.\An Environment New Jersey report from last year, ""Global Warming and Extreme Weather,"" reviewed the latest science linking global warming to hurricanes, coastal storms, extreme precipitation, wildfires and heat waves. Last week, we experienced one of the first major heat waves to move across the Northeast, and schools are even being forced to dismiss kids early.\The threat of increased extreme weather is one of the reasons why we need to make big cuts in our global warming pollution. And the easiest way to do that is to make our cars and trucks pollute less. President Obama can do just that by ensuring that new cars and trucks meet a 60 mpg standard by 2025. Such a standard would reduce global warming nationally -- equal to taking nearly 70 million vehicles off the road -- while saving the average New Jersey family $864 at the gas pump annually.\The president should seize this historic opportunity.\Doug O'Malley\Trenton, June 9\The writer is field director of Environment New Jersey, an environmental advocacy organization.\*\Regarding ""Christie shifts goals on energy"" (Page A-1, June 8):\Energy generation by burning municipal waste? This is trash to cash, and we were supposed to have one trash-to-cash plant in each county, until Gov. Jim Florio wisely put the horns on this zany idea. Most of the state's 21 counties would have had to import and burn out-of-state garbage in order to make these plants operate.\Solar energy, or more specifically solar photovoltaic panels? Solar PV has heavy upfront costs, and they usually break even at around 20 years, the typical life expectancy of these systems. Then they have to be disposed of in accordance with the rules for disposal of electronics. Even with heavy government subsidies, the homeowner takes all of the risks and at best breaks even.\Nuclear power? Fukishima, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island. I don't think so.\That leaves energy conservation.\Although they don't have the sex appeal of solar panels and windmills, large combined cycle gas turbine engines at central power plants and large-process steam users like refineries and paper mills can generate huge savings in lower hydrocarbon fuel usage and reduced carbon footprints.\Electronic ballasts and 32-watt T8 fluorescent lamps in offices everywhere can save electrical energy measured in kilowatt hours. High-efficiency condensing boilers save hydrocarbon fuels and lowers the carbon footprint\Walter S. Stevens\Garfield, June 9\Life is not always fair\Litigation and high school sports go together much like oil and water. (""Sometimes selections are hit and miss,"" Sports, Page S-9, June 9).\The fact that someone would tie up the court system with a frivolous lawsuit by a father to get his daughter designated first-team All-County represents everything that is wrong with the world today.\Is the process flawed and tough to determine whether it should be objective or subjective? Yes. But it is just plain wrong and totally misguided to lawyer up and say, ""This is going to end up in a courtroom. I'm going to bust their chops until they change their rules."" When will people realize that life is not always fair?\This is not someone losing a job for unfair reasons. This is not someone being denied medical insurance due to the greed of some unscrupulous corporation. This is second team on an All-County softball team. In the long run I doubt this will cause some catastrophic event that will ultimately scar this young woman for life.\Parents need to stop living vicariously through their children. If this student athlete is as talented as her statistics suggest (.571 avg. 9 HRS and 46 RBI), I find it hard to believe that colleges would ignore her for not making first-team All-County as a sophomore. Didn't the New York Mets just draft a player in the first round who did not even play high school ball?\The result of litigation like this is simple: As suggested by one coach in the column, people won't want to coach. This would be the true injustice. Leave the courts out of it, and let the student athletes be. There's always next year.\David Wunsch\Ringwood, June 9\The writer is Leonia High School golf coach.\*\Sports Columnist Darren Cooper's ""Sometimes selections hit and miss"" (Sports, Page S-9, June 9) about the irate father of a softball player and the selection process for All-Bergen County teams is probably a piece long overdue.\It has been a decade since our family felt personally slighted when the 2001 baseball selections were announced. Our high school coach lobbied hard on my son's behalf, but the world of backroom deals and politics reared their ugly head. I feel this father's pain but have these other thoughts on the issue.\If the father's real intent is to somehow get the selection process changed -- a futile effort, I believe -- then I applaud him. However, the attention now drawn to his daughter and him is not flattering; it appears to be self-serving. Retaining an attorney is the answer only if it somehow finds a way to change an outdated, ineffective county selection process. The Bergen County Women's Coaches Association is not going to alter this year's picks, so you may as well go after the system itself.\My son's high school baseball coach once said that no one in five years will remember who made first-team All-County. Well, it's been 10 years, and here I am, and I can guarantee you that the father of the excluded softball player won't ever forget it.\Richard Santry\Allendale, June 9\*\Regarding Sports Columnist Darren Cooper's ""Sometimes selections hit and miss"" (Sports, Page S-9, June 9):\It is amazing that The Record would give top billing in its North Jersey Sports section to a parent who thinks he can throw legal threats at the Bergen County Women's Coaches Association for failing to name his daughter a first-team All-County softball player. I'm not sure which is crazier, The Record for giving this so much attention or the legal threats of the father, Mike Paskas.\It is apparent that the first-team players on this years All-County softball team are the real players getting the short end of the stick.\Some of the statements are almost laughable. Paskas says he sees his daughter's exclusion as detrimental to her college softball future. Later, he contradicts himself by saying that with her stats, his daughter will be sure to receive preseason accolades and college interest.\Will all of the first-team players receive similar attention? Many of these players will have led their teams to league, county or state sectional titles. Here, we have an obviously talented sophomore, but one who led her team to no championship and did not even have the highest batting average on her team.\Donald L. Morgan\Park Ridge, June 10\Betrayal in Woodland Park\I am shocked and saddened to hear the news that Woodland Park Borough Councilman Dominick DiDomenico, a Democrat, has filed petitions to run as an Independent candidate for Woodland Park mayor. Since his first election to the Woodland Park Board of Education he has had the full and enthusiastic support of the Woodland Park Democratic Party, making this betrayal very unfortunate and disheartening.\Most unsettling is the fact that DiDomenico gave his word to the Democratic County Committee that he would not run as an Independent candidate if not selected during the screening process. He lost that vote, 10-2; he should respect the wishes of our elected county committee members.\I call on DiDomenico to remove his name from November's general election ballot or face removal from the Woodland Park Democratic County Committee and expulsion from the Woodland Park Democratic Club. His entry into the race serves only to give the Republican Party a marked advantage and jeopardizes the progress made in our community over the last 10 years.\Pat Lepore\Woodland Park, June 8\The writer, a Democrat, is mayor of Woodland Park and a Passaic County freeholder.\Hardly a budge on scandal meter\I am offended by Democrats who are clamoring for Rep. Anthony Weiner's resignation (""Call for Weiner to quit grows louder,"" Page A-7, June 9).\It's not because what they demand is unwarranted -- it isn't. And if they were motivated by a legitimate standard of morality I would totally agree with them. However, their demand smacks of being little more than what is expedient, in vogue and self-serving.\Recall President Clinton's even more reprehensible behavior years ago. How many fellow Democrats called for his resignation? Were there any at all? Instead, many actually had the audacity to defend the creep.\In a time when tales of corruption, greed and immorality are literally daily occurrences in political circles, perhaps in addition to pointing a finger of blame at guilty people these politicians should take a long, hard look at themselves and change their own ways as well.\This country needs true, morally sound leadership, and it's difficult to find it or demonstrate it when you're too busy making shady deals with Wall Street, big corporations and special interest groups and thus selling out the American people.\Joel S. Peters\Mahwah, June 9\*\I agree with Ezra Klein (""Let Weiner's constituents decide his fate,"" Other Views, June 10) but not for the reasons he outlines in his article. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., should not resign as a reminder to the American people that members of Congress, except for a handful of individuals, are no different from the admitted liar.\Lying, deceiving, power-hungry narcissism -- these are the common traits of many members of Congress. That is why America is in the mess we are in. Members of Congress have been on a power trip for decades, creating laws to control the American people by making them more and more dependent on the federal government for the necessities of life. In addition, our bipartisan foreign policy feeds the military-industrial complex, which is partly responsible for the $1.5 trillion budget deficit.\Not only has Weiner, one of the most left-wing members of Congress, lusted for the power to rule over the public, but he also is a lascivious cretin. He should stay in Congress to remind the American people that the political elite in Washington, D.C., do not give a damn about them but only want to indulge in their own power lust and self-indulgent escapades.\Murray Sabrin\Fort Lee, June 10\The writer, a professor of finance at Ramapo College of New Jersey, has been a candidate for several statewide elected offices.\*\I'm really tired of hearing about Rep. Anthony Weiner's escapades. Just like a flasher, the man is a pervert and should be pressured to resign. He has brought disgrace to his office and to Congress.\I don't really care if his constituents think he's the best thing since sliced bread: He is a national embarrassment and needs to go -- now. He will no longer be, if he ever was, an effective legislator. Instead, he's merely a pathetic joke, whose judgment will forever be in question.\Douglas Job\Paramus, June 10\Keep NJN in New Jersey\Here's hoping that the New Jersey Legislature will be able to thwart Governor Christie's ill-conceived plan -- or is it a ""deal?"" -- to turn over New Jersey Network to an out-of-state entity that ironically was once a New Jersey-based TV station (Channel 13 in Newark) (""Christie's NJN plan may face hurdles,"" Page A-1, June 7).\The key word is the perceived political conflict of government owning an outlet that reports on, among other things, the goings-on of that government.\As a recently retired journalist, I have for many years followed NJN's public affairs programming and can state unequivocally that NJN has always managed to walk the fine line between prevailing liberal and conservative views when choosing what events to cover in both its nightly news broadcast and its block of locally produced weekend programs -- ""Reporters Roundtable,"" ""On The Record"" and ""Due Process"" among them.\New Jerseyans cannot afford to lose such excellent fare. The possible ""alternative"" of News 12 New Jersey too often looks and feels like the local newscasts from New York City and Philadelphia, with the on-camera people ""yukking it up."" NJN, by comparison, delivers a straightforward, sobering and thought-provoking newscast. Its live coverage of Assembly and state Senate hearings is also a window into the personalities and leanings of both our elected and state officials.\Christie cites the $11 million to $13 million annual ""savings"" to be realized by ending state support of NJN. But that amounts to only about $2 per New Jersey resident per year -- a very small price to retain this unique asset in a state that desires to keep its identity free from that of its two behemoth neighbors. Our Legislature needs to act quickly to keep NJN intact.\Bob Hannon\Wood-Ridge, June 7\Christie shows little grace under pressure\New Jersey has an image problem. For far too many people outside the state, the typical New Jerseyan is personified by Snooki or Tony Soprano.\Public figures such as Governor Christie are often attacked by political opponents. He would have been well-advised in the wake of all the attention his helicopter rides to his son's baseball games generated to show some class, or what Ernest Hemingway called grace under pressure, rather than the petulant name-calling he engaged in. This kind of behavior simply reinforces all those negative Jersey images.\Patricia Meisterich\Montvale, June 5\Peace movement is alive and well\Regarding ""War protests as party politics"" (Your Views, June 2):\Groups like Veterans for Peace, Iraq Veterans Against the War, Vietnam Veterans Against War along with Code Pink, Peace Action and Military Families Speak Out are alive and well, and we haven't missed a beat or a vigil since these illegal and immoral wars began.\The two groups I represent in New Jersey are openly opposed to the continuation of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan along with the NATO assault on Libya. Furthermore, I personally advocated for the abolition of NATO -- Libya is a good example why this Cold War relic should be dispatched to the junk heap of history.\Both the Democrats and Republicans have plenty of blood on their hands, and most of us in the peace movement are aware of that fact. With that in mind, we're prepared to keep on working for peace until sanity is restored to this country no matter who is living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\Ken Dalton\Clifton, June 3\The writer is president of Veterans for Peace, chapter 21, and North Jersey coordinator of Vietnam Veterans Against the War.\End association with circus\It always disturbs me when I see the signs for the circus, knowing that a business engaged in inhumane and downright disgusting acts of animal cruelty will be coming to town.\Cole Brothers Circus -- which performed in Garfied June 2 through June 5 -- has a clear record of ignoring citations and charges from government agencies to change its cruel ways. Cole Bros. has been cited numerous times for failing to provide veterinary care to elephants and allowing elephants to be malnourished, in some cases leading to their deaths.\Due to their less-than-natural living conditions, elephants have become violent, inadvertently killing two circus goers, injuring many others and causing large amounts of property damage. Most recently, the president of Cole Brothers pleaded guilty to selling two Asian elephants, in violation of the Endangered Species Act. It was fined $150,000.\This is not an issue relevant only to extreme left-wing animal rights activists. Every citizen of Garfield ought to recognize that it is cruel to abuse and confine exotic animals while carting them around the country for one unmemorable night of entertainment after another.\I strongly urge Garfield residents to implore our police officers and city officials to stop supporting a truly inhumane business in the future.\Philip Arthur Johnson\Garfield, June 3"
78," New Jersey's lawmakers are poised to impose new pollution penalties on power companies the first step in determining who pays for contributing to global warming and who profits from preventing it.\ By year's end, the Legislature is expected to approve a plan requiring the companies to pay for the greenhouse gases they produce, a charge that could amount to $70 million or more each year.\ The system is designed to give companies an incentive to cut emissions. But in the short run, at least, the price of polluting is likely to be passed on to consumers. And that could test New Jersey politicians' newfound commitment to fighting climate change.\ ""We think that it's very important to avoid climate change sticker shock,"" said Rick Thigpen, a vice president at Public Service Electric and Gas, the state's biggest generator of both electricity and heat-trapping emissions. ""If this is seen as just raising electric prices, then there's going to be a major potential backlash.""\ Environmental and business groups predict some bill will make it out of the Legislature's lame-duck session this fall. But negotiations have only just begun over some of the key details, from how much utilities have to pay to who divvies up the millions that could be raised for state coffers.\ The legislation would authorize regulators to impose a so-called cap and trade system on utilities that emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. New Jersey, New York and eight other states agreed to the plan two years ago, ordering electric companies to cut greenhouse pollution 10 percent by 2021.\ Those are the kinds of pollutants that are trapping heat in the planet's atmosphere, setting the stage for increased flooding, worsening droughts and other potentially devastating changes to the climate. On Saturday, an international scientific panel issued yet another warning on the subject, saying the evidence for warming was ""unequivocal.""\ New Jersey's plan would put a cap on carbon emissions statewide, starting at 23 million tons a year and ratcheting downward over the coming years. The state would give ""allowances"" to companies, one per ton of greenhouse gas. Businesses that find a way to lower emissions could sell allowances to those needing more. In theory, the market finds the best way to cut pollution.\ But how free should that market be? Governor Corzine and environmental groups say the state should auction off all allowances to the highest bidder, rather than give utilities some or all of them for free. With bidding expected to start at $2 or $3 a ton in the early years, the process could raise up to $69 million annually for energy conservation, subsidies for solar power and other clean- energy projects and assistance to low-income customers hit with higher electric bills.\ A full auction, proponents say, would avoid the mistakes of the European Union's two-year-old carbon trading market, which gave away credits for free. Electric rates still soared, even for utilities that had extra allowances.\ ""If you give the allowances for free to generators, they're still going to charge customers more anyway,"" said Dale Bryk, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. ""We should be using that money to reduce energy costs for consumers.""\ PSE&G isn't opposed to a 100 percent auction, said Thigpen, the company vice president. But the utility and business lobbyists in Trenton are pushing for concessions that they say would cushion the blow to power producers.\ Some allowances could be sold at a reduced price, they say; others could be held back from the auction and released in the case of price spikes. PSE&G wants to see the state take more steps to ensure that customers don't simply shift to Pennsylvania utilities not covered by the greenhouse limits, Thigpen added.\ The state Business and Industry Association, meanwhile, would like to see some companies exempted from the camp, such as small businesses or large companies that produce their own power and heat onsite. The association's also worried that the legislation leaves specifics of the process to state environmental regulators, said Assistant Vice President Sarah Bluhm.\ ""There are no checks and balances,"" she said. ""When you're talking about potentially hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, that's worrisome.""\ Environmental groups are pushing in the other direction, trying to limit any exemptions or other loopholes. Matt Elliott, a clean energy advocate for Trenton-based Environment New Jersey, said he worries about letting companies claim credit for tree-planting and other projects whose ecological benefits are hard to measure.\ ""The utilities are trying to make sure the Legislature doesn't do this in as strong a way as possible,"" he said. ""This is the Legislature's first moment to prove themselves and show that they're serious about their commitment, that they're willing to tackle global warming in the toughest way possible.""\ Everybody agrees they'd prefer a nationwide cap-and-trade system that put businesses across the country on a level playing field. But if that happens, some say, New Jersey's early entry into the field could help companies here who learn how to profit off clean energy and other carbon cutting measures.\ ""If we invest in this process the right way, we have the potential to stimulate a whole new sector of the economy,"" said Adam Zellner, a deputy environmental commissioner in New Jersey. ""This will open up whole new doors for the state.""\ ***\ How it works\ What is cap and trade? A system designed to let the free market find global warming solutions. The state would cap greenhouse emissions from power plants and then sell or give away credits, one for each ton of emissions. Companies that find a way to cut pollution could sell credits to those that can't get below the cap.\ Who's involved? New Jersey is part of a 10-state compact of Northeastern states that's promised to cut power company emissions 10 percent. New York, Maryland, Delaware and the six New England states are also on board.\ What's at stake? It could cost companies $70 million a year to buy the credits. That will mean higher bills for customers. But the state would devote the revenues to solar and wind projects, energy conservation and other measures that could cut bills in the long run.\ Why utilities? They're one of the major generators of greenhouse pollution, though experts say bigger cuts will be needed from vehicles and other sources to really solve the problem.\ ***\ E-mail: nussbaum@northjersey.com"
79,"An appellate panel will soon grapple with whether Governor Christie illegally removed New Jersey from a multistate program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\Oral arguments are expected to be heard before a three-judge panel in Trenton on Jan. 8, nearly 20 months after two environmental groups sued Christie. They claim the governor violated state law by not seeking any public comment before pulling New Jersey out of the program in 2011.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, is a cap-and-trade program adopted by nine Eastern states in which power companies like Public Service Electric and Gas Co. must purchase credits through public auctions for every ton of carbon their plants emit while generating electricity. Revenue from the sale of credits goes to the states to invest in renewable energy programs.\Whether the lawsuit could reinstall New Jersey back into RGGI, even temporarily, remains to be seen. But the battle is essentially over whether Christie had the right to take New Jersey out of the pact unilaterally.\Although Christie has acknowledged that climate change is real and that human activity contributes to the changes, he called RGGI a failure. He said it only caused higher electricity rates for New Jersey residents and businesses, many of which supported the move.\Environmentalists have argued that RGGI has helped reduce harmful emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. They also say it adds jobs in the clean energy sector.\The lawsuit was filed in June 2012 by Environment New Jersey and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The suit argues that state law requires public input before state regulations are changed.\""We want to hold Governor Christie accountable to the public,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey. ""His decision to pull us out of RGGI was wrong, but it also iced the public out of the process.""\State officials have said that any state could pull out of RGGI anytime after giving notice to the group.\""The state hasn't changed its position,"" said Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. ""Governor Christie maintains it's a tax on business.""\New Jersey power plants cut their carbon-based emissions by 11 percent in 2012, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It was the second consecutive double-digit decline.\Rather than affecting air quality directly like soot, carbon pollution works like a blanket suspended in the atmosphere that prevents heat from escaping. The trapped heat raises air and ocean temperatures, which melts polar ice, raising sea levels.\A recent study published by a team of Rutgers scientists found that New Jersey's sea level is expected to rise 1.5 feet by 2050 and 3.5 feet by the year 2100 in the mid-Atlantic states due to melting ice caps and the gradual sinking of the ground along the Jersey Shore. By 2100, a 100-year storm could occur every 10 years in a place like Atlantic City, researchers said.\The Senate and Assembly, controlled by Democrats, have passed legislation to rejoin RGGI twice. But the Republican governor vetoed them each time.\This month, the state Senate took a first step to bypass Christie with a resolution that would ask voters to amend the state constitution and require New Jersey to be a part of RGGI."
80,"Governor Christie drew criticism from environmentalists after he expressed skepticism that human behavior has led to global warming.\Christie said he has seen evidence on both sides of the debate over man's role in global warming but doesn't think it has been definitively proven either way. During a town hall meeting earlier this week in Toms River, he said ""more science"" would be needed to convince him.\Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, scoffed at Christie's comments, saying they were politically motivated and a bid to court right-wing elements of the Tea Party movement. Christie's campaigning last month for Republican candidates in several states has raised his national profile.\""Every major scientific study done shows that man is influencing climate change,"" Tittel said in a statement. ""Governor Christie is full of hot air ... The only science the governor is paying attention to is political science. He has moved to the right to appease Tea Baggers and the coal industry.\""During the gubernatorial campaign, Christie criticized [former Governor Jon] Corzine for not doing enough on renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions,"" Tittel said. ""But since taking office, the governor has a dismal record on issues surrounding climate change and on the environment in general.""\In the past year, for instance, the state has spent millions of dollars earned through a cap and trade program on the general state budget, rather than on initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, as the program was intended.\Many scientists believe that a number of human activities are contributing to global warming, sending greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\Some studies have estimated that climate change could cause sea levels to rise and swamp many of New Jersey's barrier islands and beaches, harming the state's $39 billion coastal tourism industry.\Christie's skepticism about human activity as the cause of climate change runs counter to the platform the Republican Party adopted during the 2008 presidential campaign.\The platform reads, in part, ""The same human economic activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. While the scope and long-term consequences of this are the subject of ongoing scientific research, common sense dictates that the United States should take measured and reasonable steps today to reduce any impact on the environment.""\E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com\Credit: E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com"
81,"A lot of heat and not so much light has been made about the recent U.S. House vote to pass the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which will start to move this country to a clean energy economy.\A bipartisan majority of New Jersey's Congressional delegation, including Rep. Leonard Lance, R-Flemington, showed leadership by supporting legislation to start getting the rest of the country caught up with New Jersey.\From generating the second most power from solar collectors in the country to likely having the first offshore wind farm in the country, New Jersey has been setting the path to move away from fossil fuels and generate green jobs.\According to a survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts, there were more than 2,000 green businesses in New Jersey's emerging clean energy economy by 2007, employing more than 25,000 people.\But the final bill that comes out of the U.S. Senate can and must do better if we are to unleash the potential of clean energy to transform our economy, put millions of Americans back to work, and solve global warming.\Even with this momentum in Congress, there are still large obstacles, including more than 2,000 fossil fuel lobbyists gearing up to defeat this legislation and a conservative backlash against the transition to clean energy solutions.\The current criticisms of the legislation's cap and trade emissions program seem to miss three important points: we've done it before, we're doing it now and the cost of doing nothing far exceeds the cost of the program.\Twenty years ago, when Congress was debating strengthening the Clean Air Act to reduce acid rain, utilities charged that cleaning up their act would put them out of business or lead to huge rate hikes. The untested system of creating a market for pollution credits to be bought and sold to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions was deemed too risky.\The legislation passed Congress by strong margins, and reduced emissions by half. And it did so at one sixth of the projected costs. The experience should be informative: the strength of market forces to provide disincentives for older and dirtier technology.\Since 2005, New Jersey also has led the way regionally to reduce global warming emissions.\A collection of 10 Northeast states, including New Jersey, formed a regional compact called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to put a price on carbon and create incentives to reduce global warming pollution.\The plan is up and running, and the sky hasn't fallen. In fact, the fourth auction of carbon permits occurred recently, and it raised over $14 million for programs in New Jersey to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save consumers money. Over the next decade, the agreement will reduce power plant emissions by 10 percent and significantly reduce business and household energy demand.\And, of course, there is the issue of cost. Missing from the debate has been the cost of the status quo -- which is immense. Using data from the Department of Energy, Environment New Jersey recently calculated that between 2010 and 2030, New Jersey will spend as much as $888 billion on oil, coal, and other fossil fuels -- more than 3.3 times the total earnings of all New Jersey workers in 2007. On a per-capita annual level, the cost will increase 60 percent for the average person to more than $5,000.\The cost of cap-and-trade will be higher in states, unlike New Jersey, that are solely dependent on fossil fuels. However, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of the program over the next decade will total a little more than a postage stamp a day for average American households. And that's without the benefits of energy efficiency programs, which would likely lower consumer costs to a negligible level.\The impacts of global warming might seem abstract, but scientists continue to warn how even a small sea-level rise will have huge impacts.\Attacking science may be a viable political strategy, but the insurance industry, hardly an activist bunch, takes it seriously because of the immense value of Shore real estate. A 2008 University of Maryland study put the potential price tag on threatened property at over $106 billion.\When John F. Kennedy in 1961 issued his famous declaration that America would get to the moon within the decade, NASA's engineers, despite the technological challenges, buckled down. For Congress, this 21st century moon-shot is even more urgent. Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Bob Menendez have been steadfast clean energy supporters, but we will need their leadership to strengthen and pass clean energy legislation to kick-start the new green economy.\Doug O'Malley is the field director for Environment New Jersey, a citizen-based\environmental advocacy group based out of Trenton."
82,"The push for New Jersey to withdraw from a regional clean energy program that critics say includes an ""economically destructive tax"" gained a key Democratic ally on Wednesday.\State Sen. Paul Sarlo said he is supporting legislation to pull out of the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative because Governor Christie took millions generated from the cap-and-trade program to help balance last year's budget instead of funding clean-energy initiatives.\The program ""is only beneficial to governors looking to balance their budgets,"" Sarlo said during a rally by the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity at a Rutherford service station. ""It should be aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.""\But unlike most opponents of the program, the Democrat from Wood-Ridge said he supports renewable energy funding and believes man-made greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.\Still, leaders of Americans for Prosperity embraced Sarlo's support while environmentalists feared it could bolster the group's call for RGGI's repeal.\RGGI is a cooperative effort by Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 10 percent by 2018. To do so, power plant operators such as PSE&G must purchase allowances from their host states to cover each ton of carbon dioxide emissions they are likely to produce. The companies can then buy, sell or trade their permits. Companies that reduce their emissions and don't need all their allowances might sell them to a company whose emissions exceed their allowances.\The proceeds are to be invested by the states in energy-efficiency projects and developing renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.\Opponents say power companies have passed along the costs to comply with RGGI by raising electric bills. The Sierra Club says the increase is less than half of 1 percent of the average household bill.\""It is a hidden tax on all the ratepayers in New Jersey,"" said former Bogota Mayor Steve Lonegan, president of Americans for Prosperity's New Jersey chapter.\Opposition to RGGI has grown. The New Hampshire House voted to withdraw in February, and Republican legislators in Maine support a repeal. Leading the opposition is Americans for Prosperity, which receives funding from billionaire David Koch, an owner of Koch Industries Inc., a private energy conglomerate that has refined petroleum for more than 70 years.\Last month, Governor Christie criticized the program at a town hall meeting in Nutley, saying it may be hurting economic development. He said he would decide within two months whether New Jersey should pull out of RGGI.\Sarlo became the first Democrat to join more than 40 Republican legislators in sponsoring legislation that would repeal the Global Warming Response Act of 2007, which authorized New Jersey to enter RGGI.\Supporters of RGGI say leaving it will hamper New Jersey's role as a leader in sustainable design and renewable energy.\Sarlo ""joins a rogues' gallery of legislators who are not environmentally friendly,"" said Assemblyman John McKeon, D-South Orange, head of the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee. ""They're hiding behind tough economic times and using it as an excuse to pull back beneficial environmental programs.""\Through 2010, New Jersey has awarded $29.6 million in RGGI funds to 12 large-scale energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that are projected to generate enough electricity annually to meet the needs of more than 19,600 households each year.\But last year, Christie took $64 million that New Jersey received from the auctions to balance the budget.\""This was the worst kind of diversion possible,"" Sarlo said. ""This program became a slush fund.""\Credit: E-mail: fallon@northjersey.com"

Thousands die each year from coal-plant pollution; thousands more suffer from cardiac problems and respiratory ailments. The Republican freeholders were not acting on behalf of consumers, who stand to save little by New Jersey withdrawing from the program. They were acting on behalf of the power companies, which will save millions in emission-scrubbing equipment.

on emissions program
\
Regarding the May 20 story, ""Officials: Repeal emissions-reduction program"":
\
Atlantic County's freeholders have voiced opposition to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, as encouraged by Steve Lonegan and Americans for Prosperity.
\
Lonegan's group is a national front for oil and coal interests. In fact, the chairman of the Americans for Prosperity board is multibillionaire David Koch -owner of Koch Industries, one of the most polluting energy companies in America. So it's no surprise that AFP wants to keep us addicted to fossil fuels. It is surprising, though, that Atlantic County's Republican freeholders followed the group's lead.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative caps the very pollution that causes climate change and threatens Atlantic County in myriad ways, including sea-level rise and more extreme weather events. It affects rates by only a fraction of a percent, but in turn brings millions of dollars into our state to help businesses reduce energy usage and promote clean energy. It also saves New Jersey businesses millions of dollars, as they cut their pollution footprint.
\
AFP is lying to the public and to our elected officials about RGGI. RGGI is good for the environment and good for the economy.
\
In fact, it's good for everyone but dirty out-of-state energy companies.

must reject Obama
\
Regarding the May 20 story, ""Obama calls for pre-1967 Israel"":
\
President Barack Obama, campaigner in chief, is now trying to be the Abe Lincoln of the Middle East. He is lacking much more than the beard and the top hat.
\
Obama's ego has grown so large now that even he is starting to believe what he is saying. That is a dangerous thing, as most failed rulers and despots in past history went down this road.
\
There is no doubt now about how Obama feels about our strong ally, Israel. He chooses to turn away and leave Israelis in the ""dunk tank,"" telling them, ""Good luck, maybe no one will hit the target.""
\
Anyone who does not see his lack of empathy with Israel must be blind.
\
Obama received huge contributions in 2008 from the Jewish-American community. We can certainly hope that now many of these Jewish Americans have become enlightened and will withhold their support in 2012.
\
Obama's lack of formal condemnation for many anti-Israel nations and their comments is appalling. If anyone wants to check on his pre-presidential record, look at his pro-Palestinian support in Chicago.
\
How can any believer in the Israeli state not reject this man? It is time for Jewish Americans to be careful that their general liberal mindset doesn't blind them to those who do not act in the best interest of the Jewish homeland.

Fire everybody,
\
drill everywhere
\
A modest proposal:
\
We need to fire every worker in this country and deny them all unemployment. After all, this isn't a socialist country. We need to dig for oil everywhere, even in our backyards, because you can never have too much oil.
\
We need to become the servants of the wealthy, and no one should be allowed to hold public office unless they're wealthy. After all, they were smart enough to get rich in the first place so they must certainly be smarter than us.
\
We need to do away with all taxes to foster self-reliance like the pioneers had. We need to make old folks and retirees beg for their daily bread and medicine - serves them right for getting old in the first place.
\
We need to get rid of all medical insurance because it costs money that we don't have or that could have gone to some deserving CEO.
\
We need to get children back to work in the mines where they belong. After all, only kids are healthy enough to do dangerous work for long hours.
\
We need to move all jobs to the moon so that no one can ever work again, and the corporations will never have to pay taxes again.
\
We need to poison our air and water and burn down our farms. We've been eating chemicals for years and it's good enough for us.
\
We need to make war with every country on the planet whose ruling class isn't as rich as ours.
\
And while we're at it, we need to get our heads examined.

84,"This is the latest in a weekly series in which the major-party candidates in three North Jersey districts discuss issues that Congress has faced and will face. Excerpts of their responses are below. Video of the candidates' full responses is on northjersey.com/herbjackson.\The issue: Climate change and what to do about it\Background:\The mean annual temperature for northern New Jersey was 50.6 degrees between 1895 and 1970, then 50.9 degrees from 1971 to 2000, and then 52.9 degrees from 2001 to 2008, according to state climatologist David Robinson. A series of reports in May by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, concluded that human activity is largely causing climate change, and the consequences will be rising sea levels, disappearing Arctic ice and more frequent severe weather, including heat waves, droughts and storms. Reducing emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide that are warming the atmosphere would mitigate the predicted effects. The House in 2009 adopted a law that would impose a steadily decreasing cap on emissions of greenhouse gases from many different kinds of sources, including industry, vehicles and energy production. It also created a way for producers of those gases, primarily carbon dioxide, to trade emissions credits. Those changes are expected to increase the cost for energy, and possibly many other things, because fuels that are cheapest such as coal and oil also tend to emit the most carbon. The Senate took no action on that bill in 2010. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority under the Clean Air Act to issue regulations to cap carbon as a pollutant, but the agency has not yet acted on that authority.\The question:\Is human activity contributing to global warming? If so, what should Congress do about it?\District 5\Warren County, parts of Bergen, Passaic and Sussex\Scott Garrett, Republican incumbent\""Congress should be taking action in this general area, but not in the area of trying to rein in global warming, just the opposite. The administration is taking action to try to pass regulations, on the regulatory side, because they can't get it done through the legislative side. And I think that points out the real question that still exists in a lot of people's minds, experts and non-experts alike, on the area of global warming and what role the government should have in this realm. ... I've heard a number of experts on both sides of the equation on this issue, and to me the evidence, the question is still out there. Before Congress takes some action such as the cap-and-trade that would effectively raise a, what was it, a $1,500 or $3,000 tax on every household in this country, Congress should not be moving too quickly, as we have in the area of stimulus and other spending bills and that sort of thing, to impose regulations on this segment of the economy until these questions are answered.""\Tod Theise, Democratic challenger\""I believe human activity is contributing to global warming. ... It sort of pains me to think that we have to look at the annihilation of our species or the potential annihilation to actually do something about it. We have a commitment, not just to ourselves, but to future generations, to be good stewards to the environment. It's not about politics. ... We have to have an aggressive plan for alternative energy, a Marshall Plan. After World War II we were able to rebuild Germany, we rebuilt their economy, we helped Japan only. We have to have what I call an environmental Marshall Plan. We have to take our industrial infrastructure and change it over completely. It means investing in new technology, it means going to Detroit and saying, 'Look, start building cars with batteries, start building cars that don't run on fossil fuels.' And we have to get behind this.""\District 8\Parts of Passaic and Essex counties\Bill Pascrell Jr., Democratic incumbent\""We have tremendous climate change in the world. There are variations beyond the standard. There are certain parts of the world that are becoming heated. This, we know, is a main result of too much carbon in the air. And we continue to depend upon fossil fuel, and foreign fossil fuel at that, but we should be looking at alternative forms of energy. ... I know that's going to take time. This ain't going to happen over five or 10 or 15 years. But we've got to have that transition. ... I'm strongly concerned about doing it in a way that we do not have a dramatic change of occupations from one day to the next, that we have a gradual transitional turn away from fossil fuel. ... I chose the cap-and-trade over direct taxes on carbon. I thought it would work better for New Jersey. ... Was it far from perfect? It was probably further from perfect than any legislation that I voted on in the environment or energy [area] in the past six or seven years. I think it was going in the right direction, though, definitely.""\Roland Straten, Republican challenger\""I frankly don't know. I'm an engineer, and I really chafe at the bit when I hear that the science is concluded, that there's no more science, there's no more studies to be made on this. ... So the science is still out as far as I'm concerned. The concept of using less energy is good. I think we should use basically more alternative energy, more solar panels, more windmills. ... We need the engineers and scientists to decide what to do, and we have to get it out of the big political thing. ... Should the government force something that's not economical? The answer is no. Should they help, help with research? I have no problem with helping with research. ... The government should not force us to use a particular form of energy; what we need to do is let the free market decide.""\District 9\Parts of Bergen, Hudson and Passaic counties\Steve Rothman, Democratic incumbent\""I do believe human activity is contributing to global warming. The question is how much and what are the costs to reduce that human activity versus the benefits. And that's what we examine on a case-by-case basis when various proposals come before us. ... I think it's important that we, No. 1, reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy, especially oil. So we needed to give incentives to those who were developing alternative sources of energy ... And nuclear, if it's safe, and we can make it safe, then we ought to pursue that, and that was in the bill as well. ... I'm looking forward to the Senate coming up with its version of an energy bill. ... If they have better ideas, if they're unable to go as far as we went, I just want to move the country forward in a common-sense, smart way. But move the country forward.""\Michael Agosta, Republican challenger\""Well, the global warming, I thought after all that with Al Gore and his film career and all of his Nobel Peace Prize and such, I thought there was that scandal with the e-mail about how fake that actual situation truly is. Are we contributing to it? Yes we are, in a very, very, very small amount. ... In the late '80s or early '90s, they were blaming cows with the methane. Now we're going to blame, we talk about [carbon dioxide], here in New Jersey, actually, whether it's a possible pollutant. CO2. If we have no CO2, we have no grass, we have no trees, then we'll die. ... I think we have enough, between the [Environmental Protection Agency] and any other agency in the federal government, we have enough regulations on the books and laws and such, and I don't think we need any more intervention.""\NEXT WEEK: STIMULUS\-- Herb Jackson"
85,"Governor Christie unveiled a new state energy master plan Tuesday that calls for an increased reliance on natural gas and possibly a new nuclear plant while still promoting the development of wind, solar and other renewable energy sources.\Christie effectively abandoned the goal set by former Gov. Jon Corzine to have renewable energy sources generate 30 percent of the state's energy needs by 2020, focusing instead on the more modest 22.4 percent already required under state law.\Christie wants to promote energy generation by burning municipal and industrial waste. His plan would also continue to retrofit state buildings to make them more energy efficient.\Yet the plan expresses concerns with the cost of solar energy and the subsidies that the state has been providing to encourage its development.\""We believe this is a plan that is both realistic and forward-looking, and one that will address the real concerns of the people of New Jersey to have less-expensive, available energy ... and also to move toward a greener, more environmentally friendly state with renewable energy,"" Christie said at a press conference in Trenton on Tuesday.\The plan brought immediate criticism from the state's environmentalists, who were already upset at Christie's decision last month to remove New Jersey from a regional cap-and-trade program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\""Unfortunately the governor's plan undermines New Jersey's progress and leadership position on clean energy and tackling global warming,"" said Matt Elliott with Environment New Jersey. ""Instead of supporting the state's efforts, the governor is scaling back on programs that work and that should be expanded.""\Christie ""goes back on a 20-year commitment in this state to clean energy,"" the Sierra Club's Jeff Tittel said. He said language questioning the need to continue subsidies for solar energy could jeopardize outside financial investment in the state in the renewable energy sector, ultimately losing jobs.\Democratic lawmakers were cautious about Christie's plan, saying they need to look at it more closely during public hearings.\""Any plan that relies on alternative energy such as wind and solar is a good thing, but like most things with this governor the devil is going to be in the details,"" said Assemblyman John McKeon, D-Essex, who heads the Assembly Environment Committee.\One controversial issue will likely be whether the state needs another nuclear plant.\Christie's plan says the state ""cannot achieve its 2050 greenhouse gas reduction goal without a significant portion of the energy supply coming from nuclear technology.""\New nuclear plant?\One of the state's nuclear facilities, Oyster Creek in Ocean County, is supposed to close in 2019, and Christie wants to replace the lost capacity.\The state must first answer ""vexing economic, safety and environmental questions,"" but ultimately Christie ""supports the construction of new nuclear baseload generation,"" the plan says.\Environmentalists oppose nuclear power because it is expensive and produces radioactive waste.\Public Service Enterprise Group has long wanted to build a fourth nuclear reactor at its facility in Salem County. But Christie hinted in his plan that he might prefer another nuclear plant near the Oyster Creek facility, noting the presence of a ""highly-skilled workforce, community support for such an initiative, and the existing electrical transmission infrastructure.""\Christie's master plan emphasizes the need to reduce energy costs for state residents as a top priority.\""This plan provides relief to New Jerseyans who already pay the fourth-highest rates in the nation for energy,"" Christie said, ""while not losing sight of the need to develop renewable energy technologies.""\The plan hints that state subsidies for solar installations might be reduced or eliminated because the costs get passed on in higher electricity rates for all. ""The Christie administration does not support the unreasonable transference of wealth from ratepayers at large to solar developers as well as residential, commercial and industrial participants,"" the report says.\But the plan does suggest that ""brownfield sites and landfills are well-suited for the development of large solar generation projects.""\""We really shift our focus on solar to commercial and industrial large-scale use,"" Christie said of his plan.\The plan also emphasizes a need to provide the infrastructure that will encourage a transition of the state's vehicles away from diesel and gas toward natural gas and electric.\Citing the BP oil spill last year in the Gulf of Mexico, the release of radiation from a nuclear plant in Japan after the March earthquake and tsunami, and the explosions that killed 29 a year ago at the Upper Big Branch coal mine in West Virginia, the Christie plan says ""there are no easy options on the subject of our dependence on oil, nuclear power and the mining of coal.""\That provides the setup for the plan's emphasis on expanding the state's natural gas infrastructure -- both new gas-burning power plants and new gas pipelines.\Natural gas burns more cleanly than oil or coal, but it is still a carbon-based fuel that contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and environmentalists don't support it as strongly as other, cleaner renewable energy sources.\Christie's emphasis on natural gas comes as one gas pipeline expansion project is under way in the Highlands and a second one has been proposed to run through West Milford, Ringwood and Mahwah.\Construction began last year to build Tennessee Gas' 300 line next to an existing pipeline after receiving state and federal approvals, even though it disturbs about 230 acres, much of it protected forests. The pipeline starts in Wantage outside the Highlands and passes for 8.7 miles east through Vernon, cuts 6.7 miles across West Milford and extends for about half a mile into Ringwood.\Tennessee Gas also launched a campaign this year to build another pipeline that would cut across 7.7 miles of the Highlands, including under the Monksville Reservoir.\Environmentalists have opposed both projects because they would run though the Highlands watersheds that supply drinking water to millions of state residents. In addition, they are concerned about the drilling for gas in nearby states because the process involves fracturing, which pumps water and chemicals into the earth to extract the gas. The chemicals can contaminate drinking water supplies, some argue.\E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com\Sidebar: \What's next\The state Board of Public Utilities will hold three hearings on the revised energy master plan.\July 26\1 to 5 p.m.\New Jersey Institute of Technology\150 Bleeker St., Newark\Aug. 3\1 to 5 p.m.\State House Annex, Committee Room 11\125 W.

86,"At a private dinner in New York last December, Robert E. Grady was one of some 18 guests urging Gov. Chris Christie to run for president.\Christie, as he has stated publicly and repeatedly, told his suitors he wasn't ready. Some of the guests countered that neither was President Barack Obama in 2008. ""I rest my case,"" Christie shot back.\A month later, Grady pushed again. As they sifted through drafts of the State of the State speech inside the governor's mansion in Princeton, Grady reminded Christie that sometimes, a man does not always pick the time, but time picks the man.\It was no idle remark. Grady is the one administration insider who has known Christie from high school and helped promote his career every step of the way. More than that, Grady has the experience and contacts to make a presidential run a reality. That makes him valuable to a governor who, while denying interest in national office, is building a national profile.\Grady, a 53-year-old financier and former presidential appointee, has spent a career on big stages, even if he's been just out of the spotlight. He served as a top official for former Gov. Tom Kean and President George H.W. Bush. He worked shoulder to shoulder with Republican luminaries such as former Secretary of State James Baker, famed speechwriter Peggy Noonan, media consultant and current Fox News chief Roger Ailes, current World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick and Dick Darman, Bush's budget director.\Grady was also a partner at The Carlyle Group, a $107 billion private equity firm. The co-founder of Carlyle, David M. Rubenstein, says Grady ""knows everyone you can think of in the investment and political world.""\Despite his national pedigree, Grady, who lives in Wyoming now, comes home to New Jersey to lead two key financial and economic committees for Christie, a boyhood acquaintance. He believes he is working with someone who has the ability to be a national leader.\Grady's and Christie's personal and political roots are intertwined in Livingston, the hilly Essex County town that became an upper-end Newark suburb in the 1970s and helped to catapult several successful political careers.\Grady, a local whiz kid who spent a summer studying quantum physics with a Cornell University scientist, became the Livingston High School 1975 class president in his senior year. He recalls Christie making his impact as a freshman the year after he graduated.\""(Christie) was active, visible,"" Grady said. ""He was well known by a lot of parents in town, a lot of kids in town. He was an enthusiastic outgoing guy, just as he is today.""\Grady spurned his mother's advice to pursue science, and instead left for Harvard to study history. He spend one summer in college helping his father, then a Democrat, win a seat on the town council.\At Harvard, Grady said he helped organize protests against apartheid, the policy of racial separation in South Africa, and learned to write quickly as a member of the Harvard Crimsom newspaper. Both activities later helped advance his career.\After graduation, he came home in 1980 to find that his father was mayor and Christie had become class president. His father had appointed Christie as a representative on a local board.\Grady said he did not know Christie well then, but was aware that ""he was a youth leader and he was in the paper all the time.""\Grady took a Capitol Hill internship with a local congresswoman, pipe-smoking Millicent Fenwick, who carved a national reputation as a pro-choice, pro-environment, women's rights Republican progressive who served as cartoonist Garry Trudeau's inspiration for the Lacey Davenport character in the Doonesbury strip.\By 1982, Grady was Fenwick's chief of staff when the 72-year-old congresswoman decided to run for U.S. Senate. She ended up taking on a younger millionaire upstart named Frank Lautenberg.\Fenwick refused campaign contributions from political action committees, while Lautenberg used his millions to pay for advertising that questioned whether Fenwick was too old for the job.\Fenwick lost, and Grady was out of a job. But then another politician from Livingston gave him a call: Gov. Tom Kean.Able to write quickly on deadline, Grady wrote speeches and helped with events. One night, after a television taping, Grady was sent out to meet an Allenhurst dentist and recreational fisherman who complained about the dumping of garbage and sewage off the Jersey Shore.\The dentist, Dennis Sternberg, said he had unsuccessfully attempted to get Kean's attention for months, until Grady listened and then convinced Kean to file a lawsuit against New York and otherwise work to clean up the pollution.\""Bob was the person who made it happen,"" said Sternberg, who led a group then called Save Our Shores. ""He saw what no one saw at the time, that there were health risks (because of) the pollution.""\Kean said in an interview his most vivid memory of Grady came after the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a bill that would require $2 billion of the state's pension funds to be divested from companies doing business in South Africa in an attempt to pressure the country to abandon apartheid.\Kean, a Republican, said he expected to veto the measure because he believed the argument that American companies were doing more good than harm. But Grady piped up in a staff meeting, the only one to urge Kean to sign the bill.\Kean said that for the next several days he considered Grady's argument that apartheid would never change unless South Africa were starved of investments. Then he heard South African President P.W. Botha declare ""Apartheid forever!"" on the radio. Kean strode into Grady's office, said he had changed his mind, and told Grady to write the strongest statement possible.\Grady remained until after Kean's 1985 landslide re-election. Grady then decided to go to Stanford Graduate School of Business because, he said, he did not want to stay in politics for his entire career.\That was until the phone rang, and someone claimed to be the White House operator. There was a pause. Grady said he thought it a friend playing a prank, so his first words to then Vice-President George H.W. Bush were: ""Very funny. Screw you.""\Read my lips\Grady put off business school for seven months to serve as Bush's speechwriter, then took a leave.\After Grady graduated from Stanford, he flew back to Washington to join the Bush campaign, where he worked with Peggy Noonan, who penned Bush's widely-acclaimed ""kinder, gentler nation"" address in 1988 when he accepted the GOP nomination. Noonan also wrote many of President Ronald Reagan's speeches.\While assembling speeches for Bush, Grady said he came upon a phrase written by another writer for the campaign. Although the origins are uncertain, and Noonan has taken credit for writing it into Bush's acceptance speech, Grady said he liked the phrase and inserted it into Bush's campaign speeches.\""Read my lips: No new taxes.""\That line helped catapult Bush to victory over Democrat Michael Dukakis, and sowed seeds for his defeat four years later.\Grady became the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, working under Darman.\At OMB, Grady oversaw the energy, natural resources and science policy. He helped write the Clean Air Act and designed the cap-and-trade system, which allowed energy plants that produced emissions lower than the requirements to sell credits to older plants that had trouble meeting standards.\But the presidency turned when Bush broke his pledge and agreed to an income tax increase as part of the 1990 deficit reduction deal.\Grady said he doesn't personally favor tax increases, but he said he respected Bush for making the decision nonetheless.\""I was up there and I saw him up close,"" Grady said. ""President Bush knew that deal would cost him politically... He made the judgment to take the short-term political cost to do what was right for the country.""\One day in the early 1990s, Grady received a visit at the White House from another Livingston native: then Seton Hall law school student Chris Christie, a volunteer for Kean who wanted to work on the Bush re-election. After lunch with Christie, Grady picked up the phone and called a veteran Republican hand, attorney William Palatucci, who had also worked on the Kean campaign and would direct the Bush campaign in New Jersey.\The connection proved enormous for Christie. Christie later became a law partner with Palatucci. Palatucci remains one of Christie's top advisers.\By August 1992, Bush was down in the polls by some 20 points to young upstart Arkansas governor, Democrat Bill Clinton, and trying to fend off an independent challenge from metaphor-spinning Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot.\Top aides holed up in the Houstonian Hotel in Houston to craft a Republican convention speech that would get Bush back in the race. But the original speechwriter produced a version that no one liked.\Steven Provost -- a Grady friend who had interned with Grady in Washington, followed him to Trenton and back to Washington -- was tapped with four days left to go to write a speech.\Provost said he spent the next 90 hours without sleeping as he worked on Bush's address.\Provost said he reported every two hours or so a conference room, where Baker, Ailes, Darman and Grady suggested changes and approved content.\The speech -- in which Bush asked, ""Who do you trust?"" -- brought the president to within single digits in the polls.\But Bush lost, and for Grady, it was time to use the business degree.\He became an investment banker for Robertson and Stephens in San Francisco, a firm that helped new technology firms become publicly traded companies during the dot-com boom years.\In 2000, Grady left for another plum financial job: the Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms.\Rubenstein, the Carlyle co-founder and managing director, said in a brief telephone interview he hired Darman to join the firm in 1993, five years before Darman's death. Darman said then the best person who worked with him in government was Grady, Rubenstein said. So Grady came aboard.\Rubenstein, ranked by Forbes as one of the 200 wealthiest people in America, said he was always astounded by Grady's connections.\Grady's connections may have helped Christie again in 2001, as Grady was one of several prominent New Jersey Republicans to lobby then President George W. Bush to appoint Christie as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey.\Grady left Carlyle in 2009, moved to Jackson, Wyo., with his wife, and joined the Cheyenne Capital Fund.\Grady said Palatucci kept him informed about Christie's political progress, and he kept in touch with Christie. He helped out during Christie's 2009 gubernatorial campaign and served on his transition team.\In July, Christie and his family spent their vacation in Jackson, before Christie attended the National Governor's Conference in Salt Lake City.\Grady said his family and the Christie family hiked, biked, swam and played soccer on Grady's lawn. They attended a rodeo. Grady has pictures of the visit stored for keepsake on his iPhone.\Grady currently chairs both the State Investment Council, which manages pension funds for government workers, and the governor's Council of Economic Advisors.\Still, Grady has largely remained only slightly connected to politics for nearly two decades. Former Gov. Kean, in an interview, said he thinks that has to change.\""It would be a shame if someone of his ability didn't get back into public life in a major way,"" Kean said. ""Yes, he's married, and he's had children. He's settled. He's made enough money, I believe. But it is time to get back to the people's business.""\Grady won't share any specific plans for getting back into public life, except for one: to help Christie become president.\""I don't think the issue for Gov. Christie is could he be a good candidate. The leadership he has shown in New Jersey shows what can be done, like with our federal entitlement problem. I think he could raise a lot of money....\""If he ever were to run for president, I would drop what I was doing and do what I could to help him as much as I could,"" Grady added. ""And I've told him that.""\Jason Method: 609-292-5158; jmethod@ njpressmedia.com\Robert Grady\Age: 53\Lives: Jackson, Wyo.\Current positions: Managing Director, Cheyenne Capital Fund; Chair, State Investment Council and Governor's Council of Economic Advisors.\Previous experience: Partner, The Carlyle Group; Deputy Director, U.S. Office of Management and Budget\Speechwriter, President George H.W.

87,"The state Legislature passed bills this week requiring Governor Christie to keep New Jersey in a 10-state program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - a program Christie had vowed to abandon.\When Christie announced in May that he was pulling New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, he called it a ""failure."" He said the program had not changed behavior or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, but had raised the cost of electricity for the state's residents and businesses.\Even though Christie will likely veto the bills, environmentalists saw this week's legislative action as a moral victory.\RGGI is a cap-and-trade program that requires utilities in the 10 participating states to purchase credits for each ton of carbon they emit. The credits are sold through public auctions, and the states use the revenue to fund programs that promote renewable energy and clean-energy technology.\The Christie administration has said the Legislature doesn't have the authority to force the state to stay in the RGGI program. RGGI supporters said legislation passed in 2007, known as the Global Warming Response Act, requires the state to join RGGI. The bills passed this week require New Jersey to stay in the program.\""We are a nation governed by laws. By disregarding the intent of the Legislature, which required New Jersey to be a member of RGGI, Governor Christie is ignoring the will of the people,"" said Assembly Environment Chairman John F. McKeon, D-South Orange.\The Christie administration dismissed that argument, saying the Global Warming Response Act allowed but never required the state to join RGGI.\""The Legislature can grandstand all it wants, but we're pulling out of RGGI,"" said Larry Ragonese, spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection. ""It was never mandated that New Jersey enter this.""\He said the state has informed the RGGI member states that New Jersey will continue to participate through the end of 2011.\Business and conservative groups have called for New Jersey to get out of RGGI, saying the program drives up energy rates because utilities pass along the cost of their carbon credits to customers. Environmentalists say the rate increases are minuscule.\The auctions have earned the states a combined $886 million, of which New Jersey has received $106 million. Christie took $65 million in RGGI auction money last year to help balance the state budget, while at least $30 million has been used for its intended purpose - as grants for 12 large-scale renewable-energy projects.\Credit: E-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com"

Darman said then the best person who worked with him in government was Grady, Rubenstein said. So Grady came aboard.\Rubenstein, ranked by Forbes as one of the 200 wealthiest people in America, said he was always astounded by Grady's connections.\Grady's connections may have helped Christie again in 2001, as Grady was one of several prominent New Jersey Republicans to lobby then President George W.

89,"At a private dinner in New York last December, Robert E. Grady was one of some 18 guests urging Gov.

Some of the guests countered that neither was President Barack Obama in 2008. ""I rest my case,"" Christie shot back.\A month later, Grady pushed again.

90," Experts have bold plan for next president\ America's next president needs to take immediate and aggressive steps to tackle the threat of global warming, a national panel of energy and climate experts warned Tuesday.\ The team of scientists, industrialists and other specialists issued an environmental plan for the next president's first 100 days in office. It is full of bold but politically risky steps, such as demanding a radical rise in automobile mileage standards and increasing flood insurance rates to move homeowners away from vulnerable coastlines.\ The document, the Presidential Climate Action Project, frames global warming as a threat to both national security and the environment but also as an economic opportunity if the United States makes the right investments in clean energy and cutting the carbon emissions blamed for warming the planet.\ ""The economy-wide cost of doing nothing is far more than that of doing something,"" said Ray Anderson, a Georgia businessman, corporate environmental leader and co-chairman of the climate effort. ""There are profits to be earned in a sensible and strong course of action on carbon reduction.""\ In New Jersey, where state leaders have adopted some of the nation's most ambitious targets for cutting carbon emissions, officials welcomed the effort to get the federal government on board.\ ""We have to become energy independent, and that can't be just lip service,"" said Lisa Jackson, the state's Environmental Protection commissioner.\ The Bush administration has refused for years to adopt mandatory greenhouse reductions and it has steered most federal resources toward developing new supplies of coal, oil and gas rather than conservation or carbon-free energy sources like solar and wind.\ ""This issue is all about energy efficiency,"" Jackson said. ""It's all about making our country everything from personal habits to homes to businesses to our places of worship to schools as efficient as possible.""\ The action plan came as international negotiators continued talks in Indonesia for a new treaty on cutting global warming emissions. Two weeks ago, a U.N.-backed panel issued another grim report on the potential impacts of rising temperatures and warned that world leaders had only a few years to act before dangerous climate shifts become inevitable.\ The action plan, organized by the University of Colorado, gathered suggestions of experts across the United States in science and policy, business, government and other areas. It presents the presidential candidates with 300 separate recommendations for changes in federal policies dealing with energy, national security, economic development, transportation and a host of other topics.\ The recommendations range from the arcane (changing electricity rate regulations) to the bold (a call to strip billions of dollars in federal subsidies from the coal, oil and nuclear industries).\ The plan calls for cutting U.S. greenhouse emissions 30 percent by the end of the next decade and 90 percent by midcentury. Fuel economy for cars and trucks would be raised to 200 mpg by 2050 and foreign oil imports virtually eliminated. ""We are united in the sense that national security is at stake,"" said former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart, a Democrat and co-chairman of the project's advisory panel. ""We believe very strongly that we must become independent of Persian Gulf oil as part of this process.""\ Hart likened the scope of the challenge transforming an economy and society built on fossil fuels to what the country faced in World War II. The nation will need ""Rooseveltian"" leadership to overcome it, he said.\ The Colorado group has been in touch with several presidential campaigns and has offered to brief each, he said. A final version of the plan will be released in September in the days leading up the 2008 election.\ If the Bush administration fails to act, the report adds, the next president should approve a request by New Jersey and other states to impose tougher controls on automobile pollution, something the current White House has resisted. Another proposal, sure to raise hackles along the Jersey Shore, says the government should consider higher flood insurance rates or other ways of moving people away from coastal communities made vulnerable by rising seas.\ Ideas like that are bound to spark fights. The energy bill moving through Congress nearly died over suggestions for a much more modest increase in fuel economy and cuts to tax breaks for oil companies.\ Asked if Tuesday's recommendations seemed feasible, Rep. Scott Garrett, R-Wantage, would say only that he will ""consider all sources"" in the global warming debate.\ But others said the political ground was shifting. More than 80 municipalities in New Jersey have passed resolutions promising to cut local greenhouse pollution, noted Randall Solomon, director of the New Jersey Sustainable State Institute at Rutgers University. New Jersey has promised statewide cuts in emissions and rule changes to promote clean energy, though environmentalists complain the state has done little more than set lofty goals so far.\ Solomon, who contributed to the report, said some of the suggestions had already been adopted by presidential candidates.\ ""In terms of the politics of this, the issue's not going away,"" he said.\ ***\ (SIDEBARS)\ Climate panel's suggestions\ A panel of energy and global warming experts has a ""climate action plan"" for the next president's first 100 days. Among their recommendations:\ * Reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2020 and 90 percent by 2050.\ * Raise car and truck fuel economy to 50 mpg by 2020 and 200 mpg by 2050.\ * Establish a cap-and-auction system to set a market-driven price on greenhouse emissions; use revenues to help those least able to cope with climate change.\ * Make all new buildings carbon-neutral by 2030.\ * Immediately end federal subsidies for fossil and nuclear energy; redirect the funds to research low- and no-carbon fuels.\ * Drastically reduce U.S. oil consumption with a goal of nearly eliminating oil imports by midcentury.\ * Make the federal government a carbon-neutral enterprise.\ * Provide $1 billion in awards over five years to encourage energy technology breakthroughs; allocate $1 billion yearly to states and localities for energy efficiency and carbon-cutting projects.\ * Set national goals for renewable energy use and energy efficiency.\ * Reform international development and trade policy to stop subsidizing energy that produces greenhouse gases in developing nations. Start supporting energy efficiency and clean-energy projects.\ * Create 40 million ""green"" jobs in renewable-energy and energy- efficiency sector.\ For the full report with 300 recommendations, go to: climateactionproject.com.\ Source: climateactionproject.com\ ***\ Where candidates stand\ Democratic and Republican presidential contenders differ widely on solutions to global warming and how vital an issue it is. Democrats envision the U.S. as a world leader in reducing pollution and minimizing climate change. Republicans identify the country's dependence on foreign fuel as a national security issue and call for greater reliance on domestic sources of energy. But even among those in the same party, there are differences:\ LEADING REPUBLICANS\ RUDY GIULIANI\ * Will not support limits on greenhouse gas emissions or higher mileage standards for automobiles.\ * Calls for tapping domestic sources of energy, including ethanol, clean coal and nuclear power. Each has to be expanded 10 percent to 20 percent.\ * Calls for greater reliance on hybrid vehicles.\ MIKE HUCKABEE\ * Supports energy sources that do not have a greenhouse gas effect: nuclear, wind, solar and clean coal.\ * Calls for the United States to achieve independence from foreign sources of fuel by the end of his second term.\ * Views a cleaner environment as a spiritual issue.\ JOHN McCAIN\ * Supports cap-and-trade system in which corporations are rewarded for deep cuts in harmful energy emissions.\ * Supports reducing carbon emissions by harnessing market forces that will bring advanced technologies, such as nuclear energy, to the market faster.\ * Calls for a reduction in dependence on foreign suppliers of energy.\ MITT ROMNEY\ * Supports new fuel sources, including offshore drilling, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, nuclear power and ethanol.\ * Believes that the United States cannot act unilaterally to reduce greenhouse gases if developing nations such as China and India continue to increase their output.\ * Believes Kyoto-style mandates would kill jobs.\ LEADING DEMOCRATS:\ HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON\ * Co-sponsored legislation in the Senate to cut greenhouse gases 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050.\ * Supports the creation of a $50 billion fund to research clean energy technologies.\ * As a senator, voted in favor of efforts to increase auto fuel standards to 40 mpg by 2015.\ JOHN EDWARDS\ * Calls for capping greenhouse pollution by 80 percent by 2050.\ * Would force polluters to spend $13 billion a year on renewable energy.\ * Supports reducing oil imports and raising car fuel efficiency to 40 mpg by 2016.\ BARACK OBAMA\ * Co-sponsored in Senate a cap-and-trade system that aims for 80 percent emissions reduction by 2050.\ * Calls for a $150 billion investment over 10 years to boost clean energy and create ""green"" jobs.\ * Would provide the auto industry with breaks in health insurance costs if they invest half that savings in technology that yields more fuel-efficient vehicles.\ ***\ E-mail: nussbaum@northjersey.com\ ***"
91,"Environmental groups filed suit against the Christie administration Wednesday in a bid to get New Jersey to rejoin a multistate program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\The suit argues that Governor Christie violated state law when he did not seek any public comment or input before pulling New Jersey out of the program last year.\Christie administration officials said Wednesday that they did not violate state law and that they have no plans to rejoin the coalition, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI.\RGGI is a cap-and-trade program adopted by nine Northeastern states. Power-generating companies in the participating states must purchase credits through public auctions for every ton of carbon they emit. Revenue from the sale of credits goes to the states to invest in renewable energy programs.\""There was nothing illegal about our withdrawal from RGGI,"" said Michael Drewniak, Christie's spokesman. ""Participation in the RGGI consortium was via a contractual arrangement with provisions for any state to pull out with notice and without penalty. No one was locked into RGGI.""\Christie announced early in 2011 that New Jersey would withdraw by the end of that year.\The suit was filed in the appellate division of state Superior Court by two environmental advocacy groups, Environment New Jersey and the Natural Resources Defense Council.\""Governor Christie unilaterally made his decision to leave RGGI, without taking any input from stakeholders or the public,"" said Matt Elliott of Environment New Jersey. ""His actions are not only bad public policy, but also illegal."" State law requires public input before state regulations are changed.\Larry Ragonese, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said the state took action to withdraw from RGGI ""in close cooperation with the Attorney General's Office and we believe we are in full compliance with the law, so we disagree with the premise of the suit.""\Environmentalists have argued that RGGI has helped reduce emissions and increase jobs in the clean energy sector. The Legislature passed a bill last year requiring the state to rejoin RGGI, but Christie vetoed it. Last month, lawmakers passed similar legislation, and Christie is expected to veto that as well.\When he pulled New Jersey out of RGGI, Christie acknowledged that climate change is real, that human activity contributes to the changes and that greenhouse gas emissions are increasing. But he called the program a failure, and said it only caused higher electricity rates for New Jerseyans.\""Governor Christie has been very clear about this issue - he thinks RGGI is just another tax on New Jersey businesses and residents and that it has not been effective,"" Ragonese said.

92," The U.S. Supreme Court has joined the heated debate over global warming by agreeing to hear a dispute over whether the federal government should regulate greenhouse gases, particularly emissions from cars.\ The high court's decision Monday to rule on a lawsuit that New Jersey and other states brought against the Bush administration set up what could be a precedent-setting decision on the environment. It could bring a definitive ruling on whether the Clean Air Act compels the federal Environmental Protection Agency to restrict carbon- dioxide emissions from autos, rather than relying on voluntary climate change measures by industry.\ ""Today's decision is significant because it means the nation's high court will now consider our argument as to why the EPA must exercise [its] authority and not be allowed to abdicate its responsibility in this critical area,"" said Lee Moore, spokesman for New Jersey Attorney General Zulima Farber.\ ""EPA's lack of leadership in this area has been startling,"" said Lisa Jackson, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. ""It's required the states to take up the mantle of leadership on global warming.""\ The EPA released a statement vowing to defend its policies before the high court as being both environmentally and economically sound.\ ""These national and international voluntary programs are helping achieve reductions now while saving millions of dollars, as well as providing clean, affordable energy,"" the agency said.\ Carbon dioxide, which is released during the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline, is the leading so-called ""greenhouse"" gas because as it drifts into the atmosphere it traps the earth's heat much like a greenhouse.\ Just last fall, Princeton researchers projected that melting polar ice caps could cause sea levels to rise and swallow between 1 percent and 3 percent of New Jersey's coastline over the next century.\ ""We are more vulnerable than other places because of our coastline,"" Jackson said.\ The lawsuit now before the Supreme Court is one of several efforts that New Jersey and other Northeastern states have launched in the face of what they consider to be lax clean-air regulation by the Bush-led EPA.\ New Jersey is a plaintiff in three other pending lawsuits over air quality, one over emissions from a coal-fired plant in Pennsylvania, another over the nation's fuel economy standards and a third over the EPA's elimination of a requirement that power plants install better smokestack controls when they upgrade.\ New Jersey has also joined an alliance of states to force power plants in the region to participate in a mandatory cap-and-trade emissions program for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\ In 2005, the state decided to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, a step the EPA has declined to take. Two years ago, lawmakers in New Jersey also voted to opt out of the auto emission rules set by the federal government, choosing instead to begin in 2009 following stricter standards set by the state of California.\ The Bush administration maintains that carbon dioxide unlike other chemicals that must be controlled to assure healthy air is not a pollutant under the federal clean air law, and that even if it were, the EPA has discretion over whether to regulate it.\ A dozen states, a number of cities and various environmental groups sued. The states argue that the Environmental Protection Agency is obligated to limit carbon-dioxide emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act because as the primary ""greenhouse"" gas causing a warming of the earth, carbon dioxide is a pollutant.\ The states asked the Supreme Court to take up the case after a federal appeals court sided with the administration in a sharply divided ruling.\ Industry groups are likely to weigh in on the case.\ ""Fundamentally, we don't think carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and so we don't think these attempts [to require reductions] are a good idea,"" said John Felmy, chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group representing oil and gas producers.\ Craig Oren, an environmental law professor at Rutgers University, said the case isn't likely to turn on the science as much as it will on the language of the Clean Air Act, and whether its sometimes broad language specifically requires the EPA to regulate a gas that causes climate change conditions.\ ""A strong argument can be made that the EPA does have that authority,"" Oren said. ""But then the next question becomes, 'Has the EPA acted reasonably in not using that authority?' ""\ In addition to New Jersey, the states involved in the suit are California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\ They were joined by a number of cities including Baltimore, New York City and Washington, the Pacific island of America Samoa, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth.\ ***\ (SIDEBARS, PAGE A07)\ Other rulings\ The Supreme Court also released decisions in five other cases Monday. The justices:\ * Ruled, 6-3, that Vermont's limits on contributions and spending in political campaigns are too restrictive and improperly hinder the ability of candidates to raise money and speak to voters.\ * Ruled, 5-4, that Kansas' death penalty law does not violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\ * Decided by a 7-2 vote that prosecutors' failure to submit to a jury a factor used in sentencing is not grounds for automatic reversals of convictions.\ * Ruled, 6-3, that parents cannot collect fees for experts they use while prevailing in lawsuits seeking to force public school districts to pay for the private education of their disabled children.\ * Ruled, 5-4, that defendants are automatically entitled to a new trial if their choice of a privately retained defense lawyer is wrongly blocked.\ ***\ 5 cases to go\ The Supreme Court will be in session Wednesday, with five cases still to be decided. They are:\ * Guantanamo trials: Whether President Bush has overstepped his authority with military war-crimes trials for foreigners held in the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\ * Texas redistricting: Whether to throw out all or part of a 2003 congressional map promoted by former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.\ * Insanity: Whether to strike down Arizona's insanity defense law, in an appeal brought on behalf of a schizophrenic teenager who killed a police officer.\ * Foreign suspects: If two foreigners convicted of violent crimes in the United States have to be given new trials because police did not tell them they could seek legal help from their countries' governments, as required by a 1969 treaty.\ * Inmate newspapers: Whether states can keep troublesome inmates from reading most newspapers and magazines.\ The Associated Press\ ***\ This article contains material from The Associated Press."
93,"Governor Christie has refused to join a coalition of eight Eastern states seeking to curb air pollution blowing in from Midwest and Southern coal-fired power plants that help make New Jersey's air quality among the worst in the nation.\The move to reject a petition filed Monday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency follows a series of similar actions by Christie to withdraw from multistate initiatives designed to address environmental problems. It also adds to criticism that Christie, a potential Republican presidential candidate, makes some decisions based on appeasing red and swing states rather than looking out solely for the interests of New Jerseyans.\All eight governors who signed on to the coalition are Democrats. The three who did not are Republicans.\""He's turning his back on the lungs of New Jersey residents,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of the advocacy group Environment New Jersey, about Christie. ""It's clear Midwest power plants contribute to the poor air quality here. And it's clear Governor Christie is not doing his job if he's not protecting New Jersey residents from this.""\Both a Christie spokesman and a state Department of Environmental Protection spokesman did not return repeated requests for comment on Monday.\The petition seeks commitments from nine upwind states -- Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia -- to protect the health of downwind residents and to level the playing field for businesses.\""We're paying a steep public health and economic price for the failure of upwind states to make investments needed to operate power plants and industrial facilities in a clean and efficient manner,"" said Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who is spearheading the petition. ""Now is the ideal time to get the upwind polluters to take action.""\The petition was signed by the Democratic governors of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont that belong to the Ozone Transport Region, a group of 11 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states under EPA orders to reduce air pollution. Along with Christie, the Republican governors of Pennsylvania and Maine refused to sign.\A spokesman for Malloy said he didn't know why Christie, who suffers from asthma, or the other governors did not join the petition.\""New Jersey is a member of Ozone Transport Commission and, as such, they were aware of the petition and they were invited to be part of it,"" said David Bednarz, a spokesman for Malloy. ""You would need to speak with them to find out why they took the position they did.""\All of this comes as Christie continues to raise his national profile. As the new chairman of the Republican Governors Association, he is expected to crisscross the country next year raising money and supporting GOP candidates in the 36 states with gubernatorial races.\But some Republicans like U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., continue to attack Christie for not being conservative enough to merit the GOP nomination in the 2016 primaries. Joining a coalition that seeks to curb fossil fuel use in states heavily dependent on them could further increase those criticisms.\Politics aside, the petition asks the EPA to force the nine states to join the Ozone Transport Region, which would compel power companies to install cleaner technologies at their plants while using cleaner fuels to generate power. The petition says the Eastern states have spent billions retrofitting their power plants while the nine other states have done little to make their emissions cleaner.\In New Jersey, PSEG Power has overhauled its coal-burning power plants in Mercer County and Jersey City to reduce soot emissions by 99 percent in recent years. The state also launched a program to retrofit diesel engines in trucks, buses and locomotives.\Initiatives like that helped New Jersey reach a milestone this year when the EPA announced that every county in the state had met the federal standards for soot, a form of pollution that leads to increased asthma and heart attacks as well as premature deaths and cancer rates.\But the latest air quality survey by the American Lung Association showed that all of New Jersey still suffered from high ozone days despite declines in soot.\All 21 counties surveyed received a D or F for an excessive number of high ozone days from 2009 to 2011, according to the association's ""State of the Air"" report in April. Ozone, or smog, is created when volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen react with each other in the presence of sunlight. Diesel- and gasoline-burning vehicles produce both types of pollutants.\Despite the poor air, Christie has pulled New Jersey out of multistate initiatives and lawsuits begun by his predecessors.\In 2011, Christie withdrew New Jersey from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state cap-and-trade system to limit power plant emissions associated with climate change. He argued the plan did not work and increased electric costs for state residents.\Last year, he withdrew New Jersey from a lawsuit filed by environmentalists and other states that argues the federal standard to restrict ozone emissions is too weak. A spokesman at the time said the state didn't want to waste resources on litigation when the Obama administration was planning to roll out new ozone standards in 2014.\Christie also pulled New Jersey out of another multistate lawsuit to defend an EPA rule that restricts carbon emissions that cross state lines from coal plants in the Midwest.\Despite those moves, Christie has targeted a few dirty plants for a reduction in emissions. New Jersey appealed to the EPA to force a coal-fired power plant in Portland, Pa., to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide. And the DEP has participated in lawsuits against the owners of a plant in western Pennsylvania and against Allegheny Energy Inc. to cut emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that blow into New Jersey.\But O'Malley said cherry-picking power plants does not solve the problem. ""If [Christie] really cared, he would not call for one or two to be cleaned, he would call for all of them to be cleaned,"" he said.\Monday's petition is a formal process allowed by the federal Clean Air Act. States can ask the EPA to add any state to an air quality region such as the Ozone Transport Region if there is reason to believe it is causing violations of air quality standards elsewhere. The EPA administrator is required to address a petition within 18 months.\Credit: Email: fallon@northjersey.com"
94,"
Gov. Chris Christie recently walked New Jersey's beaches to draw attention to the state's tourism industry, but his visits to the coast also put a focus on his environmental record.
\
Christie has championed the environment in some ways, winning praise for efforts to protect ocean and water quality and to preserve open space. But he also has been criticized on issues concerning greenhouse gases, renewable energy, and beach access.
\
Environmentalists were unhappy with his vetoing of two bills Friday that would have kept New Jersey in a regional greenhouse gas reduction initiative and would have allowed creation of local stormwater utilities that could have imposed fees in Ocean County. Assemblyman Jack McKeon, D-Essex, is seeking a legislative vote to override the greenhouse gas bill veto.
\
""He has been active,"" said Tim Dillingham, director of the American Littoral Society, a coastal conservation group. ""Like everything else with this governor, when he decides to get involved with something, he takes a position.""
\
During the week of Aug. 7, Christie visited several beach towns, including Ocean City and Atlantic City, to promote the shore and his record of protecting it. That prompted Assembly Environment Committee Chairman McKeon, D-Essex, to criticize Christie for vetoing legislation to control Barnegat Bay pollution by allowing Ocean County municipalities to tax developers and by setting pollution discharge standards.
\
But Barnegat Bay also was the focus of one of the governor's key environmental victories. He signed into law three bills aimed at reversing the bay's deterioration, including restrictions on use of fertilizer that gets washed into the water. Other new laws require soil to be restored after road projects are built and to help repair ineffective stormwater basins.
\
""I think he really moved the state forward in addressing pollution problems in Barnegat Bay, where the state had turned a blind eye for many years,"" Dillingham said.
\
Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, Somerset, chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, agreed the Barnegat Bay laws Christie signed are important, although he said they were advanced by Democrats. Still, he gave Christie credit for appropriating money to preserve open space.
\
Environmentalists have opposed his administration's proposed reworking of the state's energy master plan, charging that it retrenches New Jersey's commitment to renewable energy, such as wind and solar power.
\
Previously, the plan had set a goal of having renewable energy account for 30 percent of the state's energy usage by 2021. Christie has said a more realistic goal is 22.5 percent.
\
""When the governor ran for election, he promoted himself as a champion of clean energy,"" said Christie Guhl, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Sierra Club. ""Since then, we've seen a lot of setbacks.""
\
She noted that Christie also pulled New Jersey out of a 10-state plan aimed at capping greenhouse gas emissions. The program required power producers to buy credits if gas emissions exceeded certain levels.
\
Christie said the cap-and-trade agreement, which was vehemently opposed by conservatives, taxed businesses without improving emission levels.
\
Administration officials defended Christie's record on renewable energy. The governor has been an advocate of offshore wind projects. He signed a law providing tax breaks to companies developing offshore wind farms and has worked with federal officials and other states to encourage wind energy.
\
More than 10,000 solar energy projects have been installed statewide, the Governor's Office says.
\
Many environmentalists have criticized the Department of Environmental Protection under Christie for proposing to allow individual beach towns to develop rules concerning public access to the beach. Dillingham said tourist towns promote use of their beaches, but more affluent residential shore towns discourage access to beaches.
\
By not having uniform rules statewide, the DEP is allowing certain towns to keep out poorer residents, he said.
\
""The coast is a public trust. There shouldn't be certain beaches for the haves and certain beaches for the have-nots,"" Dillingham said.
\
Michele Byers, director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, charged that Christie does not appear to understand that parts of the ecosystem depend on each other, and that the state's economy and quality of life depend on the environment.
\
She said Christie has not shown support for regional planning and has allowed sewer extensions and development in sensitive areas, noting that protecting water quality requires vigilance at local planning levels.
\
Byers and others said the DEP is considering changes to the way it adopts environmental rules, and they worry the changes would undercut protections in place to foster economic development.
\
""New Jersey worked hard to get regional planning in place. To see a governor risk that work, I think, outweighs the good he has done,"" Byers said.
\
However, even his critics agree they like parts of Christie's record. And his supporters say he deserves more credit than he gets.
\
""I would give him an A for being a progressive leader, a thoughtful environmentalist,"" said Sen. Jennifer Beck, R-Monmouth, Mercer.

95,"Lisa Jackson said on Thursday that she is stepping down next month as head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\Jackson, who headed the state Department of Environmental Protection under Gov. Jon S. Corzine and was Corzine's chief of staff for two weeks in December 2008 before taking the EPA position, didn't say what she plans to do next. Published reports from Washington-based media outlets say she has talked about returning to New Jersey.\There has been speculation for months that she could seek the Democratic nomination for governor. She spoke to New Jersey's delegation breakfast in September at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., though her comments were mostly apolitical. A column this month in The Washington Post said she might wind up as a candidate for Princeton University's next president.\""I will leave the EPA confident the ship is sailing in the right direction, and ready in my own life for new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference,"" Jackson, 50, said in a prepared statement.\The agency's first black administrator, Jackson, a New Orleans native, received engineering degrees from Tulane University and Princeton. She worked for the EPA in Washington and New York for 16 years, then in 2002 became an assistant commissioner at the DEP, first for compliance and enforcement and later for land-use management, before being promoted to head the agency in 2006.\Jackson lived in East Windsor while working at the DEP.\""Washington's loss is New Jersey's gain,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. ""We believe she will have a future here whether it is working at a university or think tank on climate change and other environmental issues. We also believe she has a future in politics and elected office. We believe she will keep fighting for the environment and things she believes in.""\The Obama administration's chief environmental watchdog is stepping down after nearly four years marked by high-profile brawls over global warming, the Keystone XL oil pipeline, new controls on coal-fired plants and several other hot-button issues that affect the nation's economy and people's health.\GOP resistance\Jackson constantly found herself caught between administration pledges to solve thorny environmental problems and steady resistance from Republicans and industrial groups that complained the agency's rules destroyed jobs and made it harder for American companies to compete internationally.\The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said last year that Jackson would need her own parking spot at the Capitol because he planned to bring her in so frequently for questioning. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called for her firing, a stance that had little downside during the GOP primary.\Historically, Cabinet members and Cabinet-level officers looking to move on will leave at the beginning of a president's second term. Jackson will leave sometime after President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address, which typically is in late January.\Obama said Jackson has been ""an important part of my team."" He thanked her for serving and praised her ""unwavering commitment"" to the public's health.\""Under her leadership, the EPA has taken sensible and important steps to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, including implementing the first national standard for harmful mercury pollution, taking important action to combat climate change under the Clean Air Act and playing a key role in establishing historic fuel economy standards that will save the average American family thousands of dollars at the pump, while also slashing carbon pollution,"" Obama said.\Environmental activist groups and other supporters lauded Jackson for the changes she was able to make, but industry representatives said some might have come at an economic cost. Groups also noted that she leaves a large, unfinished agenda.\""There has been no fiercer champion of our health and our environment than Lisa Jackson, and every American is better off today than when she took office nearly four years ago,"" said Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.\Beinecke noted that Jackson's successor will inherit an unfinished agenda, including the need to issue new health protections against carbon pollution from existing power plants.\Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate subcommittee on clean air, called Jackson's tenure a ""breath of fresh air"" and credited her for setting historic fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, and for finalizing clean air standards.\But Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, said Jackson presided over some of the most expensive environmental rules in EPA history.\""Agency rules have been used as blunt attempts to marginalize coal and other solid fossil fuels and to make motor fuels more costly at the expense of industrial jobs, energy security and economic recovery,"" Segal said. ""The record of the agency over the same period in overestimating benefits to major rules has not assisted the public in determining whether these rules have been worth it.""\Other environmental groups, however, praised Jackson's clean air efforts.\Larry Schweiger, head of the National Wildlife Federation, cited her climate change work and efforts to reduce carbon pollution.\""Notwithstanding the difficult economic and political challenges EPA faced, her agency was directly responsible for saving the lives of tens of thousands of Americans and improving the health of millions throughout the country,"" said S. William Becker of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. ""She will be sorely missed.""\Tittel agreed.\""We are very sorry to see Lisa Jackson go,"" he said. ""She has been an environmental champion and friend at the EPA and has been the best administrator that environmentalists have worked with in the EPA's 40-year history. She has had many accomplishments as EPA administrator in cleaning up toxic sites, going after air pollution, protecting our water, air and land. She passed the Soot, Mercury and CARE rules. She has a strong record at a time when moving the environment forward has been difficult.""\Environmental groups had high expectations for the Obama administration after eight years of President George W. Bush, a Texas oilman who rebuffed agency scientists and refused act on climate change. Jackson came into office promising a more active EPA. But she soon learned that changes would not occur as quickly as she had hoped.\Disappointments\Jackson watched as a Democratic-led effort to reduce global warming emissions passed the House in 2009 but was then abandoned by the Senate as economic concerns became the priority. The concept behind the bill, referred to as cap-and-trade, would have established a system where power companies bought and sold pollution rights.\""That's a revolutionary message for our country,"" Jackson said at a Paris conference shortly after accepting the job.\Jackson experienced another big setback last year when the administration scrubbed a clean-air regulation aimed at reducing health-threatening smog. Republican lawmakers had been hammering the president over the proposed rule, accusing him of making it harder for companies to create jobs.\She also vowed to better control toxic coal ash after a massive spill in Tennessee, but that regulation has yet to be finalized more than four years after the spill.\Victories\Jackson had some victories, too. During her tenure, the administration finalized a new rule doubling fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. The requirements will be phased in over 13 years and eventually require all new vehicles to average 54.5 mpg, up from 28.6 mpg at the end of last year.\She shepherded another rule that forces power plants to control mercury and other toxic pollutants for the first time. Previously, the nation's coal- and oil-fired power plants had been allowed to run without addressing their full environmental and public health costs.\Jackson also helped persuade the administration to table the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have brought carbon-heavy tar sands oil from Canada to refineries in Texas.\""Lisa Jackson fought for the environment every day, and we are concerned she may have left out of frustration,"" Tittel said. ""There are some big issues that we really need her leadership on."""
96,"President-elect Barack Obama on Monday officially named former New Jersey environmental chief Lisa Jackson to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\Jackson is part of a team of environmental and energy officials that Obama introduced at a Chicago press conference:\* Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize winner and University of California at Berkeley professor, to head the Energy Department.\* Carol Browner, who headed the EPA during the Clinton administration, to serve as the top Obama administration official on climate and energy policy.\* Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment, to head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.\Obama said Jackson ""helped make her state a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions"" and shares his goals for the nation.\At the press conference, Jackson promised to tackle air pollution, toxic chemicals and development issues.\""There is simply no higher calling for me than to lead this vital agency at this vital time,"" she said. She also thanked her husband, Kenny, and her two sons, who were in the audience, for their support.\Jackson, a chemical engineer and 16-year veteran of the EPA, spent the past two and a half years as head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, where she generated generally positive reviews from both environmentalists and industry advocates. She became Governor Corzine's chief of staff on Dec. 1. Jackson has been a member of Obama's energy and natural resources transition team.\If confirmed by the Senate, Jackson, 46, would become the first African-American to head the EPA, and the second from New Jersey to head the agency in the past decade. Former Gov. Christie Whitman was President Bush's first EPA administrator.\On Monday afternoon, Corzine said: ""Even though I lament her loss on behalf of the state of New Jersey, I am galvanized by the prospect of having one of our own showcased on a national stage with the opportunity to preserve our birthright for future generations. Lisa is up to the challenge.""\Environmentalists said one of Jackson's key achievements in New Jersey was guiding a plan through the state legislature that mandates cuts in global warming emissions. Under Jackson, New Jersey has also joined a 10-state regional cap-and-trade program designed to use market forces to get companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\""She has been one of the strongest DEP commissioners we've had in a long time,"" said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey, an environmental advocacy group. ""There's no question global warming is the biggest challenge of our time, and she's got a ton of experience on the issue.""\Those who have dealt with her say she is a practical consensus-builder.\""She's smart, thoughtful and works extremely well with stakeholders,"" said S. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. ""Being an engineer, she knows how things operate and what works on the ground, and that will give her a leg up over some previous EPA administrators.""\Industry representatives also spoke well of Jackson's tenure in New Jersey. ""She's a very good pick. We haven't always agreed, but she had always given our members the opportunity to give their point of view from a scientific-based perspective,"" said Hal Bozarth, executive director of the Chemistry Council of New Jersey, which represents the state's chemical industry.\""She understands from an economic view there needs to be a way for manufacturing, which provides jobs and builds wealth, to continue to exist,"" he said. ""She knows there ought to be a place for them to sit at the table.""\Those opinions, however, were not unanimous.\In an open letter to Obama, Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, harshly criticized Jackson's tenure at the DEP. Her actions as commissioner, Rauch wrote, ""have been nothing short of appalling,"" and ""raise troubling questions about her fitness to run an agency of much greater size, complexity and significance.""Ruch noted that the EPA took over several Superfund cleanups last summer that the DEP had been overseeing after the EPA's inspector general sharply criticized both the DEP and EPA for failing to clean up several of the worst toxic sites in New Jersey, including two in the Meadowlands.\But other environmentalists dismiss such criticisms, saying many of the problems that Ruch cites Jackson merely inherited. They also argue that she has stood up to her boss, Governor. Corzine, at times to push for environmental policies.\""On numerous occasions Jackson openly disagreed with Governor Corzine and fought to stop environmental weakening by the state legislature,"" said Jeff Tittel, of the New Jersey Sierra Club.\Jackson will have a well-placed New Jersey ally as her nomination goes through the Senate confirmation process. New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg chairs a subcommittee on the Environment and Public Works Committee, where Jackson's confirmation process would begin.\Edward McBride, Corzine's chief counsel, has been named his new chief of staff. McBride will be replaced by attorney William Castner Jr. in the chief counsel's office. Castner recently served as the executive director of the state Assembly Democrats.\***\Colorado senator tapped to head Interior\President-elect Barack Obama will name Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar his interior secretary later this week and has chosen Chicago schools chief Arne Duncan to serve as education secretary, sources said Monday.\Salazar is a Democratic first-term Colorado senator who has established a name for himself on public lands and energy resources issues.\Duncan has run the country's third-biggest school district for the past seven years.

The Record will update this list as needed with the status on these promises as Murphy moves through his tenure.\The Record will classify each promise into three categories: Promise launched, promise kept and promise broken, with an explanation for each. But because the Murphy administration is so new, many of the promises will not be classified at all.\Promise: Pass a millionaire's tax\Murphy has supported raising taxes on New Jersey's highest earners for a while, and he has not moved off his position despite wavering by other Democratic leaders.\""Everything we've talked about this entire campaign is to back the truck up and get back to reinvesting in the middle class and asking those, the biggest among us, the wealthiest among us, to pay their fair share,"" Murphy said in November.\Unlike past attempts by Democrats to pass a tax on high earners, Murphy said on MTP Daily on Jan. 17 that he wants a true millionaire's tax.\""When we talk about a millionaire's tax, that's a millionaire,"" Murphy said. ""We'll figure it out because the middle class needs, in our state, at all costs to be rescued,"" he added.\Promise: Create a state bank\This was one of Murphy's big policy ideas at the outset of his campaign. He envisions it to invest tax dollars in small businesses, student loans and infrastructure projects and offer low-interest loans.\""I can look back at periods in this state under the leadership of both or either party, when we were both fiscally responsible, proudly progressive and we dreamt and took chances and took risks and embraced big ideas,"" Murphy said at a gubernatorial forum held by the New Jersey Bankers Association in April 2017.

Let's again think deeply and do more,"" he added.\He told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in March 2017 that the bank would be owned by the residents of New Jersey ""and the business that it does would be restricted to New Jersey.""\Promise: $15 hourly minimum wage\Murphy made this one of his top campaign promises and said on Jan. 17, his first full day in office, that it is ""high on that list"" of his legislative priorities. But Murphy favors a ""clean"" bill to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and said last March during a forum with New Jersey Working Families Alliance that he would veto what the forum moderator called a ""watered down"" proposal.\Promise: Guarantee earned sick leave\Paid sick leave, like $15 minimum wage, is another one of Murphy's central promises that he included to be ""high on that list"" of policy priorities early in his term. At a Jan. 17 round table in Newark on the two topics, Murphy said that even though about a dozen towns have passed sick leave ordinances, ""we have 565 communities in our state and we need a statewide agenda, we need a statewide law that ensures earned sick leave.""\Promise: Equal pay for equal work\Murphy aims to close the gender wage gap with a statewide law. On inauguration day he signed an executive order, his first, prohibiting state agencies from asking about a job applicant's pay history, saying employers should ""pay people based on what their job is, not on what their past pay was."" His campaign website said that he would sign a bill that ""strengthens penalties for wage discrimination, bans employers from asking job applicants for their salary history, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss compensation.""\On inauguration day he called for lawmakers to deliver.\""They don't need urging on this one, trust me, they lead on this one,"" he said on inauguration day. ""Send the bill to my desk to make this simple and commonsense practice state law. As I said earlier, I will sign it.""\Promise: Create a new retirement plan for employees of small businesses.\According to his campaign website, ""Phil will offer, just as a growing number of states do, a simple, opt-in retirement plan for small business employees. Doing so will help ensure that all workers in our state can adequately save for their retirement.""\Promise: Make home ownership affordable and accessible.\According to his website, Murphy plans to achieve this by ""stopping Governor Christie's practice of diverting affordable housing funds to plug holes in the budget; expanding counseling programs to keep people in their homes and repurposing foreclosed properties as affordable housing; expanding tax credits to create new housing; and lowering property taxes by funding our schools, incentivizing shared services, and restoring rebates to low-income, seniors and disabled residents.""\Promise: Expand Earned Income Tax Credit\The earned income tax credit, or EITC, is a state benefit intended to help poor and low-income households. Christie had cut the state credit percentage relative to the federal credit in leaner years, but he raised it to 35 percent of the federal credit in 2017, his final year in office.\Murphy wants to raise the earned income tax credit to 40 percent of the federal level, his website said, ""so that working families can lift themselves out of poverty.""\Promise: Create a new child care and caregiver tax credit\This didn't get much attention during the campaign, so there aren't many specifics. Murphy told the AARP Bulletin that he would create a credit similar to the state's child-care tax credit and, the bulletin wrote, ""educate caregivers about how they can use the New Jersey Family Leave Act and make it more accessible.""\Promise: Close loopholes for ""wealthy individuals and large corporations""\Murphy talked often about closing loopholes without identifying them to help bring in revenue.\""We're going to stand for tax fairness,"" he said in the Jan. 17 MTP Daily interview. ""If you're a hedge fund and you're getting away with carried interest that we should close as a loophole at the federal [level] we're going to find a way to do that at the state level, I hope with other allied states. If you're a big corporation that's living off of loopholes,"" he added, ""we're going to close those loopholes.""\Promise: Divest pension funds from hedge funds and private equity\This is one of the ways, along with closing loopholes and raising taxes, that Murphy plans to raise about $1.3 billion to support his policy ideas. In an interview with The Record last April, he said that the state pays ""exorbitant fees to hedge funds and private equity managers"" but ""the evidence is overwhelmingly the case you no longer get what you pay for.""\""The space is overcrowded, the returns are mediocre, the fees are exorbitant. That's one obvious area,"" to save money, he said. ""Probably not the only area, but it's the area that I'd look to first.""\The State Investment Council, already facing criticism in Gov. Chris Christie's later years for its hedge fund investments, began scaling back its allocations in 2016 and seeking better fee structures.\Promise: Establish a state-level Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and strengthen existing regulations in light of President Trump's efforts to roll-back the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.\Murphy has not spoken much about specifics on this idea, but said when he named Assemblywoman Marlene Caride his choice to be the next Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner that it is up to the state to push back against what he views as harmful policies of Republican President Donald Trump. Murphy specifically named the administration's actions to take control of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as the sort of ""destruction that's coming at us from Washington.""\Promise: Prosecute financial fraud\This is another promise light on details but was included on Murphy's multi-step plan of ""ending Wall Street's influence on State Street."" The state Attorney General's office already does prosecute financial fraud with regularity.\Promise: Reclaim the innovation economy\Murphy often talked about New Jersey being ""Silicon Valley before there was a Silicon Valley."" According to Murphy's website, he wants to return New Jersey to its technological glory by:\""Launching a ""Computer Science for All"" initiative to offer computer science education to every public school student; partnering with companies to expand access to science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, internships and vocational programs; providing loan forgiveness for STEM educators in high-need schools and creating a new STEM-educator fellowship program to recruit and train a new class of STEM teachers.""\Murphy said he would also establish a Grant Management Office ""to make sure we get our fair share of federal funds for research and development,"" increase state funding for research and development, provide affordable, high-speed internet for all New Jerseyans and configure public spaces to be digitally and universally accessible; convene an ""innovation cabinet,"" increase access to capital for small businesses and startups and forgive student loans for new graduates launching businesses in ""under-served and distressed communities.""\Promise: Restore Christie's annual $7.5 million cut to Planned Parenthood\Christie repeatedly cut funding to Planned Parenthood and vetoed efforts from the Democratic Legislature to pass annual funding of $7.5 million. Murphy promised to restore that funding throughout the campaign, and during his inaugural address called on lawmakers to send him a bill to do so.\""To my partners in the Legislature: I ask you to send me the bills, among others, to reaffirm our support for women's health and Planned Parenthood,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Lower insurance premiums by reining in excessive out-of-network costs\Lawmakers in Trenton have tried for nearly a decade to end surprise medical bills due to out-of-network costs. Murphy has made doing so part of his plan to raise about $1.3 billion in revenues.\When he named Dr. Shareef Elnahal his choice to be the next health commissioner on Jan. 10, Murphy said that one of his challenges is going to be ""helping close the out-of-network loopholes that erode affordability."" Murphy likely has an ally in Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, who, before being named to lead the chamber, sponsored legislation to rein in excessive costs.\Promise: Work to identify the state's 75,000 uninsured children and enroll them in health coverage\Murphy listed this promise on his campaign website, but he has not laid out how he would achieve it.\Promise: Expand access to addiction treatment and services\Another unclear promise on his website. Murphy suggested during his inaugural address that he would continue Christie's work combating opioid addiction, but did not specifically say how in his speech.\""There is much in your body of work from which to choose, but, in particular, your work to save lives from the epidemic of opioid addiction is a legacy worth applauding and continuing, and I intend to do so,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Tackle opioid epidemic\According to his website, Murphy would do this by: pooling state, federal, and private resources to expand access to addiction treatment facilities statewide; requiring health insurers to cover Medication-Assisted Treatment and allowing nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physician assistants to prescribe any medications necessary to treat addiction; and lowering the cost of Narcan.\Promise: Rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative\Murphy said he would ""immediately"" restore New Jersey's place in the cap-and-trade program that Christie pulled out of in 2011 because, he said, it was a failure. Murphy sees it as a necessary tool to help reduce emissions and follow a standard of environmental stewardship. In an April 2017 press release, Murphy's campaign said ""he would make rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) one of his first acts in office.""\Status: Promise launched.\Murphy signed an executive order on Jan. 29, his 13th day in office, directing his administration begin the process to rejoin the cap-and-trade program. But it is not an immediate re-entry. The administration must work with the nine other member states to determine the best way to get back into the program and the state must create regulations on how to administer the program.\Promise: 100 percent clean energy by 2050\In an April 26, 2017 press release, Murphy outlined details of his plan and ""committed, within his first 100 days in office, to starting the process of creating a new State Energy Master Plan to set New Jersey on a path to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, with higher renewable standards to motivate public and private sector actors to adapt and expand the clean energy market.""\His plan also includes: A target of producing 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind generation by 2030, a goal of 600 megawatts of energy storage by 2021 and 2000 megawatts of storage by 2030; increasing funding and incentives for energy efficiency; and ""prioritizing solar energy expansion and ensuring that New Jersey regains its status as a national leader in solar energy production and job creation — including the establishment of a community solar program, allowing low-income communities to work together to afford clean energy options.""\Another component of his clean energy plan is a ban on fracking and storage of fracking waste in New Jersey, as well as a fracking ban in the Delaware River.\Status: Promise launched.\Murphy signed an executive order on Jan. 31 directing his administration to develop on offshore wind plan, specifically with the 3,500 megawatt power generation goal by 2030.\Murphy announced a day later that the state intends to vote in favor of a fracking ban in the Delaware River basin.\Promise: Protect the Jersey Shore\""We will resist the dangerous and wrong attempt to allow drilling for oil off our precious shore. We will not allow this threat to our environment and our economy to stand. Our administration, along with the bipartisan support of our federal delegation, will not back down in our fight to protect the Jersey Shore from President Trump and the energy industry special interests,"" Murphy said in his inauguration speech.\Promise: Preserve open space\According to his website, Murphy will ""stop the practice of diverting constitutionally-dedicated open space funding away from its intended purpose"" and ""will also depoliticize key environmental staff and commissions — including those that protect the Highlands and Pinelands — and restore New Jersey as a leader in smart planning.""\Promise: Sign all gun legislation Christie vetoed\""You can assume the measures he's vetoed we would have signed, and we'll endeavor to do so,"" Murphy said on an Aug. 24, 2017 conference call, where he accepted the endorsement of Americans for Responsible Solutions.\Promise: Tax gun sales to prevent violence\From his website: ""All gun sales should be subject to a tax that will fund law enforcement, drug treatment centers, and mental health services."" And on Aug. 24, 2017 conference call, Murphy said he supports a tax on guns but he lacked specifics.\""We have not picked a particular level yet. That's something we're still trying to work through,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Make New Jersey a sanctuary state*\During the Oct. 10 debate with Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, Murphy said: ""if need be, we'll be a sanctuary, not just city, but state.""\Murphy quickly backed off that language after the election, saying he recognized that the term was charged. He instead adopted ""welcoming community."" Still, he has not provided a clear definition of what that may mean. In a December interview, Murphy explained his thinking:\""How we get it done, what the trigger is, I haven't given more thought to that. But I will repeat what I said on the campaign trail: We'll do what we have to do. And, by the way, that also is invariably going to mean we're going to need to engage the federal government. And I don't mean engage in a Kumbaya. I mean we're going to need an attorney general, a governor, a lieutenant governor who are prepared to stand up to the Trump administration, probably locking arms with other like-minded states.""\*There's a catch. Murphy did not propose making New Jersey a sanctuary state as something he would pursue on his own. It is a measure he would take in response to President Donald Trump's immigration policies. It isn't clear what exactly would prompt him to pursue sanctuary policies.\Promise: Protect immigrant rights\Murphy was vocal about being resistant to policies put forth by President Donald Trump that he found un-American and perhaps unlawful. He vowed to protect so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who came to the United States illegally, and said he would oppose ""any efforts,"" according to his website, to use state and local police to assist in mass deportations.\Murphy said he would extend immigrant protections to identification and education.\""I'm all in and I've been all in for years on everyone gets access to (a) driver's license, not just some of us, everyone gets a state identification card, everybody gets not just in state tuition but in state financial aid,"" he said at the March 2016 New Jersey Working Families Alliance forum. ""That can't be for some. You're either in or you're out. And I want to be in, and you have my word I will be.""\Promise: Create an Office of Immigrant Defensive Protection\Murphy wants to develop an office he described to The Washington Post as a ""legal services-oriented"" resource for immigrants. He said on MSNBC on Jan. 17 that there are a lot of ""scared"" people in the state and a ""lot of rumors"" going around under Trump.\""We want one point of contact where folks can call up and get the right answer,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Fully fund school funding formula\Murphy made it a feature of his candidacy to fully fund education under the Corzine-era School Funding Reform Act, which has not been done since it was passed in 2008 and upheld by the state Supreme Court in 2009. Three days after he was elected, speaking at the New Jersey Education Association conference in Atlantic City, he made his first big promise as governor-elect.\""For too long our educators, our students and New Jersey property taxpayers have suffered from under-funding,"" Murphy said. ""We are going to stop the under-investment in public schools. It is priority number one.""\Murphy has not said exactly how or when he would do that.\Promise: Tuition-free community college\Murphy announced the promise during a Sept. 18 news conference in Trenton with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker. He said it would cost between $200 million and $400 million.\""This is investing in the economy,"" he said. ""This is investing in our most important asset, which is our people, so the return on the investment, if you will, is significant and relatively soon.""\Promise: End PARCC testing and eliminate exit test graduation requirement\""Good teachers and good students can have bad test days. Too much emphasis is being put on a single test, as opposed to weighing a student's progress through years of instruction,"" Murphy said on his website.\Murphy said he is ""committed"" to ending Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC, testing and the requirement that students take an exit test to graduate high school. Instead, Murphy said he would direct the state Department of Education to create an assessment that would meet the standards set in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.\Promise: Expand universal pre-kindergarten\Providing pre-kindergarten statewide""is absolutely our aspiration,"" Murphy told NJTV last September. ""I don't think you can get there overnight, though. I think you have to phase it in over some number of years.""\Promise: LGBTQ equality\On his website, Murphy said he would work toward equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people by: Allowing transgender people to select their gender on birth and death certificates and ensure that access to facilities is non-discriminatory; ensuring that all residents, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, have equal access to healthcare and fertility treatment; expanding state contract set-asides to include LGBTQ-owned businesses;and reclassifying veterans dishonorably discharged due to the discriminatory ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy to an honorable discharge so they will be eligible for state benefits.\Promise: Gender parity and diversity\According to his website, ""Phil believes the perspectives of women and minorities must be represented in every rank of government. He will appoint a cabinet that reflects the diversity of New Jersey, establish a Chief Diversity Officer position, and publish an annual review of state diversity contracting and procurement.""\Status: New Jersey already has a Chief Diversity Officer, identified by the Treasury Department as Maurice Griffin. Christie approved the position's creation in 2017 with his signature of A-1869. That person's duty is ""to monitor the state's public contracting process for the purpose of compiling information on the awarding of contracts to minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises, the total value of all contracts and the percentage of the value of those contracts awarded to minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises.""\Griffin earns an annual salary of $130,000, according to Treasury Department records.\This counts as a promise kept by default. But Murphy had nothing to do with it.\Promise: Reflect New Jersey's diversity in his administration\""We will put together an administration that looks like our state in all its great diversity, experience and intelligence. We will seek the right people working in public service for the right reasons trying mightily to do the right things,"" he said on election night.\Promise: Help people with disabilities\Murphy said in his inauguration speech that having a stronger and fairer economy means that it ""remembers that we all have value and we all can contribute, including, and especially, the differently abled."" And on his campaign website he said that the state budget ""is a $35 billion statement of our priorities. We must get back to prioritizing services for the people who need them the most, including those struggling with disabilities."" He added that he is ""determined to make New Jersey the most inclusive and most accessible place to live, work, and raise a family for people with disabilities.""\Murphy plans to achieve that by better coordinating state services and making sure that people with disabilities ""have a seat at our policy-making table.""\Promise: Divide the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs into two agencies — one with responsibility for the National Guard and another responsible for veterans\""Veterans' issues are fundamentally distinct from military affairs, and our bureaucratic structure should reflect that reality,"" Murphy said on his website.\Murphy said that ""at a minimum,"" the new veterans affairs department should consist of divisions for employment and skills development; mental health; higher education; veteran-owned businesses and military transitions and families.\Promise: Improve NJ Transit\Murphy has said that NJ Transit was once a model for the nation, but it has in recent years become a ""national disgrace.""\On his website, Murphy outlined a number of immediate steps for near-term commuter relief: ""Appointing an emergency manager to re-convene a working relationship with Amtrak — a relationship that currently is broken — around issues at Penn Station, as well as coordinate with various state and federal agencies, including the Port Authority; undertaking an immediate capital and personnel audit of NJ Transit to understand the true needs of the agency; improving customer service by deploying more uniformed NJTransit personnel in NY Penn Station, Secaucus, and Newark Penn, among other key stations.""\More from the website: ""Murphy also would require NJTransit to have push notifications about delayed trains on its app, create a ""Where's my train?"" app that would mirror the ""Where's my bus?"" app, and make it easier for commuters to obtain delay letters both online and through the app; expanding options for alternative service by creating an indefinite cross-honoring agreement with PATH and also cross-honoring with ferries and bus services, including private carriers; increasing transparency by requiring weekly reports by NJ Transit including data on number of trains on time during peak and off-peak hours and length of delays, as well as opening more NJTransit board meetings to the public and streaming them online; holding Amtrak accountable on repairs to ensure that no hour in which tracks are closed is wasted and disruptions are minimized disruptions, including requiring work to be done during off-hours and through holiday weekends."" In the long term, Murphy said he would: ""Restore operating assistance for NJTransit; work with New Jersey's Congressional Delegation and federal and regional officials to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel Project and the Port Authority Bus Terminal among other critical infrastructure investments; and would work to build new relationships with public sector actors throughout the region – including both legislators and Port Authority commissioners – to better coordinate infrastructure investment.""\Finally, Murphy said he would: ""Restore professionalism to NJT management by implementing the recommendations of the capital and personnel audit to hire a new class of professional and nationally-qualified management,"" ""ensure NJ Transit's board has commuter representation to better allow the agency to respond to consumer concerns, establish an ongoing working arrangement with Amtrak, NJTransit, and the LIRR to fund capital improvements in and around Penn Station, including those that would facilitate better passenger movement.""\Coming Monday: Meet Phil Murphy's promise keeper\CAPTION: \The governor supports taxing gun sales to help fund law enforcement efforts.\AP\The governor has pledged to protect the rights of immigrants living in New Jersey.\FILE PHOTO\Governor Phil Murphy has pledged that future graduates of Bergen Community College may attend classes tuition free.\Mitsu Yasukawa/NorthJersey.com\The appointment of former Bergen County Prosecutor Gurbir Grewal as state attorney general is a symbol of Phil Murphy's pledge to have a diverse cabinet.\Chris Pedota/NorthJersey.com\Passengers board an NJ Transit train in Rutherford.

Then, presumeably, they will need five plus more acres for parking spaces.\Let's project that to every large business in New Jersey or even the country (and even small businesses and homes). Isn't that a sight to behold?

100,"Federal regulatory burdens have a been major contributor in the loss of two million private sector jobs over the last three years. This loss of jobs parallels the tenure of our incumbent congressman Leonard Lance who has consistently voted in favor of these onerous regulations.\Lance, a member of the House Energy Committee, voted with President Obama in favor of Cap and Trade. Though the bill failed to pass Congress it serves to underline Lance's environmental radicalism that has been so costly to the American economy.\Congressman Lance also voted with Obama to continue the moratorium on offshore drilling unnecessarily limiting domestic energy production and forcing greater than necessary dependence of foreign supply. Of course, this has energy costs skyrocketing.\New EPA regulations will force the closure of an additional 32 coal plants this year. Lance remains silent as our energy sources are diminished.\The balancing power given to the House of Representatives is that of final funding authority. While Congressman Lance voted to repeal ObamaCare, he also voted to fund it.\In order to remain competitive, American companies are being forced by escalating costs to locate their facilities elsewhere. This is costing us jobs and making more people reliant on government programs.\On the two major issues of the day, Cap and Trade and ObamaCare, Leonard Lance has voted to kill American jobs.\Americans remain capable of being the most productive workers in the world.

101,"Gov. Phil Murphy made a lot of promises while running for governor. Now he has to try and fulfill them. The Record and NorthJersey.com have compiled a list of those promises and is publishing them here as a way of informing the public and to hold Murphy accountable.\This list is comprehensive but not exhaustive, and is culled from statements Murphy made during the campaign or posted on his website. The Record will update this list as needed with the status on these promises as Murphy moves through his tenure.\The Record will classify each promise into three categories: Promise launched, promise kept and promise broken, with an explanation for each. But because the Murphy administration is so new, many of the promises will not be classified at all.\Promise: Pass a millionaire's tax\Murphy has supported raising taxes on New Jersey's highest earners for a while, and he has not moved off his position despite wavering by other Democratic leaders.\""Everything we've talked about this entire campaign is to back the truck up and get back to reinvesting in the middle class and asking those, the biggest among us, the wealthiest among us, to pay their fair share,"" Murphy said in November.\Unlike past attempts by Democrats to pass a tax on high earners, Murphy said on MTP Daily on Jan. 17 that he wants a true millionaire's tax.\""When we talk about a millionaire's tax, that's a millionaire,"" Murphy said. ""We'll figure it out because the middle class needs, in our state, at all costs to be rescued,"" he added.\Promise: Create a state bank\This was one of Murphy's big policy ideas at the outset of his campaign.

Murphy promised to restore that funding throughout the campaign, and during his inaugural address called on lawmakers to send him a bill to do so.\""To my partners in the Legislature: I ask you to send me the bills, among others, to reaffirm our support for women's health and Planned Parenthood,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Lower insurance premiums by reining in excessive out-of-network costs\Lawmakers in Trenton have tried for nearly a decade to end surprise medical bills due to out-of-network costs. Murphy has made doing so part of his plan to raise about $1.3 billion in revenues.\When he named Dr. Shareef Elnahal his choice to be the next health commissioner on Jan. 10, Murphy said that one of his challenges is going to be ""helping close the out-of-network loopholes that erode affordability."" Murphy likely has an ally in Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, who, before being named to lead the chamber, sponsored legislation to rein in excessive costs.\Promise: Work to identify the state's 75,000 uninsured children and enroll them in health coverage\Murphy listed this promise on his campaign website, but he has not laid out how he would achieve it.\Promise: Expand access to addiction treatment and services\Another unclear promise on his website. Murphy suggested during his inaugural address that he would continue Christie's work combating opioid addiction, but did not specifically say how in his speech.\""There is much in your body of work from which to choose, but, in particular, your work to save lives from the epidemic of opioid addiction is a legacy worth applauding and continuing, and I intend to do so,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Tackle opioid epidemic\According to his website, Murphy would do this by: pooling state, federal, and private resources to expand access to addiction treatment facilities statewide; requiring health insurers to cover Medication-Assisted Treatment and allowing nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physician assistants to prescribe any medications necessary to treat addiction; and lowering the cost of Narcan.\Promise: Rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative\Murphy said he would ""immediately"" restore New Jersey's place in the cap-and-trade program that Christie pulled out of in 2011 because, he said, it was a failure. Murphy sees it a necessary tool to help reduce emissions and follow a standard of environmental stewardship. In an April 2017 press release, Murphy's campaign said ""he would make rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) one of his first acts in office.""\Status: Promise launched.\Murphy signed an executive order on Jan. 29, his 13th day in office, directing his administration begin the process to rejoin the cap-and-trade program. But it is not an immediate re-entry. The administration must work with the nine other member steps to determine the best way to get back into the program and the state must create regulations on how to administer the program.\Promise: 100 percent clean energy by 2050\In an April 26, 2017 press release, Murphy outlined details of his plan and ""committed, within his first 100 days in office, to starting the process of creating a new State Energy Master Plan to set New Jersey on a path to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, with higher renewable standards to motivate public and private sector actors to adapt and expand the clean energy market.""\His plan also includes: A target of producing 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind generation by 2030, a goal of 600 megawatts of energy storage by 2021 and 2000 megawatts of storage by 2030; increasing funding and incentives for energy efficiency; and ""prioritizing solar energy expansion and ensuring that New Jersey regains its status as a national leader in solar energy production and job creation — including the establishment of a community solar program, allowing low-income communities to work together to afford clean energy options.""\Another component of his clean energy plan is a ban on fracking and storage of fracking waste in New Jersey, as well as a fracking ban in the Delaware River.\Status: Promise launched.\Murphy signed an executive order on Jan. 31 directing his administration to develop on offshore wind plan, specifically with the 3,500 megawatt power generation goal by 2030.\Murphy announced a day later that the state intends to vote in favor of a fracking ban in the Delaware River basin.\Promise: Protect the Jersey Shore\""We will resist the dangerous and wrong attempt to allow drilling for oil off our precious shore. We will not allow this threat to our environment and our economy to stand. Our administration, along with the bipartisan support of our federal delegation, will not back down in our fight to protect the Jersey Shore from President Trump and the energy industry special interests,"" Murphy said in his inauguration speech.\Promise: Preserve open space\According to his website, Murphy will ""stop the practice of diverting constitutionally-dedicated open space funding away from its intended purpose"" and ""will also depoliticize key environmental staff and commissions — including those that protect the Highlands and Pinelands — and restore New Jersey as a leader in smart planning.""\Promise: Sign all gun legislation Christie vetoed\""You can assume the measures he's vetoed we would have signed, and we'll endeavor to do so,"" Murphy said on an Aug. 24, 2017 conference call, where he accepted the endorsement of Americans for Responsible Solutions.\Promise: Tax gun sales to prevent violence\From his website: ""All gun sales should be subject to a tax that will fund law enforcement, drug treatment centers, and mental health services."" And on Aug. 24, 2017 conference call, Murphy said he supports a tax on guns but he lacked specifics.\""We have not picked a particular level yet. That's something we're still trying to work through,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Make New Jersey a sanctuary state*\During the Oct. 10 debate with Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, Murphy said: ""if need be, we'll be a sanctuary, not just city, but state.""\Murphy quickly backed off that language after the election, saying he recognized that the term was charged. He instead adopted ""welcoming community."" Still, he has not provided a clear definition of what that may mean. In a December interview, Murphy explained his thinking:\""How we get it done, what the trigger is, I haven't given more thought to that. But I will repeat what I said on the campaign trail: We'll do what we have to do. And, by the way, that also is invariably going to mean we're going to need to engage the federal government. And I don't mean engage in a Kumbaya. I mean we're going to need an attorney general, a governor, a lieutenant governor who are prepared to stand up to the Trump administration, probably locking arms with other like-minded states.""\*There's a catch. Murphy did not propose making New Jersey a sanctuary state as something he would pursue on his own. It is a measure he would take in response to President Donald Trump's immigration policies. It isn't clear what exactly would prompt him to pursue sanctuary policies.\Promise: Protect immigrant rights\Murphy was vocal about being resistant to policies put forth by President Donald Trump that he found un-American and perhaps unlawful. He vowed to protect so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who came to the United States illegally, and said he would oppose ""any efforts,"" according to his website, to use state and local police to assist in mass deportations.\Murphy said he would extend immigrant protections to identification and education.\""I'm all in and I've been all in for years on everyone gets access to (a) driver's license, not just some of us, everyone gets a state identification card, everybody gets not just in state tuition but in state financial aid,"" he said at the March 2016 New Jersey Working Families Alliance forum. ""That can't be for some. You're either in or you're out. And I want to be in, and you have my word I will be.""\Promise: Create an Office of Immigrant Defensive Protection\Murphy wants to develop an office he described to The Washington Post as a ""legal services-oriented"" resource for immigrants. He said on MSNBC on Jan. 17 that there are a lot of ""scared"" people in the state and a ""lot of rumors"" going around under Trump.\""We want one point of contact where folks can call up and get the right answer,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Fully fund school funding formula\Murphy made it a feature of his candidacy to fully fund education under the Corzine-era School Funding Reform Act, which has not been done since it was passed in 2008 and upheld by the state Supreme Court in 2009. Three days after he was elected, speaking at the New Jersey Education Association conference in Atlantic City, he made his first big promise as governor-elect.\""For too long our educators, our students and New Jersey property taxpayers have suffered from under-funding,"" Murphy said. ""We are going to stop the under-investment in public schools. It is priority number one."" Murphy has not said exactly how or when he would do that.\Promise: Tuition-free community college\Murphy announced the promise during a Sept. 18 news conference in Trenton with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker. He said it would cost between $200 million and $400 million. ""This is investing in the economy,"" he said. ""This is investing in our most important asset, which is our people, so the return on the investment, if you will, is significant and relatively soon.""\Promise: End PARCC testing and eliminate exit test graduation requirement\""Good teachers and good students can have bad test days. Too much emphasis is being put on a single test, as opposed to weighing a student's progress through years of instruction,"" Murphy said on his website.\Murphy said he is ""committed"" to ending Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC, testing and the requirement that students take an exit test to graduate high school. Instead, Murphy said he would direct the state Department of Education to create an assessment that would meet the standards set in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.\Promise: Expand universal pre-kindergarten\Providing pre-kindergarten statewide""is absolutely our aspiration,"" Murphy told NJTV last September. ""I don't think you can get there overnight, though. I think you have to phase it in over some number of years.""\Promise: LGBTQ equality\On his website, Murphy said he would work toward equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people by: Allowing transgender people to select their gender on birth and death certificates and ensure that access to facilities is non-discriminatory; ensuring that all residents, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, have equal access to healthcare and fertility treatment; expanding state contract set-asides to include LGBTQ-owned businesses;and reclassifying veterans dishonorably discharged due to the discriminatory ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy to an honorable discharge so they will be eligible for state benefits.\Promise: Gender parity and diversity\According to his website, ""Phil believes the perspectives of women and minorities must be represented in every rank of government. He will appoint a cabinet that reflects the diversity of N.J., establish a Chief Diversity Officer position, and publish an annual review of state diversity contracting and procurement.""\Status: New Jersey already has a Chief Diversity Officer, identified by the Treasury Department as Maurice Griffin. Christie approved the position's creation in 2017 with his signature of A-1869. That person's duty is ""to monitor the state's public contracting process for the purpose of compiling information on the awarding of contracts to minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises, the total value of all contracts and the percentage of the value of those contracts awarded to minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises.""\Griffin earns an annual salary of $130,000, according to Treasury Department records.\This counts as a promise kept by default. But Murphy had nothing to do with it.\Promise: Reflect New Jersey's diversity in his administration\""We will put together an administration that looks like our state in all its great diversity, experience and intelligence. We will seek the right people working in public service for the right reasons trying mightily to do the right things,"" he said on election night.\Promise: Help people with disabilities\Murphy said in his inauguration speech that having a stronger and fairer economy means that it ""remembers that we all have value and we all can contribute, including, and especially, the differently abled."" And on his campaign website he said that the state budget ""is a $35 billion statement of our priorities. We must get back to prioritizing services for the people who need them the most, including those struggling with disabilities."" He added that he is ""determined to make New Jersey the most inclusive and most accessible place to live, work, and raise a family for people with disabilities.""\Murphy plans to achieve that by better coordinating state services and making sure that people with disabilities ""have a seat at our policy-making table.""\Promise: Divide the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs into two agencies — one with responsibility for the National Guard and another responsible for veterans\""Veterans' issues are fundamentally distinct from military affairs, and our bureaucratic structure should reflect that reality,"" Murphy said on his website.\Murphy said that ""at a minimum,"" the new veterans affairs department should consist of divisions for employment and skills development; mental health; higher education; veteran-owned businesses and military transitions and families.\Promise: Improve NJ Transit\Murphy has said that NJ Transit was once a model for the nation, but it has in recent years become a ""national disgrace.""\On his website, Murphy outlined a number of immediate steps for near-term commuter relief: ""Appointing an emergency manager to re-convene a working relationship with Amtrak — a relationship that currently is broken — around issues at Penn Station, as well as coordinate with various state and federal agencies, including the Port Authority; undertaking an immediate capital and personnel audit of NJ Transit to understand the true needs of the agency; improving customer service by deploying more uniformed NJTransit personnel in NY Penn Station, Secaucus, and Newark Penn, among other key stations.""\CAPTION: \The governor has pledged to protect the rights of immigrants living in New Jersey.\FILE PHOTO"
102,"Gov. Phil Murphy made a lot of promises while running for governor. Now he has to try to fulfill them. The Record and NorthJersey.com have compiled a list of those promises and is publishing them here as a way of informing the public and to hold Murphy accountable.\This list is comprehensive but not exhaustive, and is culled from statements Murphy made during the campaign or posted on his website. The Record will update this list as needed with the status on these promises as Murphy moves through his tenure.\Promise: Pass a millionaire's tax\Murphy has supported raising taxes on New Jersey's highest earners for a while, and he has not moved off his position despite wavering by other Democratic leaders.\""Everything we've talked about this entire campaign is to back the truck up and get back to reinvesting in the middle class and asking those, the biggest among us, the wealthiest among us, to pay their fair share,"" Murphy said in November.\Unlike past attempts by Democrats to pass a tax on high earners, Murphy said on MTP Daily on Jan. 17 that he wants a true millionaire's tax.\""When we talk about a millionaire's tax, that's a millionaire,"" Murphy said. ""We'll figure it out because the middle class needs, in our state, at all costs to be rescued,"" he added.\Promise: Create a state bank\This was one of Murphy's big policy ideas at the outset of his campaign. He envisions it to invest tax dollars in small businesses, student loans and infrastructure projects and offer low-interest loans.\""I can look back at periods in this state under the leadership of both or either party, when we were both fiscally responsible, proudly progressive and we dreamt and took chances and took risks and embraced big ideas,"" Murphy said at a gubernatorial forum held by the New Jersey Bankers Association in April 2017. ""If we believe in our future, let's put our money where our mouth is. Let's again think deeply and do more,"" he added.\He told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in March 2017 that the bank would be owned by the residents of New Jersey ""and the business that it does would be restricted to New Jersey.""\Promise: $15 hourly minimum wage\Murphy made this one of his top campaign promises and said on Jan. 17, his first full day in office, that it is ""high on that list"" of his legislative priorities. But Murphy favors a ""clean"" bill to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and said last March during a forum with the New Jersey Working Families Alliance that he would veto what the forum moderator called a ""watered down"" proposal.\Promise: Guarantee earned sick leave\Paid sick leave, like the $15 minimum wage, is another one of Murphy's central promises that he included to be ""high on that list"" of policy priorities early in his term. At a Jan. 17 round table in Newark on the two topics, Murphy said that even though about a dozen towns have passed sick leave ordinances, ""we have 565 communities in our state and we need a statewide agenda, we need a statewide law that ensures earned sick leave.""\Promise: Equal pay for equal work\Murphy aims to close the gender wage gap with a statewide law. On inauguration day he signed an executive order, his first, prohibiting state agencies from asking about a job applicant's pay history, saying employers should ""pay people based on what their job is, not on what their past pay was."" His campaign website said that he would sign a bill that ""strengthens penalties for wage discrimination, bans employers from asking job applicants for their salary history, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss compensation.""\On inauguration day he called for lawmakers to deliver.\""They don't need urging on this one, trust me, they lead on this one,"" he said on inauguration day. ""Send the bill to my desk to make this simple and common sense practice state law. As I said earlier, I will sign it.""\Promise: Create a new retirement plan for employees of small businesses.\According to his campaign website, ""Phil will offer, just as a growing number of states do, a simple, opt-in retirement plan for small business employees. Doing so will help ensure that all workers in our state can adequately save for their retirement.""\Promise: Make home ownership affordable and accessible.\According to his website, Murphy plans to achieve this by ""stopping Governor Christie's practice of diverting affordable housing funds to plug holes in the budget; expanding counseling programs to keep people in their homes and repurposing foreclosed properties as affordable housing; expanding tax credits to create new housing; and lowering property taxes by funding our schools, incentivizing shared services, and restoring rebates to low-income, seniors and disabled residents.""\Promise: Expand Earned Income Tax Credit\The earned income tax credit, or EITC, is a state benefit intended to help poor and low-income households. Christie had cut the state credit percentage relative to the federal credit in leaner years, but he raised it to 35 percent of the federal credit in 2017, his final year in office.\Murphy wants to raise the earned income tax credit to 40 percent of the federal level, his website said, ""so that working families can lift themselves out of poverty.""\Promise: Create a new child care and caregiver tax credit\This didn't get much attention during the campaign, so there aren't many specifics. Murphy told the AARP Bulletin that he would create a credit similar to the state's child-care tax credit and, the bulletin wrote, ""educate caregivers about how they can use the New Jersey Family Leave Act and make it more accessible.""\Promise: Close loopholes for ""wealthy individuals and large corporations""\Murphy talked often about closing loopholes without identifying them to help bring in revenue.\""We're going to stand for tax fairness,"" he said in the Jan. 17 MTP Daily interview. ""If you're a hedge fund and you're getting away with carried interest that we should close as a loophole at the federal [level], we're going to find a way to do that at the state level, I hope with other allied states. If you're a big corporation that's living off of loopholes,"" he added, ""we're going to close those loopholes.""\Promise: Divest pension funds from hedge funds and private equity\This is one of the ways, along with closing loopholes and raising taxes, that Murphy plans to raise about $1.3 billion to support his policy ideas. In an interview with The Record last April, he said that the state pays ""exorbitant fees to hedge funds and private equity managers"" but ""the evidence is overwhelmingly the case you no longer get what you pay for.""\""The space is overcrowded, the returns are mediocre, the fees are exorbitant. That's one obvious area,"" to save money, he said. ""Probably not the only area, but it's the area that I'd look to first.""\The State Investment Council, already facing criticism in Gov. Chris Christie's later years for its hedge fund investments, began scaling back its allocations in 2016 and seeking better fee structures.\Promise: Establish a state-level Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and strengthen existing regulations in light of President Donald Trump's efforts to roll back the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.\Murphy has not spoken much about specifics on this idea, but said when he named Assemblywoman Marlene Caride his choice to be the next Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner that it is up to the state to push back against what he views as harmful policies of Republican President Donald Trump. Murphy specifically named the administration's actions to take control of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as the sort of ""destruction that's coming at us from Washington.""\Promise: Prosecute financial fraud\This is another promise light on details but was included on Murphy's multi-step plan of ""ending Wall Street's influence on State Street."" The state Attorney General's office already does prosecute financial fraud with regularity.\Promise: Reclaim the innovation economy\Murphy often talked about New Jersey being ""Silicon Valley before there was a Silicon Valley."" According to Murphy's website, he wants to return New Jersey to its technological glory by:\""Launching a ""Computer Science for All"" initiative to offer computer science education to every public school student; partnering with companies to expand access to science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, internships and vocational programs; providing loan forgiveness for STEM educators in high-need schools and creating a new STEM-educator fellowship program to recruit and train a new class of STEM teachers.""\Murphy said he would also establish a Grant Management Office ""to make sure we get our fair share of federal funds for research and development,"" increase state funding for research and development, provide affordable, high-speed internet for all New Jerseyans and configure public spaces to be digitally and universally accessible; convene an ""innovation cabinet,"" increase access to capital for small businesses and startups and forgive student loans for new graduates launching businesses in ""under-served and distressed communities.""\Promise: Restore Christie's annual $7.5 million cut to Planned Parenthood\Christie repeatedly cut funding to Planned Parenthood and vetoed efforts from the Democratic Legislature to pass annual funding of $7.5 million. Murphy promised to restore that funding throughout the campaign, and during his inaugural address called on lawmakers to send him a bill to do so.\""To my partners in the Legislature: I ask you to send me the bills, among others, to reaffirm our support for women's health and Planned Parenthood,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Lower insurance premiums by reining in excessive out-of-network costs\Lawmakers in Trenton have tried for nearly a decade to end surprise medical bills due to out-of-network costs.

103," OTTAWA Canada will be among the first countries in the world to ban the purchase of traditional light bulbs. It's part of the government's plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.\ The government's announcement follows the lead of Australia and the Canadian province of Ontario and will take effect in 2012. Canadian retailers will be required to stock more efficient light bulbs such as compact fluorescents and halogen bulbs.\ The new-generation light bulbs cost a bit more but last about seven years and use much less energy. The downside is that many of these bulbs contain mercury and need to be disposed of like paint and chemicals at special toxic-waste centers.\ Natural Resources Minister Gary Lunn said the ban will get Canadians thinking more about the energy they use.\ ""This is more than just about light bulbs,"" he said. ""The light bulb is only the gateway to broad public engagement on energy efficiency and action on climate change.""\ Opposition critics and environmentalists offered reluctant praise for the ban, but condemned the government's overall plan for fighting climate change as outlined by Environment Minister John Baird.\ The plan marks a clear separation from Liberal Leader Stephane Dion, who has claimed repeatedly that Canadian firms could make ""megatons of money"" by taking part in Europe's market for trading carbon credits.\ European countries have set up a cap-and-trade system, meaning countries dictate maximum levels of greenhouse-gas emissions for industry. To comply with the law, companies that are over the limit can buy credits from companies that are under the limit.\ Baird said the Conservatives' plan will create a cap-and-trade system, but Canadian companies will be able to trade domestically only, or eventually with the United States and Mexico if the governments can reach an agreement.\ ""We have concerns about the European market,"" Baird said.\ Environmentalists express concern that the rejection of Europe in favor of the United States which is not part of the Kyoto Protocol and has no national trading system is another step away from Kyoto.\ ""I see it as an end-run around the United Nations system,"" Beatrice Olivastri of Friends of the Earth Canada said. ""Anything that is a U.S.-related program is clearly outside of Kyoto, so that to me is very worrisome."""
104,"WASHINGTON -- As Congress members struggle to find solutions to global warming, they are looking to 10 Northeast states for help.\Unwilling to wait for the slow-moving federal government to act, New York, Vermont, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and five other states have begun an historic experiment to fight climate change on their own.\Earlier this fall, six of those states held the nation's first auction of carbon dioxide allowances after setting a cap on how much of the greenhouse gas their 225 power plants can emit.\They raised more than $38 million as energy companies snapped up carbon credits that allow them to continue producing the colorless, odorless gas at current levels while giving the states money to invest in renewable energy and conservation.\They also created a model that federal lawmakers, environmentalists and renewable energy companies say can be used to develop national legislation in the next Congress.\""They can show us how a cap-and-trade approach to global warming might work, can work, will work,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who serves on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and has worked on global warming legislation for years.\""My hope is to learn from their experiment to help us craft legislation that is better and smarter and gives us the biggest bang in reducing carbon emissions for our buck,"" Carper said.\Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who serves on the global warming subcommittee, said the states' initiative would help him as he renews his efforts to negotiate a bill in the Senate next year.\""Once again, the states are way ahead of the federal government in coming up with solutions,"" Sanders said. ""Obviously, this is something we're going to watch very closely and take the applicable lessons to Washington and into our national legislation.""\Northeast governors say creating an example for the federal government was a big reason why they joined together to create the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which also includes Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.\The initiative caps power plant emissions at current levels through 2014. Energy companies must then cut their emissions by 10 percent by 2019.\Utilities are motivated to buy the credits at auction because they must meet a Dec. 31, 2011, deadline to buy one emission allowance for every ton of carbon they produce. There are limits on how much any one company can buy at an auction, so buying early can help companies comply by the deadline. Some also might want to buy extra credits to allow for future plant expansions or the construction of new plants that would create more carbon.\""This will make a significant difference in our region, but we are only 10 states -- some of them quite small,"" said Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas, who worked with the other nine states for five years to create the regional program. ""We really believe that a federal program is needed.""\But Douglas and the other governors have vowed to fight any congressional legislation that would bar them from setting their own limits on global warming emissions.\Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, recently released draft legislation that would limit states' ability to implement their own emissions caps.\""We shouldn't be penalized for our leadership,"" said Douglas, a Republican. ""I don't know why a state program shouldn't be allowed to be more rigorous or expansive than a federal program. We don't want Washington to get in the way.""\New York Gov. David Paterson, a Democrat, agrees and has sent an open letter to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee John McCain calling on them not to pre-empt state efforts on climate change.\But utility companies say it's a nightmare for them to have to deal with a patchwork of regulations that vary from state to state. Instead, they favor one national standard, said Gavin Donohue, president of the Independent Power Producers of New York Inc.\""The problem from an industry standpoint is that we can't plan if we're not sure which limit we have to meet,"" Donohue said.\He also worries that the Northeast initiative will hurt the 10 states that created it by causing energy companies to move to nearby states that have no costly emissions' regulations.\Donohue said he also hopes the federal government doesn't adopt the auction system that the Northeast states have designed. They prefer proposals that have been offered in Congress that would give power plants free carbon allowances for several years instead of forcing them to immediately buy them. Phased-in emission limits would eventually lead to the need to buy and sell carbon credits.\But the Northeast states say they will push for a national auction system modeled after theirs.\""It puts a monetary value on carbon pollution and ensures that polluters pay,"" said Judith Enck, New York's deputy secretary for the environment. She said it also has the potential to bring new ""green"" jobs to the region by spurring state investment in renewable power and conservation.\The program shows Americans that combating global warming doesn't have to be as difficult as Congress seems to make it, said Emily Figdor of Environment America.\""It helps the American people understand that there are solutions at their finger tips,"" she said."
105,"State Senate President Stephen Sweeney announced Thursday that he would challenge the governor's decision to remove New Jersey from a multistate initiative to reduce greenhouse gases, through a rarely used legislative action.\Governor Christie, a Republican, ended New Jersey's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, in 2011. The cap-and-trade program is an agreement between some East Coast states that forces utilities to purchase credits for their carbon emissions. Money from these purchases goes to promote green initiatives.\Christie has called RGGI ""a failure.""\""RGGI does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens, tax our businesses, with no discernable or measurable impact upon our environment,"" the governor said when he stopped the state's participation three years ago.\To push New Jersey back into participating, Sweeney, D-Gloucester, wants to force a rule change that would mandate reentry into RGGI. He said the initiative has reduced emissions and attracted green jobs to the state.\""We are blocking him from killing RGGI through regulation,"" said Sweeney.\This is not the first time that Sweeney has used a resolution to fight one of Christie's decisions. Previously, Sweeney objected to changes the Christie administration proposed to remove some testing requirements in the civil service system, which is used to hire and promote some public employees.\Democrats said Christie's changes would lead to corruption and nepotism. The Legislature passed a resolution saying that Christie's new rules did not comply with the original intent of the state's civil service laws.\Sweeney's path forward on RGGI is similar and involves complicated parliamentary maneuvering. A court case followed Christie's decision not to participate in RGGI.\The court ruled that the administration's unilateral pullout was improper and required that it go through a rule-making process. In response, the administration published new rules to pull the state out of the cap-and-trade initiative.\Democrats now have introduced a resolution that says Christie violated legislative intent when he wrote the rules to pull out of RGGI. Democrats claim that previous state laws ordered the administration to participate in the collaboration - laws that could not be ignored. If the resolution passes the Legislature, the administration would have 30 days to rewrite or amend the rules. After this time, if the Legislature is still not satisfied, it could pass another resolution that would force a rule change.\To fight Christie, Sweeney chose to use an arcane legislative process that one senator called ""uncharted territory"" when used to fight civil service changes earlier this year. Even if they force a rule change, a court battle may still be fought over participation in the program.\""We are going to invalidate his rules,"" Sweeney said.\Credit: Email: phillis@northjersey.com"
106,"Associated Press\TRENTON -- Gov. Chris Christie outlined his vision for New Jersey's energy future Tuesday, leaving the door open for a new nuclear plant in the state to replace one that will shut down in eight years.\Christie said a new nuclear plant should be considered ""an option"" as a replacement for the 41-year-old Oyster Creek nuclear plant in Ocean County, whose owners reached a deal with the state to close it in 2019 -- a decade earlier than its license allows. Christie said he would need to see a specific plan for a new plant, however, before deciding whether to endorse such a move.\""I'm not going to jump-start the process, but I'm saying it's got to be considered an option,"" Christie said.\The most densely populated state has four nuclear reactors, including Oyster Creek, the nation's oldest. Two of the reactors, Oyster Creek in Lacey and Hope Creek in Salem County, are similar in design to the Fukushima Daiichi reactors in Japan that were damaged by an earthquake and tsunami in March.\Oyster Creek generates 636 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 600,000 homes a year, and provides 9 percent of New Jersey's electricity.\Besides planning for the loss of nuclear power, Christie's energy master plan also calls for:\*Expanding natural gas use.\*Increased use of solar energy at the industrial and commercial levels.\*Energy-efficient upgrades to government buildings.\About 50 percent of all energy generated in New Jersey comes from nuclear power; 33 percent from natural gas; 10 percent from coal and less than 1 percent comes from oil. As of 2010, less than 3 percent of energy was produced using renewable sources, according to the state.\""The first step is to make our current use of energy more efficient,"" Christie said.\At the same time, Christie also is recommending a lower target for increasing the state's reliance on renewable energy sources over the next decade. Christie's plan calls for 22.5 percent of the state's energy to be renewable by 2021, compared to a 30 percent goal set by his Democratic predecessor, Jon Corzine.\The first-term Republican governor said his plan, compared to Corzine's, was not ""pie in the sky, pandering to any constituency group.""\Environmentalists were quick to criticize the plan, saying that Christie, who has quickly become a rising Republican star, was erasing New Jersey's long history of strong environmental protections to kowtow to conservatives.\""This is all part of his national agenda,"" said Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club.\""He's more concerned about the Koch brothers and tea party than the environment or economy in New Jersey,"" Tittel said, referring to the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch of energy giant Koch Industries, who have been lobbying around the country against the pollution ""cap-and-trade"" program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\Last month, Christie announced New Jersey was dropping out of the Northeast's 10-state cap-and trade program, which he said was a failure at cutting pollution and a burden to taxpayers.\The business community, however, was thrilled.\""We're happy that nuclear is included,"" said Michael Egenton of the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce.\""We want everything on the table."""
107,"YES\Last month, Gov. Chris Christie announced that he's pulling New Jersey out of the nation's only intrastate, cap-and-trade compact to limit the emission of greenhouse gases from power plants in the Northeast. New Jersey joined what became the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2005.\RGGI's goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 10-state region 10 percent by 2018. Christie contends that RGGI isn't working and that it constitutes nothing more than an added tax on energy suppliers that hurts consumers and businesses. Democrats in the Legislature are moving forward with legislation to try to stop Christie from pulling the state out of RGGI.\We at the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce agree with Gov. Chris Christie's decision to pull New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) for two major reasons: The two-year-old program was not effective in cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, and the program ultimately contributed to higher energy prices for residents and businesses in New Jersey.\Make no mistake about it: The high cost of energy in New Jersey is a sensitive issue for companies considering moving to or expanding in New Jersey.\When we poll our member companies and ask them what issues are impediments to their operations in New Jersey, steep energy costs consistently rank among the top three, along with the cost of health insurance and taxes.\New Jersey's commercial and industrial customers pay among the highest energy rates in the nation, partly because of the taxes paid by power plant owners in New Jersey under RGGI's cap-and-trade system.\As our economy continues to struggle, it is incumbent upon our leaders to revisit policies that stifle economic growth. In this case, Christie's goal is to reduce energy rates and make them comparable to costs in other regions and states -- important steps for encouraging economic growth.\Still, the governor is to be commended for not ignoring the need for clean energy. In fact, he reiterated -- with the state chamber's endorsement -- that he would prohibit any kind of new coal-fired power plants in New Jersey. Further, his plan calls for the state to focus on developing solar projects on brownfields and landfills, encourage the construction of natural gas power plants and develop a program to conserve energy in state facilities.\The state Chamber of Commerce will continue to get behind a number of initiatives to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including new technologies such as fuel cells and offshore wind. And we will push for policy that encourages developers of these technologies to locate here in New Jersey, where we have the thinkers to advance those fields and the highly skilled workers to manufacture their products.\In addition, nuclear energy must play a role in the clean energy solution. Nuclear power has one of the lowest impacts on the environment of any energy source because it does not emit air pollution.\Yes, there have been reduced emissions in recent years. It has been attributed, not to RGGI, but to reductions in energy use that came with the downturn in the economy and an increase in the use of natural gas.\Only 10 Northeastern states chose to be part of RGGI, while states including our neighboring Pennsylvania declined. Because Pennsylvania relies more on fossil fuels such as dirty coal, energy costs there are lower, making it more business-friendly than New Jersey. Pennsylvania and other states in the Midwest can offer their energy at lower prices because they were never mandated to pay RGGI's carbon tax.\If we are to have a level playing field when it comes to addressing energy, it must be a nationwide, not a piecemeal, approach. Otherwise, states outside our region will continue to run older, more polluting power plants and offer energy at rock-bottom prices with no environmental benefit to any of us.\Michael Egenton is senior vice president, government relations, for the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce.\Michael\Egenton"
108,"PARAMUS -- A leading advocate for tough governmental action on climate change warned Thursday that much of the world was ignoring the problem of global warming.\Appearing before an audience at Bergen Community College that was largely receptive to his message, James E. Hansen, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, also urged North Jerseyans to prod their elected representatives to act on the issue.\Hansen, a former Ridgewood resident, first made national news in 1988 when he told a U.S. Senate subcommittee that global warming was a growing threat to the environment and that humans were almost certainly responsible.\The issue has since become a flashpoint not only for President Obama, who has said he supports a cap-and-trade solution, but also for several Republican presidential contenders who, led by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, have questioned the science behind climate change.\On Thursday, Hansen called the cap-and-trade idea ""cockamamie,"" but he sounded some notes of hope that there might be movement on the issue in the national sphere. The best solution, Hansen said, would be a carbon tax, which the Obama administration has said is not politically viable.\""There's a huge gap between rhetoric and reality,"" Hansen said at the event, which was sponsored by the North Jersey Public Policy Network. ""Politicians have learned to say the right words. ... But they're not actually taking any actions.""\Hansen has a long public history with the issue, sparring with administrations of both parties while looking for solutions.\In 2001, Hansen was invited to brief then-Vice President Dick Cheney, who was intrigued by Hansen's opinion then that mitigating soot in the atmosphere should be prioritized over curbing carbon dioxide because it was cheaper and more effective. Three years later, Hansen came out publicly for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. In 2006, he accused the Bush administration of trying to silence him after he gave a speech calling for cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions.\Since then, Hansen has retained his post at NASA while continuing to press for more national action on climate change, including a carbon tax. This approach has again put him at odds with the president, and Hansen was arrested while protesting in front of the White House in 2009.\Hansen said that a persistent gap between what scientists understood and what the public knew about the subject pushed him further into the public sphere, years after he made waves with his congressional testimony.\""I quickly decided that the public aspect of this was not for me,"" Hansen said. ""It wasn't until years later that my grandchildren kind of forced me to explain what was going on.""\A lengthy question-and-answer session produced a steady stream of gratitude for Hansen and further calls to action.\One man, who was wearing a shirt that said ""Spill oil, beaches spoil,"" called the arguments offered by climate-change skeptics ""garbage.""\""Win the debate, that's what I suggest,"" the man said. ""Eventually, the climate will force the issue.""\Hansen ended the talk on an optimistic note, saying that China is making major investments in alternative energy. He also said the courts could lead the way if the public starts to demand it.\""Young people had better start to get angry about it,"" Hansen said. ""We're going to determine the climate in the next century, centuries, next millennia."""
109,"Gov. Phil Murphy began the process Monday for New Jersey to re-enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, six years after former Gov. Chris Christie made the controversial decision to leave the multistate cap-and-trade compact.\Murphy, a Democrat who succeeded the Republican Christie on Jan. 16, had pledged to make New Jersey's re-entry into the initiative, known as RGGI, one of his first moves upon taking office. At a Monday morning ceremony overlooking Sandy Hook Bay, Murphy signed an executive order directing the state to rejoin the nine-state coalition.\""As the densest state in the nation, we can ill afford to keep our heads in the sand when it comes to climate change,"" Murphy said during a signing ceremony at the Seastreak ferry port in Highlands, a low-lying Monmouth County town devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Murphy cited the storm as one example of the effects of climate change.\""Environmental impacts here are not contained; they are felt along the broad swaths of our state. Sandy's impacts were felt in virtually every community,"" he said.\The greenhouse gas initiative aims to reduce emissions, which most science organizations agree are a leading cause of global warming and rising sea levels that have led to extreme weather in recent years. Nine states, from Maine to Maryland, are part of the initiative, which caps the amount of carbon dioxide power plants may release and requires those plants to purchase credits allowing them to emit specified amounts of the gas.\When Christie pulled New Jersey out of the program in 2011 — it took effect in 2012 — he said it was a tax with no discernible effect on the environment.\While he accepted the reality of climate change, Christie viewed it as an ineffective tool to battle global warming and often pointed out, in the face of criticism, that New Jersey's carbon emissions fell below the state's own goals.\But Murphy said Monday that Christie's withdrawal from the compact ""lacked any common sense,"" left money on the table and ""robbed"" New Jersey of the opportunity to invest in clean energy options. In his executive order, Murphy cited a study from the Acadia Center, a clean-energy nonprofit group, that said New Jersey lost as much as $279 million by its absence from the program.\Murphy's wife, Tammy Murphy, who plans to make the environment one of her main concerns during the administration, tallied up a list of losses for the state.\In 2015, she said, participating states invested a combined $410 million in energy efficiency programs, clean energy production and assistance for residents. As a result, those states' consumers saved $2.3 billion, she said.\Murphy said the executive order marked a campaign promise kept, but added: ""It's a broader promise of building New Jersey where science isn't something to be ignored and common sense once again leads our decision-making.""\The executive order does not instantly bring New Jersey back into the fold of RGGI states.\Jeff Tittel, executive director of the state's Sierra Club chapter, said it could take six to nine months for full re-entry. And the executive order Murphy signed directs his acting Department of Environmental Protection commissioner, Catherine McCabe, and Board of Public Utilities President Joseph Fiordaliso ""to immediately begin negotiations with current RGGI member states to determine how to best re-enter New Jersey into the carbon budget trading program.""\The Department of Environmental Protection must also create a structure for how RGGI funds will be allocated. A bill moving through the Legislature would also require the state to rejoin RGGI, but with the added caveat that pulling out of the compact would require legislative approval.\Two of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, and Assemblyman Tim Eustace, D-Maywood, joined Murphy during the ceremony and hailed the decision as an overdue action to battle climate change. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, who co-sponsors the bill, was not there.\Environmental group leaders were also there and praised Murphy.\""RGGI is a light of climate action in the darkness of climate rollbacks of the Trump era,"" Environment New Jersey Director Doug O'Malley said in a statement, referring to Republican President Donald Trump, who has said climate change is a hoax and has taken steps to roll back environmental policies. ""While RGGI is not a silver bullet to reduce all our carbon emissions, it's an incredible first step to reduce pollution from our fossil fuel plants and move us to a clean, renewable energy economy.""\U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Monmouth, who is the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Trump's policies, such as pulling out of the Paris climate accord and plans to drill for oil off the Atlantic coast, elevate the state's role.\""What we continue to hear from the Trump administration is tearing down environmental protection,"" Pallone said. ""Right now we're depending on the states and the towns to do things to try to achieve our climate goals, because we know that the federal government simply will not do it,"" he added.\CAPTION: \Phil Murphy"

Making the space even tighter were various exhibits by vendors taking part in a New Jersey Business and Industry Association effort to highlight products made in the Garden State.\Adding to the scrum were bands, Girl Scouts (on hand for a ceremony honoring the organization's 100th anniversary) and Irish heritage groups. People roamed the capitol's hallways and common areas hoping for chance meetings with members of the Assembly and Senate.\Middletown residents Heidi Bruhin and Lynn Dash thought they hit the jackpot when they shared an elevator ride with Republican Sen.

Christopher ""Kip"" Bateman, R-Somerset, designed to prohibit the trade of shark fins within the state. It would pull fins out of the seafood trade. Nagiewicz said similar legislation has been passed in California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington.\Day of protests: The issues\Gov. Chris Christie withdrew New Jersey from a multistate cap-and-trade program designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions, saying it was ineffective and costly to businesses. Environmentalists say the program cuts pollution and provides revenue to states from factories that exceed carbon allowances.\The proposed folding of Rutgers University's Camden campus into Rowan University is undergoing criticism by administration, faculty and students from the Camden school.\The trading of shark fins within the state should be prohibited, according to advocates supporting new legislation to end the practice.\The Highlands Council's proposed change of executive director was criticized by enviornmentalists who claim Christie prompted the change weaken enforcement of laws protecting the region.\ID_Code: CN-303150044"
112,"Last month, Gov. Chris Christie announced that he's pulling New Jersey out of the nation's only intrastate, cap-and-trade compact to limit the emission of greenhouse gases from power plants in the Northeast. New Jersey joined what became the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2005.\RGGI's goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 10-state region 10 percent by 2018. Christie contends that RGGI isn't working and that it constitutes nothing more than an added tax on energy suppliers that hurts consumers and businesses. Democrats in the Legislature are moving forward with legislation to try to stop Christie from pulling the state out of RGGI.\We at the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce agree with Gov. Chris Christie's decision to pull New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) for two major reasons: The two-year-old program was not effective in cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, and the program ultimately contributed to higher energy prices for residents and businesses in New Jersey.\Make no mistake about it: The high cost of energy in New Jersey is a sensitive issue for companies considering moving to or expanding in New Jersey.\When we poll our member companies and ask them what issues are impediments to their operations in New Jersey, steep energy costs consistently rank among the top three, along with the cost of health insurance and taxes.\New Jersey's commercial and industrial customers pay among the highest energy rates in the nation, partly because of the taxes paid by power plant owners in New Jersey under RGGI's cap-and-trade system.\As our economy continues to struggle, it is incumbent upon our leaders to revisit policies that stifle economic growth. In this case, Christie's goal is to reduce energy rates and make them comparable to costs in other regions and states -- important steps for encouraging economic growth.\Still, the governor is to be commended for not ignoring the need for clean energy. In fact, he reiterated -- with the state chamber's endorsement -- that he would prohibit any kind of new coal-fired power plants in New Jersey. Further, his plan calls for the state to focus on developing solar projects on brownfields and landfills, encourage the construction of natural gas power plants and develop a program to conserve energy in state facilities.\The state Chamber of Commerce will continue to get behind a number of initiatives to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including new technologies such as fuel cells and offshore wind. And we will push for policy that encourages developers of these technologies to locate here in New Jersey, where we have the thinkers to advance those fields and the highly skilled workers to manufacture their products.\In addition, nuclear energy must play a role in the clean energy solution. Nuclear power has one of the lowest impacts on the environment of any energy source because it does not emit air pollution.\Yes, there have been reduced emissions in recent years. It has been attributed, not to RGGI, but to reductions in energy use that came with the downturn in the economy and an increase in the use of natural gas.\Only 10 Northeastern states chose to be part of RGGI, while states including our neighboring Pennsylvania declined. Because Pennsylvania relies more on fossil fuels such as dirty coal, energy costs there are lower, making it more business-friendly than New Jersey. Pennsylvania and other states in the Midwest can offer their energy at lower prices because they were never mandated to pay RGGI's carbon tax.\If we are to have a level playing field when it comes to addressing energy, it must be a nationwide, not a piecemeal, approach. Otherwise, states outside our region will continue to run older, more polluting power plants and offer energy at rock-bottom prices with no environmental benefit to any of us.\Michael\Egenton\ID_Code: B3201110306190024"
113,"Gov. Phil Murphy began the process Monday for New Jersey to re-enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, six years after former Gov. Chris Christie made the controversial decision to leave the multi-state cap-and-trade compact.\Murphy, a Democrat who succeeded the Republican Christie on Jan. 16, had pledged to make New Jersey's re-entry into the initiative, known as RGGI, one of his first moves upon taking office. At a Monday morning ceremony overlooking Sandy Hook Bay, Murphy signed an executive order directing the state to rejoin the nine-state coalition.\""As the densest state in the nation, we can ill afford to keep our heads in the sand when it comes to climate change,"" Murphy said during a signing ceremony at the Seastreak ferry port in Highlands, a low-lying Monmouth County town devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Murphy cited the storm as one example of the effects of climate change.\""Environmental impacts here are not contained, they are felt along the broad swaths of our state. Sandy's impacts were felt in virtually every community,"" he said.\The greenhouse gas initiative aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which most science organizations agree is a leading cause of global warming and rising sea levels that have led to extreme weather in recent years. Nine states, from Maine to Maryland, are part of the initiative that caps the amount of carbon dioxide power plants may release and requires those plants to purchase credits allowing them to emit specified amounts of the gas.\When Christie pulled New Jersey out of the program in 2011 — it took effect in 2012 — he argued that it was a tax with no discernible effect on the environment.\While he accepted the reality of climate change, Christie viewed it as an ineffective tool to battle global warming and often pointed out in the face of criticism that New Jersey's carbon emissions fell below the state's own goals.\But Murphy said Monday that Christie's withdrawal from the compact ""lacked any commonsense,"" left money on the table and ""robbed"" New Jersey of the opportunity to invest in clean energy options. In his executive order, Murphy cited unidentified studies that said New Jersey lost as much as $279 million by its absence from the program.\Murphy's wife, Tammy Murphy, who plans to make the environment one of her main concerns during the administration, tallied up a list of losses for the state.\In 2015, she said, participating states invested a combined $410 million in energy efficiency programs, clean energy production and assistance for residents. As a result, those states' consumers saved $2.3 billion, she said.\Murphy said the executive order marked a campaign promise kept, but added that ""It's a broader promise of building New Jersey where science isn't something to be ignored and commonsense once again leads our decision-making.""\The executive order does not instantly bring New Jersey back into the fold of RGGI states.\Jeff Tittel, executive director of the state's Sierra Club chapter, said it could take between six and nine months for full re-entry. And the executive order Murphy signed directs his acting Department of Environmental Protection commissioner, Catherine McCabe, and Board of Public Utilities President Joseph Fiordaliso ""to immediately begin negotiations with current RGGI member states to determine how to best reenter New Jersey into the carbon budget trading program.""\The Department of Environmental Protection must also create a structure for how RGGI funds will be allocated. A bill moving through the Legislature would also require the state to rejoin RGGI, but with the added caveat that pulling out of the compact would require legislative approval.\Two of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, and Assemblyman Tim Eustace, D-Maywood, joined Murphy during the ceremony and hailed the decision as an overdue action to battle climate change. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, who co-sponsors the bill, was not there.\Environmental group leaders were also there and praised Murphy.\""RGGI is a light of climate action in the darkness of climate rollbacks of the Trump era,"" Environment New Jersey Director Doug O'Malley said in a statement. ""While RGGI is not a silver bullet to reduce all our carbon emissions, it's an incredible first step to reduce pollution from our fossil fuel plants and move us to a clean, renewable energy economy.""\U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-6th, who is the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that Trump's policies, such as pulling out of the Paris climate accord and plans to drill for oil off the Atlantic coast, elevate the state's role."
114,"Gov. Phil Murphy made a lot of promises while running for governor. Now he has to try to fulfill them. The Record and NorthJersey.com have compiled a list of those promises and is publishing them here as a way of informing the public and to hold Murphy accountable.\This list is comprehensive but not exhaustive, and is culled from statements Murphy made during the campaign or posted on his website. The Record will update this list as needed with the status on these promises as Murphy moves through his tenure.\Promise: Pass a millionaire's tax\Murphy has supported raising taxes on New Jersey's highest earners for a while, and he has not moved off his position despite wavering by other Democratic leaders.\""Everything we've talked about this entire campaign is to back the truck up and get back to reinvesting in the middle class and asking those, the biggest among us, the wealthiest among us, to pay their fair share,"" Murphy said in November.\Unlike past attempts by Democrats to pass a tax on high earners, Murphy said on MTP Daily on Jan. 17 that he wants a true millionaire's tax.\""When we talk about a millionaire's tax, that's a millionaire,"" Murphy said. ""We'll figure it out because the middle class needs, in our state, at all costs to be rescued,"" he added.\Promise: Create a state bank\This was one of Murphy's big policy ideas at the outset of his campaign. He envisions it to invest tax dollars in small businesses, student loans and infrastructure projects and offer low-interest loans.\""I can look back at periods in this state under the leadership of both or either party, when we were both fiscally responsible, proudly progressive and we dreamt and took chances and took risks and embraced big ideas,"" Murphy said at a gubernatorial forum held by the New Jersey Bankers Association in April 2017. ""If we believe in our future, let's put our money where our mouth is. Let's again think deeply and do more,"" he added.\He told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in March 2017 that the bank would be owned by the residents of New Jersey ""and the business that it does would be restricted to New Jersey.""\Promise: $15 hourly minimum wage\Murphy made this one of his top campaign promises and said on Jan. 17, his first full day in office, that it is ""high on that list"" of his legislative priorities. But Murphy favors a ""clean"" bill to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and said last March during a forum with the New Jersey Working Families Alliance that he would veto what the forum moderator called a ""watered down"" proposal.\Promise: Guarantee earned sick leave\Paid sick leave, like the $15 minimum wage, is another one of Murphy's central promises that he included to be ""high on that list"" of policy priorities early in his term. At a Jan. 17 round table in Newark on the two topics, Murphy said that even though about a dozen towns have passed sick leave ordinances, ""we have 565 communities in our state and we need a statewide agenda, we need a statewide law that ensures earned sick leave.""\Promise: Equal pay for equal work\Murphy aims to close the gender wage gap with a statewide law. On inauguration day he signed an executive order, his first, prohibiting state agencies from asking about a job applicant's pay history, saying employers should ""pay people based on what their job is, not on what their past pay was."" His campaign website said that he would sign a bill that ""strengthens penalties for wage discrimination, bans employers from asking job applicants for their salary history, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss compensation.""\On inauguration day he called for lawmakers to deliver.\""They don't need urging on this one, trust me, they lead on this one,"" he said on inauguration day. ""Send the bill to my desk to make this simple and common sense practice state law. As I said earlier, I will sign it.""\Promise: Create a new retirement plan for employees of small businesses.\According to his campaign website, ""Phil will offer, just as a growing number of states do, a simple, opt-in retirement plan for small business employees. Doing so will help ensure that all workers in our state can adequately save for their retirement.""\Promise: Make home ownership affordable and accessible.\According to his website, Murphy plans to achieve this by ""stopping Governor Christie's practice of diverting affordable housing funds to plug holes in the budget; expanding counseling programs to keep people in their homes and repurposing foreclosed properties as affordable housing; expanding tax credits to create new housing; and lowering property taxes by funding our schools, incentivizing shared services, and restoring rebates to low-income, seniors and disabled residents.""\Promise: Expand Earned Income Tax Credit\The earned income tax credit, or EITC, is a state benefit intended to help poor and low-income households. Christie had cut the state credit percentage relative to the federal credit in leaner years, but he raised it to 35 percent of the federal credit in 2017, his final year in office.\Murphy wants to raise the earned income tax credit to 40 percent of the federal level, his website said, ""so that working families can lift themselves out of poverty.""\Promise: Create a new child care and caregiver tax credit\This didn't get much attention during the campaign, so there aren't many specifics. Murphy told the AARP Bulletin that he would create a credit similar to the state's child-care tax credit and, the bulletin wrote, ""educate caregivers about how they can use the New Jersey Family Leave Act and make it more accessible.""\Promise: Close loopholes for ""wealthy individuals and large corporations""\Murphy talked often about closing loopholes without identifying them to help bring in revenue.\""We're going to stand for tax fairness,"" he said in the Jan. 17 MTP Daily interview. ""If you're a hedge fund and you're getting away with carried interest that we should close as a loophole at the federal [level], we're going to find a way to do that at the state level, I hope with other allied states. If you're a big corporation that's living off of loopholes,"" he added, ""we're going to close those loopholes.""\Promise: Divest pension funds from hedge funds and private equity\This is one of the ways, along with closing loopholes and raising taxes, that Murphy plans to raise about $1.3 billion to support his policy ideas. In an interview with The Record last April, he said that the state pays ""exorbitant fees to hedge funds and private equity managers"" but ""the evidence is overwhelmingly the case you no longer get what you pay for.""\""The space is overcrowded, the returns are mediocre, the fees are exorbitant. That's one obvious area,"" to save money, he said. ""Probably not the only area, but it's the area that I'd look to first.""\The State Investment Council, already facing criticism in Gov. Chris Christie's later years for its hedge fund investments, began scaling back its allocations in 2016 and seeking better fee structures.\Promise: Establish a state-level Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and strengthen existing regulations in light of President Donald Trump's efforts to roll back the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.\Murphy has not spoken much about specifics on this idea, but said when he named Assemblywoman Marlene Caride his choice to be the next Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner that it is up to the state to push back against what he views as harmful policies of Republican President Donald Trump. Murphy specifically named the administration's actions to take control of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as the sort of ""destruction that's coming at us from Washington.""\Promise: Prosecute financial fraud\This is another promise light on details but was included on Murphy's multi-step plan of ""ending Wall Street's influence on State Street."" The state Attorney General's office already does prosecute financial fraud with regularity.\Promise: Reclaim the innovation economy\Murphy often talked about New Jersey being ""Silicon Valley before there was a Silicon Valley."" According to Murphy's website, he wants to return New Jersey to its technological glory by:\""Launching a ""Computer Science for All"" initiative to offer computer science education to every public school student; partnering with companies to expand access to science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, internships and vocational programs; providing loan forgiveness for STEM educators in high-need schools and creating a new STEM-educator fellowship program to recruit and train a new class of STEM teachers.""\Murphy said he would also establish a Grant Management Office ""to make sure we get our fair share of federal funds for research and development,"" increase state funding for research and development, provide affordable, high-speed internet for all New Jerseyans and configure public spaces to be digitally and universally accessible; convene an ""innovation cabinet,"" increase access to capital for small businesses and startups and forgive student loans for new graduates launching businesses in ""under-served and distressed communities.""\Promise: Restore Christie's annual $7.5 million cut to Planned Parenthood\Christie repeatedly cut funding to Planned Parenthood and vetoed efforts from the Democratic Legislature to pass annual funding of $7.5 million. Murphy promised to restore that funding throughout the campaign, and during his inaugural address called on lawmakers to send him a bill to do so.\""To my partners in the Legislature: I ask you to send me the bills, among others, to reaffirm our support for women's health and Planned Parenthood,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Lower insurance premiums by reining in excessive out-of-network costs\Lawmakers in Trenton have tried for nearly a decade to end surprise medical bills due to out-of-network costs. Murphy has made doing so part of his plan to raise about $1.3 billion in revenues.\When he named Dr. Shareef Elnahal his choice to be the next health commissioner on Jan. 10, Murphy said that one of his challenges is going to be ""helping close the out-of-network loopholes that erode affordability."" Murphy likely has an ally in Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, who, before being named to lead the chamber, sponsored legislation to rein in excessive costs.\Promise: Work to identify the state's 75,000 uninsured children and enroll them in health coverage\Murphy listed this promise on his campaign website, but he has not laid out how he would achieve it.\Promise: Expand access to addiction treatment and services\Another unclear promise on his website. Murphy suggested during his inaugural address that he would continue Christie's work combating opioid addiction, but did not specifically say how in his speech.\""There is much in your body of work from which to choose, but, in particular, your work to save lives from the epidemic of opioid addiction is a legacy worth applauding and continuing, and I intend to do so,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Tackle opioid epidemic\According to his website, Murphy would do this by: pooling state, federal and private resources to expand access to addiction treatment facilities statewide; requiring health insurers to cover Medication-Assisted Treatment and allowing nurse practitioners, pharmacists and physician assistants to prescribe any medications necessary to treat addiction; and lowering the cost of Narcan.\Promise: Rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative\Murphy said he would ""immediately"" restore New Jersey's place in the cap-and-trade program that Christie pulled out of in 2011 because, he said, it was a failure. Murphy sees it as a necessary tool to help reduce emissions and follow a standard of environmental stewardship. In an April 2017 press release, Murphy's campaign said ""he would make rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) one of his first acts in office.""\Status: Murphy signed an executive order on Jan. 29, his 13th day in office, directing his administration begin the process to rejoin the cap-and-trade program. But it is not an immediate re-entry. The administration must work with the nine other member states to determine the best way to get back into the program and the state must create regulations on how to administer the program.\Promise: 100 percent clean energy by 2050\In an April 26, 2017 press release, Murphy outlined details of his plan and ""committed, within his first 100 days in office, to starting the process of creating a new State Energy Master Plan to set New Jersey on a path to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, with higher renewable standards to motivate public and private sector actors to adapt and expand the clean energy market.""\His plan also includes: A target of producing 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind generation by 2030, a goal of 600 megawatts of energy storage by 2021 and 2000 megawatts of storage by 2030; increasing funding and incentives for energy efficiency; and ""prioritizing solar energy expansion and ensuring that New Jersey regains its status as a national leader in solar energy production and job creation — including the establishment of a community solar program, allowing low-income communities to work together to afford clean energy options.""\Another component of his clean energy plan is a ban on fracking and storage of fracking waste in New Jersey, as well as a fracking ban in the Delaware River.\Status: Murphy signed an executive order on Jan. 31 directing his administration to develop on offshore wind plan, specifically with the 3,500 megawatt power generation goal by 2030.\Murphy announced a day later that the state intends to vote in favor of a fracking ban in the Delaware River basin.\Promise: Protect the Jersey Shore\""We will resist the dangerous and wrong attempt to allow drilling for oil off our precious shore. We will not allow this threat to our environment and our economy to stand. Our administration, along with the bipartisan support of our federal delegation, will not back down in our fight to protect the Jersey Shore from President Trump and the energy industry special interests,"" Murphy said in his inauguration speech.\Promise: Preserve open space\According to his website, Murphy will ""stop the practice of diverting constitutionally-dedicated open space funding away from its intended purpose"" and ""will also depoliticize key environmental staff and commissions — including those that protect the Highlands and Pinelands — and restore New Jersey as a leader in smart planning.""\Promise: Sign all gun legislation Christie vetoed\""You can assume the measures he's vetoed we would have signed, and we'll endeavor to do so,"" Murphy said on an Aug. 24, 2017 conference call, where he accepted the endorsement of Americans for Responsible Solutions.\Promise: Tax gun sales to prevent violence\From his website: ""All gun sales should be subject to a tax that will fund law enforcement, drug treatment centers, and mental health services."" And on an Aug. 24, 2017 conference call, Murphy said he supports a tax on guns but he lacked specifics.\""We have not picked a particular level yet. That's something we're still trying to work through,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Make New Jersey a sanctuary state*\During the Oct. 10 debate with Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, Murphy said: ""if need be, we'll be a sanctuary, not just city, but state.""\Murphy quickly backed off that language after the election, saying he recognized that the term was charged. He instead adopted ""welcoming community."" Still, he has not provided a clear definition of what that may mean. In a December interview, Murphy explained his thinking:\""How we get it done, what the trigger is, I haven't given more thought to that. But I will repeat what I said on the campaign trail: We'll do what we have to do. And, by the way, that also is invariably going to mean we're going to need to engage the federal government. And I don't mean engage in a Kumbaya. I mean we're going to need an attorney general, a governor, a lieutenant governor who are prepared to stand up to the Trump administration, probably locking arms with other like-minded states.""\*There's a catch. Murphy did not propose making New Jersey a sanctuary state as something he would pursue on his own. It is a measure he would take in response to President Donald Trump's immigration policies. It isn't clear what exactly would prompt him to pursue sanctuary policies.\Promise: Protect immigrant rights\Murphy was vocal about being resistant to policies put forth by President Donald Trump that he found un-American and perhaps unlawful. He vowed to protect so-called ""Dreamers"", young immigrants who came to the United States illegally, and said he would oppose ""any efforts,"" according to his website, to use state and local police to assist in mass deportations.\Murphy said he would extend immigrant protections to identification and education.\""I'm all in and I've been all in for years on everyone gets access to (a) driver's license, not just some of us, everyone gets a state identification card, everybody gets not just in state tuition but in state financial aid,"" he said at the March 2016 New Jersey Working Families Alliance forum. ""That can't be for some. You're either in or you're out. And I want to be in, and you have my word I will be.""\Promise: Create an Office of Immigrant Defensive Protection\Murphy wants to develop an office he described to The Washington Post as a ""legal services-oriented"" resource for immigrants. He said on MSNBC on Jan. 17 that there are a lot of ""scared"" people in the state and a ""lot of rumors"" going around under Trump.\""We want one point of contact where folks can call up and get the right answer,"" Murphy said.\Promise: Fully fund school funding formula\Murphy made it a feature of his candidacy to fully fund education under the Corzine-era School Funding Reform Act, which has not been done since it was passed in 2008 and upheld by the state Supreme Court in 2009. Three days after he was elected, speaking at the New Jersey Education Association conference in Atlantic City, he made his first big promise as governor-elect. ""For too long our educators, our students and New Jersey property taxpayers have suffered from under-funding,"" Murphy said. ""We are going to stop the under-investment in public schools. It is priority number one.""\Murphy has not said exactly how or when he would do that.\Promise: Tuition-free community college\Murphy announced the promise during a Sept. 18 news conference in Trenton with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker. He said it would cost between $200 million and $400 million. ""This is investing in the economy,"" he said. ""This is investing in our most important asset, which is our people, so the return on the investment, if you will, is significant and relatively soon.""\Promise: End PARCC testing and eliminate exit test graduation requirement\""Good teachers and good students can have bad test days. Too much emphasis is being put on a single test, as opposed to weighing a student's progress through years of instruction,"" Murphy said on his website.\Murphy said he is ""committed"" to ending Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC, testing and the requirement that students take an exit test to graduate high school. Instead, Murphy said he would direct the state Department of Education to create an assessment that would meet the standards set in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.\Promise: Expand universal pre-kindergarten\Providing pre-kindergarten statewide""is absolutely our aspiration,"" Murphy told NJTV last September. ""I don't think you can get there overnight, though. I think you have to phase it in over some number of years.""\Promise: LGBTQ equality\On his website, Murphy said he would work toward equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people by: Allowing transgender people to select their gender on birth and death certificates and ensure that access to facilities is non-discriminatory; ensuring that all residents, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, have equal access to healthcare and fertility treatment; expanding state contract set-asides to include LGBTQ-owned businesses;and reclassifying veterans dishonorably discharged due to the discriminatory ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy to an honorable discharge so they will be eligible for state benefits.\Promise: Gender parity and diversity\According to his website, ""Phil believes the perspectives of women and minorities must be represented in every rank of government. He will appoint a cabinet that reflects the diversity of New Jersey, establish a Chief Diversity Officer position, and publish an annual review of state diversity contracting and procurement.""\Status: New Jersey already has a Chief Diversity Officer, identified by the Treasury Department as Maurice Griffin.\Christie approved the position's creation in 2017 with his signature of A-1869. That person's duty is ""to monitor the state's public contracting process for the purpose of compiling information on the awarding of contracts to minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises, the total value of all contracts and the percentage of the value of those contracts awarded to minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises."" Griffin earns an annual salary of $130,000, according to Treasury Department records.\This counts as a promise kept by default. But Murphy had nothing to do with it.\Promise: Reflect New Jersey's diversity in his administration\""We will put together an administration that looks like our state in all its great diversity, experience and intelligence. We will seek the right people working in public service for the right reasons trying mightily to do the right things,"" he said on election night.\Promise: Help people with disabilities\Murphy said in his inauguration speech that having a stronger and fairer economy means that it ""remembers that we all have value and we all can contribute, including, and especially, the differently abled."" And on his campaign website he said that the state budget ""is a $35 billion statement of our priorities. We must get back to prioritizing services for the people who need them the most, including those struggling with disabilities."" He added that he is ""determined to make New Jersey the most inclusive and most accessible place to live, work, and raise a family for people with disabilities.""\Murphy plans to achieve that by better coordinating state services and making sure that people with disabilities ""have a seat at our policy-making table.""\Promise: Divide the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs into two agencies — one with responsibility for the National Guard and another responsible for veterans\""Veterans' issues are fundamentally distinct from military affairs, and our bureaucratic structure should reflect that reality,"" Murphy said on his website.\Murphy said that ""at a minimum,"" the new veterans affairs department should consist of divisions for employment and skills development; mental health; higher education; veteran-owned businesses and military transitions and families.\Promise: Improve NJ Transit\Murphy has said that NJ Transit was once a model for the nation, but it has in recent years become a ""national disgrace.""\On his website, Murphy outlined a number of immediate steps for near-term commuter relief: ""Appointing an emergency manager to re-convene a working relationship with Amtrak — a relationship that currently is broken — around issues at Penn Station, as well as coordinate with various state and federal agencies, including the Port Authority; undertaking an immediate capital and personnel audit of NJ Transit to understand the true needs of the agency; improving customer service by deploying more uniformed NJ Transit personnel in NY Penn Station, Secaucus, and Newark Penn, among other key stations.""\More from the website: ""Murphy also would require NJ Transit to have push notifications about delayed trains on its app, create a ""Where's my train?"" app that would mirror the ""Where's my bus?"" app, and make it easier for commuters to obtain delay letters both online and through the app; expanding options for alternative service by creating an indefinite cross-honoring agreement with PATH and also cross-honoring with ferries and bus services, including private carriers; increasing transparency by requiring weekly reports by NJ Transit including data on number of trains on time during peak and off-peak hours and length of delays, as well as opening more NJ Transit board meetings to the public and streaming them online; holding Amtrak accountable on repairs to ensure that no hour in which tracks are closed is wasted and disruptions are minimized disruptions, including requiring work to be done during off-hours and through holiday weekends.""\Finally, Murphy said he would: ""Restore professionalism to NJT management by implementing the recommendations of the capital and personnel audit to hire a new class of professional and nationally-qualified management,"" and ""ensure NJ Transit's board has commuter representation to better allow the agency to respond to consumer concerns, establish an ongoing working arrangement with Amtrak, NJTransit, and the LIRR to fund capital improvements in and around Penn Station, including those that would facilitate better passenger movement"" and ""expedite implementation of safety measures, including positive train control automatic braking technology, to guarantee long-range passenger safety.""\Status: Murphy took the first steps toward his promise of improving NJ Transit but has a long way to go. He signed an executive order on Jan. 22 directing an audit of the transportation agency to be completed ""as expeditiously as possible."" He also named Kevin Corbett the agency's new executive director on Jan. 30, promising he would ""yank it back from the brink."""
115,"legislature environmental concerns\The premise -- that RGGI is a failure -- was debated at length at Monday's hearing.\TRENTON Gov. Chris Christie says he is committed to protecting natural resources and is not a climate-change skeptic. But environmentalists and Democrats are skeptical. They dominated an Assembly hearing Monday at the Statehouse, armed with criticism of the Republican governor's decision to pull New Jersey out of the nation's first cap-and-trade anti-pollution program.\They also questioned whether Christie alone has the authority to make such a move.\Christie said last month the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, called RGGI and pronounced ""reggie,"" isn't effective and thwarts economic development.\Getting out of the program does not require legislative approvals, Christie's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, said.\""Participation in the RGGI consortium was via a contractual arrangement in which there are provisions for the state to pull out with notice and without penalty,"" Drewniak said.\Drewniak said the state Department of Environmental Protection also will ""need to repeal some rules which it will do in compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act.""\Christie said he was confident there wouldn't be hitches in exiting when he announced his intention May 26.\The premise -- that RGGI is a failure -- was debated at length at Monday's hearing.\Christie sent a top environmental adviser, Ray Cantor, to testify before the Assembly Utilities and Environment Committee.\Cantor was grilled by the chairman, Assemblyman Upendra J. Chivukula, D-Somerset, when Cantor called RGGI a ""tax"" that had not reduced ""a single pound of carbon"" emission since the program went into effect more than two years ago.\As for claims by environmentalists that RGGI will help create jobs with expansion of a clean-energy market, Cantor said, ""We believe we'll create more jobs by lowering taxes.""\Chivukula depicted the policy change as appeasement for corporations already based here, while bringing risk to the environment.\He said he doubted that businesses from outside the state will notice.\""Now that the governor has pulled New Jersey out of RGGI, how many companies are rushing into New Jersey because they'll be paying 5 percent less on their energy bills?"" Chivukula said.\Later, Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey, said the program hasn't had a chance.\Mottola Jaborska said fixes were due to be made in 2012.\""If I were a clean-energy company, I'd be very concerned with coming to New Jersey right now,"" she said.\After the hearing, Chivukula and two other Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation intended to require New Jersey's continued participation in RGGI.\The package of bills includes a measure that would make participation a state law and would require Christie to use the funds generated from the program for clean energy projects.\Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said the pact enjoyed bipartisan support when it was enacted in 2008.\Tittel said companies that receive RGGI funds have been able to make energy efficiency improvements or build on-site clean energy projects, helping them save money and support local jobs with workers retrofitting buildings.\Sara Bluhm, representing the 23,000-member New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said RGGI increases costs for businesses -- and for residential customers as well.\Bluhm said a recent study pegged the added cost of energy bills because of government policy at 26 percent.\Bob Jordan: 609-984-4343, BJordan@NJPress Media.com\ABOUT RGGI\RGGI is a 10-state agreement intended to reduce carbon dioxide pollution in the Northeast by 10 percent by 2018. Entities such as power plants must purchase pollution allowances. Proceeds from the auction of allowances are intended to be invested in clean energy measures that further reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions."
116,"Gov. Phil Murphy began the process Monday for New Jersey to re-enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, six years after former Gov. Chris Christie made the controversial decision to leave the multi-state cap-and-trade compact.\Murphy, a Democrat who succeeded the Republican Christie on Jan. 16, had pledged to make New Jersey's re-entry into the initiative, known as RGGI, one of his first moves upon taking office. At a Monday morning ceremony overlooking Sandy Hook Bay, Murphy signed an executive order directing the state to rejoin the nine-state coalition.\""As the densest state in the nation, we can ill afford to keep our heads in the sand when it comes to climate change,"" Murphy said during a signing ceremony at the Seastreak ferry port in Highlands, a low-lying Monmouth County town devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Murphy cited the storm as one example of the effects of climate change.\""Environmental impacts here are not contained, they are felt along the broad swaths of our state. Sandy's impacts were felt in virtually every community,"" he said.\The greenhouse gas initiative aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which most science organizations agree is a leading cause of global warming and rising sea levels that have led to extreme weather in recent years. Nine states, from Maine to Maryland, are part of the initiative that caps the amount of carbon dioxide power plants may release and requires those plants to purchase credits allowing them to emit specified amounts of the gas.\When Christie pulled New Jersey out of the program in 2011 — it took effect in 2012 — he argued that it was a tax with no discernible effect on the environment.\While he accepted the reality of climate change, Christie viewed it as an ineffective tool to battle global warming and often pointed out in the face of criticism that New Jersey's carbon emissions fell below the state's own goals.\But Murphy said Monday that Christie's withdrawal from the compact ""lacked any commonsense,"" left money on the table and ""robbed"" New Jersey of the opportunity to invest in clean energy options. In his executive order, Murphy cited unidentified studies that said New Jersey lost as much as $279 million by its absence from the program.\Murphy's wife, Tammy Murphy, who plans to make the environment one of her main concerns during the administration, tallied up a list of losses for the state.\In 2015, she said, participating states invested a combined $410 million in energy efficiency programs, clean energy production and assistance for residents. As a result, those states' consumers saved $2.3 billion, she said.\Murphy said the executive order marked a campaign promise kept, but added that ""It's a broader promise of building New Jersey where science isn't something to be ignored and commonsense once again leads our decision-making.""\The executive order does not instantly bring New Jersey back into the fold of RGGI states.\Jeff Tittel, executive director of the state's Sierra Club chapter, said it could take between six and nine months for full re-entry. And the executive order Murphy signed directs his acting Department of Environmental Protection commissioner, Catherine McCabe, and Board of Public Utilities President Joseph Fiordaliso ""to immediately begin negotiations with current RGGI member states to determine how to best reenter New Jersey into the carbon budget trading program.""\The Department of Environmental Protection must also create a structure for how RGGI funds will be allocated. A bill moving through the Legislature would also require the state to rejoin RGGI, but with the added caveat that pulling out of the compact would require legislative approval.\Two of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, and Assemblyman Tim Eustace, D-Maywood, joined Murphy during the ceremony and hailed the decision as an overdue action to battle climate change. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, who co-sponsors the bill, was not there.\Environmental group leaders were also there and praised Murphy.\""RGGI is a light of climate action in the darkness of climate rollbacks of the Trump era,"" Environment New Jersey Director Doug O'Malley said in a statement, referring to Republican President Donald Trump, who has said climate change is a hoax and has taken steps to roll back environmental policies. ""While RGGI is not a silver bullet to reduce all our carbon emissions, it's an incredible first step to reduce pollution from our fossil fuel plants and move us to a clean, renewable energy economy.""\U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-6th, who is the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that Trump's policies, such as pulling out of the Paris climate accord and plans to drill for oil off the Atlantic coast, elevate the state's role.\""What we continue to hear from the Trump administration is tearing down environmental protection,"" Pallone said. ""Right now we're depending on the states and the towns to do things to try to achieve our climate goals because we know that the federal government simply will not do it,"" he added."
117,"| Statehouse Bureau\It was last call for New Jersey residents to vent concerns ranging from pollution to the proposed folding of Rutgers University's Camden campus into Rowan University.\Even concerns about the trading of shark fins were on the minds of those crowded into the halls of the Statehouse Thursday.\A half-dozen citizen groups staged demonstrations outside the Statehouse and lobbied legislators inside the building on a number of different causes Thursday, trying to win influence before the Legislature starts its annual six-week budget break.\The day had an almost festival feel to it, as legislators, lobbyists and advocates packed into the hallway connecting the Senate and Assembly chambers. Making the space even tighter were various exhibits by vendors taking part in a New Jersey Business and Industry Association effort to highlight products made in the Garden State.\Adding to the scrum were bands, Girl Scouts (on hand for a ceremony honoring the organization's 100th anniversary) and Irish heritage groups. People roamed the capitol's hallways and common areas hoping for chance meetings with members of the Assembly and Senate.\Middletown residents Heidi Bruhin and Lynn Dash thought they hit the jackpot when they shared an elevator ride with Republican Sen. Joseph Kyrillos, R-Monmouth.\Bruhin and Dash tried to make the case to Kyrillos that he support a bill compelling New Jersey to participate in a regional cap-and-trade program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Kyrillos had championed Gov. Chris Christie's decision last year to withdraw from the 10-state pact.\""I don't think he's going to change his mind, but he told us he's still listening to all the arguments,"" Bruhin said.\When the vote was held, Kyrillos and all but one of his Republican colleagues opposed the measure.\The bill passed 22-15 on support from Democrats, too thin a margin to make a two-thirds override attempt of the GOP governor viable right away, but a leader of an environmentalist group promised to keep the pressure on.\""This is a beginning, not an end,"" said Doug O'Malley, field director of Environment New Jersey. ""We have a good measuring stick of where we need to pick up votes .""\O'Malley said more than 100 people were in Trenton hoping to drum up support on the legislation to keep New Jersey in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Buses picked up advocates in Red Bank, Wall, Jackson and other points in the state, with one bus with 20 passengers rolling from Ridgewood after a 7 a.m. pickup.\Camden residents Ulysses Delgado and Moneke Ragsdale were in Trenton to protest the proposed Camden County takeover of the city police force, a transition supported by the governor.\Another group of about 20 people focused entirely on the merger of Rutgers-Camden and Rowan. Hyun Kyu Seo, a Rutgers-Camden student, brought copies of online petitions he created in opposition to the merger, signed electronically by 11,500.\The junior art major from Columbus -- joined by several other students and a dozen Rutgers-Camden faculty members -- said taxpayers ""deserve a fuller fiscal and educational accounting before being forced to commit to radical changes in education in southern New Jersey.""\""I disagree that a merger between Rutgers-Camden and Rowan will boost the educational mission of both institutions,"" he said.\Meanwhile, Brick resident Steve Nagiewicz, chairman of the nonprofit Shark Research Institute and an environmental science teacher at Atlantic City High School, visited the Statehouse to bring attention to new legislation sponsored by Sen. Christopher ""Kip"" Bateman, R-Somerset, designed to prohibit the trade of shark fins within the state. It would pull fins out of the seafood trade. Nagiewicz said similar legislation has been passed in California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington.\Day of protests: The issues\Gov. Chris Christie withdrew New Jersey from a multistate cap-and-trade program designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions, saying it was ineffective and costly to businesses. Environmentalists say the program cuts pollution and provides revenue to states from factories that exceed carbon allowances.\The proposed folding of Rutgers University's Camden campus into Rowan University is undergoing criticism by administration, faculty and students from the Camden school.\The trading of shark fins within the state should be prohibited, according to advocates supporting new legislation to end the practice.\The Highlands Council's proposed change of executive director was criticized by enviornmentalists who claim Christie prompted the change weaken enforcement of laws protecting the region.\ID_Code: B3-303150082"
118,"COMMENTARY\BECAUSE of an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that global warming is a serious threat to the world's environment, one solution is emerging that would have been inconceivable a decade ago: State governments in the Northeast may designate nuclear power as a ""green"" energy source that merits clean-air credits.\Given that it's the only major energy source available to satisfy growing energy demands without further loading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, nuclear power meets the conditions for receiving tax credits under a nine-state plan to reduce greenhouse emissions.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was created three years ago under the leadership of New York State Gov. George Pataki. In April, representatives of state agencies and private organizations from New England and the mid-Atlantic will meet to establish a market-based system for curtailing carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants. New Jersey will be among the states represented at the meeting.\Even though some environmental groups have vowed to walk out if nuclear power obtains this seal of approval, there are powerful incentives for including it in the carbon-reduction program. Greenhouse gas emission-free nuclear plants provide 30 percent of the electricity in the Northeast, compared to less than 1 percent from solar and wind energy combined. Since they are intermittent energy sources, solar and wind cannot be relied on to provide large amounts of electricity every day. If not for nuclear power, the region would have to obtain even more of its electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels - especially coal, which is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.\Therefore, excluding nuclear power from the carbon-reduction program would be self-defeating. Without continued and even increasing use of nuclear power, there is no hope for this region to get carbon emissions from power plants under control. By recognizing the important role that nuclear power has been playing in providing emission-free electricity, state officials will not just be rewarding its current performance, but will be encouraging an ongoing contribution.\Our region needs 16 existing nuclear plants to renew their licenses, allowing them to operate for another 20 years, as well as new, advanced nuclear plants in the future. Nuclear power could then continue to play an important role in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.\The market-based approach envisioned in the regional initiative would set an overall level of emissions for carbon dioxide. The idea would be to reduce emissions to 1990 levels, using a cap-and-trade system in which electricity companies are encouraged to use the lowest-cost source of emissions reductions. The owner of a power plant with high costs to reduce emissions - a coal plant, for example - could pay another firm with lower costs to reduce its emissions by the prescribed amount. This market-based approach saves money and keeps electricity costs affordable, while achieving the desired reduction in greenhouse emissions.\Nuclear power would benefit from the cap-and-trade system, because the production costs of nuclear-generated electricity, on average, are only a third those of electricity produced from power plants that burn natural gas. In New Jersey, it would be easier for utility owners to make progress toward achieving carbon controls by making full use of the Hope Creek, Salem and Oyster Creek nuclear power plants. These reactors produce zero emissions, while gas-fired plants release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air.\In addition, natural gas should be reserved for better uses than electricity production. Residential consumers need natural gas for heating and cooking purposes, and it's essential to manufacturers in many petrochemical and other industrial processes.\It is in New Jersey's interest that nuclear power plants receive clean-air credit at the upcoming regional meeting. Without more nuclear power, any strategy for significantly reducing greenhouse gases in power production will be unworkable. The federal government and energy industries are recognizing that nuclear power must be one of the building blocks for a future without the threat of global warming; it's time for our states to do so as well.\Roger P. Shaw, Rumson, a nuclear engineer, is the former director of radiation protection at the Three Mile Island and Oyster Creek nuclear power plants."
119,"In June, Gov. Phil Murphy's administration denied permits to a controversial pipeline that would send natural gas from New Jersey under Raritan Bay to New York City — a move that environmentalists said reaffirmed the governor's goals to move the state away from fossil fuels.\A week later, Murphy's representative on the Delaware River Basin Commission voted with others to approve permits for a massive liquefied natural gas port on the Delaware River in Gloucester County that will allow a glut of gas fracked from Pennsylvania to be compressed and loaded onto ships for export.\Those two decisions — seven days apart — capture what many see as Murphy's inconsistency with environmental issues despite his forceful campaigning as a green candidate.\Murphy often boasts that his administration is leading the charge against climate change, which he calls an ""existential threat."" And he has said he is making New Jersey ""a national model for sound, fact-based, pro-growth, and proudly progressive and forward-leaning policymaking.""\While Murphy has laid out an aggressive agenda for New Jersey to become more reliant on renewable energy, states such as California, New York and Washington have set more ambitious goals that put them at the vanguard of a growing movement by cities and states to try countering the threats of climate change through local environmental policy.\Murphy, a Democrat, has also been dogged by criticism that he lacks a sense of urgency for passing key measures that could stem the impact of climate change. And he is faulted by some, including his environmental supporters, that his talk on climate change doesn't match the reality of his actions as governor.\He has not fulfilled his promise to reopen the Office of Climate Change, which was shuttered by former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican. Murphy has diverted hundreds of millions of dollars in environmental funds to help balance the state budget. New Jersey is one of two coastal states without climate adaptation plans. And the administration has not set forth rules to regulate greenhouse gas emissions or rolled back Christie-era regulations viewed as harmful to the environment.\""We'd like to see more agreement between his rhetoric and what he's willing to do politically and expend the capital on,"" said Amy Goldsmith, longtime state director of the advocacy group Clean Water Action.\A coalition of several dozen environmental groups and progressive organizations that make up Murphy's base say the most egregious errors so far are a failure to impose a moratorium on new fossil fuel projects and redefining clean energy in its draft energy master plan to mean carbon-neutral — a key distinction that allows for carbon production in ways such as trash incineration and new power plants.\Murphy made a campaign pledge to ""eventually"" reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity. But his office said, without elaborating, that there are a ""number of regional restraints and challenges to going completely carbon-free.""\The master plan, which serves as the state's guiding policy document, also does not set near-term benchmarks that environmental groups say are needed to meet the scientific community's clarion call to sharply reduce emissions by 2030 and reach ""net zero"" carbon emissions by 2050.\Net zero emissions, as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. National Climate Assessment, means reducing carbon output economy-wide to zero or at least dramatically reducing emissions and offsetting the rest through removal methods.\New Jersey's definition of carbon-neutral is similar but does not apply as widely, leaving room for emissions elsewhere. Under state law passed in 2007, New Jersey would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent of 2006 levels by 2050.\""Defining clean energy as carbon-neutral is something Donald Trump would do. It's Orwellian. It's like Ben and Jerry saying their ice cream is vegan,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club.\Murphy is vocal that climate change is already taking a toll on New Jersey and the planet. His moves to ban offshore drilling, jump-start wind and solar energy production, aggressively use lawsuits against polluters and President Donald Trump and rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — a multistate cap-and-trade program designed to reduce emissions — have earned praise from even his toughest critics.\But many advocates say much more aggressive action is needed from him to adequately fight the impacts of climate change over the next several years.\""The rollbacks were so massive under Christie that you can't just chisel away at the edges,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey. ""You need a full reversal. We have seen progress on that front, but not fast enough.""\Murphy's office said his Department of Environmental Protection has ""improved upon"" many of the Christie-era regulations and proposed ""the most far-reaching stream protection rule in nearly a decade"" that will buffer the waterways from development. An effort to regulate chemicals in groundwater and drinking water has also drawn worldwide attention, said Alexandra Altman, a spokeswoman for the governor.\And the administration has done ""far more"" than just reopening the Office of Climate Change, she said, by naming a chief resilience officer and reorganizing the Climate & Flood Resilience Program, which ""serves as a hub responsible for coordinating the climate change resilience and adaptation work ongoing in many programs across the DEP.""\One of Murphy's most reliable supporters, the League of Conservation Voters, said the governor deserves praise for re-focusing the state on environmental issues, particularly renewable energy.\""He has to make up for eight years of lost time under Christie,"" said the group's executive director, Ed Potosnak. ""There are areas where there is impatience, especially in the environmental community. But we think he's living up to our expectations and his vision for the environment.""\The impatience is due to the immediate threat of climate change, which is heightened in New Jersey because rising sea levels threaten thousands of properties. Nationally, the planet's warming trend will have devastating effects on the economy, health and agriculture, according to the national climate assessment.\""The verdict is in,"" Murphy tweeted when that assessment was released in November. ""The world must act now to curb the cataclysmic effects of climate change.""\Environmental groups agree. Placing a moratorium on new fossil fuel projects would send a message that Murphy is more serious about boldly addressing climate change, but he could do even better by setting immediate goals to reduce emissions, they said.\""There's no plan in place to seriously reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 years when the scientists are telling us we need to have at least a 45 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 if we're going to avoid climate catastrophe,"" said Jonathan Reichman, an attorney on the board of the advocacy group Blue Wave NJ. ""That seems to be the gold standard.""\Perhaps most frustrating to environmentalists is Murphy's position on fossil fuels. The administration supports a plan set in motion by Christie for NJ Transit to build a gas-fired power plant in the Meadowlands, a move that promises to keep local and Amtrak rail lines reliably powered even during extreme weather but would add another major source of greenhouse gas emissions to the region.\Murphy has also been mum on about a dozen fossil fuel projects throughout the state that environmental groups say would derail his clean energy goals. Among them is a power plant slated for the Meadowlands that would be tied for the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the state if built.\""I don't understand how the governor cannot see his own hypocrisy in that,"" said Matt Smith, an organizer for Food & Water Watch New Jersey, which is one of the groups that make up the Empower New Jersey coalition seeking to strengthen the energy master plan.\Smith pointed to Murphy's words the day the climate assessment was released as an example of the mismatch between the governor's rhetoric and his actions.\""Murphy is very quick to jump on Twitter and say this is the single biggest moral issue of our time and sort of mirroring the rhetoric of the campaign trail, which is that he was going to be a national leader,"" Smith said. ""But when it gets to actual policy, whether implemented or proposed, he falls far short of the mark.""\There is still time for Murphy to alter course.

126,"In June, Gov. Phil Murphy's administration denied permits to a controversial pipeline that would send natural gas from New Jersey under Raritan Bay to New York City — a move that environmentalists said reaffirmed the governor's goals to move the state away from fossil fuels.\A week later, Murphy's representative on the Delaware River Basin Commission voted with others to approve permits for a massive liquefied natural gas port on the Delaware River in Gloucester County that will allow a glut of gas fracked from Pennsylvania to be compressed and loaded onto ships for export.\Those two decisions — seven days apart — capture what many see as Murphy's inconsistency with environmental issues despite his forceful campaigning as a green candidate.\Murphy often boasts that his administration is leading the charge against climate change, which he calls an ""existential threat."" And he has said he is making New Jersey ""a national model for sound, fact-based, pro-growth, and proudly progressive and forward-leaning policymaking.""\While Murphy has laid out an aggressive agenda for New Jersey to become more reliant on renewable energy, states such as California, New York and Washington have set more ambitious goals that put them at the vanguard of a growing movement by cities and states to try countering the threats of climate change through local environmental policy.\Murphy, a Democrat, has also been dogged by criticism that he lacks a sense of urgency for passing key measures that could stem the impact of climate change. And he is faulted by some, including his environmental supporters, that his talk on climate change doesn't match the reality of his actions as governor.\He has not fulfilled his promise to reopen the Office of Climate Change, which was shuttered by former Gov.

127,"Gov. Chris Christie, as expected, has no intention of putting New Jersey back in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Last week, for the third time, he vetoed a legislative push to rejoin the initiative after pulling the state out in 2011. He said New Jersey is doing just fine on its own in cutting carbon emissions and that RGGI amounts to little more than another tax on energy consumers.\Christie's resolve doesn't matter much at this point. It's likely that New Jersey will jump back into RGGI soon after a new governor takes over. Both Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno have expressed support.\The bigger question now is should New Jersey be part of RGGI? The short answer is simply yes.\Let's first start with some common sense. Nine other Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states were part of RGGI from the beginning in 2009 and have remained -- Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland and Delaware. Does anyone honestly think Christie himself knows better than the rest of these states? Highly unlikely.\To be fair, Christie isn't just some powerful lone wolf on this issue. RGGI opposition generally falls along predictable partisan lines, with anti-environment conservatives bemoaning restrictions on industry that hurt jobs and raise costs, and scoffing at concerns about climate change. Supporters emphasize a vital need to curb carbon emissions to temper the effects of global warming.\Gauging the success of RGGI to date is tricky business, in part because of the influence of other factors, in part because RGGI itself remains a work in progress. The idea behind the cap-and-trade initiative is to establish caps on carbon emissions that decline over time, and to sell at auction ""allowances"" for those emissions. Power-plant companies buying the right to release those emissions therefore have a built-in incentive to curb them. Auction proceeds raise revenue for the state to reinvest in green-energy initiatives, furthering emission reductions and balancing added business costs that would be passed on to electricity users.\That's the way it's supposed to work. But there's still a good deal of trial and error involved. Energy prices have dropped since RGGI went into effect, but that period also encompasses a massive recession and growth in domestic gas and oil production. RGGI states have come in under the emissions caps relatively easily because, experts say, the caps have been too high. That has kept auction prices low and reduced impact on electricity customers, but has also minimized the environmental impact of RGGI. More aggressively lowering those caps is expected to change some of those dynamics in the years ahead.\RGGI is an imperfect solution, but an important one, especially now as the Trump Administration rolls out one anti-environment measure after another.

128,"TRENTON -- Gov. Chris Christie intends to keep New Jersey out of a multistate pollution-reduction pact, despite facing a lawsuit filed Wednesday by two environmental groups seeking to have the state rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\Christie a year ago announced an end to participation with nine other states in the RGGI cap-and-trade program, denouncing it as a de facto tax on businesses with potentially higher energy bills for residents.\Environmentalists claim RGGI was delivering on promises to cut air pollution. They said the market for pollution permits had generated $159 million in sales in New Jersey during three years of participation, including $125 million for the state to use toward energy efficiency and renewable projects.\The lawsuit filed by Environment New Jersey and the National Resources Defense Council claims Christie and other state officials acted unilaterally in pulling New Jersey out of the program.\A spokesman for Christie, Michael Drewniak, disagreed.\""There was nothing illegal about our withdrawal from RGGI. Participation in the RGGI consortium was via a contractual arrangement with provisions for any state to pull out with notice and without penalty,"" Drewniak said. ""No one was locked into RGGI, which was a failed public policy that taxed businesses and residents and left New Jersey at a competitive disadvantage.""\Christie is also being pressured by state lawmakers. A resolution approved May 24 compelling the state's return to RGGI sits on Christie's desk.\He has until July 8 to sign it, but Drewniak said, ""No, we will not be rejoining RGGI.""\The lawsuit filed in the Appellate Division of Superior Court in Trenton contends that Christie and the state Department of Environmental Protection violated the state's rulemaking process by failing to take public comment.\""Governor Christie unilaterally made his decision to leave RGGI without taking any input from stakeholders or the public,"" said Matt Elliott, clean energy advocate for Environment New Jersey. ""As we contend today, his actions are not only bad public policy, but also illegal. The people of New Jersey have spoken out overwhelmingly in support of RGGI. To date, over 50,000 New Jerseyans have called or written their elected officials urging them to stand up for RGGI.""\Bob Jordan: bjordan@\njpressmedia.com"

130,"For eight years, New Jersey sat on the environmental sidelines, unable to show any leadership in promoting clean energy and combating climate change because its governor didn't want to.\That's changing rapidly under a new governor, however, with Phil Murphy already moving to reverse some of the environmental mistakes of his predecessor. New Jerseyans should be thankful, because Murphy's efforts may one day help save a lot of homes and businesses, and a lot of lives.\Former Gov. Chris Christie wasn't a climate change denier. But he also didn't believe New Jersey should bother doing much of anything about it. Conservatives like Christie just don't think it's worth the cost to fight Mother Nature, regardless of how much human activity may be pushing global warming along. New Jersey, however, is headed back in the right direction. Murphy's actions to date include:\On Tuesday, he appointed NY/NJ Baykeeper Debbie Mans as the second in command at the state Department of Environmental Protection. Her appointment as deputy commissioner is one of the top spots ever held in recent years by an environmental advocate\Two weeks ago, he signed an executive order to restore the state to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a multistate effort to reduce carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade program. Christie said years ago that RGGI was ineffective, but the program has endured, helping fund carbon-reducing programs with revenue generated by auctioning off carbon ""allowances"" to power companies. Murphy said Christie's decision has cost New Jersey nearly $300 million, and he wants future funds to be primarily devoted to so-called ""environmental justice"" communities — lower-income urban areas suffering from pollution.\He supported a ban on hydraulic fracturing — fracking — within the Delaware River Basin. Governors from neighboring states are on board as well, with the hope of protecting a water supply serving more than 15 million people among four states. Fracking — injecting a powerful mixture of water and chemicals into the ground — has helped to unlock vast new natural gas supplies, but the process comes with significant environmental risk. New Jersey's jump into the fray can only help prospects for a ban.\He removed the state from a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan. This one isn't likely to have much impact; many other states continue to fight the plan's goals of reducing carbon pollution by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, which critics — including Christie — have maintained will drive up costs and unduly control energy markets. But it's a stand on principle.\This is just a start for Murphy. Christie was at best neglectful and often aggressively opposed to environmental causes, and the administration in Washington will do nothing for the environment under President Donald Trump. Some of Murphy's desire to undo Christie's overall legacy may be misplaced, but on the environment there should be little doubt. After eight years on the bench, it's time for New Jersey to get back in the game and fight.\CAPTION: \Gov. Phil Murphy said in Phillipsburg on Feb. 1 that New Jersey will vote to ban fracking in the Delaware River basin, countering former Gov.

131,"Environmental advocates say New Jersey's participation in a multi-state greenhouse gas reduction program yielded $151 million in economic benefits over the past three years, including the creation of 1,700 jobs.\The report released Wednesday by Environment New Jersey was intended as a challenge to Governor Christie's claim that the state's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative had produced no economic or climate-change benefits.\But the Christie administration fired back a challenge of its own, with a spokesman saying the report's job creation claim was ""fictitious.""\RGGI, as the cap-and-trade program is known, requires utilities in the participating states to purchase credits for each ton of carbon they emit. The credits are sold through public auctions, with the revenues used for programs that promote renewable energy and clean-energy technology. In New Jersey, the allowances that power emitters were forced to buy led to a 0.7 percent increase in electric rates, which environmentalists argued was so minimal as to make little difference to most ratepayers.\Calling it a ""failure"" that amounted to nothing more than a ""tax on electricity,"" Christie announced last May the state would leave the RGGI program.\Matt Elliot, clean energy advocate for Environment New Jersey, argued that the governor's action was based on ""misinformation.""\The group contends the program not only created job and business opportunities in green energy fields, but that its initiatives eliminated the need for 52,000 megawatt hours of fossil-fuel-generated electricity each year. That translates into 13,100 fewer metric tons of carbon emissions per year, or the equivalent of taking 2,500 cars off the road, according to the report.\""The choice is crystal clear: New Jersey should remain in RGGI,"" said Elliot, arguing that the state stands to lose millions of dollars of revenue in the coming years from the carbon-allowance auctions that could be invested in clean energy industries.\His organization and other environmental groups are trying to persuade lawmakers to pass legislation that would require the state to rejoin the program.\Other programs better\But as far as the administration is concerned, ""the RGGI issue is done,"" said Larry Ragonese, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. He said the administration believes the state's other air pollution programs will be able to achieve better emissions reductions in New Jersey than could be accomplished with the RGGI program.\In addition to taking issue with the report's job-creation claims, Ragonese said the money raised by RGGI -- $151 million -- was ""minuscule in the scope of things.""\""This business was discouraging businesses from coming to New Jersey,"" Ragonese said. ""It was bad for ratepayers and bad public policy.""\Credit: Email: diskin@northjersey.com"

Last week, for the third time, he vetoed a legislative push to rejoin the initiative after pulling the state out in 2011. He said New Jersey is doing just fine on its own in cutting carbon emissions and that RGGI amounts to little more than another tax on energy consumers.\Christie's resolve doesn't matter much at this point. It's likely that New Jersey will jump back into RGGI soon after a new governor takes over. Both Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno have expressed support.\The bigger question now is should New Jersey be part of RGGI? The short answer is simply yes.\Let's first start with some common sense. Nine other Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states were part of RGGI from the beginning in 2009 and have remained -- Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland and Delaware. Does anyone honestly think Christie himself knows better than the rest of these states? Highly unlikely.\To be fair, Christie isn't just some powerful lone wolf on this issue. RGGI opposition generally falls along predictable partisan lines, with anti-environment conservatives bemoaning restrictions on industry that hurt jobs and raise costs, and scoffing at concerns about climate change. Supporters emphasize a vital need to curb carbon emissions to temper the effects of global warming.\Gauging the success of RGGI to date is tricky business, in part because of the influence of other factors, in part because RGGI itself remains a work in progress. The idea behind the cap-and-trade initiative is to establish caps on carbon emissions that decline over time, and to sell at auction ""allowances"" for those emissions. Power-plant companies buying the right to release those emissions therefore have a built-in incentive to curb them. Auction proceeds raise revenue for the state to reinvest in green-energy initiatives, furthering emission reductions and balancing added business costs that would be passed on to electricity users.\That's the way it's supposed to work. But there's still a good deal of trial and error involved. Energy prices have dropped since RGGI went into effect, but that period also encompasses a massive recession and growth in domestic gas and oil production. RGGI states have come in under the emissions caps relatively easily because, experts say, the caps have been too high. That has kept auction prices low and reduced impact on electricity customers, but has also minimized the environmental impact of RGGI. More aggressively lowering those caps is expected to change some of those dynamics in the years ahead.\RGGI is an imperfect solution, but an important one, especially now as the Trump Administration rolls out one anti-environment measure after another. States have a growing responsibility to pick up the ball Washington has dropped, and RGGI can serve as a model for other regions as the kinks continue to be smoothed out. We look forward to New Jersey returning to the RGGI fold.\States have a growing responsibility to pick up the ball Washington has dropped, and RGGI can serve as a model for other regions as the kinks continue to be smoothed out."
135,"IT IS an unprecedented, historic action. Three former New Jersey governors -- a Republican and two Democrats -- have joined in a legal action against the Christie administration, in an attempt to protect the environmental legacies of their respective administrations. Govs. Brendan Byrne, Christine Whitman and James Florio filed an amicus brief earlier this month in support of a lawsuit filed against the state by the Sierra Club and Environment New Jersey. The suit seeks to halt the construction of the Pinelands pipeline, one of 12 such pipelines being planned in the state.\The controversial 22-mile natural-gas pipeline that would run through New Jersey's Pinelands is part of a large-scale project to convert the power plant owned by B.L. England in Beesley's Point, which has been ordered to close unless it converts from coal to natural gas. The pipeline would run through the 1 million-acre Pinelands National Preserve, a haven of protected pine forests, and the largest open space in the coastal region. The Pinelands -- also home to an 18-trillion-gallon aquifer -- is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, as it hosts plants and species found nowhere else in the world.\After thousands of New Jerseyans voiced their opposition to the pipeline to the Pinelands Commission - including hundreds who attended public hearings -in January 2014, the commission rejected the proposed the pipeline. A majority of commission members recognized that the pipeline violated both the Pinelands Protection Act, which requires that development within the sanctuary serve the needs of the Pinelands, and the state's Comprehensive Management Plan, because the pipeline will serve a plant outside of the Pinelands region. But that rejection was contrary to the position held by Governor Christie, who then appointed several ""pro-pipeline"" appointees to the commission.\Unilateral ruling\But even with the newly installed members, the administration chose not to risk another vote, and instead the Christie-appointed Pinelands Commission's executive director, Nancy Wittenberg, unilaterally determined that the proposed pipeline was consistent with the state's Comprehensive Management Plan. Wittenberg's decision meant that there was not another messy public hearing on the pipeline and Pinelands Commission members were not allowed to vote on the pipeline project.\Following Wittenberg's ruling, the state Board of Public Utilities removed local jurisdiction -- which would have meant that the pipeline would have needed municipal land-use approvals in each of the municipalities it traverses, including Maurice River Township, Upper Township and Estell Manor.\The ruling by Wittenberg, circumventing a full public hearing and Pinelands Commission vote, and the authorization by the BPU, circumventing the municipal approval process, prompted the filing of the lawsuit.\Each of the governors filing the friend of the court brief had some role in protecting the Pinelands during their careers: As a congressman, Florio wrote federal legislation that established the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve. After serving as governor, he then presided over the Pinelands Commission from 2002 to 2005. Byrne signed the state Pinelands Protection Act into law in 1979. Whitman was a vocal advocate during her administration for open space in the Pinelands.\Violation charged\In the brief, the governors urge the court to vacate the Board of Public Utilities approval for the pipeline, arguing that it is in violation of the Comprehensive Management Plan, and that Wittenberg's position as executive director ""is administrative and advisory only,"" stating that ""the integrity of the Pinelands program and its careful balancing of interests require a formal decision from the full commission, not an advisory letter from the commission's staff."" They also state that the BPU should not have waived municipal review of the project.\When asked if the amicus filing had made Christie rethink his decision, a spokesman for the governor pointed me to an exchange the governor had had with a report when the three governors, along with former Gov. Tom Kean, had initially voiced opposition to the plan. The reporter asked if the governors' stance made Christie think differently about the pipeline. The governor's response: ""No.""\The spokesman said that the administration ""recognizes that the pipeline project can represent an important piece of New Jersey's clean-energy future and meeting our long-term energy demands. The project represents a clean-energy alternative, has wide bipartisan support, and has been approved by state environmental and energy regulators, as well as the state's ratepayer advocate. Additionally, the pipeline project was approved by three federal agencies, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.""\All but Christie left positive legacy\Jeff Tittel, head of the Sierra Club of New Jersey and the among the most prominent environmental activists of the state, notes that all New Jersey governors -- both Democrats and Republicans -- have left a some kind of positive environmental legacy -- except for Christie.\Tittel noted that throughout his tenure, Christie has pulled the state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market-based cap-and-trade-based effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; he has settled an $8.9 billion lawsuit against Exxon, on which a judge was set to rule for a pittance of $225 million, and has ""dismantled"" the Department of Environmental Protection, cutting enforcement by 60 percent.\""While every New Jersey governor in modern history has an environmental legacy to be proud of, Christie's accomplishment has been to roll back the progress made by previous governors,"" Tittel said.\Tittel pointed out that New Jersey, with its dense population and industrial background, tends to see the manifestations of environmental issues before other states. ""New Jersey has always been cutting edge in our protection of the environment. We've always been a national leader,"" Tittel said.\But no more.\Credit: Brigid Callahan Harrison is professor of political science and law at Montclair State University, where she teaches courses in American government.

136,"Barack Obama's energy policies have the endorsement of Governor Corzine and environmental groups, and his vision often mirrors New Jersey's long-term energy goals.\But even in a state that increasingly is leaning toward the Democrat for president, voters have sided with Republican John McCain's ""Drill, baby, drill!"" call to expand domestic production and his plan to build 45 nuclear plants.\By a 2-to-1 ratio, state voters surveyed by Quinnipiac University in August supported offshore drilling for fossil fuels, and more than half favored exploration in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge. And even as some New Jersey activists were in court trying to prevent license renewals for the state's four nuclear power plants, 61 percent of the poll's respondents favored building more reactors.\The poll's findings dovetail with McCain's main energy policies, and run counter to endorsements that Obama has earned from Environment New Jersey and the Sierra Club.\Clay F. Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said the survey showed the depth of worry caused by the price of gasoline, about $4 a gallon at the time.\""The shock ... changed a lot of people's minds about alternative energy,"" Richards said. ""The fact is that there have been no nuclear accidents over the years, so all of a sudden it appears to be a safe alternative.""\Gas since has fallen below $3 a gallon, and Richards said that the same voters today probably wouldn't be as gung-ho for nuclear power and ocean drilling.\""It's the kind of reaction that's sparked by $4-a-gallon gasoline,"" Richards said. ""So they're not as enthusiastic, but they're more open to those kinds of proposals than they have been in the past.""\Obama and McCain want the United States to become more energy-efficient, decrease dependence on foreign oil and pour millions of dollars into research and development.\""In some cases, their energy policies are going to affect New Jersey virtually the same,"" said Frank Maisano, an energy specialist for Bracewell & Giuliani, representing utilities, refineries and wind-energy developers. ""New Jersey is already running down the road which Obama and McCain, on climate policy, are both advocating.""\Each supports nuclear power, but has different approaches on its use: McCain wants to build 45 reactors by 2030, while Obama first wants to solve the problem of highly toxic nuclear-waste disposal. On drilling for oil and natural gas, McCain supports striking down a federal ban on offshore exploration; Obama once was against such drilling, but in August said he would permit such activity in tandem with greater use of alternative sources and more research and development.\Corzine and environmental groups, which oppose offshore drilling, have endorsed Obama despite the candidate's switch on exploring in the Atlantic Ocean.\Randall Solomon, director of the New Jersey Sustainable State Institute of the Bloustein School of Rutgers University, said Obama's policies, more than McCain's, resemble state policy on greenhouse gas emissions; ""green"" construction; housing based on transportation hubs, and guidelines for utilities' sources of energy.\""The big picture is they both have a full complement of policies,"" Solomon said.\In 2007, Corzine signed the Global Warming Response Act, putting New Jersey ahead of the federal government in terms of reducing greenhouse gases. The administration this month granted rights to construct a $1 billion wind farm off the coast, and on Wednesday introduced its energy master plan.\Corzine's long-term energy plans call for the state to derive 30 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2020. By that year, New Jersey also should be harnessing 3,000 megawatts from wind power. Within 12 years, the state would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent.\Dena Mottola, executive director of Environment New Jersey, said an Obama administration could put some of New Jersey's policies into wider use.\""I think both our renewable-energy program and our energy-efficiency programs are models for the country,"" Mottola said. ""The nation needs to do what New Jersey is doing to bring about the changes we need.""\***\WHERE THEY STAND\ENERGY\John McCain and Barack Obama say the United States must reduce fuel consumption and encourage the use of geothermal, wind, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. Each supports ""cap and trade"" policies to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Both favor offshore drilling for gas and natural oil.\Here are areas where they differ:\INDEPENDENCE\Obama wants no more Middle Eastern oil in 10 years. McCain would cut it off by 2025.\NUCLEAR\McCain wants 45 new reactors. Obama first would solve hazardous-waste issues.\""GREEN"" ECONOMY\McCain aims to invest $20 billion in coal technology and give tax credits to companies for research and development. Obama envisions the creation of 20 million jobs in industries providing fuel-efficient cars, solar panels and wind turbines.\WINDFALL TAX\Obama would give taxpayers credits of up to $1,000 via a tax on utilities. McCain calls such a tax harmful.\VEHICLES\McCain wants to give a $5,000 tax credit to buyers of zero-emission cars and award $300 million to the developer of an electric vehicle. Obama intends to increase fuel-efficiency standards and have 1 million made-in-America hybrids in use by 2015.\***\E-mail: younge@northjersey.com"

The Senate budget committee may also take up the bill this week. If so, then the bill will likely be brought to the floor for a full vote of both houses next week. The last voting session for both houses is Jan. 14.\The bill has seen some reductions in the number of charging stations targeted from the original version, but most of it has been retained as of a draft that circulated on Friday.\""This appears to be the best we can get and it's important we get it done,"" said Jeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. ""From an environmental standpoint, it removes a lot of the roadblocks that have kept us from being a leader in the electric vehicle movement.""\Among the supporters of the bill are the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers and the New Jersey Gasoline and Convenience Store Association.\Sal Risalvato, executive director of the gas station association, said his members support the legislation but want to see incentives given to service stations to install electric chargers and other alternative fuel options like hydrogen.\""Anything that promotes EVs is fine with us because it will still bring the cars into our businesses,"" he said.\Email: fallon@northjersey.com Twitter: @newsfallon\getty images\CREDIT: Scott Fallon"

Governor Chris Christie is nothing if not controversial. To me, that is a good thing. Helicopter scandals aside, the controversy surrounding Christie isn't based on moral lapses in his personal life, as is becoming very common among politicians these days. The Governor drums up controversy because he says what he thinks, does what he says he is going to do, and doesn't care if you or anyone else likes it. Whether you agree of disagree with his stances, you have to admit it's pretty refreshing to see a politician that does something beside talk, and who actually acts on what he says he is going to, even if there are a lot people who won't like it.
\
This attitude has garnered Christie a lot of attention from the national media, and had many calling him a front runner to win the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Christie has said numerous times he plans to finish his job in New Jersey before moving on. This would lead you to think if he really has no interest in joining to 2012 presidential race he could very well be looking at 2016.
\
What does this have to do with the environment? Well, as someone who has no problem saying what he thinks; Christie, a Republican with national appeal, has gone against the typical party line and acknowledged the legitimacy of human induced climate change.
\
Recently Governor Christie had the state withdraw from its commitment to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap and trade like system designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power generators among the member states in the northeast. Several environmentalists cried foul over this and the state legislature has attempted to force the state back in, an action which the Governor vetoed last week. It was in discussing his decision to leave RGGI that Christie acknowledged human-made climate change:
\
""While I acknowledge that the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere are increasing, that climate change is real, that human activity plays a role in these changes and these changes are impacting our state, I simply disagree that RGGI is an effective mechanism for addressing global warming.""
\
Again, this is a pretty big deal for a highly touted Republican to go against the supposed opinion of his base, and admit that climate change is real, and we are causing it. Though it may be a big deal that he is saying this, I don't think it is actually anything groundbreaking or detrimental to him being a national figure among his party.
\
In the last 5 years I can't remember a single person I have talked to that does not think our actions are having SOME impact on the climate. That would be regardless of political stance or level of education. The consensus seems to be that yes, we're making an impact on the environment. How much of an impact and what we can or should do about it, well that's where the opinions start to vary.
\
So this is why I think what Christie is saying probably reflects the opinion of a lot of people when it comes to the whole climate change debate (and yes, it is still a debate, anyone who tell you differently has no concept of the basic philosophy of the scientific method).
\
The Governor isn't telling everyone that Atlantic City and all other coastal cities are going be under water by the end of the century. He is not saying that New Jersey will end up with a climate similar to South Carolina in 50 years. He is not saying extreme weather such as droughts, hurricanes, and blizzards are going to be more frequent and more severe. No, he is not making any claims as to what the impacts are, he is just saying that our use of fossil fuels is impacting Earth's climate in some way, and any human induced change in our climate is not a good thing.
\
While there are highly opinionated people on both side of the spectrum; those who claim it's all a hoax, and those who are saying the data is so concrete that there can be no debate, the truth is, nobody really knows what our impact on the climate is. The science behind human induced climate change can really be simplified into one sentence; greenhouse gases that we emit trap heat within our atmosphere, preventing it from radiating into space. That is what we know. Despite what some would have you believe, we don't know what trapping in all of that heat will actually do. There are models out there that say all sorts of things. But consider this; these models are attempting to take into account EVERYTHING that impacts our climate. That is something that I don't see as possible.
\
There are millions of factors that have to be included in a model, some of which we don't fully understand, others we probably don't even know about yet. And anyone that would tell you there is a simple graph that shows lines that correlate increases in greenhouses gases to increases in temperature are doing themselves a serious disservice. Greenhouse gases have increased as we pump more of them into the air. Over that time the temperature has gone up as well. But as greenhouse gases have increased, you know what else has also, our life expectancy! Now these things obviously don't correlate, our technology has increased, so we have needed more power, and thus emitted more toxic gases, but likewise our technology has also kept us walking around this planet longer. Its sloppy science to use the temperature/CO2 level charts as the be all end all of the climate debate. Just because lines match up on a graph doesn't mean the relationship is that simple.
\
None of the models out there on what will happen to the climate are THE AUTHORITY on the issue. If you really want to see why none of these models should be considered an absolute truth read ""Hack the Planet"". This book deals with the idea of geo-engineering the planet to combat climate change. In other words, our emissions are impacting the climate, so let's also take active step to combat this, rather than just decide to reduce emissions. There are many plans associated with engineering a solution to climate change, and I won't get into them. But here is what you take away from the book. Attempts to actively change the climate never work out as they are expected (modeled!) to. Better still, scientists noted in the book, many of whom believe the threat of climate change is very real, won't support further geo-engineering because they can't be certain what is going happen if you attempt one of these proposed solutions. If they are that uncertain about a climate model that attempts to fix the problem, how can they possibly speak with certainty on models that show the impacts of climate change itself?
\
I think the reasonable answer to all of this is exactly what our Governor is saying. Yes, there is no doubt that emissions from fossil fuels are having some impact, what that is, nobody knows for certain. Partisan fighting in nothing new in the world of politics, it's pretty ironic that someone as outspoken and bullish as Chris Christie represents the voice of reason in the climate debate.
"
142,"Governor Christie did more than lay out budget cuts last week. He launched a full-scale attack on government spending, from the town halls to the State House.\And he's not backing down after a week of protests by public workers and outcry from school and local government officials.\""Everybody knew this day was coming,"" Christie told The Record's editorial board on Friday.\If Christie's budget clears the Legislature, it will affect many groups in New Jersey.\There will be less money for school districts, municipalities, colleges and NJ Transit. And no one will get property tax rebates in 2010 if Christie's budget clears the Legislature unchanged. Every state department will also get less money for operations, and government employees at all levels are facing reforms that will affect their health and pension benefits.\Christie showed no signs of bending during his 70-minute interview.\""I have a great sense of comfort about where we are because I know there are not a lot of alternatives,"" he said.\Business owners\Compared to most constituencies, business leaders are almost giddy at Christie's budget message.\They find little to fault in the governor's pro-growth rhetoric, after eight years of complaining that the Governor's Office is too closely aligned with unions, the state business climate stifles job creation and taxes are scaring off new businesses.\The business sector didn't get off scot-free. Christie cut half the $60 million budget for a program that gives tax credits to high-tech companies and the entire $15 million pool of tax credits available for film and digital production companies.\Employers will no longer be eligible for a $3,000 grant for each new job created under the Invest NJ program, whose budget was eliminated.\Yet the cuts are modest, given that some employers could see a 4 percent drop in their corporate business tax if Christie is able to let a surcharge expire in June. Small-business owners also could pay less in tax as a result of Christie's pledge not to renew an income tax hike enacted last year as an emergency measure. It affects small businesses taxed through their owners' incomes.\Perhaps the biggest prize for some local retailers, however, is a Christie plan to repeal Bergen County's blue laws -- allowing retailers to open on Sundays.\-- Hugh R. Morley\College students\The state's public colleges and universities will grapple with a $175 million aid cut that is also likely to force layoffs, cutbacks and tuition hikes. The schools, with an average tuition of $11,000, are already among the most expensive in the nation.\The head of the association representing many of the schools, Darryl Greer, called the cuts ""disappointing and harmful to the state's long-term interests.""\-- Patricia Alex\Government employees\Collective bargaining reforms, civil service changes, health insurance cost shares and pension rule modifications are all being pushed by Christie in an effort to cut government costs at all levels. As many as 1,300 state employees will lose their jobs to layoffs, and school districts and municipal governments are saying they may also have to enact layoffs to offset state aid cuts.\Christie is also not funding the state share of this year's pension contribution to save $3 billion.\-- John Reitmeyer\Health care consumers\The state budget increases the amount of aid for hospitals by $11 million, or 1.3 percent, but eliminates programs that would have provided insurance coverage to 50,000 low-income adults.\Generous eligibility standards for children to enroll in subsidized health insurance remain intact. But the governor called a halt to additional enrollment of parents of eligible children on March 10, and continues the freeze through the next fiscal year, for anticipated savings of $25 million. In addition, he terminated subsidized insurance coverage for 11,000 low-income legal resident aliens, as of April 1, to save $30 million more.\Senior citizens who receive prescription coverage under the PAAD or Senior Gold programs are likely to face higher out-of-pocket costs because of a new requirement that they meet a $310 annual deductible, starting in 2011. PAAD recipients' copayment for brand-name drugs will increase from $7 to $15; their co-payment for generic prescriptions will drop by $1 to $5.\The budget anticipates $45 million in new tax revenues from hospitals and ambulatory-surgery centers through elimination of the caps on specialized taxes affecting them. This will be matched by the federal government, and redistributed to hospitals under a revamped charity-care formula, resulting in a net increase of $11 million in funding to hospitals, according to the budget.\Tougher investigation and prosecution of Medicaid fraud is expected to yield an additional $40 million in revenue. And the elimination of state support for family-planning programs and anti-smoking programs, and of nursing staff in state buildings, is expected to produce more savings.\-- Lindy Washburn\Environment advocates\State funding for the Department of Environmental Protection was not cut as severely as that of many other agencies and no state parks are marked for closure -- though some may be privatized.\The DEP budget would be reduced by about 2 percent to $381 million, from $387 million in 2010. The major hit would be at the DEP's Office of Climate and Energy, whose main source of funding -- quarterly auctions of greenhouse gas emissions -- is being taken away to balance the budget.\Since late 2008 when it joined, New Jersey has reaped more than $64 million from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program that includes nine other Northeastern states. Those revenues are supposed to be used for greenhouse gas emissions programs. State law requires stabilization of statewide greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.\-- Scott Fallon\Motorists and commuters\Under the governor's plan, the state Department of Transportation's funding would be cut 4.3 percent, or $56.3 million -- one of the largest cuts in the agency's history.\NJ Transit's state subsidies will be cut 11 percent this year. The agency has already said it plans to raise fares by 25 percent and reduce top-level administrative salaries to help replace the funding.\The governor has also proposed closing Motor Vehicle Commission agencies on Mondays and increasing Saturday customer-service hours. Four agencies would be closed entirely.\-- Tom Davis\Property tax payers\No property tax rebates in 2010, but Christie has left $270 million in funding for a tax credit he wants to establish in 2011. The rebate allocation used to be as high as $2 billion.\But Christie also has proposed a 2.5 percent cap on future property tax hikes by local governments that would be enacted through a constitutional amendment that could get on the ballot as soon as this November.\Municipal aid, which is often used to soften property tax hikes, is set to decrease by $271 million to $1.3 billion. Other programs that help troubled cities are also being cut.\-- John Reitmeyer\School districts\The budget includes $820 million in cuts in school aid to local districts that are still grappling with a $475 million cut that forced them to use surplus funds to meet current obligations.\Bergen County will get $102 million less in state aid for schools -- a drop of 41 percent, the steepest cut in the state. Passaic County's aid will drop by $64 million.\Indeed, local educators warned that cutbacks are likely in addition to layoffs. Extracurricular activities and elective offerings may be slashed. Class sizes are likely to grow.\-- Patricia Alex\Sidebar: \Business\4% tax cut\The corporate business tax could drop by 4 percent, but employers hoping to get a $3,000 grant for each job created will find the program, Invest NJ, has been eliminated.\Municipalities\$275M cut\State aid to towns has been cut an average of 17.5 percent this year, likely forcing towns to cut services and employees.\Health care\$11M increase\The state budget increases the amount of aid for hospitals by 1.3 percent, but eliminates programs that would have provided insurance coverage to 50,000 low-income adults.\Environment\$6.7M cut\Fewer grants will be given out for greenhouse gas emissions programs, such as those that promote energy efficiency, reduce electricity demand and preserve forest and tidal marshes.\Schools\$819.4M cut\There are 27 Bergen County districts that will get no state aid, part of a $102 million cut. Passaic County districts will get a $64 million cut.\Transportation\4.3% cut\Motor Vehicle Commission agencies would be closed on low-traffic Mondays, and Saturday customer service hours would be increased. Four ""underutilized"" Motor Vehicle Commission agencies would be closed.\{CAPTION1} NO CAPTION {CREDIT1} GRAPHIC - JERRY LUCIANI/STAFF ARTIST {IMAGENAME1} NO IMAGENAME"
143,"Political struggles over the Bush administration's air pollution regulations and the fate of Pacific sea turtles are drawing attention again to the problem of mercury in fish, as the federal Food and Drug Administration finally amended its longstanding consumer advisory to include canned tuna.\One thread in all of this is longline fishing, in which the hooks used to catch tuna, swordfish and other large species sometimes snag sea turtles as well. Moreover, the fish caught by longliners store mercury in their tissues, and sources of that potentially harmful element include coal-burning power plants.\In late March, the FDA announced that expectant and nursing mothers, women who may become pregnant, and young children should eat no more than one six-ounce can of albacore tuna per week to limit their exposure to mercury in fish.\That advisory was the upshot from years of debate over whether canned tuna should be included on the mercury advisory list. The decision didn't sit well with environmental groups, who sought an even more conservative warning.\""It's been three solid years, and we're hearing no substantive improvements. ... They've fallen so far short of what the public needs,"" complained Jane Houlihan, vice president for research with the Environmental Working Group, a Washington, D.C.-based activist organization that's critical of the mercury standard.\FDA officials say their mercury limits still give an eightfold margin of safety for the population most sensitive to the organic traces of mercury, called methylmercury, that are found in some fish. Mercury can have harmful effects on the neurological development of fetuses and young children, and the FDA recommends that mothers and children avoid altogether swordfish, shark, tilefish and king mackerel.\The dispute is really over how wide the margin of safety should be set, said Randi Thomas of the U.S. Tuna Foundation, a tuna industry association. The government's reference point is set ""for the most sensitive part of the population,"" Thomas said.\Other groups contend the albacore limit should be one can a month - or none at all - to widen the margin.\""Six ounces of albacore is probably pushing it,"" but it's a long-needed improvement to the health advisory, said Dr. Michael Gochfeld, a mercury researcher at the Environmental and Occupation Health Sciences Institute in Piscataway.\In a report published in December, Gochfeld and professor Joanna Burger of Rutgers University found canned albacore white tuna they obtained from a central New Jersey supermarket contained mean mercury levels of 0.407 parts per million.\In comparison, canned light tuna contained a mean mercury level of 0.132 ppm. The simple lesson, Gochfeld said, is for mothers and children to ""choose light over white.""\Some organizations, such as the Environmental Working Group and Environmental Defense, have created their own online ""seafood calculators"" on their Web sites to show consumers how to determine even more restrictive fish intake based on their weight, sex and other personal factors.\Mercury in the food chain\Warnings on tuna present a public health dilemma: Fish is a prime, low-fat source of protein, omega-3 oils, minerals and vitamins, and eating more of it is one way Americans can stave off obesity and cardiovascular disease, dietary experts say.\In its pure state, mercury is a silvery, liquid metal. Uncontained, it will bead and roll across a laboratory countertop, a testimony to its ancient name: quicksilver. In the environment, mercury emitted from nature's volcanoes and humanity's coal-burning power plants falls into oceans and lakes.\Once in the water, mercury is converted by bacteria into an organic form called methylmercury, a more toxic form. As bacteria are eaten by grazing organisms, which are eaten by other animals, and big fish eat little fish, methylmercury becomes more concentrated as it moves up aquatic food chains.\Although mercury traces in the water are minute, the bioaccumulation process multiplies methylmercury many times over in the tissues of top-end predators, whether they're Atlantic swordfish or Pine Barrens pickerel, according to state and federal studies.\Studies of human health effects have yielded mixed results, but they tend to reassure federal food regulators that their mercury limits are adequate.\A University of Rochester study tracked a group of mothers and children in the Seychelles, an island nation in the Indian Ocean where swordfish is nearly as much a staple as canned tuna is in America. Despite elevated mercury levels in the women, the scientists reported they could not link the mercury to any neurological ill effects in their children.\A competing study of families on the Faroe Islands far north of Scotland documented some below-average results among children on neurological tests. Environmental activists tend to cite that study more, while critics have questioned its statistical correlations and possible confounding factors such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), another chemical contaminant in whale meat consumed by Faroese.\""If everyone was eating 15 pounds of swordfish a year, there might be a problem,"" said Gef Flimlin, an agent with the Rutgers Cooperative Extension Service who works with commercial fishermen and shellfish growers. ""If you look at how many kinds of fish you can buy in New Jersey, there's probably 80 or more. If you wanted fish for dinner all the time, you could eat something different every night and not eat the same thing for months.""\Still, ""people react very negatively. I think they overreact to negative discussions about seafood,"" said Flimlin, who is organizing a seafood safety conference in June at Rutgers University to bring together scientists, nutrition and health experts and the news media.\Different agendas pushed\The tuna debate is tied into other environmental issues, said Thomas of the tuna industry foundation.\""All of these issues are mixed up. It's not just the fishing issues. It's the air pollution coming from utilities. These (activist) groups go round and round and keep building it up,"" she said.\The federal Environmental Protection Agency has been battered by accusations that its own scientists' advice on limiting mercury emissions from power plants was trumped by political pressure from the utilities industry.\Mercury from American power plants is just a part of worldwide mercury emissions, so skeptics question how much it contributes to mercury contamination in the ocean environment, which also has a number of natural sources such as volcanic vents.\But the state Department of Environmental Protection says domestic air emissions are directly linked to mercury levels in freshwater lakes and streams; mercury levels are particularly elevated in Pine Barrens chain pickerel, for example. DEP officials have gone to court seeking to limit what drifts here from Midwestern power generator stacks.\Under terms of an earlier lawsuit settlement with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the federal EPA must meet a court-ordered deadline for new air regulations before the end of this year. It proposes a system that it says would reduce mercury emissions 70 percent by 2018, while allowing utilities to trade air pollution limits between newer and older plants.\However, EPA advisers in January told agency Administrator Mike Leavitt that ""the cap and trade program, as proposed, may not address existing hot spots and may create new local hot spots for mercury, disproportionately impacting local communities.""\Meanwhile, the mercury issue has been taken up by sea turtle preservationists, who picket and even sue California supermarkets over point-of-sale mercury warnings at fish counters. On its Web site at www.seaturtles.org, the Sea Turtle Restoration Project ties its goal of stopping longline fishing to getting consumers to buy less swordfish and tuna.\That has some in the fishing industry saying the long-running mercury issue has been subordinated to other agendas.\""It seems to be a multipronged attack on the fishing industry in general, and longlining in particular, out there,"" said Nils Stolpe of the Garden State Seafood Alliance, a New Jersey commercial fishing industry group.\Some environmental groups oppose the fishing gear used to catch swordfish and tuna, and when recent publicity campaigns tied those fish to mercury, ""it's the same organizations behind it,"" Stolpe said. ""With the exception of king mackerel, the other fish are species that the enviros have big problems with.""\The seafood industry had always lobbied against adding canned tuna to the advisory, arguing that the risk for mercury exposure was relatively low, but the risk high that Americans would be turned off from eating fish altogether. New Jersey fishermen have not detected any direct effect on their sales from the recent flurry of contaminant reports, Stolpe said.\""The steak tuna market is different because people don't eat enough of it to be affected. Swordfish is different. People don't eat a lot of it, and the price moves around a lot,"" Stolpe said. ""People don't eat tuna steaks the way they eat canned tuna, which is more of a staple.""\Over the past decade, government advisories on mercury gradually have become more conservative. The agency's current position is that pregnant women and women who may become pregnant should avoid eating certain kinds of larger, long-lived fish that tend to accumulate higher methylmercury levels in their tissue than other species.\Swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tilefish should be avoided by childbearing women, and that caution should extend too for women who are nursing infants, and to very young children whose central nervous systems are still developing, the FDA says.\As for other fish, the FDA recommends that women and children in the risk group eat on average up to 12 ounces per week - or two to three servings a week, based on typical serving sizes.\The advisory also cautions about eating fish caught from local freshwater streams and lakes. In some states, including New Jersey, elevated mercury levels in freshwater fish such as pickerel have led state health authorities to issue their own health advisories about consuming those catches.\Commercially farm-raised freshwater fish, such as tilapia, trout and catfish, can be included in the basic guideline for 12 ounces per week, the FDA says.\""One food does not a diet make. The key with all these advisories is not to eat one thing to the exclusion of others,"" said Don Schaffner, a food science professor at Rutgers University's Cook College in New Brunswick."
144," On frozen Lake Hopatcong, a father and son plumb the waters for perch and pickerel. For 30 years, they've been casting lines in streams tucked amid New Jersey's busy highways. Wherever they go, they find the same warning: Beware of the fish. Beware of mercury.\ In Paterson, a nutritionist warns an expectant mother that swordfish, mackerel, and the trusty tuna sandwich - the seafood doctors always said was part of a healthy diet - could harm her baby. Those fish contain a poison: mercury.\ In New Brunswick, a woman strums her guitar. Five years ago, after she swore off meat and chicken in favor of tuna and swordfish, her hand began to tremble. It quivered so much that playing the guitar became difficult. So did drawing a straight line. Her hair began to fall out. Hair and blood tests revealed the culprit: mercury.\ The nation's smokestacks aren't just polluting the air - they are contaminating our waters, and our bodies.\ The mercury that rises from those industrial stacks floats through the atmosphere and settles in rivers, lakes, and oceans, contaminating fish and finding its way to dinner tables across the nation. A growing number of studies document the human toll: Children exposed to mercury are slower to walk and talk and may be more susceptible to autism and attention deficit disorders. Adults can suffer memory loss, nerve damage, and fatigue.\ From the wooded shores of Ringwood's Shepherd Lake to the shaded streams in the Pine Barrens, every lake and every inch of river and stream in New Jersey is tainted with mercury, prompting state officials to warn residents about eating certain fish. Nationwide, similar advisories about mercury contamination cover 500,000 miles of river, more than 12 million acres of lakes, and much of the Atlantic coastline.\ Because of contaminated fish, 630,000 unborn children - nearly twice original estimates - are exposed to unsafe mercury levels each year, the federal Environmental Protection Agency said last month. These children can suffer irreversible changes in the brain and nervous system.\ Within days, the federal Food and Drug Administration is expected to expand its warnings about consuming the fish sold in supermarkets and restaurants. For the first time, it will single out canned tuna - America's most popular fish - because of mercury contamination.\ It doesn't have to be this way, environmental officials in New Jersey and other states say. The technology exists to reduce drastically the mercury emitted by coal-fired power plants, the largest source of the pollutant in the country.\ Indeed, in just three years, mercury emissions could be slashed by 90 percent, they say.\ But the Bush administration is pushing a controversial plan that would do less, environmentalists say. President Bush's proposal gives utilities 14 years to cut their mercury emissions by 70 percent. It also allows plants to buy and sell the right to pollute.\ ""It provides incentives to do more than required,"" EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt told power producers earlier this year, ""and serious market-imposed sanctions for those who do less.""\ Environmentalists say it will create ""hot spots"" around power plants that buy the right to keep pumping out mercury rather than cleaning up.\ As the debate rages, pollution continues to fall in poisoned raindrops on New Jersey.\ In the Pinelands, where the acidic water amplifies mercury's impact, many of the fish are now off limits to children and pregnant women. In Passaic County, pregnant women are told never to eat large- mouth bass caught in four reservoirs.\ On the list of fish advisories around the state, a warning is repeated 43 times: ""Do Not Eat""\ A useful substance\ Rows of welding machines click and hiccup in Clifton, sealing gleaming beads of mercury inside tiny, bullet-sized capsules. In a boxy factory on Route 46, the machines are manufacturing electrical switches for the innards of lawn mowers and levels and other conveniences of modern life.\ Much of the mercury is recycled, carefully extracted from junked cars and thermostats before the heavy metal escapes into the environment.\ The shimmering quicksilver inside these miniature switches, however, could cause long-lasting problems if let loose. A single broken thermometer, - containing about a fifth of a teaspoon of mercury - is enough to contaminate all the fish in a 20-acre lake, according to the EPA.\ By contrast, America's coal-fired power plants - in the Ohio River Valley, on the shores of the Great Lakes, in Jersey City, and elsewhere - spew 48 tons of mercury into the air a year. The mercury in these plumes is unregulated. The government forced waste incinerators to reduce their emissions, but the utilities have not been required to do the same.\ The toxic plumes can travel hundreds of miles before falling to earth in snowflakes, soot, and rain, and then wash into lakes and streams in runoff.\ A crucial transformation takes place when mercury reaches the sediments of these waters. Bacteria there change the mercury into methylmercury, which then enters the food chain when the bacteria are consumed by plankton. Those tiny creatures are then eaten by small fish, which are eaten by larger fish, and so on.\ The higher mercury rises in the food chain, the more concentrated it becomes. The mercury in trout, for instance, can be a million times more concentrated than in the surrounding water. Cooking or cleaning will not remove the contamination.\ At the top of the food chain are anglers like Chuck Snover Sr., who stood with his 16-year-old son on frozen Lake Hopatcong last month. A fat, striped perch flopped in its death throes on the ice before being dropped on a small charcoal stove.\ Father and son fish most weekends. Sometimes, it's slim pickings. But lately, the fish have all but jumped out of the lake. A week ago, a cousin fishing with the pair caught 52. The week before, they took 50.\ ""We eat what we can catch,"" says Snover, 41, of Hackettstown. Asked about the state's warning advisories, he says most anglers - and there are one million of them in New Jersey - ignore them.\ ""I don't know whether we are uneducated about it or uncaring,"" he says. ""I guess the thought is you can get hit by a truck on the road any moment.""\ A study five years ago of Hudson River anglers confirmed his observation. Despite fish advisories by New Jersey and New York State, the fishermen still routinely ate their catch and shared it with their families, Mount Sinai School of Medicine researchers found. Those who ate their take more frequently had significantly higher mercury, as well as other chemicals, in their blood and hair.\ Now the same scientists are midway through a five-year study of 168 fishermen from the Englewood Boat Basin, a Ridgefield fishing club, and piers in Bayonne, Elizabeth, and New York City. With detailed questionnaires and blood and hair samples, they're hoping to help answer a fundamental question:\ What is the human cost of mercury?\ Many babies at risk\ Mercury inflicts its greatest damage upon hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting pregnant women and their unborn children throughout the United States.\ New research suggests that nearly one woman in six in the United States may have unsafe levels of mercury in her body - ironically because of the fish eaten to stay healthy.\ Any day now, the FDA will issue its warnings on commercial fish - mainstays of the American diet such as tuna and salmon.\ A draft released in December cautioned pregnant women to avoid swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish completely because of mercury. It advised them to eat no more than two or three meals of fish and shellfish a week and to vary the types of fish - no more than a serving per week of each kind.\ Although the draft did not warn pregnant women to limit tuna, it pointed out that tuna steaks and canned white tuna contain more mercury than chunk light tuna because they are taken from larger fish. The most recent of the FDA's periodic samples of canned tuna found that mercury concentrations were three times higher in albacore than in chunk light.\ Environmentalists say the warnings should be stronger. But the FDA must balance mercury concerns with overall nutrition. Fish that aren't laden with mercury provide many health benefits, especially for the heart.\ That's the message that Alyce Thomas, a prenatal nutrition consultant, tries to convey to women with high-risk pregnancies at St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson. But there's a lot of ground to cover, she says: Just getting enough to eat is important, as is avoiding alcohol. Add the problems of diabetes and high blood pressure, and fish advisories don't get a lot of airtime.\ But on this Monday morning, Thomas tells Helen Vasquez of Prospect Park about mercury.\ ""Fish contains mercury, which can build up in the body. They don't know how much is too much,"" Thomas tells the 20-year-old, whose baby is due in two months. She warns her to eat no more than one can of tuna a week.\ ""I never heard about the mercury,"" says Vasquez. Thomas explains how the metal is put into the air by smokestacks and winds up in water, where it enters the food chain.\ ""Really?"" Vasquez asks. ""It gets into the fish?""\ Between 11,000 and 24,000 newborns are exposed to unsafe levels of mercury each year in New Jersey, according to estimates by state environmental officials. A study of hair and blood samples from 189 women in six North Jersey obstetrical practices found that one in eight exceeded what the EPA considered safe.\ To be sure, the great majority of pregnant women in New Jersey have low levels of mercury exposure, according to the New Jersey Mercury Task Force's 2001 report. African-Americans and those with middle incomes had the lowest risk, it noted.\ Still, new research in the United States and Japan now shows that mercury concentrates in umbilical cord blood, meaning that babies receive a higher exposure than their mothers, according to the EPA. If the EPA's safety guidelines were adjusted to account for this difference, nearly one in six pregnant women would be considered at risk.\ A disaster in Japan\ The most heartbreaking cases of mercury damage in children occurred in the Japanese town of Minimata, where mercury waste contaminated the fish that were the town's main food supply. The impact on pregnant women themselves was slight, but their children were born retarded, deaf, blind, unable to speak, or with cerebral palsy.\ But for most of the thousands of babies who have been exposed in the womb, the effects are more subtle - so subtle that they probably will never be attributed to mercury. Although babies can be routinely tested for lead poisoning, their blood is not checked for mercury.\ Dr. Michael Gochfeld, a mercury specialist at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute in Piscataway and a professor at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, doesn't point to a bassinet in the hospital nursery and say a child suffers from ""mercury poisoning.""\ Instead, he points to a subtle loss of potential for thousands of children. ""It might reduce IQ by a few points,"" says Gochfeld, chairman of the state's mercury task force. ""It might reduce motor coordination, so that this child is someone we think of as a klutz. It might make them unmusical.""\ Studies have shown that children born to mothers with high mercury levels were slower to talk, walk, and develop fine motor skills. The research, conducted in the Faroe Islands of the remote North Atlantic, where fish and whale are dietary staples, found that children exposed to more mercury had weaker memories and attention spans. And the damage apparently is permanent. Follow-up studies when the children turned 14 showed that their brains had not recovered.\ More worrisome, the damage was detected even at levels of exposure previously thought safe.\ New findings from the Seychelles, a fish-eating island nation in the Indian Ocean, reveal a difference in brain activity for common actions, such as moving a hand. Earlier research there had shown no effects from mercury exposure. The latest results, presented at a medical conference in Hawaii last month, startled Dr. George Lambert, head of New Jersey's Institute of Neurotoxicology and Environmental Assessment in Piscataway, part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Rutgers University.\ A different side of the brain lit up in brain scans of children exposed to higher mercury levels. ""It's a rewiring of the brain,"" Lambert says. ""These are things we're just beginning to understand.""\ Mercury in the developing fetus causes permanent changes that depend upon what Lambert calls ""windows of susceptibility"": how great the exposure, how long it lasts, and what fetal development is taking place at that instant.\ Mercury's role in autism is also being explored in several studies at the institute. Does prenatal exposure to mercury heighten susceptibility? Does that lead to the regression seen in autism?\ Animal studies at Lambert's institute have found that even low levels of exposure harm brain cells - they don't multiply as frequently, and they don't form as many connections. ""The exposure can be at low levels and just for a short period of time,"" Lambert says. ""It will have profound effects for the duration.""\ The costs, when intelligence is lowered across a population, are high: A drop of just five IQ points because of mercury contamination doubles the number of children whose IQs fall below 70 and require remedial help. True geniuses, on the other hand, become merely ""highly intelligent,"" and society is deprived of the benefit of their brilliance because of mercury.\ The diminished lifetime earnings, when measured over an entire society, amount to $2.3 billion a year, estimates Michael McCalley, a professor of community and preventative medicine at New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine.\ McCalley, president of the advocacy group Physicians for Social Responsibility, acknowledged that removing mercury from smokestacks is costly, but he said: ""There are numbers on the other side. There are benefits.\ ""If the EPA proceeds with its mercury rule,"" said McCalley, who testified last month against Bush's mercury proposal, ""we'll have more children with lowered IQs who struggle to keep up in school, who may require remedial classes or special education, and whose lifelong earning capacity will be reduced.""\ Hatters went mad\ Mercury's dangers have been recorded ever since hat makers in the mid-1800s used it as a felt stiffener, causing bizarre personality changes in those who inhaled the fumes - and inspiring the expression ""mad as a hatter.""\ In addition to mood changes, high mercury levels in the blood of adults have been linked, in various studies, with infertility, fatigue, headache, joint pain, and reduced memory and concentration.\ A growing concern about mercury in the food chain has raised new questions. Are the health advantages of eating fish, which are low in cholesterol and full of good-for-you essential fatty acids, undercut by the increased risk of heart attack in those with high mercury levels? Two studies of middle-aged men have come up with different answers.\ For Marilynn Winston, a diet rich in fish led to fatigue, a tremor, irritability, and hair loss.\ The vibrant 71-year-old still gets hungry describing the grilled, marinated tuna steaks, surrounded by portobello mushrooms, she used to make. About 10 years ago, having abandoned red meat, she also dropped poultry from her diet because of worries about its hormones and antibiotics. She dined daily on fish - and unwittingly sickened herself with mercury.\ When a doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong from standard blood tests, Winston visited a naturopath, a medical practitioner who uses non-invasive, natural medicine relying on nutrition and vitamins. A sample of her hair was analyzed, revealing high mercury levels. A subsequent blood test showed a mercury concentration more than six times what was considered safe.\ She eliminated larger, predatory fish species from her diet, because they were likely to have the highest mercury concentrations. She took selenium supplements and herbs recommended by her son, an herbalist, to help rid the contamination from her body. She started eating chicken again.\ Today, five years after she was diagnosed, her blood mercury has dropped back to a normal range, and Winston feels almost completely recovered: She can singlehandedly lift a kayak, and she can dance until midnight again.\ Unlike newborns, who can suffer permanent damage, adults can recover from mercury's effects once the exposure ceases. In six to 12 weeks, a body can rid itself of half its burden of mercury.\ For those who love fish, the best advice is to vary what they eat, choosing smaller species that are lower in mercury and taken from comparatively unpolluted waters. Fish that have tested lower for mercury include wild salmon, herring, sardines, shrimp, tilapia, and sole.\ ""I'm all for people eating fish,"" Winston says. ""They just shouldn't poison themselves.""\ Action in New Jersey\ Towering over the Hackensack River, the Hudson Generating Station is New Jersey's king of mercury polluters. The smokestacks of PSEG Power's Jersey City plant belch more than 100 pounds of the poison each year, one-fifth the state total.\ But that should change soon. Under a $300 million, 10-year cleanup plan worked out with state officials, PSEG will add filters, chemical sprays, and other measures to remove a host of pollutants from its emissions. The power company believes it can cut escaping mercury by as much as 90 percent.\ Governor McGreevey's administration hopes to force similar reductions at other plants in the state. The governor wants to require the state's 10 coal-fired boilers to cut mercury emissions by 90 percent by 2007. Metal recyclers and municipal incinerators, which have already made deep cuts, would also be required to reduce pollution further.\ ""With the Bush administration weakening public health protections from mercury exposure, it is critical that New Jersey act to protect children,"" McGreevey declared in January in his State of the State address.\ The question at the heart of the mercury fight is whether coal- fired plants around the country can make the same massive cuts - and whether the huge costs are worth the health benefits.\ The technology exists. Municipal and medical waste incinerators poured more than 5,000 pounds of mercury annually into American skies in the 1990s. Now, they have cut that to just 350 pounds.\ At two South Jersey power plants in Swedesboro and Carneys Point, engineers for another utility have slashed emissions by 98 percent, said Bill O'Sullivan, the state's director of air quality.\ But cleaning up New Jersey's coal-burning power plants won't protect people from the pollution drifting in from other states. The DEP estimates that at least a third, and probably closer to half, of the total mercury pollution in the state comes from outside its borders. In Ohio, where the EPA and New Jersey have sued seven power plants because of the load of asthma-causing pollutants they send toward New Jersey, utilities pump 4 tons of mercury a year into the skies.\ The coal mined from the earth naturally contains mercury. Burning it at high temperatures produces a plume with some pure mercury, in the form of free-floating atoms, and some bonded with other pollutants into soot particles.\ The heavier soot particles drop from the sky quickly, causing so- called ""hot spots"" downwind of power plants.\ Elemental mercury is lighter, floating along on the jet stream. Much of this falls to the ground, but a vast global current of mercury circulates above the earth, fed by smokestacks from countries such as China, Ukraine, and the United States.\ The Bush administration proposed in December to reduce pollution in the United States through a ""cap and trade"" system that would let the market dictate where and how power plants clean up.\ It's a proven system that has cut acid rain emissions by 40 percent since the 1990s, supporters say. ""Those principles ought to work for mercury as well,"" says Scott Segal, an electric power industry spokesman in Washington.\ Power companies would have the flexibility and incentive to find cheaper, innovative ways of cleaning up, he says. They would have the time they need to buy and install pollution equipment at hundreds of plants. That would help overcome one of the biggest hurdles - the quirkiness of coal. Hunks taken from the same mine can have surprisingly different chemical compositions. A system that vacuums up mercury from one variety may have problems with another.\ The cost of mercury controls alone is unclear, but the EPA estimates that utilities will have to spend $50 billion over the next 20 years for the air quality improvements the White House promises.\ If an immediate cleanup were ordered, says Segal, some utilities would sue. The tough stance environmentalists want ""does not get you a 90 percent reduction in three years,"" he warns. ""What it gets is litigation in three years.""\ Health or profits?\ In a windowless Philadelphia conference hall, the battle over mercury boiled over last month at an EPA hearing. Segal and representatives of other utilities defended the trading proposal, but they were outnumbered by a parade of parents, environmentalists, academics, and state officials who said the White House was trading children's safety for corporate profits.\ ""The laggards in the industry are being rewarded by this rule,"" complained Bradley Campbell, New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protection. Power and coal companies ""hid in the bushes until the Bush administration quashed the controls that they wanted quashed, and now they're being held to a standard that's very weak.""\ Officials from Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York also criticized the plan. The measure faces a certain legal challenge if adopted, said an assistant attorney general for New York State.\ For New Jersey, this is a familiar battleground. The state has been in court for years against coal-fueled plants in the Midwest and South, trying to force them to add smokestack controls to cut the smog and soot they send drifting toward the skies of other states.\ Even the EPA's own advisers say the plan is inadequate. In January, a panel of scientists who counsel the agency on children's issues warned that trading might worsen some mercury hot spots and create new ones.\ ""The concern,"" wrote the 27-member Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee, ""is that this proposed action does not go as far as is feasible to reduce mercury emissions from power plants and therefore does not sufficiently protect our nation's children.\ ""While cost-effectiveness is important, the priority should be to protect our children's health in a timely manner.""\ Afraid to eat fish\ Back on Lake Hopatcong, the buzz of a power augur breaks the silence. Brian Opeka clutches the drill as its blade cuts into the ice.\ Opeka, 40, has been ice fishing New Jersey's waters with his father since he was 10. He loves the patient routine, the long days spent sitting over a shimmering hole in the ice, waiting for a line to quiver.\ Mercury has added another tradition, though: ""In the last 10 years, we haven't taken a fish,"" says Opeka's 73-year-old dad, John. ""No matter how big, how small, we measure 'em, take a picture, and put 'em back.""\ But it's possible to reclaim these waters. In Florida, scientists found that mercury levels in Everglades fish and wading birds dropped by up to 70 percent over the last 10 years after nearby industries added emission controls. In New Jersey, studies of lakes and marshes found that the amount of mercury leaching into sediments has been reduced, thanks to decreased burning of coal and garbage in our homes.\ On Friday, state officials unveiled a systematic plan to monitor how chemical contamination in the state's fish progresses over time.\ ""How long does it take the lake to recuperate?"" John Opeka wonders, as he perches on a stool over the ice. How long will it take to make the fish safe?\ ****\ E-mail: washburn@northjersey.com and nussbaum@northjersey.com\ ****\ (GRAPHIC TEXT, PAGE a01)\ Mercury's menace\ Every lake and stream in New Jersey is tainted with mercury, forcing the state to warn people to limit the amount of fish they eat. Cutting mercury pollution from power plants, the main source of the contamination, has sparked a heated debate in Washington. How fish become tainted:\ 1. Coal-fired power plants release mercury (Hg) into the air.\ 2. Mercury can be carried hundreds of miles before falling to earth and settling in the sediment of lakes, rivers, ponds, and oceans.\ 3. Bacteria in the sediments then convert it to methylmercury, which can be absorbed in the tissue of living things.\ 4. Plankton ingest the bacteria. Insects and small fish eat the plankton. The mercury increases in concentration as it works its way up the food chain.\ 5. Large predator fish such as bass, walleye, tuna, and swordfish can have levels of mercury one million times higher than the surrounding water.\ 6. More than 2 million lakes and 500,000 miles of rivers in the nation are tainted with mercury, and people are told to limit the consumption of certain fish from those waters.\ 7. Cooking or cleaning fish does not reduce mercury contamination.\ 8. Children born to mothers who have high mercury levels are slower to walk and talk and can suffer learning disabilities. The federal government estimates that 630,000 babies born every year in the United States may be at risk. In adults, mercury may increase the risk of heart attack and infertility and cause memory and concentration problems.\ Sources: National Wildlife Federation, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\ ****\ (SIDEBAR, PAGE a18)\ Mercury: where it is and what it does to people\ What is mercury?\ Mercury is an element that occurs naturally in the environment and has been used in such things as thermometers, dental fillings, blood pressure cuffs, and batteries. It is extracted from mines in an ore called cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). It is also a common impurity in coal.\ Coal-burning power plants emit mercury from their smokestacks. Waste incinerators and metal recyclers also produce pollution when burning items with mercury thrown into the trash or when melting old cars that contain mercury in light switches. Industrial dumping also adds to contamination in places such as Berry's Creek in the Meadowlands, where officials discovered the highest concentrations of mercury in freshwater sediment ever documented in the world.\ How might I be exposed?\ Most people are exposed by eating seafood from waters contaminated with mercury. Others breathe vapors from spills or from mercury used in some cultural or religious practices. Mercury is contained in the amalgam used in dental fillings. Women can pass mercury contamination on to their babies during pregnancy and through breast milk.\ What damage will mercury do to people?\ Scientists are still learning about mercury's effects. Children born to mothers with high levels of mercury are slower to talk and walk and master fine motor skills. Their memories and attention spans are poorer. In adults, mercury exposure causes fatigue, mood changes, problems with memory and concentration, and nerve damage. Some studies have associated mercury with joint pain, infertility, and increased risk of heart attack.\ Adults eventually recover after mercury exposure ceases, but children may suffer lifelong problems.\ How does mercury in the air contaminate fish?\ Mercury levels in air pollution are usually too low to cause harm. But the mercury eventually settles into the sediments of lakes, rivers, streams, and oceans. Bacteria in the sediments transform it into methylmercury, a more toxic form because it's more readily absorbed by living things. Plankton eat the bacteria. Small fish eat the plankton and are, in turn, eaten by larger fish. With each step up the food chain, the mercury becomes more concentrated. Large predator fish that have eaten smaller contaminated fish can have a million times more mercury in their systems than the surrounding waters.\ Will cooking or cleaning the fish reduce the mercury?\ No. Mercury spreads throughout the meat of the fish, so removing skin or fat won't help, either.\ What kind of fish is safe to eat?\ Seafoods that are lower in mercury include wild salmon, herring, sardines, shrimp, tilapia, sole, and troll-caught albacore tuna under 18 pounds.\ The federal government warns pregnant women to avoid swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish completely. Light tuna, according to the government, contains less mercury than albacore, or white tuna.\ The state Department of Environmental Protection posts fish consumption advisories for freshwater fish at www.state.nj.us/dep/ dsr/njmainfish.htm.\ In North Jersey, the state says the general public should eat no more than one 8-ounce serving per week of bass and chain pickerel caught in any local waters. Pregnant women and young children should eat no more than one meal per month. There are additional advisories for particular locations. For instance, the state says those at high risk should avoid all white perch, largemouth bass, walleye, and pickerel from Passaic County's Monksville Reservoir.\ Is the water safe for drinking and swimming?\ Although the methylmercury in the bacteria and the fish is harmful, aquatic mercury that has not been changed into methylmercury is less readily absorbed by the body, so these waters are still considered safe for drinking and swimming.\ Can I be tested for mercury exposure?\ Yes. Blood, urine, and strands of hair can be tested.\ - Alex Nussbaum and Lindy Washburn"

Chris Christie made the controversial decision to leave the multi-state cap-and-trade compact.\Murphy, a Democrat who succeeded the Republican Christie on Jan. 16, had pledged to make New Jersey's re-entry into the initiative, known as RGGI, one of his first moves upon taking office. At a Monday morning ceremony overlooking Sandy Hook Bay, Murphy signed an executive order directing the state to rejoin the nine-state coalition.\""As the densest state in the nation, we can ill afford to keep our heads in the sand when it comes to climate change,"" Murphy said during a signing ceremony at the Seastreak ferry port in Highlands, a low-lying Monmouth County town devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

Sandy's impacts were felt in virtually every community,"" he said.\The greenhouse gas initiative aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which most science organizations agree is a leading cause of global warming and rising sea levels that have led to extreme weather in recent years.

151,"Residents of New Jersey expect a lot from the state's energy policies. We want lower energy prices, more jobs at higher wages, a healthy and clean environment, and protection of vulnerable communities. We also want energy policy to be formed in a transparent and publicly accessible manner.\When thinking about the major energy problems that New Jersey and the nation face, many solutions quickly come to mind, such as energy efficiency, renewable resources, fossil fuels and nuclear power. Almost everyone has a favored technological solution that they claim if only the government pursued full throttle, our energy problems would fade away. In the horse race of energy solutions, the advice to policymakers is ""Place your bets.""\The problem with any one technical solution is that it will not address all of our energy objectives, and many technologies are not scalable to the amount we need. Picking winners also gives the impression of political favoritism. If policy makers pick a combination of technologies, then that amounts to betting the trifecta.\Instead of thinking about picking energy winners, we should think about making the race fair by getting the economic incentives right.\The consumption and production of energy, along with its consequences, is driven by the costs and benefits we obtain from different energy sources, but for the most part do not include all of the environmental costs. Our energy challenges require a major shift in our economic activity so that all of us fundamentally change our behavior.\The market costs of producing and consuming fossil fuels must increase either through a comprehensive carbon tax or cap-and-trade policy to reflect their non-market costs such as environmental damage. This will induce energy efficiency and spur advances in cleaner resources to lower costs and improve performance.\Internalizing the environmental costs of energy will raise energy prices and slow economic growth unless policy makers offset energy price increases by reducing general taxes and regulations that hinder economic activity. This combination of policy changes will shift economic activity away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner energy resources and economic growth.\Since lower-income families spend a greater percentage of their income on energy than wealthier families, policy-makers need to also make sure that vulnerable communities are protected from higher direct costs. In some cases, those that are more vulnerable among us also bear the environmental costs of dirtier fuels.\On the plus side, technological advances in natural gas drilling have dramatically lowered the price of producing U.S. natural gas, which is cleaner than coal and oil and provides some energy security benefits. Solar costs have also rapidly declined and future cost reductions look promising. New grid technologies can facilitate integration of multiple technologies such as wind.\Policy-makers, however, should not bet on specific technologies. Instead, they should make sure that the horse track is level, the race is run fairly and admission prices are low.\Frank Felder is director of the Center for Energy, Economic and Environmental Policy at Rutgers University.\ID_Code: BZ-310140003"

The last two caused $1.3 billion in damage.\""The places that are dry will be getting drier,"" said Mattison, of Montclair, who hosts a television and radio show with his wife, Bonnie, on their website, newlygreens.com. ""The places that are wet will be getting wetter.""\Mattison advocated economic incentives to drive change, whether it be rebate programs to replace old, inefficient home heating systems or cap-and-trade regulations to get energy producers to lower emissions.\But he also suggested making everyday changes that are realistic. He gave up his low-mileage pickup truck in favor of an old Toyota Camry when he couldn't afford a new hybrid. He gradually replaced his incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient ones, but only after the incandescent bulbs blew out.\""Am I taking out a $40,000 loan to put up solar panels on my house? No, I'm not in that position,"" said Mattison, an audio and video technician. ""What people need to do is look at what is realistic for them, and then do it. Progress has been made. People were not even talking about this five years ago.""\Pessolano felt encouraged after Mattison's presentation.\""When we make decisions at the cash register, we can really drive the market toward being more environmentally friendly,"" he said.\E-mail: fallon@northjersey.com\Credit: E-mail: fallon@northjersey.com"
153,"| @ReporterBMakin\While the impact of horrific storms on energy has been a pressing issue the last three weeks after Hurricane Sandy, energy's impact on horrific storms and the climate changes of global warming have been related concerns for many years.\""The severe storms and hurricanes that have ravaged New Jersey in the past year and a half and the historic highs in sea levels underscore the urgency of protecting the environment,"" said Assemblyman John F. McKeon, D-Madison.\McKeon, along with U.S. Rep. Rush Holt, D-Hopewell Township, and state Sen. Kip Bateman, R-Branchburg, recently was awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award from the state chapter of the Sierra Club for environmental leadership. He was recognized in part for his fight against global warming, according to Sierra Club.\""Scientists say global warming is a major factor in the severe weather conditions that we have been experiencing and have claimed thousands of lives, destroyed tens of thousands of homes and property, disrupted transportation and cost billions of dollars to the state's economy,"" McKeon said. ""We must move forward to accelerate our fight against climate change.""\In the first week after Hurricane Sandy, Gov. Chris Christie said, ""I can do lots of things. I can't change the weather.""\Perhaps not, McKeon said, but Christie could have allowed New Jersey to remain a leader with nine other states in the fight against climate change with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. After vetoing the state's participation for a second time this summer, Christie called the cap-and-trade program a futile policy. The initiative requires utilities in participating states to purchase credits for each ton of carbon they emit. The credits are sold through public auctions, and the states use the revenue to pay for programs promoting renewable energy and clean-energy technology.\Rather than alter the behavior of energy producers, the program raises electric rates, Christie has said. Yet, the annual cost is only $6 per average household, according to environmentalists.\McKeon said he would like to see the administration take a leadership role in battling climate change in order to help prevent future storms from wreaking more havoc on the state.\""There are two different issues as it relates to the two major utility companies and what might be the new normal,"" he said. ""We have to do things differently in a way to keep from the disruption of society and the economy. School was out for two weeks and businesses were down. People couldn't get to work. The human toll was priceless and incalculable and is now a permanent sadness for victims and their families, but the economic damages are catastrophic for our economy. Society can't continue to take two weeks away from productivity every year. They have to deal with the new normal by doing a better job to restore normalcy.\""I give Gov.

154,"We agree with Gov. Chris Christie's decision to pull New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) for two major reasons: The two-year-old program was not effective in cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, and the program ultimately contributed to higher energy prices for residents and businesses in New Jersey.\Make no mistake about it. The high cost of energy in New Jersey is a sensitive issue for companies considering moving to or expanding in New Jersey.\When we poll our member companies and ask them what issues are impediments to their operations in New Jersey -- steep energy costs consistently rank among the top three, along with the cost of health insurance and taxes.\New Jersey's commercial and industrial customers pay among the highest energy rates in the nation, partly because the taxes paid by power plant owners in New Jersey under RGGI's cap-and-trade system.\As our economy continues to struggle, it is incumbent upon our leaders to revisit policies that stifle economic growth. In this case Christie's goal is to reduce energy rates and make them comparable to costs in other regions and states -- important steps for encouraging economic growth. Still, the governor is to be commended for not ignoring the need for clean energy.\In fact, he reiterated -- with the chamber of commerce's endorsement -- that he would prohibit any kind of new coal-fired power plants in New Jersey. Further, his plan calls for the state to focus on developing solar projects on brownfields and landfills, encourage the construction of natural gas power plants and develop a program to conserve energy in state facilities.\The New Jersey Chamber of Commerce will continue to get behind a number of initiatives to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include new technologies such as fuel cells and off-shore wind. And we will push for policy that encourages developers of these technologies to locate here in New Jersey -- where we have the thinkers to advance those fields and the high-skilled workers to manufacture their products.\In addition, nuclear energy must play a role in the clean energy solution. Nuclear has one of the lowest impacts on the environment of any energy source because it does not emit air pollution.\Yes, there have been reduced emissions in recent years. It has been attributed not to RGGI, but to reductions in energy use that came with the downturn in the economy and an increase in the use of natural gas.\Only 10 Northeastern states chose to be part of RGGI, while states like our neighbor, Pennsylvania, declined. Since Pennsylvania relies more on fossil fuels, such as dirty coal, energy costs there are lower, making it more business-friendly than New Jersey. Pennsylvania and other states in the Midwest can offer their energy at lower prices because they were never mandated to pay RGGI's carbon tax.\If we are to have a level playing field when it comes to addressing energy, it must be a nationwide, not a piecemeal, approach. Otherwise, states outside our region will continue to run older, more polluting power plants and offer energy at rock-bottom prices with no environmental benefit to any of us.\Michael Egenton is senior vice president, government relations, for the Trenton-based New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce.\ID_Code: BZ201110106190318"
155,"The 21st Century economy, along with public energy and our transportation infrastructure, will rely less and less on fossil fuels. Which is why it is vital, in densely populated, automobile traffic-heavy New Jersey, that we begin the transition to cleaner, more sustainable fuels with all deliberate speed.\An electric cars incentives bill that's found traction in Trenton and could be passed and signed into law in coming days would set that process in motion and help New Jersey begin to move dramatically to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, and combat climate change.\As environmental writer Scott Fallon of NorthJersey.com and USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey reports, the ""electric vehicles"" measure, in the works for some time, would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a substantial rebate on a purchase or lease.\The upshot for New Jersey would be more electric vehicles on our roadways, and more clean air for our lungs.\""If we're going to take air pollution and climate change seriously, this is something that has to be done,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of the advocacy group Environment New Jersey.\The centerpiece of the legislation is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price so they are more competitive with gasoline-powered cars. New Jersey, it should be noted, already waives the 7% sales tax on electric vehicle purchases, and the federal government offers a $2,500 to $7,500 income tax credit based on a car's battery capacity.\The rebates could help spur more electric car purchases in a market where even the cheapest models are not really affordable for the common working family in New Jersey.\Indeed, the cheapest Tesla Model 3, the best-selling electric car in the U.S., has a sticker price of almost $40,000.\The state rebate would be funded by $30 million annually from an existing clean energy charge on utility bills, and from money raised through a cap and trade program.\Yet in some ways, the price tag for the legislation is beside the point.\This is one where the question should not be, ""How can we afford to go forward?"" Rather, it should be, ""How can we not afford to go forward?""\One potential sticking point is the inclusion in the current bill that concerns NJ Transit buses, and which would see a gradual rollout of the technology. By Dec. 31, 2024, at least 10 percent of new buses purchased for the fleet would need to be ""zero-emission"" vehicles, and by end of 2032, NJ Transit could buy only electric-powered buses.\This may prove ambitious, given the sorry fiscal state at the agency, and so a perhaps more flexible move to all-out conversion for NJ Transit buses is a better way to go. The problem, of course, is that when target dates are pushed back in such programs, they tend to disappear altogether.\Certainly, compromise can be worked out to get an electric vehicle incentives bill passed and signed by the end of the lame-duck session.\A bill that retains even much of the wish list is a smart move toward smart and cleaner energy for New Jersey and its residents.\CREDIT: North Jersey Editorial Board"
156,"TRENTON -- It was last call for New Jersey residents to vent concerns ranging from pollution to the proposed folding of Rutgers University's Camden campus into Rowan University.\Even concerns about the trading of shark fins were on the minds of those crowded into the halls of the Statehouse Thursday.\A half-dozen citizen groups staged demonstrations outside the Statehouse and lobbied legislators inside the building on a number of different causes Thursday, trying to win influence before the Legislature starts its annual six-week budget break.\The day had an almost festival feel to it, as legislators, lobbyists and advocates packed into the hallway connecting the Senate and Assembly chambers. Making the space even tighter were various exhibits by vendors taking part in a New Jersey Business and Industry Association effort to highlight products made in the Garden State.\Adding to the scrum were bands, Girl Scouts (on hand for a ceremony honoring the organization's 100th anniversary) and Irish heritage groups. People roamed the capitol's hallways and common areas hoping for chance meetings with members of the Assembly and Senate.\Middletown residents Heidi Bruhin and Lynn Dash thought they hit the jackpot when they shared an elevator ride with Republican Sen. Joseph Kyrillos, R-Monmouth.\Bruhin and Dash tried to make the case to Kyrillos that he support a bill compelling New Jersey to participate in a regional cap-and-trade program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Kyrillos had championed Gov. Chris Christie's decision last year to withdraw from the 10-state pact.\""I don't think he's going to change his mind, but he told us he's still listening to all the arguments,"" Bruhin said.\When the vote was held, Kyrillos and all but one of his Republican colleagues opposed the measure.\The bill passed 22-15 on support from Democrats, too thin a margin to make a two-thirds override attempt of the GOP governor viable right away, but a leader of an environmentalist group promised to keep the pressure on.\""This is a beginning, not an end,"" said Doug O'Malley, field director of Environment New Jersey. ""We have a good measuring stick of where we need to pick up votes .""\O'Malley said more than 100 people were in Trenton hoping to drum up support on the legislation to keep New Jersey in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Buses picked up advocates in Red Bank, Wall, Jackson and other points in the state, with one bus with 20 passengers rolling from Ridgewood after a 7 a.m. pickup.\Camden residents Ulysses Delgado and Moneke Ragsdale were in Trenton to protest the proposed Camden County takeover of the city police force, a transition supported by the governor.\Another group of about 20 people focused entirely on the merger of Rutgers-Camden and Rowan. Hyun Kyu Seo, a Rutgers-Camden student, brought copies of online petitions he created in opposition to the merger, signed electronically by 11,500.\The junior art major from Columbus -- joined by several other students and a dozen Rutgers-Camden faculty members -- said taxpayers ""deserve a fuller fiscal and educational accounting before being forced to commit to radical changes in education in southern New Jersey.""\""I disagree that a merger between Rutgers-Camden and Rowan will boost the educational mission of both institutions,"" he said.\Meanwhile, Brick resident Steve Nagiewicz, chairman of the nonprofit Shark Research Institute and an environmental science teacher at Atlantic City High School, visited the Statehouse to bring attention to new legislation sponsored by Sen. Christopher ""Kip"" Bateman, R-Somerset, designed to prohibit the trade of shark fins within the state. It would pull fins out of the seafood trade. Nagiewicz said similar legislation has been passed in California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington."
157,"Gov. Phil Murphy ordered his administration Wednesday to develop an offshore wind plan for New Jersey after eight years of stalled progress to harness the Atlantic Ocean as an energy resource.\Murphy, who has promised to convert the state fully to clean energy by 2050, signed an executive order intended to establish New Jersey as an environmental leader. The order outlines a goal of generating 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, and directs his acting environmental protection commissioner and utilities president to establish a strategic offshore wind plan.\Murphy signed the executive order at an Atlantic City wastewater facility powered by wind turbines that have become part of the city's casino skyline.\He called attention to a 2010 law signed by Gov. Chris Christie, known as the Offshore Wind Economic Development Act, that he said was designed to begin a new era of power and generate a new energy sector. But what should have been a ""big game-changer"" for the economy idled in bureaucracy while other states ""leap-frogged us,"" he said.\""There is tremendous urgency in our need to act,"" Murphy said. ""The days of political delay are over. 2030 is only a dozen years away and we have a lot to do, so we better get to it,"" he added. ""And surely as the breezes blow at the Jersey Shore, we're going to get this done.""\New Jersey was poised to become the first state to develop offshore wind power when Christie signed the 2010 law, but environmentalists say Christie stalled the development of a key funding mechanism in the ensuing years as he embarked on a presidential bid to appeal to conservative voters in states heavily dependent of fossil fuels.\Without offshore renewable energy certificates, known as ORECs, companies could not get investors to finance turbine projects that often cost as much as $1 billion. Rhode Island moved ahead and became the first state to produce offshore wind power when turbines went online in late 2016.\Even though New Jersey was making no progress, the Obama administration granted three companies the right to build turbines — one off Sandy Hook and two near Atlantic City.\In 2015, US Wind Inc. and RES Americas won the right to lease about 344,000 acres of seafloor from Cape May Court House north for 60 miles to Barnegat. Statoil, a Norwegian company, won a bid in 2016 to lease nearly 80,000 acres about 18 miles southeast of Sandy Hook for $42.5 million.\The process to get wind turbines in the ocean is very lengthy.\Even if New Jersey fast tracks some of the wind farms, the projects would still require permits from federal agencies including U.S. Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and several others.\Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, was one of several lawmakers who attended Wednesday's ceremony and welcomed the order after eight years of minimal progress to move the state's offshore wind program to its potential.\Sweeney said that when the law was signed in 2010, Atlantic City hosted 1,700 people who ""were talking about what we had done as the model to make this happen."" But he said he watched in ""frustration"" as other states, particularly Maryland, made greater progress in developing offshore wind energy.\""It's been eight years of torture, and in a couple minutes we're going to jump from the back to the front again,"" he said. ""We're ready for it. Everything's in place.""\The order is the latest action by Murphy focused on the environment.\Earlier in the week he signed an executive order to return New Jersey to the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program that former Republican Gov. Chris Christie pulled New Jersey out of in 2012. And his administration announced Tuesday that it plans to withdraw from a multi-state lawsuit intended to block former President Barack Obama's plan to cut power plant emissions."

NORTHFIELD - The Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders voted Tuesday to urge the state to withdraw from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI - a multistate ""cap and trade"" emissions-reduction program that opponents claim is a burden on businesses and rate-payers and supporters claim is a revenue-generating way of slowing climate change.
\
The resolution, introduced by Republican Freeholder Joseph McDevitt, was approved by a party-line, 6-3 vote, with all Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.
\
Atlantic County is the seventh county to back the effort by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity - whose state director, Steve Lonegan, spoke at the meeting along with several supporters - to compel New Jersey and other states to withdraw from the four-year-old program, in which carbon emissions are capped and carbon credits are sold at auction.
\
Lonegan framed his opposition in economic terms, calling the program ""a deceptive program that lines the pockets of Wall Street speculators"" who buy and sell credits. He also argued that New Jersey businesses, and especially its casinos, are at a disadvantage over non-RGGI states such as Pennsylvania.
\
""It's a regressive and destructive tax on low-wage earners,"" Lonegan said. ""A profit-making speculative scheme that makes (credit default swaps) look like child's play.""
\
While Lonegan didn't question the science of climate change - even citing what he said were RGGI reports that admitted no real impact on climate change until 2030, adding that ""by that time ... we will have lost years and years"" in the effort to combat it - many other supporters of the resolution, including McDevitt, said they questioned whether climate change was real.
\
""There's no denying there's global warming ... the ice (from the ice age) melted,"" Absecon Councilman Charles Urban said sarcastically. ""There's also climate change four seasons of the year.""
\
Democratic Freeholder Jim Schroeder, meanwhile, said that arguing about climate change was ""beyond my pay grade."" But when criticized by a speaker who indirectly compared climate change science to early-20th century eugenics, Schroeder said that ""the preponderance of scientists"" agree that man-made global warming exists.
\
Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, whose group opposes efforts to withdraw from RGGI, told The Press that the program has raised as much as $68 million a year for efforts such as marshland and pinelands restoration, energy efficiency programs and solar projects such as the panels on the Atlantic City Convention Center.
\
""It would send a chill politically for any type of programs that deal with carbons and regulate climate change-producing chemicals,"" Tittel said, adding that Americans for Prosperity is backed by the owner of the energy conglomerate Koch Industries. ""For a state like New Jersey, it's extremely short-sighted. As a coastal state, it's one of the most vulnerable to sea level rise.""
\
In the end, the economic argument won over the Republican freeholders
\
""I also have a young son, and I don't believe anyone in this room doesn't want to leave a better state than they inherited,"" said Republican Freeholder Richard Dase. ""But I wished we lived in a world where people (help) the environment because it's the right thing to do, not because there's a (dollar) value on it.""

160,"Residents of New Jersey expect a lot from the state's energy policies. We want lower energy prices, more jobs at higher wages, a healthy and clean environment, and protection of vulnerable communities. We also want energy policy to be formed in a transparent and publicly accessible manner.\When thinking about the major energy problems that New Jersey and the nation face, many solutions quickly come to mind, such as energy efficiency, renewable resources, fossil fuels and nuclear power. Almost everyone has a favored technological solution that they claim if only the government pursued full throttle, our energy problems would fade away. In the horse race of energy solutions, the advice to policymakers is ""Place your bets.""\The problem with any one technical solution is that it will not address all of our energy objectives, and many technologies are not scalable to the amount we need. Picking winners also gives the impression of political favoritism. If policy makers pick a combination of technologies, then that amounts to betting the trifecta.\Instead of thinking about picking winners, we should think about making the race fair by getting the economic incentives right. The consumption and production of energy, along with its consequences, is driven by the costs and benefits we obtain from different energy sources, but for the most part do not include all of the environmental costs. Our energy challenges require a major shift in our economic activity so that all of us fundamentally change our behavior.\The market costs of producing and consuming fossil fuels must increase either through a comprehensive carbon tax or cap-and-trade policy to reflect their non-market costs such as environmental damage. This will induce energy efficiency and spur advances in cleaner resources to lower costs and improve performance.\Internalizing the environmental costs of energy will raise energy prices and slow economic growth unless policy makers offset energy price increases by reducing general taxes and regulations that hinder economic activity. This combination of policy changes will shift economic activity away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner energy resources and economic growth.\Since lower-income families spend a greater percentage of their income on energy than wealthier families, policy makers need to also make sure that vulnerable communities are protected from higher direct costs.\On the plus side, technological advances in natural gas drilling have dramatically lowered the price of producing U.S. natural gas, which is cleaner than coal and oil and provides some energy security benefits. Solar costs have also rapidly declined and future cost reductions look promising. New grid technologies can facilitate integration of multiple technologies such as wind.\Policy makers, however, should not bet on specific technologies. Instead, they should make sure that the horse track is level, the race is run fairly and admission prices are low.\Frank Felder is director of the Center for Energy, Economic and Environmental Policy at Rutgers University."
161,"""We're mad as hell and we are not taking it anymore"" was the mantra loudly given to U.S. Rep. John Adler, D-N.J., at the packed Medford VFW town meeting recently. It was a proverbial lynching of President Barack Obama's linchpin health reform plan. It did not matter that Adler said he would not vote for the proposed health care bill. The uncivil crowd was angry and let him know it over and over again.\Of course, we still don't know if the freshman congressman will be pressured into a slightly revised plan. However, he certainly understands where this group stands about major changes to health care. Letting the government euthanize us senior citizens by precluding needed care was not popular. He also said he would not raise taxes in this environment and was pro-business. However, he voted for Cap and Trade, which seems to impeach his own words.\He said he is for nuclear and drilling where it is environmentally safe. Offshore New Jersey is off-limits. If he truly believes increased taxes will hurt the economy and he is pro-business to create jobs, he should vote that way.\Secured funding\Adler helped secure FEMA money for Medford and is helping the Lakes to receive similar funds for the dam flooding. We thank him. However, New Jersey has been ranked dead last for more than 20 years in the amount of federal money it receives back from Washington for every $1 in taxes we pay, and a recent report showed we are last in federal education funding. This is partly why New Jersey has the highest taxes in the country.\Many of us can't deduct Jersey taxes due to the alternative minimum tax. I asked Adler why New Jersey is dead last in federal funding. Adler's nonanswer was we need to cut spending at all levels of government, which is true. But he did not answer why we don't get back our fair share of New Jersey taxes sent to Washington.\When I sarcastically said maybe we need Chicago-style politicians getting New Jersey more federal funding, the crowd went ballistic. I don't know whether they turned on me or were just venting more anger about Obama and his Chicago cronies running this country -- into the ground. Hopefully it was the latter. I know first-hand about Cook County politics, which are as corrupt as New Jersey politics.\Folks, I was only kidding. If the Medford town hall meeting is representative of America's views, Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi et al. are in trouble. Mark Twain said ""When giving a speech eloquence is more important than the information or facts."" America elected eloquence. Now the facts are outweighing the eloquence.\I hope Adler takes that message back to Washington. I also thank Adler for having the meeting.\The writer lives in Medford."

The credits are sold through public auctions, and the states use the revenue to pay for programs promoting renewable energy and clean-energy technology.\Rather than alter the behavior of energy producers, the program raises electric rates, Christie has said. Yet, the annual cost is only $6 per average household, according to environmentalists.\McKeon said he would like to see the administration take a leadership role in battling climate change in order to help prevent future storms from wreaking more havoc on the state.\""There are two different issues as it relates to the two major utility companies and what might be the new normal,"" he said. ""We have to do things differently in a way to keep from the disruption of society and the economy. School was out for two weeks and businesses were down. People couldn't get to work. The human toll was priceless and incalculable and is now a permanent sadness for victims and their families, but the economic damages are catastrophic for our economy. Society can't continue to take two weeks away from productivity every year. They have to deal with the new normal by doing a better job to restore normalcy.\""I give Gov. Christie credit for showing himself as a leader and getting us through these difficult times,"" McKeon said. ""Perhaps he will have an epiphany, just based on what he has seen with is own eyes, regarding this problem. New Jersey needs to be part of the solution.""\Staff Writer Bob Makin: 732-565-7319, bmakin@njpressmedia.com\ID_Code: CN-311170012"
164,"Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula will run against Rep. Leonard Lance for his seat in Congress this fall.\Chivukula, 61, has served in the state Assembly since 2002, the last five years as deputy speaker.\The Democrat serves the state's 17th Legislative District, which is made up of Franklin, Milltown, New Brunswick, North Brunswick and Piscataway.\Lance, a Republican, was elected to the House of Representatives in 2008, and re-elected in 2010 to represent New Jersey's 7th Congressional District, which includes parts of Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties.\""America is a great country. It gave an opportunity for an immigrant like myself,"" said Chivukula, who was born in India and came to the U.S. when he was 24 years old to pursue his education.\""America has been a great home for me, and our country has been at the top of the world for many, many years,"" Chivukula added.

165,"Mr. Malwitz assertion in the Aug. 7 Home News Tribune that anyone who has questions about the federal government's intent to socialize medicine must be getting their talking points from insurance companies who feed ""right-wing hate radio"" or from Fox News is the reason why so many news outlets in this country are in dire financial straits.\I, for one, seek out the issues facing us today from a variety of sources -- newspapers, Internet and cable news, one of which is Fox. I have found that many news people, like politicians, lobbyists, college professors and entertainers, live in a bubble. All too often many of them associate only with like-minded individuals.\The protests at town hall meetings around the country are just the latest example of the backlash by the American people to President Obama's overambitious agenda. How ridiculous is it to pass bills costing we the taxpayers trillions of dollars without our legislators even having had the opportunity to read them?\The Cap and Trade bill, a pitiful attempt at stopping alleged global warming, will send American jobs overseas and have no impact on the environment. The Cash for Clunkers bill is an attempt to handpick which industries and unions will prosper or fail after already receiving billions of taxpayer funded dollars.\And now we have the new debacle, health care. Do their need to be changes made? Absolutely. But do I want the government, which wastes nearly half of every dollar in revenue from We, The People, to write and vote on the legislation in weeks? Absolutely not. In this administration's ever-changing cast of bad guys the new demon is insurance companies.\The Fed is likely to follow the lead of New Jersey and destroy us with ridiculous taxes, nonexistent business incentives, a minutiae of regulations and then come back to us with their hands out to fix what they broke. I'm glad to see people are finally getting off their behinds and asking questions and demanding intelligible answers from the legislators who are suppose to represent them.\The outrage seen at town hall meetings around the U.S. are not ""manufactured"" as some politicians prefer to say. The Tea Parties (Taxed Enough Already) are not organized by ""right wing zealots"" as the press is fond of reporting. They are not Acorn or Americorps or Republican party mouthpieces. They are not naysayers or racists.

166,"Residents of New Jersey expect a lot from the state's energy policies. We want lower energy prices, more jobs at higher wages, a healthy and clean environment, and protection of vulnerable communities. We also want energy policy to be formed in a transparent and publicly accessible manner.\When thinking about the major energy problems that New Jersey and the nation face, many solutions quickly come to mind, such as energy efficiency, renewable resources, fossil fuels and nuclear power. Almost everyone has a favored technological solution that they claim if only the government pursued full throttle, our energy problems would fade away. In the horse race of energy solutions, the advice to policymakers is ""Place your bets.""\The problem with any one technical solution is that it will not address all of our energy objectives, and many technologies are not scalable to the amount we need. Picking winners also gives the impression of political favoritism. If policy makers pick a combination of technologies, then that amounts to betting the trifecta.\Instead of thinking about picking winners, we should think about making the race fair by getting the economic incentives right. The consumption and production of energy, along with its consequences, is driven by the costs and benefits we obtain from different energy sources, but for the most part do not include all of the environmental costs. Our energy challenges require a major shift in our economic activity so that all of us fundamentally change our behavior.\The market costs of producing and consuming fossil fuels must increase either through a comprehensive carbon tax or cap-and-trade policy to reflect their non-market costs such as environmental damage. This will induce energy efficiency and spur advances in cleaner resources to lower costs and improve performance.\Internalizing the environmental costs of energy will raise energy prices and slow economic growth unless policy makers offset energy price increases by reducing general taxes and regulations that hinder economic activity. This combination of policy changes will shift economic activity away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner energy resources and economic growth.\Since lower-income families spend a greater percentage of their income on energy than wealthier families, policy makers need to also make sure that vulnerable communities are protected from higher direct costs.\On the plus side, technological advances in natural gas drilling have dramatically lowered the price of producing U.S. natural gas, which is cleaner than coal and oil and provides some energy security benefits. Solar costs have also rapidly declined and future cost reductions look promising. New grid technologies can facilitate integration of multiple technologies such as wind.\Policy makers, however, should not bet on specific technologies. Instead, they should make sure that the horse track is level, the race is run fairly and admission prices are low.\Frank Felder is director of the Center for Energy, Economic and Environmental Policy at Rutgers University.\ID_Code: B3-310140025"
167,"Solar energy is one of the new bright spots in New Jersey's energy picture. Less than a decade ago, few buildings or homes across our state had solar panels on their roofs. Today, New Jersey has more solar installations than 48 other states, trailing only California.\A solid position in a new growth industry is more than a point of pride. Solar energy is providing an important source of new jobs and economic activity to help strengthen New Jersey's ability to compete while benefiting the environment and quality of life.\Solar's emergence is the product of a strong consensus that clean, renewable energy is a good investment for the future of our state. At PSEG, we are investing more than $700 million to expand access to solar energy across New Jersey. There are two major prongs to our effort. One is a loan program to help customers finance solar energy installations.\Through the second prong, called Solar 4 All, we are putting solar panels on up to 200,000 utility poles, building solar farms on some of our properties and exploring opportunities to install and operate solar energy systems on behalf of town halls, schools and other public or nonprofit facilities.\PSEG has embraced renewables for a number of reasons. First, our customers tell us they want the benefits of green energy. Utilities are uniquely equipped to bring these benefits to millions of people, just as we have traditionally provided universal access to electricity and gas. Second, renewables can help put energy on a more sustainable track by reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Solar energy is not only carbon-free, but pollution-free. Last but not least, renewables present an extraordinary jobs-and-growth opportunity.\New Jersey has a knowledge-based, high-tech economy. It's in our state's interest to have strong companies active here in the clean energy industry, creating jobs and poised to grow. It's in the interest of local communities, too. When we build a solar farm on a former contaminated site, as we are doing in Trenton, it brings land back into productive uses. It also generates good-paying local jobs -- and hope for a better future.\There is a broader economic benefit as well. Renewable energy can be a powerful growth engine across our country, and the expertise being developed in our state is a value-added product.\A new business at PSEG is exploring renewable energy opportunities outside of our utility service area. This year, we expect to complete solar farms in Florida and Ohio. And in 2009, we built a solar farm at the M&M Mars factory in Hackettstown, supplying 20 percent of the energy used to produce M&M chocolates at that facility.\As we continue to grow, it adds to our ability to create more green jobs, attract suppliers, provide additional work for New Jersey-based professionals and strengthen a new tax-paying industry.\Some caution is in order, however. First, there are costs to consider. Renewable energy, including solar, is more expensive at this point than conventional generation. We strongly believe the benefits justify the cost, but we need always to keep in mind our customers' interests in affordable energy. With a view to protecting customers, it's good that steps promoting offshore wind energy development in New Jersey will need to provide a clear-cut economic benefit to pass muster under a new state law.\Second, we must remain aware that renewable energy is only part of the solution. Our nation will continue to need a diverse mix of fuels. In this respect, we shouldn't overlook the advantages derived from emissions-free nuclear energy, or from abundant domestic supplies of environmentally friendly natural gas. Moreover, we need to give priority to conservation and energy efficiency, which provide the most cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gases.\Finally, there is a national context to consider as well. Many of the environmental successes of the last several decades were made possible by bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. This is true of the Clean Air Act, the adoption of a cap-and-trade system to reduce acid rain pollution and the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\We must continue to urge Congress to act in the same bipartisan spirit and pass appropriate energy and climate legislation. A clear national policy will provide the certainty that businesses need to open up the floodgates for clean energy investment.\In the meantime, finding new ways to build on New Jersey's remarkable green-energy growth story can reap a rich harvest for the Garden State and its residents.\Ralph Izzo is chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSE&G."
168,"Gov. Phil Murphy ordered his administration Wednesday to develop an offshore wind plan for New Jersey after eight years of stalled progress to harness the Atlantic Ocean as an energy resource.\Murphy, who has promised to convert the state fully to clean energy by 2050, signed an executive order intended to establish New Jersey as an environmental leader. The order outlines a goal of generating 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, and directs his acting environmental protection commissioner and utilities president to establish a strategic offshore wind plan.\Murphy signed the executive order at an Atlantic City wastewater facility powered by wind turbines that have become part of the city's casino skyline.\He called attention to a 2010 law signed by Gov. Chris Christie, known as the Offshore Wind Economic Development Act, that he said was designed to begin a new era of power and generate a new energy sector. But what should have been a ""big game-changer"" for the economy idled in bureaucracy while other states ""leap-frogged us,"" he said.\""There is tremendous urgency in our need to act,"" Murphy said. ""The days of political delay are over. 2030 is only a dozen years away and we have a lot to do, so we better get to it,"" he added. ""And surely as the breezes blow at the Jersey Shore, we're going to get this done.""\New Jersey was poised to become the first state to develop offshore wind power when Christie signed the 2010 law, but environmentalists say Christie stalled the development of a key funding mechanism in the ensuing years as he embarked on a presidential bid to appeal to conservative voters in states heavily dependent of fossil fuels.\Without offshore renewable energy certificates, known as ORECs, companies could not get investors to finance turbine projects that often cost as much as $1 billion. Rhode Island moved ahead and became the first state to produce offshore wind power when turbines went online in late 2016.\Even though New Jersey was making no progress, the Obama administration granted three companies the right to build turbines — one off Sandy Hook and two near Atlantic City.\In 2015, US Wind Inc. and RES Americas won the right to lease about 344,000 acres of seafloor from Cape May Court House north for 60 miles to Barnegat. Statoil, a Norwegian company, won a bid in 2016 to lease nearly 80,000 acres about 18 miles southeast of Sandy Hook for $42.5 million.\The process to get wind turbines in the ocean is very lengthy.\Even if New Jersey fast tracks some of the wind farms, the projects would still require permits from federal agencies including U.S. Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and several others.\Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, was one of several lawmakers who attended Wednesday's ceremony and welcomed the order after eight years of minimal progress to move the state's offshore wind program to its potential.\Sweeney said that when the law was signed in 2010, Atlantic City hosted 1,700 people who ""were talking about what we had done as the model to make this happen."" But he said he watched in ""frustration"" as other states, particularly Maryland, made greater progress in developing offshore wind energy.\""It's been eight years of torture, and in a couple minutes we're going to jump from the back to the front again,"" he said. ""We're ready for it. Everything's in place.""\The order is the latest action by Murphy focused on the environment.\Earlier in the week he signed an executive order to return New Jersey to the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program that former Republican Gov. Chris Christie pulled New Jersey out of in 2012. And his administration announced Tuesday that it plans to withdraw from a multi-state lawsuit intended to block former President Barack Obama's plan to cut power plant emissions."
169," Don't expect any federal action on climate change before the 2008 presidential election, but the next administration will have to deal with it regardless of which party wins, former Gov. Christie Whitman said Monday.\ Scientists testifying before a state legislative committee in Trenton earlier this year predicted climate change would lead to more frequent heat waves and flooding in coming decades, especially in the Meadowlands, as well as more powerful storms that could thrash the Jersey Shore.\ Whitman told students at Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute that the next president will face strong pressure from the public, the business community and other developed nations to address climate issues.\ But she said action before the election is not likely because the campaign is already well under way and political campaigns tend to push issues to the poles, with one side saying ""everyone's going to die,"" and the other side pointing to one cool spring season to say the whole issue is a hoax.\ Whitman said some proposals on Capitol Hill described as ""bold"" approaches to climate change actually contain ""poison pills"" in the form of strict mandates and short time frames that seem designed to provoke a Republican rejection that Democrats can exploit.\ ""One of the things about climate change that I think is so important is trying to tamp down the rhetoric and look at what can we do together, and not just try to keep this issue alive for political purposes in an election cycle,"" Whitman said. ""And I've seen, unfortunately, too much of that.""\ But the former Republican governor and administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bush also showed she still has a strong partisan streak.\ Asked during an interview about a recent comment by Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who is chairwoman of the environment committee, that the Bush administration wasted ""critical years"" that could have been used to begin to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, Whitman said:\ ""I think we should have, but it's nice of Senator Boxer to say that because the [Democratic] Clinton administration didn't try to regulate carbon.""\ Whitman as EPA leader drew the ire of conservatives when, relying on a Bush campaign promise, she said at an international conference that the United States was considering regulating carbon emissions.\ Bush ended up deciding against such a move, and last month the EPA lost a lawsuit before the Supreme Court in which the agency contended it did not have the authority to treat carbon dioxide as an air pollutant.\ Whitman told the students she wished the current EPA administrator, Stephen Johnson, would use the ruling as a catalyst to start the difficult job of devising a ""cap and trade"" system through which emissions would be restricted but businesses could trade with each other for emission rights. At the same time, she defended Johnson's decision not to take such a position.\ ""He had to say 'We're still taking a look at the ruling,' "" Whitman said, explaining, as she did often about her own tenure, ""You have to defer to the elected officials. You were not elected. It's somebody else's policy.""\ Bush has said that strict regulation by the United States while China takes no action would make the U.S. less competitive economically.\ ***\ E-mail: jackson@northjersey.com\ ***"

171,"Last week, a draft memo surfaced from the Homeland Security Department suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency.\Most disturbing was the stated rationale. This was being proposed ""in the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform."" In other words, because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, they will legislate it themselves.\Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate. Administrators administer the law, they don't change it. That's the legislators' job.\When questioned, the White House downplayed the toxic memo, leaving the impression that it was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland Security. But the administration is engaged in an even more significant power play elsewhere.\A 2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they threaten human health and the environment. The Obama EPA made precisely that finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The Washington Post, sending ""a message to Congress.""\It was not a terribly subtle message: Enact cap-and-trade legislation -- taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based energy -- or the EPA will do so unilaterally. As Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch noted, such a finding ""is likely to help light a fire under Congress to get moving.""\Well, Congress didn't. Despite the ""regulatory cudgel"" (to again quote the Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly refused to acquiesce.\Good for the Senate. But what to do when the executive is passively aggressive rather than actively so? Take border security.\Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., reports that President Barack Obama told him about pressure from his political left and its concern that if the border is secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform (i.e., amnesty).\Indeed, Homeland Security's abandonment of the ""virtual fence"" on the southern border, combined with its lack of interest in completing the real fence that today covers only one-third of the border, gives the distinct impression that serious border enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican quid pro quo on comprehensive reform.\But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for legislative favors. It is, as the administration vociferously argued in court in the Arizona case, the federal executive's constitutional responsibility. Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. Non-execution is a dereliction of duty.\This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal government or to Democrats. In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has just issued a ruling allowing police to ask about one's immigration status when stopped for some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment.\Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect. If police latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to be expanded, that's an issue for the legislature, not the executive.\How did we get here? I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.) The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned the heads of the country's nine largest banks and informed them that henceforth the federal government was their business partner. The banks were under no legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal government, when crossed, to cause you trouble, endless trouble. They complied.\So did BP when the president summoned its top executives to the White House to demand a $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages. Existing law capped damages at $75 million. BP, like the banks, understood the power of the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was.\Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was), and still be troubled by how we got there. Everyone wants energy in the executive (as Alexander Hamilton called it). But not lawlessness. In the modern welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That's bad enough. But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the separation of powers. Such constraints on your life must first be approved by both houses of Congress.\That's called the consent of the governed. The constitutional order is meant to subject you to the will of the people's representatives, not to the whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking bureaucrat.\Charles Krauthammer is a nationally syndicated columnist."

(PUBLISHED WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2009, PAGE A02.)\IT'S NOT OFTEN business leaders go before Congress and say ""Please give us more regulation."" Unless they're facing regulations that others in their business are not.\That's part of what happened last week when the chief executive officer of the parent company of Public Service Electric & Gas testified in support of a national cap on carbon emissions.\Public Service Enterprise Group CEO Ralph Izzo has been singing that song for a while now, and one reason why is his company already gets more than half its electricity from nuclear power, a very low source of carbon emissions.\PSEG also is already dealing with New Jersey's state-imposed greenhouse gas restrictions that include a nascent exchange where emission rights are traded among northeastern states.\""Uncertainty about a national program slows our transition to a green economy, complicating investment decisions about whether to retrofit coal plants to reduce emissions, pursue development of new nuclear or invest in offshore wind,"" Izzo told the Senate's environment committee.\""And while we delay, America is losing ground to nations around the world.""\That may be, but leaders of a group of South Jersey building trade unions are urging the Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Bob Menendez to oppose the climate change bill.\Their reason: New restrictions on emissions from refineries could lead Valero Energy to close its Paulsboro refinery and move the work to other countries.\In a letter to the senators, the South Jersey Building Trades Council - whose leaders include state Senate Majority Leader Steve Sweeney and Assembly candidate Donald Norcross -- said it took no comfort from the promise of ""green jobs"" to replace those lost from the new regulation.\""With respect, we don't make solar panels in Paulsboro,"" the letter said. ""Even if those jobs occur, they won't be here.""\Lautenberg, a committee member who supports the bill, said at a hearing Tuesday that the dangers from rising global temperature were just as serious.\""My father lost his job many times during the Depression years and it was catastrophic in our family. But what's the final cost? That's the thing we have to look at,"" he said. ""We're sounding the alarm. America, wake up, wake up, your kids are in danger, your families are in danger.

There are many distractions that can cause accidents, Wicker said.\""Perhaps we ought to include eating a hamburger in this legislation,"" he said.\Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., countered that his mother had been killed by a drunk driver trying to elude police and he was strongly for federal involvement, especially to ban texting.\""You can eat a hamburger without looking at the meat.

173," When Duke Energy Corp. CEO James E. Rogers considers global warming, he sees more than a costly quagmire for the U.S. power industry; he sees grand monuments. Notre Dame in Paris, St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\ Rogers has adopted what he calls ""cathedral thinking,"" a view that tackling climate change is a chance for the industry to leave a proud environmental legacy for future generations.\ This philosophy may not deliver results as quickly as environmentalists would like, or sit well with all his counterparts. However, it does aptly describe an approach toward reducing greenhouse gases that a small but growing number of power executives are embracing.\ ""The science says we need to act,"" said Rogers. Of course, shifting political winds are an equally persuasive force in an industry that accounts for almost 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.\ Rogers and many other executives are convinced the United States is likely to join Europe in placing limits on carbon dioxide emissions believed by scientists to cause global warming perhaps as early as next decade.\ This rising expectation of mandatory carbon caps is reviving interest in nuclear power, accelerating the use of cleaner coal- burning technologies and spurring investment in alternative fuels such as wind and biomass.\ Some of the country's biggest power producers are even setting voluntary greenhouse-gas reduction goals now in hopes of gaining a competitive edge down the road.\ Despite good intentions, it will probably be decades before meaningful progress is made on reducing carbon emissions, say experts on energy and the environment. That is because half the country's electricity comes from burning coal by far the largest industrial source of carbon dioxide and the most promising technology for capturing these emissions and sequestering them underground is still in the experimental phase.\ Meanwhile, the Edison Electric Institute, the industry's main trade association, is lobbying to prevent mandatory carbon caps, calling them an unnecessary financial burden at a time when the power industry needs to invest billions just to meet anticipated demand.\ Rogers, who is the chairman of EEI through June and welcomes economywide carbon caps, is at odds with the association's official position: it favors voluntary measures, a stance also advocated by the Bush administration.\ U.S. electricity demand is expected to rise by about 1.5 percent a year, resulting in a 50 percent increase from current levels by 2030. Factor in the anticipated industrialization of China, India and other developing nations, and the global rate of growth for electricity demand is even higher.\ The Electric Power Research Institute predicts that, with today's technology, global carbon dioxide emissions will more than double by 2050 to 80 billion metric tons a year. The U.S. already accounts for more than 7 billion tons a year.\ Increasing energy efficiency standards and deploying ""improved versions"" of today's power plants would substantially slow the rate of growth, according to EPRI, a non-profit that provides scientific and technical research on electricity. But to actually reduce annual global carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, EPRI estimates that nearly half of the world's electricity would need to come from carbon-free fuels, such as nuclear, wind and solar. Today, carbon-free fuels account for a third of global power generation. This is one reason some U.S. power executives vow to fight carbon limits unless constraints are carried out worldwide.\ Some opponents of mandatory carbon caps say the power industry would be better off with one federal standard than a hodgepodge of state regulations with which to comply.\ But either way, the basic principle of putting a price on carbon is gaining traction: The Congressional Budget Office last month said any cost-effective U.S. policy on global warming will require emissions taxes or a cap and trade system similar to Europe's. It is against this backdrop of legislative activity at the state level and with help from federal tax breaks included in last year's energy bill that some utilities are tweaking their long-term strategies.\ David Crane, head of Princeton-based NRG Energy, said at a recent conference that the industry's long-standing attitude of ""see no carbon, hear no carbon, speak no carbon"" is increasingly out of touch with mainstream American values."
174,"Gov. Phil Murphy ordered his administration Wednesday to develop an offshore wind plan for New Jersey after eight years of stalled progress to harness the Atlantic Ocean as an energy resource.\Murphy, who has promised to convert the state fully to clean energy by 2050, signed an executive order intended to establish New Jersey as an environmental leader. The order outlines a goal of generating 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, enough to power 1.5 million homes, and directs his acting environmental protection commissioner and utilities president to establish a strategic offshore wind plan.\Murphy signed the executive order at an Atlantic City wastewater facility powered by wind turbines that have become part of the city's casino skyline.\He called attention to a 2010 law signed by Gov. Chris Christie, known as the Offshore Wind Economic Development Act, that he said was designed to begin a new era of power and generate a new energy sector. But what should have been a ""big game-changer"" for the economy idled in bureaucracy while other states ""leapfrogged us,"" he said.\""There is tremendous urgency in our need to act,"" Murphy said. ""The days of political delay are over. 2030 is only a dozen years away and we have a lot to do, so we better get to it,"" he added. ""And surely as the breezes blow at the Jersey Shore, we're going to get this done.""\New Jersey was poised to become the first state to develop offshore wind power when Christie signed the 2010 law, but environmentalists say Christie stalled the development of a key funding mechanism in the ensuing years as he embarked on a presidential bid to appeal to conservative voters in states heavily dependent of fossil fuels.\Without offshore renewable energy certificates, known as ORECs, companies could not get investors to finance turbine projects that often cost as much as $1 billion. Rhode Island moved ahead and became the first state to produce offshore wind power when turbines went online in late 2016.\Even though New Jersey was making no progress, the Obama administration granted three companies the right to build turbines — one off Sandy Hook and two near Atlantic City.\In 2015, US Wind Inc. and RES Americas won the right to lease about 344,000 acres of seafloor from Cape May Court House north for 60 miles to Barnegat. Statoil, a Norwegian company, won a bid in 2016 to lease nearly 80,000 acres about 18 miles southeast of Sandy Hook for $42.5 million.\The process to get wind turbines in the ocean is very lengthy.\Even if New Jersey fast tracks some of the wind farms, the projects would still require permits from federal agencies including U.S. Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and several others.\Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, was one of several lawmakers who attended Wednesday's ceremony and welcomed the order after eight years of minimal progress to move the state's offshore wind program to its potential.\Sweeney said that when the law was signed in 2010, Atlantic City hosted 1,700 people who ""were talking about what we had done as the model to make this happen."" But he said he watched in ""frustration"" as other states, particularly Maryland, made greater progress in developing offshore wind energy.\""It's been eight years of torture, and in a couple of minutes we're going to jump from the back to the front again,"" he said. ""We're ready for it. Everything's in place.""\The order is the latest action by Murphy focused on the environment.\Earlier in the week he signed an executive order to return New Jersey to the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program that Christie pulled New Jersey out of in 2012. And his administration announced Tuesday that it plans to withdraw from a multi-state lawsuit intended to block former President Barack Obama's plan to cut power plant emissions."

His book ""Fed Up!"" cites an estimate by the conservative Heritage Foundation of catastrophic job losses from greenhouse gas rules. Perry also refers to Al Gore as ""a false prophet of a secular carbon cult,"" whatever on Earth that means.\Ron Paul says most environmental questions should be resolved through the courts. Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman take the orthodox position: that any new environmental regulations should be put on hold because enacting them would kill jobs.\On Friday, Obama appeared to cede the point. He blocked new EPA rules limiting ground-level ozone -- otherwise known as smog -- as part of a larger effort to reduce ""regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty"" for U.S. businesses. The move came hours after a disappointing labor report showing that the economy added no new jobs in August.\The move to block the ozone rules may make sense politically, since it defuses an issue on which Republicans were prepared to hammer Obama and the Democrats all year. As a matter of public policy, however, it's wrong.\In developing the rule that Obama nixed, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was simply fulfilling the agency's prime mission: protecting human health.\""Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion,"" says the agency's website. ""It can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ground-level ozone also can reduce lung function and inflame the linings of the lungs.

New, more efficient plants are built; older, dirtier facilities are retrofitted. Companies innovate by developing new technology -- ultimately making U.S. industry more competitive.

176,"Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. Well-spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of Obamacare, financial reform and a near-trillion-dollar stimulus that will significantly transform the country.\But spent, nonetheless. There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural.\That's why, as I suggested last week, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next 2 1/2 years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress next January.\Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda.\That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses. It is still possible for the gaffe-happy Republicans to blow it. When the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee publicly apologizes to the corporation that unleashed the worst oil spill in American history, you know the Republicans are capable of just about anything.\But assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-on reforms are dead. Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring).\They could then vote for anything -- including measures they today shun as the midterms approach and their seats are threatened -- because they would have nothing to lose. They would be unemployed. And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.\As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are already looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session. Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes and climate-change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.\Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden. Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission, which conveniently reports by Dec. 1. And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress -- but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.\It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply. To pass in a lame-duck session major legislation so unpopular that Democrats had no chance of passing it in regular session -- after major Democratic losses signifying a withdrawal of the mandate implicitly granted in 2008 -- would be an egregious violation of elementary democratic norms.\Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through a health-care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber -- something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.\How, then, to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress? Bring the issue up now -- applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day. Every current member should be publicly asked: In the event you lose in November -- a remote and deeply deplorable eventuality, but still not inconceivable -- do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?\The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow. Call me naive, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.\Charles Krauthammer is a nationally syndicated columnist."

178,"Most people don't remember Obamacare's notorious Section 1233, mandating government payments for end-of-life counseling. It aroused so much anxiety as a possible first slippery step on the road to state-mandated late-life rationing that the Senate never included it in the final health care law.\Well, it's back -- by administrative fiat. A month ago, Medicare issued a regulation providing for end-of-life counseling during annual ""wellness"" visits. It was all nicely buried amid the simultaneous release of hundreds of new Medicare rules.\Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., author of Section 1233, was delighted.\""Mr. Blumenauer's office celebrated ""a quiet victory' but urged supporters not to crow about it,"" reports The New York Times.\Deathly quiet. In early November, his office sent an e-mail plea to supporters: ""We would ask that you not broadcast this accomplishment out to any of your lists . . . e-mails can too easily be forwarded."" They had been lucky that ""thus far, it seems that no press or blogs have discovered it. . . . The longer this (regulation) goes unnoticed, the better our chances of keeping it.""\So much for Democratic transparency -- and for their repeated claim that the more people learn what is in the health care law, the more they will like it.\Turns out ignorance is the Democrats' best hope. And regulation is their perfect vehicle -- so much quieter than legislation.\Consider two other regulatory usurpations in just the last few days:\On Dec. 23, the Interior Department issued Secretarial Order 3310 reversing a 2003 decision and giving itself the authority to designate public lands as ""Wild Lands."" A clever twofer: (1) a bureaucratic power grab -- for seven years up through Dec. 22, wilderness designation had been the exclusive province of Congress, and (2) a leftward lurch -- more land to be ""protected"" from such nefarious uses as domestic oil exploration in a country disastrously dependent on foreign sources.\The very same day, the president's Environmental Protection Agency declared that in 2011 it would begin drawing up anti-carbon regulations on oil refineries and power plants, another power grab effectively enacting what Congress had firmly rejected when presented as cap-and-trade legislation.\For an Obama bureaucrat, however, the will of Congress is a mere speed bump. Hence this regulatory trifecta, each one moving smartly left -- and nicely clarifying what the spirit of bipartisan compromise that President Barack Obama heralded in his post-lame-duck Dec. 22 news conference was really about: a shift to the center for public consumption and political appearance only.\On that day, Obama finally embraced the tax-cut compromise he had initially excoriated, but only to avoid forfeiting its obvious political benefit -- its appeal to independent voters who demand bipartisanship and are the key to Obama's re-election.\But make no mistake: Obama's initial excoriation in his angry Dec. 7 news conference was the authentic Obama. He hated the deal.\Now as always, Obama's heart lies left. For those fooled into thinking otherwise by the new Obama of Dec. 22, his administration's defiantly liberal regulatory moves -- on the environment, energy and health care -- should disabuse even the most beguiled.\These regulatory power plays make political sense. Because Obama needs to appear to reclaim the center, he will stage his more ideological fights in yawn-inducing regulatory hearings rather than in the dramatic spotlight of congressional debate. How better to impose a liberal agenda on a center-right nation than regulatory stealth?\It's Obama's only way forward during the next two years. He will never get past the half-Republican 112th what he could not get past the overwhelmingly Democratic 111th. He doesn't have the votes and he surely doesn't want the publicity. Hence the quiet resurrection, as it were, of end-of-life counseling.\Obama knows he has only so many years to change the country. In his first two, he achieved much: the first stimulus, Obamacare and financial regulation. For the next two, however, the Republican House will prevent any repetition of that. Obama's agenda will therefore have to be advanced by the more subterranean means of rule-by-regulation.\But this must simultaneously be mixed with ostentatious displays of legislative bipartisanship (e.g., the lame-duck tax-cut deal) in order to pull off the (apparent) centrist repositioning required for re-election.\This, in turn, would grant Obama four more years when, freed from the need for pretense, he can reassert himself ideologically and complete the social-democratic transformation -- begun Jan. 20, 2009; derailed Nov. 2, 2010 -- that is the mission of his presidency.\Charles Krauthammer is a nationally syndicated columnist."

It was critiqued last week at public comment sessions in Newark and Trenton. Those concerned with the state's environment, its fiscal and economic health and quality of life should consider conveying their concerns to the BPU.\The Christie administration has overhauled the master plan. While New Jersey was once a national leader in clean energy use and production - that is, in the creation and use of energy through solar, wind and geothermal sources instead of fossil fuels, its status has dropped considerably during the Christie administration. Whereas the state plan included a goal that 30 percent of the state's energy come from renewable sources by 2020, the Christie administration reduced that goal to 22.5 percent.\According to Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, ""The Energy Master Plan update can help New Jersey become a national leader again in clean energy."" He rattled off some sobering statistics: ""We were second in the nation for solar installations and we're now seventh. We had 10,000 jobs in solar and are down to 5,500. We were seventh in energy efficiency and are now 21st. We were supposed to be the first state in the nation to have offshore wind. Even though five years ago Christie signed the Offshore Economic Development Act and the EMP calls for 3,000 megawatts of wind power, the Christie administration has blocked financing rules for offshore wind.""\""The EMP,"" Tittel suggested, ""can allow us to implement the Global Warming Response Act, which also increases our goals from 80 percent greenhouse gas reduction from electricity by 2050.""\While I agree wholeheartedly with most of Tittel's assertion that the state needs to renew its efforts to rely on clean energy, I would argue against his advocacy for offshore wind farms. Offshore wind farms are popular for three reasons: first, because of stronger winds blowing offshore, they produce more energy than their onshore counterparts. Second, those with a ""not in my back yard"" attitude object to the presence of the wind turbines favor placing them offshore, where they can barely be seen. Third, those who construct offshore wind farms are powerful advocates for offshore construction.\Costs, risks outweigh advantages\But in my view, the costs - both financial and environmental -- associated with offshore farms and the environmental risks far outweigh the aesthetic and efficiency advantages. Today, the cost of constructing an offshore wind turbine exceeds $5 million per megawatt of capacity. A land-based turbine costs about half that -- $2.5 million. In addition, offshore turbines are much costlier to repair than land-based turbines. These high costs make it unlikely that offshore wind farms will be able to produce electricity at competitive prices and will require large government subsidies for the initial installation of the wind turbines and their continued operation.\Despite the high costs associated with the production of energy using offshore wind turbines, it is a flourishing industry, as governments subsidize the offshore energy sector - and investors realize tidy profits derived from government subsidies. Offshore wind farms also have the potential to be enormously destructive to fishing grounds, as the heavy equipment used to install the mills can wreak havoc on fish habitats, both at the site and where hundreds of miles of high voltage cable is laid between the mills and electrical service platforms and to the shore where the energy is harvested. The turbines require lubrication, thus necessitating the transportation of oil to the offshore sites, having the potential for an environmental disaster.\Futuristic\Regarding the aesthetics, one need only drive into Atlantic City via Route 30 to see how lovely these turbines can be - at once both futuristic and yet somehow reminiscent of the past, and certainly more pleasing to the eye than coal or petroleum refineries.\But Tittel is right in his conviction that New Jersey and the BPU can and should be doing much more to reduce New Jersey reliance on dirty and non-renewable energy sources.\He is particularly on target in his criticism of Governor Christie's decision to pull New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, an effort designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions using a cap-and-trade program for emissions from power plants. Tittel argues that pulling out of RGGI cost New Jerseyans 1,800 jobs and $1.25 million in revenue.\""RGGI worked; New Jersey received over $40 million a year and it created over 1,800 jobs. It reduced carbon pollution by 18 million tons. We have to tell the BPU to stop promoting dirty fuels and work towards clean energy and reducing climate change by ramping up their Energy Master Plan,"" he argued.\Citizens who agree that New Jersey should rejoin RGGI, or that greater efforts should be made to increase production and use of clean energy, should feel particularly compelled to voice their views to the BPU.\The final BPU meeting for public comment is Monday at The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey in Galloway from 1-5 p.m. Written public comments my be submitted via email by the close of business on Aug. 24, 2015, to EMPupdate@bpu.state.nj.us."
182,"
There is unprecedented momentum for a real international agreement at the Paris climate talks in December: The U.S. is on track to make significant cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, China has announced a cap-and-trade program and many others have made commitments of their own.

The biggest obstacle? Justice - or at least two ideas about justice.
\
The first involves redistribution. As part of any agreement, poor nations, such as Brazil and India, want wealthier countries to pay them a lot of money, both for scaling back their emissions and for adapting to a warming climate.
\
Their argument has traction. Wealthy nations have agreed, in principle, to provide $100 billion by 2020 to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund. Last year, President Barack Obama pledged to give $3 billion. (Disclosure: My wife, Samantha Power, is the U.S. ambassador to the U.N.) Recently China announced that it would give another $3.1 billion, and Prime Minister David Cameron said that the U. K. would give $8.8 billion. But both Obama and Cameron face significant opposition from their national legislatures - and in Paris, poor nations seem poised to demand far more, perhaps even trillions.
\
Are those demands justified? Rich countries have a lot of poor people too, and they face multiple demands on their budgets. Though developed nations can be spectacularly generous, they are likely to resist giving many billions of additional dollars in foreign aid.
\
But poor countries have a second and perhaps more compelling idea: corrective justice. In particular, they call for ""reparations,"" a term used over the weekend by Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar.
\
Their contention is that rich nations, which created the problem of climate change, have an obligation to fix it, not least by providing compensation for the high costs that, in their view, global warming has already imposed.
\
That isn't entirely crazy, but like other arguments for reparations, it runs into serious objections. For one thing, it depends on notions of collective responsibility. Most people in wealthy nations - whether rich or poor, or whether American or British or German - did not intend, and are not personally responsible for, the harms faced by citizens of India.
\
Much of the current ""stock"" of greenhouse gas emissions was produced by the actions of people who are now dead. The median American was born in 1979. How, exactly, does he or she owe reparations to people now suffering from warmer climates?
\
There is a subtler problem. Through industrial activity, trade and technology, rich countries have conferred big benefits on poor ones, not least in the form of improved health and opportunity.
\
A full accounting might require poor countries to pay the rich ones back for those benefits. No one in rich nations is asking for any form of restitution. (And they shouldn't.) But if we are really interested in measuring who has helping and hurt whom, a claim for reparations puts the issue on the table.
\
It is possible, of course, to combine arguments from redistribution and corrective justice in support of the conclusion that as part of a climate change agreement, wealthy nations should be prepared to meet their $100 billion pledge, or even to add to it. Because emissions from poor nations (including India) are rapidly growing, and because a worldwide agreement requires broad participation, wealthy nations have their own incentive to sweeten the pot.
\
Whether or not the moral arguments of poor nations are convincing, there is a cruel irony. If the economic demands of those nations are exorbitant, they will present serious obstacles to an effective agreement - and if such an agreement cannot be reached, the world's poorest nations will be the world's biggest losers.

183,"Voters will decide Tuesday whether Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno or Democrat Phil Murphy will become New Jersey's 56th governor.\For those still familiarizing themselves with the two major-party candidates, are on the fence or simply want to learn more about where they stand on issues critical to New Jersey's future, here is a brief guide on their positions and who they are.\Name: Kim Guadagno (pronounced Gwa-don-no)\Age: 58\Hometown: Monmouth Beach\Family: Husband, Michael, and children Kevin, 24; Michael, 21; and Anderson, 17.\Education: Political science degree from Ursinus College, 1980; law degree from American University, 1983.\Prior Experience: Lieutenant governor, 2010-present; Monmouth County Sheriff 2007-2010; Monmouth Beach commissioner, 2005-2007; assistant state attorney general, 1999-2001; assistant United States attorney for district of New Jersey, 1991-1999; United States Organized Crime Strike Force in Brooklyn,1988-1991.\Property taxes: Guadagno says lowering property tax bills is her No. 1 priority. She has proposed a property tax ""circuit breaker"" that would provide relief to middle-class homeowners. It would cap the school portion of a property tax bill at 5 percent of a household's income, with a maximum limit of $3,000 in savings. The plan has been widely criticized because it relies on about $1.5 billion in savings and revenue growth at a time when the state is struggling to meet its modest revenue projections. Guadagno says she will make tax relief a priority and find the money.\Taxes: Opposes all tax increases. She has promised that, if elected, she will not run for a second term if she does not lower property taxes.\School Funding: Favors restructuring the school-funding formula. Says extra money going to over-funded school districts should be re-directed to property tax relief, which would prompt a legal challenge. Guadagno says she wants one, because it would require creating a ""full, fleshed-out record"" so political leaders can ""find out what the facts are.""\Marijuana: Favors decriminalizing marijuana but is opposed to legalizing it for recreational use.\Climate change: Guadagno says she is ""not a climate denier."" And as a resident of the Jersey Shore, she said, ""I strongly believe we must protect our environment by leading on things like renewable energy.""\She favors New Jersey re-joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program that Gov. Chris Christie pulled out of, and said the state should ""actively work to grow the green economy to create thousands of good-paying jobs.""\Health care: Guadagno views the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, as a ""disaster."" But she also does not believe the roughly 500,000 people in New Jersey who benefit from the health law should lose coverage. She said Congress must ""pass a plan to ensure people can get their health care, cover pre-existing conditions and lower costs for consumers."" She is against single-payer health care because, she said, it will lead to ""dramatic tax increases, reduce the quality of care and force New Jersey doctors out of business.""\Age: 60\Hometown: Middletown\Family: Wife, Tammy, and children Josh, 19; Emma, 17; Charlie, 15; and Sam, 13.\Education: Economics degree from Harvard University, 1979; masters of business administration from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, 1983.\Prior Experience: U.S. ambassador to Germany, 2009 to 2013; Democratic National Committee finance chairman, 2006-2009; retired from Goldman Sachs in 2003; chaired New Jersey Benefits Task Force, 2005; board member NAACP, 180 Turning Lives Around, 2nd Floor teen helpline; founder policy organizations New Start New Jersey and New Way for New Jersey.\Public bank: Murphy has proposed that New Jersey becomes the second state in the nation to run a bank. North Dakota established its bank a century ago. Murphy's intention is to use the bank as a lending house for low-interest loans to students, businesses and municipalities. That money would then be re-invested in the state rather than companies that have no obligation to spend it here. Murphy's plan has many skeptics, including bankers, who chiefly worry that a state bank would remove liquidity from struggling community banks.\Clean energy: Murphy aims to transition New Jersey to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. He proposes doing so by rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, prioritizing and expanding solar energy, using offshore wind and increasing funding and incentives for energy efficiency.\Taxes: He has said that ""everything's on the table,"" but has committed to raising taxes on high-income earners and taxing the sale of marijuana if it is legalized. He has also said he's open to considering a special tax dedicated to NJ Transit. Murphy's campaign told the Observer that it plans on raising about $1.3 billion a year in new revenue from the taxes.\School Funding: Fully fund the formula established under Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine.\Marijuana: Legalize for recreational use with sales taxed by state.\Climate change: Murphy has proposed a plan for New Jersey to transition to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. Like Guadagno, he would also re-join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. He's been endorsed by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, which calls him the ""clean energy champ.""\Health care: Given the uncertainty in Washington over health care, Murphy has said that all options are on the table, including consideration of a Medicare-for-all system in New Jersey. ""We're going to have to do what it takes,"" he has said. Murphy opposes attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and strip coverage of current Medicaid recipients. He said he intends to restore roughly $7.5 million in annual funding for Planned Parenthood that Christie routinely vetoed, and wants to lower ""excessive"" out-of-network costs that he says would help lower premiums.\CAPTION: \Republican nominee\Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno\AP photos\Democratic nominee\Phil Murphy"
184,"""We think this problem can be solved with a better job of recycling.""\Sal Risalvato Executive directorNew Jersey Gasoline and C-Store Association\A prospective ban or fee for plastic grocery bags — one that would assess a 5-cent per bag charge on shoppers — could represent an early test on just how deep new Gov. Phil Murphy's commitment is to environmental causes.\Environmentalists in New Jersey are hopeful that a new administration and legislative leadership will eliminate plastic bags — which can become a particularly insidious form of pollution in the ocean — from supermarkets, gas stations and corner stores.\But first, somebody has to persuade the skeptical people of New Jersey to rally behind the cause.\""The governor has to lead on this,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. ""I think if he waits for a bill to come through the (legislative) process he may not get a bill he likes. It's important for the governor or his office to be actively involved.""\The Governor's Office declined to comment for this story, but Murphy's election was lauded by environmentalists who for years felt ignored by former Gov. Chris Christie's Administration.\""New Jersey once was a national model for protecting the environment and growing an economy fueled by innovation and ideas. ... We can once again be the state that leads the nation in progressive policies and puts common sense and our residents first in line,"" Murphy said during his inaugural address on Jan. 16. ""We can, and will, stand for the right things.""\The equivalent of one garbage truck worth of plastic is dumped into the ocean every minute, according to a 2016 report by the World Economic Forum and Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We could live in a world with more pounds of plastic in the ocean than fish by 2050.\Plastics, including single-use items like bags, straws and utensils, don't biodegrade, which means they float in the ocean, breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces but never truly disappearing.\Animals, such as sea turtles, mistake plastic bags and pieces as food, which clogs up their digestive systems. This can injure or kill them.\A couple of different versions of a plastic bag ban have been introduced in the New Jersey Legislature since 2016.\The option with the most traction would have placed a 5-cent fee on each plastic bag used by a consumer at a chain store or retailers larger than 2,000 square feet. Seniors and shoppers using food stamps would have been excluded.\The use of plastic bags would have been discontinued on Jan. 1, 2025.\But neither the Assembly or Senate bill made it out of committee, not that the legislation would have had much of a future anyway.\""There was no shot that Governor Christie was ever going to sign anything like this,"" said Sandra Meola, spokeswoman for NY/NJ Baykeeper.\Senate Democrats intend to try the bill again in the new legislative session, according to a spokeswoman for the majority party.\The same entities that opposed the ban before, including both big business like Walmart and small-shop owners, will likely continue to do so.\""Any kind of a fee on the bag or outright ban on the bag, yes, we would oppose it,"" said Sal Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline and C-Store Association, which represents the owners of 1,500 gas and convenience stores in the state. ""We think this problem can be solved with a better job of recycling.""\Will environmentalists have a champion in Murphy in the plastic bag debate?\""I would hope that he would be, given everything else that he's said he would support and do once in office,"" Meola said. ""If he wants New Jersey to be a leader in sustainability and be a leader in clean waterways, this is a way to do that.""\Murphy's embrace of policies that reflect the acceptance of climate change predictions was a central part of his campaign and there is already movement in Trenton on the state rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program aimed at limiting carbon emissions.\Polling shows attitudes toward climate change have changed in New Jersey, with two out of three now believing that rising sea levels represent a ""very serious"" threat to the Jersey Shore.\Meanwhile, the most recent gauge of the public's opinion on a plastic bag ban — a 5-year-old Fairleigh Dickinson PublicMind poll — shows that New Jersey residents were solidly against a plan to charge shoppers 5 cents for every single-use bag.\Just 39 percent of those surveyed said they'd support the passage of a law like that, while 56 percent were opposed.\""Part of it has to be an education program, you need leadership, whether it's the Legislature, the DEP (Department of Environmental Protection) commissioner, or the governor himself, you need to explain why these plastic bags need to be banned,"" Tittel told the Asbury Park Press.\California is the only state to have prohibited plastic bags in most instances, although all Hawaii counties have their own individual bans, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\A few towns in New Jersey, including Long Beach Township, have successfully passed local laws that have either forbidden merchants from offering plastic bags or forced them to charge for their use.\So while he's ""a little more optimistic"" with Murphy charting the course, Surfrider Foundation regional manager John Weber says his focus remains on working with all interested parties.\""We could get a statewide bill on (plastic bags), but we should continue to work on municipalities, on the local level,"" he said. ""Statewide bag legislation does not have a good track record.""\Russ Zimmer: 732-557-5748, razimmer@app.com, @russzimmer\""We think this problem can be solved with a better job of recycling.""\Sal Risalvato Executive directorNew Jersey Gasoline and C-Store Association\CAPTION: \High winds scattered plastic trash bags from a suburban Milwaukee landfill into trees and fences in 2016.\Michael Sears/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"

186," THE BOTTOM-LINE environmental question in electric utility deregulation is this: Will deregulation mean cleaner or dirtier air?\ That's an extremely simplistic summing up of an extremely complicated debate. Enough material has been published on the subject to probably merit its own environmental-impact statement.\ But, in general, environmental groups and states with air- pollution problems fear the worst as the rules change. The chief federal laws governing utility emissions for the past 25 years, the Clean Air Act and its amendments, was engineered to address a system of regional monopolies with state regulators. Grandfathered in - and exempt from some emissions controls - were many coal-fired plants built before 1978 that were expected to be phased out.\ In the new era, utilities can compete nationwide, and there may be more demand to use coal-fired plants. Coal is the cheapest and most plentiful fossil fuel.\ Environmental groups see this likely demand for older coal plants - and the overall potential increase in energy consumption and emissions as power costs drop - as a probable loss for clean air, renewable energy, and energy conservation. Already, according to a new study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, electricity generation from older coal plants has risen 15 percent since wholesale electricity production was deregulated in 1992.\ Natural Resources Defense Council senior scientist Daniel Lashof said many of the older, coal-fired plants are exempt from the toughest air-pollution standards, and other regulatory standards vary. This contradicts ""what industry says is fair competition,"" he said. ""It's not fair competition if different power plants are playing by different rules with respect to how much pollution they emit. That's why [older coal plants] end up with a competitive advantage.""\ As a result, environmental groups are pressing states and Congress for specific environmental protections against increased pollution, financial incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, and federal pollution guidelines to be part of the overall deregulatory effort.\ New Jersey's efforts to bring competition to electricity customers is ""a giant welcome mat for dirty out-of-state coal-fired power plants,"" according to one consumer advocate. John Paul Guinan, an energy advocate at the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Citizen Lobby, noted that since last month, when New Jersey customers for the first time in nearly a century were permitted to purchase power from any supplier, many businesses and industries switched to ""dirty"" power sellers.\ Sixty of New Jersey's largest manufacturing plants recently switched to Allegheny Energy Inc., one of the worst air polluters among power suppliers in the country, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\ Chemical vapors from Allegheny's power plants in the Midwest drift to New Jersey, and, combined with car exhaust, cause smog and acid rain, EPA officials say. Smog and acid rain have been cited as posing health risks to infants, senior citizens, and those with respiratory ailments.\ According to the Department of Environmental Protection, one- third of New Jersey's air pollution originates from out-of-state, primarily the Midwest and South.\ Robert Shinn, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, also expressed concern about an increase in dirtier air. He had urged federal regulators to impose uniform pollution standards on all power generators nationwide, but such rules never passed. Environmentalists wanted all power companies selling in New Jersey to be required to use at least some natural gas and other ""green,"" or clean, energy sources.\ ""The New Jersey energy marketplace has not yet attracted a single `green' energy supplier,"" according to Guinan. ""Although the New Jersey electric marketplace is open for business, the choices are pathetically few. Without clean energy choices and real competition, consumers are being dealt a losing hand.""\ The utility industry, meanwhile, says its studies and those done by others predict little or no increase in air pollution from deregulation. The utility industry will still be heavily regulated under the federal Clean Air Act, even as individual states move forward with deregulation.\ ""Right now there are 19 [Environmental Protection Agency] regulatory programs that are on the books or that are strong possibilities over the next decade"" addressing new and old plants, said Paul Bailey, vice president for environment for the Edison Electric Institute.\ Bailey said utilities believe improvements to the Clean Air Act should be discussed in upcoming reauthorization debates rather than in deregulation legislation.\ For more neutral analysts, the answer to whether the future holds cleaner or dirtier air is ""nobody knows."" The Congressional Research Service says deregulation would tend to tilt in favor of old coal plants, therefore exacerbating pollution. But it adds, ""It is also possible that the economic and environmental advantages of new technology may be sufficient in some cases to overcome the existing plant's advantages.""\ And the CRS says the situation could be mitigated by measures before Congress and the states: ""cap-and-trade"" programs among utilities to prevent increases in pollution levels, ""green pricing"" to encourage consumers to use less polluting sources, and state or federal standards requiring a percentage of electricity coming from renewable, non-polluting sources.\ ""Many in the environmental community are concerned,"" said Dirk Forrister of the Environmental Defense Fund, ""that if you don't pay close attention to the environmental aspects of what you are doing in deregulating, you could end up increasing production from old, dirty power plants that are currently underutilized.\ ""That said, if you do it right, you could meet the prospects of environmental protection and increase the prospect of renewable energy and energy efficiency,"" he continued.\ Sandra Fleishman writes for The Washington Post. This article includes material from Record and wire reports."
187,"In his My View published on Dec. 25, Marvin Smith wrote about what is probably the most important issue of our time: The need to change from fossil fuel to clean energy. It impacts our economy, our foreign policy, environment, global warming, health care and world hunger. In the long term, it threatens the very existence of a livable planet.\We are behind much of the world in the effort to switch to renewable energy, including the use of wind, solar power, geothermal bio-fuels from switch grass and sugar cane and implementing ways to reduce energy use.\President Obama has indicated he will institute programs to move our country toward the solutions. He has expressed a hope that we can be free from purchasing foreign oil by the end of his second term.\Mr. Smith has suggested a $2 a gallon tax on gasoline to create the funds that will be needed. I think it was Al Gore who suggested a 50-cent tax some years ago. I thought it was a great idea then, and I would support it now.\The question is, with the present economy, would the tax be economically wise and could it gain political support? There is a possible alternative. I recently read the forward written for Van Jones' new book, ""The Green Collar Economy."" It was written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He wrote: ""The practice of borrowing a million dollars a day to buy foreign oil has caused the dollar to implode. More than a trillion dollars a year in annual subsidies to oil and gas producers has beggared a nation that four decades ago owned half of the globe's wealth.""\Most experts agree that the choice of corn to create the bio-fuel ethanol was a very bad decision. It uses more energy to create than it produces. The massive switch from other crops to corn has caused food shortages, increased prices and created hunger and food riots in the undeveloped world. Yet we still continue to give massive subsidies to this industry.\Wouldn't it be prudent to take the money that we spend to support the problem and use it to solve the problem?\The oil and coal companies aren't going to stop producing the product because we remove the subsidies. They might increase the price, but so will a tax. It would seem the alternative would be worse -- you would have the subsidies plus a gasoline and a carbon tax.\Let us let the new Obama administration know this is the change we believe in.\Mr. Smith also questions the wisdom of building a new natural gas-fired generator at the Vineland Electric Utility. He raises the question of a carbon tax.\At this point we disagree. It is not an either or question. In the years ahead, it is going to take a smart use of both fossil and renewable energy. President Obama may be able to end our dependence on foreign oil. However, most experts talk in 20- to 50-year time frames for the total elimination of fossil fuels.\The new generation plant is our bridge to a locally green economy. It satisfies the state's demand that we stop burning coal by 2012. It will reduce our present carbon emissions. Natural gas will become more available from domestic wells. It maintains our position on the energy grid. Until we create a way to store large quantities of electricity, and until the nation develops the new smart grid, it gives us a dependable source of power when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. Additionally, if Congress chooses the cap and trade system, which worked well for the acid rain problem, instead of a carbon tax, we would have credits to sell.\We need to develop programs to aid homes and businesses to reduce energy use with insulation, efficient windows and to update heating systems, air conditioners and appliances to new energy-efficient units.\The utility could look at ways to develop partnerships with home and business owners to install solar and wind units. This would provide clean energy to the owner and give extra energy to the utility.\We need to install the new smart meters that charge lower prices when the demand is low. This would encourage customers to save by running washers, dryers and dishwashers during periods of low demand.\We need to be working with local banks, businesses, contractors, unions, suppliers, store owners, Cumberland County College and the Technical Education Center to make sure the jobs and revenues created stay in the community.\Finally, we should be seeking out the federal and state grants that are and will be available to communities to do these things.\Vineland Mayor Romano is promoting citizen participation. He has created committees for human relations, special events, a welcome home committee, youth council and one to plan the city's 150th anniversary.\There should be a sixth committee. It should be composed of leading members of all segments of our community. It should be charged with looking at what is being done in other communities and how their initiatives could be applied locally. They should design and present a green economy program best suited for Vineland's needs.\It would not be easy. However, with thought and effort, we can be one of the communities that take advantage of the changes that are surely coming. Changes not just for right now, but changes for better lives for our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\Charles A. Biddinger\Vineland"
188,"Gov. Phil Murphy will not be able to make his ambitious clean energy goals if he fails to stop 12 fossil fuel projects from moving forward, according to a report issued Wednesday by a coalition of environmental groups.\Advocates say four proposed power plants along with eight pipelines and other natural gas infrastructure would increase New Jersey's greenhouse gas output by 30 percent and would derail Murphy's efforts to power the state by renewable energy by mid-century.\""You can't get to 100 percent renewable by 2050 by building more power plants and pipelines,"" said Amy Goldsmith, state director of Clean Water Action. ""You can't build a single one of these projects and hope to achieve these goals.""\Among the projects are a power plant in the Meadowlands to produce electricity to New York, two pipelines through the protected Pinelands, a pipeline under Raritan Bay and New York Harbor to Queens and a pipeline from Pennsylvania through Central Jersey.\Those projects continue a decades-long trend in New Jersey, which saw pipelines and other infrastructure built to move an abundant supply of gas fracked in northern Pennsylvania to a large swath of customers in the Northeast.\Murphy inherited almost all of these projects from the pro-fossil fuel Christie administration. But Murphy came into office last year championing an environmental agenda to transition New Jersey's energy production to wind and solar power.\Alexandra Altman, a Murphy spokeswoman, said the governor ""has directed his team to take a hard look at energy infrastructure projects as part of an updated Energy Master Plan, which will focus on renewable energy and shift away from outdated energy sources.""\Over the past year, Murphy has made moves to reduce the state's contribution to global warming by rejoining a regional cap and trade system and laying the groundwork to build one of the nation's largest offshore wind farms - a project that has been stalled for at least a decade.\His aggressive clean energy mandate requires 50 percent of all electricity sold in the state to come from renewable sources by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050.\But advocates say his efforts will be in vain unless he takes a strong stand against the natural gas industry, which generated 58 percent of electricity in New Jersey as of October. Only 3.5 percent came from renewable sources.\The four power plants plus a recently completed PSEG plant in Woodbridge would spike carbon dioxide and methane emissions from New Jersey's power plants by 76 percent, according to the report.\""It's kind of scary that no one until now has done the basic math around these cumulative impacts or shared it,"" said Ken Dolsky of the Don't Gas the Meadowlands Coalition and a primary author of the report. ""Our research shows building these gas projects would make it impossible to achieve Governor Murphy's objectives.""\Dolsky and other members of a coalition called Empower New Jersey held a rally in Trenton on Wednesday calling for Murphy to pass a moratorium to halt progress on the dozen projects.\Governors have issued moratoriums to stop environmental threats in the past such as Gov. Brendan Byrne stopping development in the Pinelands and Gov. Jim Florio barring the construction of trash incinerators.\Such action is needed if Murphy wants to jump-start New Jersey clean energy businesses, advocates said.\""The lost opportunity for the investment in renewable clean energy during the 30, 40 year lifespan of these projects will never be regained when we need it most,"" said Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of Delaware Riverkeeper Network.\Here are a dozen new power plant, pipeline and other fossil fuel infrastructure projects either proposed or in various stages of permitting that are cited in the report.\POWER PLANTS\North Bergen Liberty Generating Station (Meadowlands): A 1,200 megawatt gas-fired power plant proposed for North Bergen.\Phoenix Energy Center (aka Highlands Power Plant - Hunterdon County): A 663 megawatt power plant on the site of a former paper mill on the Musconetcong River.\BL England (Cape May County): A 447-megawatt natural-gas power plant that would replace an existing coal-fired unit.\Keasbey Energy Center (Middlesex County): Competitive Power Ventures is seeking approval to build another natural-gas plant next to its existing 725-megawatt Woodbridge Energy Center.\PIPELINES, COMPRESSOR STATIONS\Rivervale South to Market (Meadowlands): A Williams project approved by federal officials to build a half-mile natural gas pipeline in the Meadowlands and upgrade existing pipes to carry more fuel.\Gateway Expansion Project (Essex County): Williams Transco would build a new 33,000 horsepower compressor station next to an existing one near the Passaic River.\PennEast Pipeline (Mercer County): The proposed 118-mile pipeline would cross the Delaware River and terminate at Transco's pipeline interconnection near Pennington.\Williams' Northeast Supply Enhancement compressor stations (Somerset and Middlesex Counties and Raritan Bay): The project will add 37 miles of new pipeline and new compression to the existing Transco pipeline system from Middlesex County under Raritan Bay to Queens.\Cape Atlantic Reliability Project (aka South Jersey Gas Pipeline) (Pinelands): The 22-mile pipeline would extend from Cumberland County to Cape May County.\Southern Reliability Link (Pinelands): A 28-mile natural gas pipeline through portions of Burlington and Ocean Counties.\Garden State Expansion Project (Burlington County): A new compressor station in Bordentown that has been built but won't be in service until the Southern Reliability Link pipeline is constructed.\Lambertville East Expansion (Mercer County): A plan to replace replace two existing compressor units and expand capacity.\The coalition includes environmental groups Clean Water Action, Blue Wave NJ, Delaware Riverkeeper Network, Environment New Jersey, Food & Water Watch, NJ Sierra Club and Don't Gas the Meadowlands Coalition.\Email: fallon@northjersey.com\CREDIT: Scott Fallon"
189,"A prospective ban or fee for plastic grocery bags – one that would assess a 5-cent per bag charge on shoppers – could represent an early test on just how deep new Gov. Phil Murphy's commitment is to environmental causes.\Environmentalists in New Jersey are hopeful that a new administration and legislative leadership will eliminate plastic bags – which can become a particularly insidious form of pollution in the ocean – from supermarkets, gas stations and corner stores.\But first, somebody has to convince the skeptical people of New Jersey to rally behind the cause.\""The governor has to lead on this,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. ""I think if he waits for a bill to come through the (legislative) process he may not get a bill he likes. It's important for the governor or his office to be actively involved.""\The Governor's Office declined to comment for this story, but Murphy's election was lauded by environmentalists who for years felt ignored by former Gov. Chris Christie's administration.\""New Jersey once was a national model for protecting the environment and growing an economy fueled by innovation and ideas. ... We can once again be the state that leads the nation in progressive policies and puts common sense and our residents first in line,"" Murphy said during his inaugural address on Jan. 16. ""We can, and will, stand for the right things.""\The equivalent of one garbage truck worth of plastic is dumped into the ocean every minute, according to a 2016 report by the World Economic Forum and Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We could live in a world with more pounds of plastic in the ocean than fish by 2050.\Plastics, including single-use items like bags, straws and utensils, don't biodegrade, which means they float in the ocean, breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces but never truly disappearing.\Animals, such as sea turtles, mistake plastic bags and pieces as food, which clogs up their digestive systems. This can injure or kill them.\A couple of different versions of a plastic bag ban have been introduced in the New Jersey Legislature since 2016.\The option with the most traction would have placed a 5-cent fee on each plastic bag used by a consumer at a chain store or retailers larger than 2,000 square feet. Seniors and shoppers using food stamps would have been excluded.\The use of plastic bags would have been discontinued on Jan. 1, 2025.\But neither the Assembly or Senate bill made it out of committee, not that the legislation would have had much of a future anyway.\""There was no shot that Governor Christie was ever going to sign anything like this,"" said Sandra Meola, spokeswoman for NY/NJ Baykeeper.\Senate Democrats intend to try the bill again in the new legislative session, according to a spokeswoman for the majority party.\The same entities that opposed the ban before, including both big business like Walmart and small shop owners, will likely continue to do so.\""Any kind of a fee on the bag or outright ban on the bag, yes, we would oppose it,"" said Sal Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline and C-Store Association, which represents the owners of 1,500 gas and convenience stores in the state. ""We think this problem can be solved with a better job of recycling.""\Will environmentalists have a champion in Murphy in the plastic bag debate?\""I would hope that he would be, given everything else that he's said he would support and do once in office,"" Meola said. ""If he wants New Jersey to be a leader in sustainability and be a leader in clean waterways. this is a way to do that.""\Murphy's embrace of policies that reflect the acceptance of climate change predictions was a central part of his campaign and there is already movement in Trenton on the state rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program aimed at limiting carbon emissions.\Polling shows attitudes toward climate change have changed in New Jersey, with two out of three now believing that rising sea levels represent a ""very serious"" threat to the Jersey Shore.\Meanwhile, the most recent gauge of the public's opinion on a plastic bag ban – a 5-year-old Fairleigh Dickinson PublicMind poll – shows that New Jersey residents were solidly against a plan to charge shoppers 5 cents for every single-use bag.\Just 39 percent of those surveyed said they'd support the passage of a law like that, while 56 percent were opposed.\""Part of it has to be an education program, you need leadership, whether it's the Legislature, the DEP (Department of Environmental Protection) commissioner, or the governor himself, you need to explain why these plastic bags need to be banned,"" Tittel told the Asbury Park Press.\California is the only state to have prohibited plastic bags in most instances, although all Hawaii counties have their own individual bans, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\A few towns in New Jersey, including Long Beach Township, have successfully passed local laws that have either forbidden merchants from offering plastic bags or forced them to charge for their use.\So while he's ""a little more optimistic"" with Murphy charting the course, Surfrider Foundation regional manager John Weber says his focus remains on working with all interested parties.\""We could get a statewide bill on (plastic bags), but we should continue to work on municipalities, on the local level,"" he said. ""Statewide bag legislation does not have a good track record.""\Russ Zimmer: 732-557-5748, razimmer@app.com, @russzimmer\More online\Search ""plastic bags"" at APP.com to vote in our poll on whether you would support paying for plastic bags.\CAPTION: \Jack McKee of Bradley Beach pushes his grocery cart of groceries packed in recycled plastic bags at Wegmans in Ocean Township.\Tanya Breen/Staff Photographer\High winds scattered plastic trash bags from a suburban Milwaukee landfill into trees and fences in 2016.\Michael Sears/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"

She has proposed a property tax ""circuit breaker"" that would provide relief to middle-class homeowners. It would cap the school portion of a property tax bill at 5 percent of a household's income, with a maximum limit of $3,000 in savings. The plan has been widely criticized because it relies on about $1.5 billion in savings and revenue growth at a time when the state is struggling to meet its modest revenue projections. Guadagno says she will make tax relief a priority and find the money.\Taxes: Opposes all tax increases. She has promised that, if elected, she will not run for a second term if she does not lower property taxes.\School Funding: Favors restructuring the school-funding formula. Says extra money going to over-funded school districts should be re-directed to property tax relief, which would prompt a legal challenge. Guadagno says she wants one, because it would require creating a ""full, fleshed-out record"" so political leaders can ""find out what the facts are.""\Marijuana: Favors decriminalizing marijuana but is opposed to legalizing it for recreational use.\Climate change: Guadagno says she is ""not a climate denier.""

She said Congress must ""pass a plan to ensure people can get their health care, cover pre-existing conditions and lower costs for consumers.""

That money would then be re-invested in the state rather than companies that have no obligation to spend it here. Murphy's plan has many skeptics, including bankers, who chiefly worry that a state bank would remove liquidity from struggling community banks.\Clean energy: Murphy aims to transition New Jersey to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. He proposes doing so by rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, prioritizing and expanding solar energy, using offshore wind and increasing funding and incentives for energy efficiency.\Taxes: He has said that ""everything's on the table,"" but has committed to raising taxes on high-income earners and taxing the sale of marijuana if it is legalized.

196,"""Any kind of a fee on the bag or outright ban on the bag, yes, we would oppose it.""\Sal Risalvato\Executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline and C-Store Association\A prospective ban or fee for plastic grocery bags – one that would assess a 5-cent per bag charge on shoppers – could represent an early test on just how deep new Gov. Phil Murphy's commitment is to environmental causes.\Environmentalists in New Jersey are hopeful that a new administration and legislative leadership will eliminate plastic bags – which can become a particularly insidious form of pollution in the ocean – from supermarkets, gas stations and corner stores.\But first, somebody has to convince the skeptical people of New Jersey to rally behind the cause.\""The governor has to lead on this,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. ""I think if he waits for a bill to come through the (legislative) process he may not get a bill he likes. It's important for the governor or his office to be actively involved.""\The Governor's Office declined to comment for this story, but Murphy's election was lauded by environmentalists who for years felt ignored by former Gov. Chris Christie's administration.\""New Jersey once was a national model for protecting the environment and growing an economy fueled by innovation and ideas. ... We can once again be the state that leads the nation in progressive policies and puts common sense and our residents first in line,"" Murphy said during his inaugural address on Jan. 16. ""We can, and will, stand for the right things.""\The equivalent of one garbage truck worth of plastic is dumped into the ocean every minute, according to a 2016 report by the World Economic Forum and Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We could live in a world with more pounds of plastic in the ocean than fish by 2050.\Plastics, including single-use items like bags, straws and utensils, don't biodegrade, which means they float in the ocean, breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces but never truly disappearing.\Animals, such as sea turtles, mistake plastic bags and pieces as food, which clogs up their digestive systems. This can injure or kill them.\A couple of different versions of a plastic bag ban have been introduced in the New Jersey Legislature since 2016.\The option with the most traction would have placed a 5-cent fee on each plastic bag used by a consumer at a chain store or retailers larger than 2,000 square feet. Seniors and shoppers using food stamps would have been excluded.\The use of plastic bags would have been discontinued on Jan. 1, 2025.\But neither the Assembly or Senate bill made it out of committee, not that the legislation would have had much of a future anyway.\""There was no shot that Governor Christie was ever going to sign anything like this,"" said Sandra Meola, spokeswoman for NY/NJ Baykeeper.\Senate Democrats intend to try the bill again in the new legislative session, according to a spokeswoman for the majority party.\The same entities that opposed the ban before, including both big business like Walmart and small-shop owners, will likely continue to do so.\""Any kind of a fee on the bag or outright ban on the bag, yes, we would oppose it,"" said Sal Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline and C-Store Association, which represents the owners of 1,500 gas and convenience stores in the state. ""We think this problem can be solved with a better job of recycling.""\Will environmentalists have a champion in Murphy in the plastic bag debate?\""I would hope that he would be, given everything else that he's said he would support and do once in office,"" Meola said. ""If he wants New Jersey to be a leader in sustainability and be a leader in clean waterways, this is a way to do that.""\Murphy's embrace of policies that reflect the acceptance of climate change predictions was a central part of his campaign and there is already movement in Trenton on the state rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program aimed at limiting carbon emissions.\Polling shows attitudes toward climate change have changed in New Jersey, with two out of three now believing that rising sea levels represent a ""very serious"" threat to the Jersey Shore.\Meanwhile, the most recent gauge of the public's opinion on a plastic bag ban – a 5-year-old Fairleigh Dickinson PublicMind poll – shows that New Jersey residents were solidly against a plan to charge shoppers 5 cents for every single-use bag.\Just 39 percent of those surveyed said they'd support the passage of a law like that, while 56 percent were opposed.\""Part of it has to be an education program, you need leadership, whether it's the Legislature, the DEP (Department of Environmental Protection) commissioner, or the governor himself, you need to explain why these plastic bags need to be banned,"" Tittel told the Asbury Park Press.\California is the only state to have prohibited plastic bags in most instances, although all Hawaii counties have their own individual bans, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\A few towns in New Jersey, including Long Beach Township, have successfully passed local laws that have either forbidden merchants from offering plastic bags or forced them to charge for their use. So while he's ""a little more optimistic"" with Murphy charting the course, Surfrider Foundation regional manager John Weber says his focus remains on working with all interested parties.\""We could get a statewide bill on (plastic bags), but we should continue to work on municipalities, on the local level,"" he said. ""Statewide bag legislation does not have a good track record.""\Russ Zimmer: 732-557-5748, razimmer@app.com, @russzimmer\""Any kind of a fee on the bag or outright ban on the bag, yes, we would oppose it.""\Sal Risalvato\Executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline and C-Store Association\CAPTION: \Jack McKee of Bradley Beach pushes his grocery cart of groceries packed in recycled plastic bags at Wegmans in Ocean Township.\Tanya Breen/Staff Photographer"

They could help reverse a recent decline in bus ridership.\State officials would provide legal help to people facing eviction or foreclosure to bring down the rate of foreclosures, which is currently the highest in the nation.\Murphy would reinstate the Senior Deputy Commissioner of Housing and the statewide Commission on Housing through executive action and incentivize housing production to meet the need for affordable homes.\New Jersey communities would combine homeless programs to use funds more efficiently. Homeless Trust Fund programs would be expanded to provide money to cover gaps in services and give additional funding for shelters or emergency assistance.

Such assistance also could apply to people who don't qualify for unemployment insurance, such as Uber and Lyft drivers and other participants in the ""gig"" economy.\State government also would identify key areas for economic growth — such as logistics, life sciences, technology and renewable energy — and target incentives to businesses in those areas rather than granting massive tax breaks.\The state also would work to attract more foreign investment in its companies.\Murphy's administration would end surprise out-of-network bills, restore funds for family planning to the state budget, and preserve and improve the insurance gains made under the Affordable Care Act.\The state would lead efforts — defunded by the Trump Administration — to boost enrollment in Obamacare plans and Medicaid. It would explore the potential for ""incentives"" and ""shared responsibility"" payments to encourage individuals and businesses to have health coverage. And it would look into holding premiums down through creation of a state reinsurance program.\The governor would direct attention to the social determinants of health, such as housing, education and employment, with the goal of addressing the ""systemic racism and discrimination"" that leads New Jersey to have the nation's highest gap between black and white infant-mortality rates and other markers of racial disparity.\CAPTION: \Gov.

Murphy was sworn in Jan. 16.\The governor, who hand picked the committees, is under no obligation to implement or even accept the recommendations, which read like a wish-list for a utopian vision of New Jersey.\""Short-sighted decisions based on what could happen in the next election have left many New Jersey agencies without strategies that ensure the state's competitiveness and viability in the 21st century, but the era of ad-hoc policy making is over in New Jersey,"" Murphy said in a statement accompanying the reports. ""We have thoroughly reviewed the transition reports and have already started acting on some of the recommendations. ""\Many of the reports recap pledges Murphy made during the campaign, such as raising the state minimum wage to $15 an hour and legalizing marijuana for recreational use. Others paint a more idyllic vision for New Jersey, where tech startups flourish in vacant buildings, technology makes trains run on time, and health consumers are protected from high out-of-pocket charges for emergencies.\Here are some highlights:\The Gateway rail tunnel and the Port Authority Bus Terminal expansion would be top priorities, with a high-level gubernatorial aide in charge of making them happen.\An emergency manager would improve the relationship between NJ Transit and Amtrak and serve as a voice for the state's interests.\NJ Transit's executive director would review the factors that have led to the agency's decline, including the performance of upper management and the large number of vacancies of critical jobs.\NJ Transit and the state Department of Transportation would consider more bus rapid transit projects. With dedicated lanes, less frequent stops and off-board fare collection, rapid buses mimic trains but at less cost. They could help reverse a recent decline in bus ridership.\State officials would provide legal help to people facing eviction or foreclosure to bring down the rate of foreclosures, which is currently the highest in the nation.\Murphy would reinstate the Senior Deputy Commissioner of Housing and the statewide Commission on Housing through executive action and incentivize housing production to meet the need for affordable homes.\New Jersey communities would combine homeless programs to use funds more efficiently. Homeless Trust Fund programs would be expanded to provide money to cover gaps in services and give additional funding for shelters or emergency assistance. The ultimate goal would be to end homeless in the state.\New Jersey would rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program by New England and mid-Atlantic states to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. Early in his tenure Christie pulled New Jersey out of the group.\Offshore wind farms would help Murphy realize his goal of all of New Jersey's energy coming from renewable sources by 2050.\The state would take it's portion of the recent Volkswagen settlement money to ""serve as a springboard for the electrification of the state's transportation system.""\New Jersey would look at budget challenges over a longer horizon, rather than simply managing year-by-year, and would put more money into its rainy day fund.\The state would raise revenues by legalizing and taxing marijuana for recreational use, by raising the income tax on people who earn $1 million or more, and by ending the ability of multi-state corporations to claim lower tax rates in other states if they're located in New Jersey.\New Jersey would support federal legislation to apply sales taxes to purchases by residents to companies that have no physical presence in the state.\The state would harness technology to more efficiently deliver services to residents, while reviewing all state programs to make sure they're still necessary and well-run.\The state pension system also would revisit the practice of paying Wall Street managers to invest its assets, which carried $659 million in fees in 2016, up from $125 million in 2009.\The state would improve services to unemployed residents by pairing them with job coaches, rather than simply providing unemployment insurance. Such assistance also could apply to people who don't qualify for unemployment insurance, such as Uber and Lyft drivers and other participants in the ""gig"" economy.\State government also would identify key areas for economic growth — such as logistics, life sciences, technology and renewable energy — and target incentives to businesses in those areas rather than granting massive tax breaks.\The state also would work to attract more foreign investment in its companies.\Murphy's administration would end surprise out-of-network bills, restore funds for family planning to the state budget, and preserve and improve the insurance gains made under the Affordable Care Act.\The state would lead efforts — defunded by the Trump Administration — to boost enrollment in Obamacare plans and Medicaid. It would explore the potential for ""incentives"" and ""shared responsibility"" payments to encourage individuals and businesses to have health coverage. And it would look into holding premiums down through creation of a state reinsurance program.\The governor would direct attention to the social determinants of health, such as housing, education and employment, with the goal of addressing the ""systemic racism and discrimination"" that leads New Jersey to have the nation's highest gap between black and white infant-mortality rates and other markers of racial disparity.\The state would fully fund public schools under its funding formula, put a pause on creating new charter schools, expand vocational-technical education and reduce the role of standardized tests in the classroom.\The state also would expand its Tuition Aid Grant and Educational Opportunity Fund programs to make college more affordable while moving New Jersey toward offering free tuition at community colleges.\New Jersey would create incentives for winegrowers in a Coastal Plains Wine Corridor, help farmers manage the herd of deer that prey on their crops, and provide low-interest loans to farmers for measures that reduce pollution.\The state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs would split into two separate agencies, one responsible for the National Guard and the other for veterans.\The state would work to ease the transition of prisoners back into society to reduce the rate of recidivism, which currently is 70 percent. The state would explore and in some cases lift barriers to reintegration such as driver's license suspensions, employment restrictions, bars to certain professional licenses, and access to government assistance, including housing.\Staff reporters Curtis Tate, Megan Burrow, James O'Neill, Lindy Washburn and Nick Pugliese contributed to this report."

206,"'Listen to right-wing America'\I'm fed up with Republicans usurping 33 percent of The Record's opinion page with right-wing propaganda (""We want change, but reasoned change,"" Other Views, Oct. 5).\Listen to right-wing America. It's against all blacks, Hispanics, gays, unions, government employees, welfare, abortion rights, unemployment benefits, minimum wage laws, rebates to poor seniors and the disabled, a tax freeze for seniors, equal pay for women, libraries, school lunches for poor kids, sex education in schools, evolution taught in schools, public schools, stem cell research, medical marijuana, aid to the developmentally impaired, the blind, the disabled and any and all social programs that do not benefit its members directly.\Its proponents favor unrestricted gun ownership and love war (provided they don't have to go). They like tax breaks for the rich because they may hit the lotto and because the rich create jobs, even if they're in China or India.\They don't want the government regulating corporations, banks, the environment or anything. They hate that Muslim, Hitler, Socialist, Kenya-born, black Obama, and they want him to fail. They think Sarah Palin is beautiful, and they love Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. They believe we should name everything after Ronald ""the government is the problem!"" Reagan.\Johnnie Najarian\River Edge, Oct. 5\*\Christie Whitman says fury and betrayal are not coherent values on which to found public policy (""We want change, but reasoned change,"" Other Views, Oct. 5). What the heck was the American Revolution about?\Anyway, let me get this straight: I am to take a values course from a person who vetoed a bill that outlawed partial birth abortions as governor in 1999? Oh how sweet it is.\Mike Castle is reasonable and a fiscal conservative? I guess being a wishy-washy, middle-of-the-road, reach-across-party-lines, see-both-sides-of-the-issue ""moderate,"" as our former governor is explains her description of Castle. It is precisely this thinking from these intellectuals that got us TARP and cap and trade. Whitman says fiscal conservative; I say a typical liberal who spends our hard-earned money.\She extols Castle's virtues, then rips Christine O'Donnell. She says O'Donnell has no credentials and can't manage her finances. Well, at least she didn't mismanage the finances of how many teachers in New Jersey by mismanagement of the public pension fund.\Whitman says O'Donnell's views are out of step with the mainstream. So, cutting spending, limiting government regulation and bureaucracy and cutting taxes are not in the mainstream.\Whitman laments: ""Even if she wins how will she work with people across the aisle."" Wake up. This is what working across the aisle means: getting the Republicans to do what the Democrats want.\Whitman says gridlock born of extremism is not going to produce solutions. So, adhering to our Constitution, empowering the individual and pursuing liberty and freedom through personal responsibility is extreme?\Wow.\And I thought frisking a black youth for no good reason was the definition of extreme.\David Cavalluzzo\Hackensack, Oct. 6\*\I'm not a Tea Party member, but the answer to ""A question for Tea Party"" (Your Views, Oct. 2), although not simple, is obvious. The original Tea Party's eventual answers to the question of ""Now what?"" were the Declaration of Independence, the War for Independence and the U.S. Constitution, which set the stage for the creation of the greatest nation on Earth: just, compassionate, lawful and entrepreneurial.\These qualities are fraying because we've put expediency before character, votes before just government and self-interest before the interest of the nation as a whole.\Before anyone can solve a problem, there must be recognition that there is one. We must uncover the reasons behind them and remove those reasons. Then policy questions can be practically answered, so long as they are constructed from a standpoint that's just, compassionate, lawful and ""liberal"" in regard to letting people make their own ways in life and business without government interference.\Gerald Wisz\Garfield, Oct. 2\*\With disgust, I read that the income gap between the richest and poorest Americans grew last year to its largest margin ever (""Other census findings,"" Page A-13, Sept. 29) and Republican are outspending Democrats on TV ads by a 6-1 margin (""GOP groups outspend Democrats on ads,"" Page A-6, Sept. 28).\This is what 40 years of right-wing propaganda has wrought.\President Nixon went to China and provided opportunity for corporations and rich investors while ultimately forcing the American middle class to compete against slave-wage workers. Then, President Reagan attacked the labor movement and helped prop up corporate profits.\The right wing always blames government claiming it is too big. Then, after their deficit spending and inept legislation, they make the American middle-class bailout the ""too big to fail"" right-wing elite. Legislation and tax codes do redistribute wealth, and for 40 years the greedy have made fools of the working middle class.\During the 1950s the top marginal income tax rate on the super rich was more than 90 percent, and they reinvested in the American economy and worker. Today, the right-wing elite pay less tax because it invested in Congress.\Daniel Buckley\Lodi, Sept. 28\*\It pays to analyze the right's policy agenda, particularly the Republican Party's ""Pledge to America."" It really is an old shirt turned inside-out and called new.\The pledge condemns federal debt 16 times but proposes to make the Bush tax cuts for the rich permanent. It hints at fewer national parks, no more Small Business Administration loans, no more Medicaid, child health or nutrition programs and no more homeland security. Later, the Republicans will tackle Social Security and the new health care additions.\It should come as no surprise that Republicans oppose any or all of President Obama's ideas for the economy and unemployment because if those measures worked it would greatly embarrass and undermine all Republican arguments. That would not bode well in the next presidential election.\How can anyone ignore the fact that billionaires and high financiers head the Tea Party? How can one believe that they are interested in the middle class' welfare when the middle class is being nudged into the poverty zone?\Republicans' behavior -- twittering while the president speaks, calling him a liar during a speech -- fortifies my opinion that they are bent on demeaning a man who is for the middle class, for children's education, for the returning vet, and for better health care. They are busy creating divisions; the president is anxious to unite. But that's what the Tea Party is all about -- division.\Phyllis Sembos\Emerson, Sept. 26\*\Regarding ""Old-style campaigning suits Pascrell just fine"" (Page A-1, Oct. 4):\Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, claims that he ""said to the Tea Party early on, you're fighting against big government, what would you have done? Would you have recommended to President Bush not to bail out these banks and let the whole thing crash and do nothing? What would you have done? I never got an answer.""\Never got an answer? How might Pascrell propose that we ought to have let him know our numerous answers?\Perhaps we could have shown up at his shamefully all-too-infrequent town hall meetings. Maybe we could hosted giant rallies in several New Jersey locations and in Washington, D.C., on a regular basis. Perhaps pollsters could ask us our opinions and report them in hundreds of different media outlets. Of course, my fellow tea partiers and I did all these things -- and Pascrell makes it abundantly clear that he doesn't care about what we have to say.\Mark Kalinowski\Clifton, Oct. 6\The ARC tunnel and Christie\In the spring, Governor Christie went on the warpath against our children in the name of taking down the teachers union. His aggressive campaign against approving school budgets has led to thousands of teachers losing their jobs and jeopardizes the future of our children.\Thursday, he killed the thousands of jobs that were being created by the digging of a new rail tunnel under the Hudson. His shortsighted decision will lead to more crowded streets and highways and more auto and truck pollution.\Instead of building for the future, Christie is content to operate in the short term. The question is: What will Christie do next to kill jobs, damage our future and lower the quality of life in New Jersey? I can't answer that question beyond guaranteeing that there will be something, and it'll probably happen soon.\Roger Berkley\Woodcliff Lake, Oct. 7\*\I am appalled by ""Christie shoots down tunnel project"" (Page A-1, Oct. 8). It is so one-sided and typical of your paper's political philosophy. Instead of just reciting a list of potential people who may suffer, including, of all things, those whose property values might go up, you might have also attempted to list the consequences of cost overruns if Governor Christie had not acted.\I commend Christie for taking into account the fiscal impact of probable, not only potential, cost overruns on New Jersey's finances. Fortunately, New Jersey can't print money like the federal government. Guess who would wind up paying for overruns? We taxpayers from all over New Jersey.\Richard W. Rudmann\Elmwood Park, Oct. 8\*\Everyone talks and writes about how to stop bullying. Why don't we start at the top with Governor Christie? With him it's, ""My way of the highway."" He's turned out to be the biggest bully of them all. It's getting to the point where the more I read about his shenanigans, the more I regret having voted for him.\Anne Reynolds\Oradell, Oct. 8\*\I recoiled at the news that Governor Christie wants to scrap the ARC tunnel project which, incidentally, would save me over an hour per day on my round-trip commute.\My wife always tells me to listen to her because, as she says, she's always right. She voted for former Gov. Jon Corzine. I voted for Christie. My wife is right again.\Abraham Weintraub\Fair Lawn, Oct. 7\*\Governor Christie's decision to block the building of a new commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River is grounds at least for a public vote on the project.\This is a blunder of epic proportions. Christie may think he's being ""bold,"" but in fact his decision is cowardly.\The Governor says we're ""broke."" Yet he won't raise the gas tax a penny a gallon, which would raise $50 million annually. He won't raise taxes on the top 1 percent.\It will stunt growth in the state. It will kill jobs and it is exactly the wrong thing to do now. We are coming out of this economic downturn. We cannot afford not to build this tunnel.\Our rail system needs upgrading. Our roads, bridges and tunnels are both antiquated and operating far beyond their capacities now.\For pessimists who saw a bleak future, this decision offers affirmation. For those who see bright signs, this decision dims them.\This man is now an official disaster. Let's get rid of him. Don't think only Tea Party types are fed up.\Michael Fremer\Wyckoff, Oct. 7\Taxpayers are Pequannock's bank\The Pequannock Township Council decided a number of years ago to buy out the homes along the river and pay the market value to their owners through the Open Space program. This was a good thing for residents who owned homes along the river; however, it also resulted in lost tax revenue for the township, which will tap the remaining taxpayers for the lost revenue.\""Little Falls gets $5.9M to elevate flood-prone homes"" (Page L-1, Oct. 2) reported on how Little Falls created a mitigation plan that made the township eligible for federal grants. Due to its efforts, Little Falls received a $5.9 million grant to elevate 34 homes in the flood zone.\Why the Pequannock Township Council couldn't have created a mitigation plan as well is beyond comprehension. Apparently, the township's elected officials had no knowledge of such an undertaking. All they know how to do is go to the bank and spend, spend, spend our tax money. After all, we the taxpayers are their bank.\Henry L. Samek\Pompton Plains, Oct. 3\The writer, a former Pequannock mayor, ran unsuccessfully as an independent in 2008 for a seat on the Township Council.\Public pays price of presidential visit\I am still quite disturbed by President Obama visiting Cresskill for a fund raiser at a big-shot resident's home for one hour.\He will be flying into Newark and leaving via Air Force One along with its dummy twin and four or five Marine helicopters. I understand it costs taxpayers at least $2.5 million any time Air Force One goes anywhere. For days, dozens of Secret Service and state police vehicles will turn Cresskill upside down; his limo will wait in the firehouse, and the Secret Service will take over the police station.\I learned from a chat with Cresskill's mayor that the visit will cost the borough and state well over $50,000. The mayor was not among the guests at the gathering.\This is disgusting. I don't even think Wall Street would do something like this. But who am I to say anything. I just give the federal government 40 percent of my hard-earned money.\Silly me.\Doug Daniele\Paramus, Oct. 6\*\We already know The Record leans to the left. But the way you framed the news about President Obama on Oct. 7 was really a disservice to your journalistic credibility.\Your lead story is "" Obama visit boosts party war chest"" (Page A-1) about the president's visit to a Cresskill home to rally Democrats.

207,"On free speech and right to bear arms\The events in Arizona are a shocking wake-up call for all Americans, especially those involved in politics and government.\Although we do not know the motives of the individual accused of shooting U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and the killing of six others, this atrocity is an alarm to which we must all respond.\Inflammatory rhetoric coming from both sides of the political aisle has unfortunately come to dominate our political discourse. It cannot continue. It is time to ratchet down the intensity of our rhetoric during campaigns and in the course of debates on governing.\Demonizing your political adversary; questioning your opponent's loyalty to this nation or to a particular group or statements calling for the torture of your opponent or his physical demise belong in the Nazi Party of the mid-20th century -- not in political parties of the United States in 2011.\I have asked the members of my party to think carefully about the words and images they use in their political mail, television and radio commercials. I expect no less from the Democratic leadership. Political consultants should use better judgment in guiding their candidates as well. And political commentators need to use more caution before denigrating candidates or groups they disagree with.\Political disputes in America are settled at the ballot box, not with the business end of an M-16 rifle.\I encourage citizens to work for change if that is what they want, but to do so respectfully. The political parties and candidates who square off in elections and who battle on the floors of the legislatures, administration buildings and municipal halls are not enemies; they are merely political opponents. We are all Americans.\We can be proud of our right to free speech, but we cannot abuse it without consequence.\Robert Yudin\Wyckoff, Jan. 12\The writer is chairman of the Bergen County Republican Organization.\*\I seldom read George Will's syndicated columns because I am that liberal your mother warned you about. But I read the excuse for his conservative brethren from their complicity in the ""provocative political rhetoric"" that he suggests has no bearing on the assassination attempt of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (""A typical reflex to blame the right,"" Other Views, Jan. 11).\It may be true that no single cause will emerge from a thorough investigation. But anyone who watched the Tea Party conservatives destroy all semblance of communication in any number of town meetings last summer knows where the vitriolic language and factually bereft beliefs are created.\Maybe Will sleeps undisturbed. But Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Roger Ailes and Rush Limbaugh ought to be insomniacs.\Barrett Thiele\Red Bank, Jan. 11\*\In ""Guns and hate"" (Editorial, Jan. 11), The Record says, ""There is no question that what often parades as discourse is just short of hate speech."" It goes on: ""We need laws that ensure that persons who buy firearms have been properly vetted by law enforcement, that all firearms are licensed and that all licensees are properly trained in the use of firearms. None of these requirements would infringe on a citizen's right to bear arms.""\I have a question. If the Second Amendment can be pushed, pulled and stretched so that it would be almost impossible for a law-abiding citizen to buy a handgun, would The Record be willing to let the amendment about free speech be so diluted?\You freely admit that much of what is written online is nothing but hate speech by many people. You also freely admit that hate speech can and has caused disturbed people to act in harmful ways. So if the amendment that allows you to publish your paper also allows people to take advantage of it in destructive ways, why do you not call for the First Amendment to be made over?\Why is it allowed to stand firm with no conditions except for the restriction that ""no one can yell fire in a crowded movie theater if there is no fire""?\And how come people who write articles for newspapers or magazines or on blogs like Daily KOS do not have to go to class to learn that hateful writings can cause people to kill other people? How come they do not have to go through background checks by the police to see if they have ever committed a crime? How come they can work for any publication even if it were found that they have criminal records?\What makes the First Amendment protecting a newspaper's right to publish so much stronger than the Second Amendment allowing adult U.S. citizens who have never committed violent crimes the right to ""keep and bear arms?""\Jack Velten\River Edge, Jan. 11\*\In ""A typical reflex to blame the right"" (Other Views, Jan. 11), syndicated columnist George Will gives a new twist to the psychotic behavior of Jared L. Loughner, the accused murderer in the Tucson, Ariz., bloodbath: It is the fault of ""liberals.""\Never mind the hate spewing forth and the venom dripping from the mouths of conservatives. Loughner has provided Will with just the cause he seemed to be waiting for so he can blame everything on liberals.\Has Will thought of blaming them for the economic morass that the ""liberals"" inherited from the Bush administration? Has he blamed them for Sept. 11, 2001?\Will is not content to have conservatives reflect on their own culpability. He is determined to increase the volume with damaging rhetoric and let the chips (or bullets) fall where they may.\Morris Roth\Fort Lee, Jan. 11\*\The horrifying gun rampage on Jan. 8 in Tucson, Ariz., demonstrates again the devastating effects of allowing a lobby (the National Rifle Association and its allies) whose main goal is to encourage the sales and profits of the gun industry to dictate gun laws.\Almost every other industrialized nation has sensible gun violence prevention laws that would prevent anyone who might be prone to violence from obtaining such lethality. The failure to do this amounts to allowing individual citizens access to weapons of mass destruction.\In 1994, despite opposition from the NRA, the United States adopted a national assault weapons ban. It prohibited the sale of ammunition clips of more than 10 bullets. The ban expired in 2004. Under intense pressure from the NRA and with a different president and Congress, it was not renewed. So the shooter was able to buy the 33-cartridge magazine he used to wreak havoc in Tucson.\When guns are so easily accessible, it's no wonder that the United States has by far the highest rate of gun violence in the industrialized world. More than 30,000 Americans die each year at the hand of a gun. The Tucson rampage is simply the latest dramatic episode in what is a daily occurrence in the United States.\If we want to get serious about preventing such mass gun violence in the future, we must reinstate the national assault weapons ban and pass other sensible gun violence prevention laws.\Robert Moore\Princeton, Jan. 10\The writer is executive director of the Princeton-based Coalition for Peace Action and pastor of East Brunswick Congregational Church.\*\""Guns and hate"" (Editorial, Jan. 11) starts off with a questionable premise that the Constitution is ""a living and breathing organism."" The Constitution is solid and set in stone. The Founders wrote the Constitution using very few words. They meant what they said.\The Constitution should be viewed as a contract between the people and the government that represents them. The words of the document held the same meaning yesterday as they do today. To say it is living and breathing is to abandon it altogether.\If the Founders' meaning can be erased or reinterpreted, it becomes a concoction of temporary policy agendas of whoever is in power. If the words of our founding document can be manipulated, why should any past law bind this generation?\The Founders knew the Constitution was imperfect but had to ratify it to move forward with the new republic. This is why they spelled out the amendment process.\The tragic event in Arizona is not the fault of the Second Amendment.\Daniel Meakem\Wanaque, Jan. 11\*\My favorite history teacher in high school planted the truth in my mind: The Constitution is a near-perfect document; but clearly it is perfect because it can be amended to right a wrong or an archaic law. My dream over my lifetime is to see the banning of handguns. I don't expect to it to be realized. It is a sad fact to face.\The firearm industry and the National Rifle Association are merchants of death. No other country of our peers -- England, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands -- can compare in our homicide rate or the death of innocent children by gun. Could all these and many other nations be less civilized? No, we are.\Our nation has a cowboy-gangster mentality. ""Why, I have the right to protect my own,"" the citizens decree. It does not seem to be working. It is insanity.\The only sane solution is no guns. It would not erase domestic violence but give someone a fighting chance of survival. It would not eliminate all street crime but certainly would eliminate drive-by shootings and babies being killed even as they sleep.\Let the gangs revisit ""West Side Story."" You have a chance with a switchblade, nothing at all with a Glock or an Uzi. I wish our leaders had the courage to face the fact: Guns kill.\Ellen Dowling\Clifton, Jan. 11\*\As part of the tragic story in Tucson, the media is rightly covering the suspected mental illness of the shooter,\This is important. But we don't often see the needs of the mentally ill discussed until something tragic like this happens. People who suffer from this disorder are members of our society; they need our compassion, our interest, our attention and our help.\Many are alone, some homeless. Many can't afford much-needed medications or vital services like transportation to clinics, doctors and therapy.\Some, though, live with these illnesses and do beautifully with the help of medication, therapy and a good support system. They thrive with an illness that is tough, not only for what it is, but what it isn't. They defy the stigma of being ""mentally ill,"" which is a difficult thing to overcome. They live lives that are full and rich.\Diane Rainey\Bloomingdale, Jan. 12\*\Here we go again. A madman commits a massacre seeking infamy and the media predictably fulfill his wishes by frequently publishing and airing his picture. The next nut sees this, encouraging him to be a copycat.\When is the media going to figure this out and wise up?\Is the competition so intense and misguided to make a buck?\The event itself is bad enough without the image of that animal peeking at us.\Bob Van Gurp\Midland Park, Jan. 11\*\Regarding ""How can we not politicize Tucson?"" (Your Views, Jan 12):\The first letter writer chooses to blast Sarah Palin for the use of targets even though Democrats have used the same imagery in their campaigns.\Strange that he ignores the startling commercial of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., defending the Second Amendment by firing a high-powered rifle at President Obama's cap-and-trade bill and promising to do the same to his health plan. No one thinks he aimed at the president.\Was he aware that Sandra Bernhard hoped Palin would be raped, that an ""art"" exhibit in New York invited rifle-toting folk to shoot at her image and that she was hanged in effigy in Los Angeles? Does he remember that Keith Olbermann suggested that Hillary Clinton be discreetly murdered to get her out of the way in 2008? Where was the huge outcry?\The hypocrisy of the majority of pundits and journalists is astonishing. Former President George W. Bush suffered terrible accusations during his eight years, but there was never a word to ""cool it."" Frankly, they have a license to be divisive. That being the case, Sarah ought not to cool it but keep firing.\Dan Nevins\Wayne, Jan. 13\*\The Record's front-page headline stated ""A call for healing: President tells memorial crowd that Giffords opened her eyes"" (Jan. 13).\The question is: When will we?\Henri Z. Szubin\Teaneck, Jan. 14\*\Early this month, it was CBS anchor woman Katie Couric giving us a glimpse into her idiosyncrasies, then projecting those insecurities onto the rest of us. Now, it is syndicated columnist Leonard Pitts Jr.\Couric offered that Muslims needed their own ""Cosby Show"" and went on to explain: ""I know that sounds crazy. But 'The Cosby Show' did so much to change attitudes about African-Americans in this country, and I think sometimes people are afraid of what they don't understand."" Am I the only one who felt uncomfortable for Couric's admission about her ignorant stereotyping that preceded her Cosby revelation?\In ""It was not the seed, but it was the soil"" (Other Views, Jan. 12), Pitts ascribes to many of us a quickness to define ourselves ""in tribal terms than national ones. We are African American women. We are Jews. We are Southerners. We are gays."" Until Sept. 11, 2001, when we understood that we were all Americans. Like Couric, he makes an assumption about what the rest of us took out of a common experience.\I would suggest that Couric and Pitts expand their circle of friends outside their liberal media echo chambers. There is a whole country of people that did not need ""The Cosby Show"" to accept black families into the mainstream, and it did not take 9/11 to look at our fellow citizens as anything but fellow Americans.\Stephen G. Kenny\Glen Rock, Jan. 12\*\I am totally perplexed with the letter that called President Obama's address at the memorial service in Tucson, Ariz., ""disgraceful"" (Your Views, Jan. 14). The letter writer said she was ""disgusted with his performance and more than appalled by the audience's reaction.""\What possible part of the president's address was ""disgraceful?"" I cannot imagine. Was it perhaps when he said, ""I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it. All of us -- we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children's expectations.""\The president was addressing a wounded, grieving nation and did so admirably.\Joan Savoia Pippi\Waldwick, Jan. 14\*\Thanks to Editorial Page Editor Alfred P.

She seems to have been a very nice lady.\However, I doubt that our government will meet Christina's hopes and dreams. One of her goals in life was to be a veterinarian, and she helped her neighbors by taking care of their pets.

Loughner targeted Rep. Gabrielle Giffords other than that he was anti-government. We also cannot say that Sarah Palin and others were directly responsible for the shootings in Tucson, Ariz.\But even if it weren't true in this case, we must make those who use these incendiary words, oriented in gun violence, understand that toxic rhetoric, even when meant metaphorically, can lead disturbed individuals to believe that the killing of government officials is an acceptable response.\Our country is the most violent of all developed nations. It has been more than 150 years since a political assassination occurred in the United Kingdom. In its history, Canada has never even had an assassination attempt. The United States, on the other hand, has seen Jan. 8's scenario repeated over and over. It is shameful and embarrassing.\Words do matter. As former President Bill Clinton recently remarked, ""Your words go out to the serious and to the delirious."" It is time for all in the public arena -- politicians, activists, the media; in the right, left and center -- to come together as adults and pledge to end the vitriolic war of words that so bitterly divides our country.

The current venomous attacks are a disgrace to our great nation and cannot be allowed to continue.\Chuck Bailey\Barnegat, Jan. 13\The writer is a former Closter resident.\*\During my time studying at Arizona State University I had the privilege to work at the Arizona House of Representatives. It was an educational and fulfilling experience that taught me many lessons about how government works and how it doesn't work.\One of the representatives while I worked there was Gabrielle Giffords. After graduation, I moved back to New Jersey. But in 2006, an opportunity arose to work on a campaign in Arizona, and I jumped at the chance. I spent four months in Phoenix and Tucson working on several campaigns, one of which was Gabrielle Giffords' first run for Congress. I met the soon-to-be congresswoman on the campus of the University of Arizona and found her to be a warm individual.\I also had the chance to work with one of her aides, Gabe Zimmerman. Gabe was co-worker on the campaign. I am saddened that while doing his job on Jan. 8 and helping constituents he lost his life.\Such events should never have taken place in the United States, where we cherish our freedom of speech, which undoubtedly leads to disagreement. These disagreements should always be respectful of the other side's views and never lead to violence.\I hope that both Democrats and Republicans can reach out to each other and truly work together for the betterment of our communities, state and country. It's terrible that it takes such horrible acts to make us change the way we treat each other.

208,"The traditional argument of the economy versus the environment is a false dichotomy, an unnecessary choice. The two actually have a positive, mutual association. It's fitting that economy and ecology have the same root word -- eco, Greek for ""home.""\Many people believe that if you act to protect the environment, you harm the economy. This widespread belief is fed by energy industry propaganda. This belief is not supported by the facts. We're seeing that the costs of environmental inaction are in fact higher than the costs of action to protect the environment, and that actions to protect the environment would stimulate the economy.\A good example of this is action to mitigate climate change. Assuming a gradually increasing carbon fee with full dividends to consumers, we see positive impacts on the economy. The Citizens' Climate Lobby's media advisory for a study prepared by Regional Economic Models Inc., (REMI) concludes: ""The general assumption, until now, has been that solutions to address global warming will be a drag on the economy and lead to loss of jobs. The new REMI study turns that assumption on its head, showing that a carbon tax -- if done the right way -- will grow the economy and add jobs.""\The report shows that such a carbon fee and dividend would add 2.2 million jobs over 10 years while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 33 percent.\So, why aren't we doing this?\Tony Giordano\Howell\Setting the record straight about the Catholic Church\Regarding the July 5 letter ""Conservative Catholicism yields unjust court rulings"": First, the Catholic Church is neither ""conservative"" nor ""liberal.""\Second, the writer states that our country is marching toward theocracy and extends VIP treatment to a tiny number of religions; in fact, there are 18 million more Catholics in the U.S. than it takes to elect a president.\What the Supreme Court was doing in the Hobby Lobby decision was upholding the Constitution in allowing individuals to run their companies according to their conscience. To say that the Supreme Court bases their opinions on ""conservative Catholicism"" is to be ignorant of its many decisions. It's also ignorant to state Catholics are against universal health care or are in favor of gun violence.\Lastly, Hobby Lobby is not a Catholic-run company. Nor were the Pilgrims who came to this country. This decision had absolutely nothing to do with the Catholic Church.\Mary Ann Dowd\MIDDLETOWN"
209,"AP Business Writer\French President Nicolas Sarkozy wants to tax carbon dioxide emissions by households and businesses, a measure aimed at helping France slash its output greenhouse gases over the coming decades -- but viewed with skepticism by many.\In a highly anticipated speech on the subject, Sarkozy sought to convince his compatriots of the need for the carbon tax, which surveys show around two-thirds of the French oppose. France would be the largest economy to impose one so far.\Sarkozy said that faced with threats to the climate and the need to reduce its dependence on oil, ""it is time for France to profoundly adapt its taxation system and create real ecological taxation.""\The tax would be initially based on the market price for carbon dioxide emissions permits, which is now euro17 ($24.74) per ton of carbon dioxide, Sarkozy said. At that level, the government expects to raise euro3 billion, which will be entirely returned to households and businesses through a reduction in other taxes or repaid via a so-called ""Green Check,"" Sarkozy said.\The result would be a shift of the tax burden from other revenue sources to energy derived from fossil fuels in an effort to discourage their use.\Gasoline, diesel fuel, coal and natual gas will be subject to the tax, but not electricity, Sarkozy said. France generates most of its electricity via nuclear power, which doesn't emit greenhouse gases.\The tax would add 4.5 euro cents to each liter of diesel, 4 cents to each liter of gasoline and 0.4 cents for each KWh of natural gas consumed, Sarkozy said. The tax is intended to rise gradually from this level, Sarkozy said.\The plan, dubbed a ""carbon tax"" by most observers despite the government's effort to brand it as a ""climate-energy contribution,"" has stirred passionate debate in France, where surveys say most voters oppose the idea.\France would be the largest economy to levy such a tax, though some smaller European countries already tax household carbon dioxide emissions, including Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Slovenia.\France hopes to play a leading role at a U.N. meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, this December aimed at striking a pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which bound 37 industrial countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 percent of 1990 levels by 2012.\The idea for a tax on carbon emissions has been debated in France since at least 2007, when it was part of the electoral platform of presidential candidate Nicolas Hulot, a television star and environmentalist. General outlines for the proposed tax were hashed out by experts led by former prime minister Michel Rocard earlier this year.\In the absence of details on the tax's size and how it would be levied, the debate has bogged down in recent weeks, with confusion and contradiction even within the conservative government.\Prime Minister Francois Fillon told a newspaper last week that the tax would be euro14 ($20.20) per ton of C02. Sarkozy quickly stepped in and said nothing was yet decided. The Rocard commission had suggested a price of euro32 ($46.15) per ton of C02.\A tax of that size would raise euro8 billion ($11.5 billion), which the government has pledged to redistribute through cuts in other levies and charges.\A poll published Thursday in the magazine Paris-Match showed 65 percent of French people opposed the tax and 34 percent in favor.\The survey by the IFOP polling agency also showed that opposition to the tax crossed political lines, with 56 percent of Green Party voters and 60 percent of Sarkozy's own UMP party voters against the carbon tax. The poll questioned 1,007 people by telephone on Sept. 3 and 4. No margin of error was given.\Sarkozy has brushed aside the criticism, saying in comments reported by the French press that the carbon tax was similar to other major reforms that were originally unpopular in France, such as decolonization and the repeal of the death penalty.\For individuals, a tax of euro32 per ton of C02 would amount to an average additional euro160 ($230) per year, half on heating gas and half on gasoline or diesel fuel, said Gael Callonnec, an economist at the French Environment and Energy Management Agency, a public agency that advised the government on the plan.\A tax of this size would be equivalent to an 8-centime increase in the price of a liter of unleaded gasoline (roughly 3 US cents per gallon), Callonnec said.\Hulot, the ex-presidential candidate, told the French newspaper Liberation that the tax should progressively increase to around euro100 per ton of C02 by 2030.\France under Sarkozy has sought to catch up to, and eventually surpass, European neighbors with ""greener"" reputations. Last summer France's parliament passed a sweeping law that says the country should reduce its carbon emissions fourfold by 2050 and increase renewable energy sources to 23 percent of total energy production, about double current levels."

212,"Gov. Christie is no friend of the environment. The national conservatives Christie is courting for his presidential run are also apathetic to environmental concerns, which helps to explain why the governor pulled New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2011.\Exactly what that move has wrought isn't entirely clear. Activists say the state has lost more than a hundred million dollars in revenue that RGGI would have created through cap-and-trade auctions, a number that will continue to grow. They also argue that the state hasn't curbed its carbon emissions as much as it might have otherwise, although all across the Northeast those emissions have declined, thanks primarily to recessionary pressures and the growing abundance of more carbon-friendly natural gas. Of greater concern, environmentalists project significant increases in emissions within New Jersey in the decades ahead if the state stays out of the regional agreement.\Christie's original argument was that RGGI was too weak to be effective and that it amounted to a carbon tax on polluters that would be passed down to public ratepayers. He did add, however, that he conceded the likelihood of global warming and mankind's contribution to it -- perhaps to separate himself from the more unhinged element of the far right. Christie also did something very Christie-like in the process -- he tried to do what he wanted without necessarily following some rules that might get in the way. Now the Legislature may be on the verge of successfully calling him on it.\On Monday, the Senate Environment Committee approved a resolution that would effectively prevent Christie from changing regulations to finalize New Jersey's departure from RGGI. Earlier this year, an appeals court found that the governor erred in simply telling power-plant operators they were no longer bound the by RGGI rules, even though no formal repeal process had been completed. Lawmakers are now trying to stop that repeal by claiming it's inconsistent with legislative intent. If the legislative measure succeeds, however, the path ahead is still unclear. It won't return New Jersey to the regional initiative, at least not immediately. Christie would have time to respond with changes to the rules, and the prospect of potential legal action looms beyond that if an impasse develops.\The absence of an obvious end game is partly due to the uncertain environmental effects. While there is a certain common-sense logic to the fact that restrictions on carbon emissions will reduce those emissions, RGGI's role is just one piece of broader clean-energy initiatives. It is telling that Jeff Tittel, the executive director of the New Jersey Sierra Club who is never bashful about criticizing the powers that be, this week placed far more emphasis on Christie's careless administrative maneuverings in trying to scuttle RGGI than the actual environmental impact of those actions.\But we do know a few things. Leaving RGGI does nothing to help the environment. It is costing New Jersey money, although Christie has tried to dismiss the numbers as relatively meaningless. And in the long run, such indifference to carbon emissions will be harmful to the state in some fashion.\The plus side of scrapping RGGI? There really isn't one, aside from giving some marginal boost to Christie's conservative credentials. Sorry, but we find the environment and the state's bottom line to be a bit more important."
213,"It is an outrage when the people inside and outside of the government talk about imposing a carbon tax on an already overtaxed population, rather than make more of an effort to come up with a better solution to clean our environment. They should start by imposing taxes and fines on the polluters.\Also, the government's agencies that supposedly protect our environment should be making more of an effort to educate and advise the drivers of all motor vehicles, not to idle engines for more than a few minutes when they are parked. If they are caught ignoring that limit, they should be fined.\It is unfortunate that some drivers are irresponsible, careless, or they just don't realize that what comes out of their vehicle's tailpipe is toxic to the air that we breathe. The technologies of those remote starters also are one of the major culprits (in some cases up to a half hour in advance, before people get into their cars to drive). Other times they park and talk on the cellphone, text, or chat with their passengers while the engine is idling.\Delivery trucks also are guilty of leaving their engines running when they are loading and unloading their cargo. I've seen landscapers and home remodeling contractors leave their trucks parked in streets or driveways, with the engine idling as they go into customers' houses to give job estimates. Sometimes they even leave their trucks idling when they are taking coffee breaks, or eating their lunch. Some of those trucks burn diesel and they don't smell too good, especially when they are parked in front of our houses.\This observation is viewed from one neighborhood. If this would be multiplied by the thousands of similar occurrences in others neighborhoods, imagine just how much senseless fuel is being burned and how much pollution is been discharged into the air. All of this wasted fuel and damages to the environment could be avoided, if each driver would just be more responsible and shut off their engines when they parked. That would be another step toward breathing cleaner air.\Anthony Parisi\BRIDGEWATER\Facts don't support Obama criticisms\I realize that it is difficult to change the mind of someone with pre-conceived beliefs (however wrong) like letter writer Barbara Skokan, but I am sure there are readers who actually care about facts. Her letter of March 24 contains so much misinformation/disinformation that it cannot be allowed to go uncountered.\To her first statement about the ""financial ruin"" caused by President Barack Obama's policies, I would direct her to the stock market which is higher than ever, making any person (not just the rich) with a 401(k) much better off. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the bank bailout, was started under President George W. Bush. The bailout of American International Group (AIG) insurance company was part of that same effort.\The president did not nationalize the auto industry; he subsidized it in order to save an iconic American industry and its ancillary manufacturers and suppliers -- that also started under the Bush administration. According to a study by the Center for Automotive Research, the auto bailout ""saved 1.5 million U.S. jobs and avoided the loss of $105.3 billion in unemployment benefit payments and the loss of personal and social insurance tax collection.""\President Obama has not ""started his own war using drones."" The first use of drones was Feb. 4, 2002, during the Bush administration. The reason the president hasn't closed Guantanamo Bay is because Congress repeatedly has passed laws denying the money necessary to do it.\Contrary to her assertion that he kept us dependent on foreign oil, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, in the past five years U.S. crude oil production has increased by 40 percent and the International Energy Agency forecasts that the U.S. will overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's top producer next year. I'm sure people have heard about the North Dakota oil boom, termed the ""new gold rush."" I happen to think we should be focusing much more on renewable, non-polluting energy sources but, nevertheless, Ms. Skokan's statement is dead wrong.\People can certainly disagree with the president's policies but they should be basing their opinions on what is factually true. Our country will never make any progress unless we stop listening to corporate-funded propaganda and start reading, listening to and researching for ourselves the facts of a particular issue. The Citizens United decision has made that harder but it is our responsibility as citizens to get it right. The very future of our country depends on it.\JoAnn D. Claps\RANDOLPH"
214," Joan Lowy writes for Scripps Howard News Service. Contact her at LowyJ@shns.com. Send comments about this article to oped@northjersey.com.\ FEELING THE HEAT on global warming, sentiment in U.S. business and industry is beginning to shift in favor of action to address carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\ U.S. companies already face restrictions on such emissions from their overseas operations as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, the 124- nation climate-change treaty that came into force this year.\ At home, major corporations are under mounting pressure from shareholder activists who want companies to assess the financial risks posed by climate change and the likelihood of future restrictions on carbon emissions in the United States.\ President Bush pulled the United States out of the Kyoto treaty and remains opposed to mandatory curbs on greenhouse gases, saying they are too expensive for the U.S. economy. But more than two dozen states have moved to fill in the void, adopting regulations and policies designed to discourage emissions or encourage the use of renewable energy.\ There is also a sense that by delaying action, U.S. companies will be left behind in the competition for green energy and energy- efficient technologies, business leaders said.\ ""Some companies feel that if we don't act soon in the United States, we may be missing out on opportunities to innovate and to develop the technologies that will address these problems in the future,"" said Steve Percy, former chief executive officer of BP America.\ ""On top of that, I think there is a recognition on the part of some of these leading companies that public opinion is slowly beginning to shift on these issues,"" Percy said. ""They want to be able to say in the future that they were progressive on this issue.""\ Big companies are also coming to the conclusion that reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by becoming more energy efficient ""adds value to your business,"" said Mark Chatelain, energy and environment director at Johnson Controls of Milwaukee, a $27 billion-a-year auto- parts and energy-systems company that ranks 71st in the Fortune 500.\ Cost savings usually accompany improvements in efficiency, ""but there are intangibles as well, including customer satisfaction and a license to operate in a lot of countries where, if you had a bad reputation, you might not get work,"" said Chatelain, who heads a Johnson division that advises other companies on how to improve their energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. ""It definitely adds to your reputation and brand image.""\ Another concern, particularly for energy companies and their directors, is that they may be vulnerable in the future to lawsuits seeking compensation for damage caused by climate change similar to the litigation faced by the tobacco industry over the past decade.\ ""Some of the global insurers are starting to ask companies about the risk they face long-term,"" Percy said.\ Some of America's top corporate leaders are starting to talk about tax increases and caps on emissions, a sharp contrast to the stance of U.S. business and industry just a few years ago, when the emphasis was on delaying mandatory restrictions as long as possible.\ Two months ago, Paul Anderson, chief executive officer of Duke Energy, an electric utility and natural-gas pipeline company that ranks 86th in the Fortune 500, called for a federal tax to discourage emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas scientists say is driving global warming.\ Saying ""there is no free lunch,"" Anderson warned in a speech to Charlotte, N.C., business leaders that Americans may have to get used to paying more for energy in order to tackle global warming.\ Anderson complained that concern about climate change has led to a costly ""patchwork"" of local, state and regional policies.\ ""Duke Energy ... believes that a mandatory, federal, economy- wide policy response - for example, a carbon tax - is preferable to this patchwork, as it would be less costly to society and more effective in managing greenhouse gas emissions,"" said a company policy statement that accompanied Anderson's speech. ""A national approach would also be easier to integrate into a comprehensive global response, which the U.S. and other countries should continue to pursue.""\ Such perceived heresy infuriated climate skeptics. ""The overwhelming amount of new science is moving in the opposite direction of the scaremongers who claim that man is the cause of any warming - if warming exists at all,"" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement responding to Anderson's speech.\ ""Duke's new position in the face of these facts will do nothing to help the environment,"" Inhofe said. ""It will only hurt their ratepayers, who are already being stung by rising power costs and escalating gas prices at the pump.""\ Anderson, however, is not alone. Exelon Corp. Chairman and CEO John Rowe, for example, has also called for mandatory constraints on carbon dioxide.\ ""The science on carbon and climate change has become overwhelming,"" Rowe said last fall at a news conference of the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy, which he co- chaired. ""The United States must take responsibility for addressing its contribution to the risks of climate change.""\ Exelon, an electricity company with more than $14 billion in annual revenues, generates more nuclear power than any other U.S. company and might benefit from an industry shift away from coal, which is high in carbon, to nuclear power, which does not produce greenhouse gases.\ Wielding increasing financial clout, shareholder activists who press climate-change-related resolutions at annual stockholder meetings have also forced the issue in front of corporate directors.\ For example, the Investor Network on Climate Risk, one of the shareholder groups backing the climate resolutions, includes three dozen leading U.S. institutional investors and investment funds with more than $1.5 trillion in assets, including the California, New York State, New York City and Connecticut public pension funds.\ In response to shareholder pressure and environmental protests, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the nation's third-largest bank, recently announced an aggressive climate policy, including assessing the financial risks of greenhouse-gas emissions in its loan evaluations. Besides the threat of legal liability, companies and their lenders and insurers could face increased costs from future government regulation and from environmental changes related to global warming. Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. have made similar pledges in recent years.\ Last year, two of the nation's largest electric-power generators, American Electric Power and Cinergy, agreed to study and publicly report on the financial risks posed by climate change and on their efforts to reduce emissions.\ The power companies ""didn't come out with reports that said, 'Never mind, this is a silly issue or ... it's an environmental issue that doesn't come to fruition for the next 20 years, so go away,' "" said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a Boston-based investor coalition that has helped coordinate shareholder resolution filings. ""They came out with hundred-page reports that documented page-by-page the financial risk to them as companies and as an industry if they don't act.""\ ""Change is slow, painfully slow, so we have a long way to go, but progress is unquestionably being made,"" Lubber said. ""I am heartened by the fact that this is no longer seen as a long-term, off-in-the- distance environmental issue that can be ignored."""
215,"In his My View published on Dec. 25, Marvin Smith wrote about what is probably the most important issue of our time: The need to change from fossil fuel to clean energy. It impacts our economy, our foreign policy, environment, global warming, health care and world hunger. In the long term, it threatens the very existence of a livable planet.\We are behind much of the world in the effort to switch to renewable energy, including the use of wind, solar power, geothermal bio-fuels from switch grass and sugar cane and implementing ways to reduce energy use.\President Obama has indicated he will institute programs to move our country toward the solutions. He has expressed a hope that we can be free from purchasing foreign oil by the end of his second term.\Mr. Smith has suggested a $2 a gallon tax on gasoline to create the funds that will be needed. I think it was Al Gore who suggested a 50-cent tax some years ago. I thought it was a great idea then, and I would support it now.\The question is, with the present economy, would the tax be economically wise and could it gain political support? There is a possible alternative. I recently read the forward written for Van Jones' new book, ""The Green Collar Economy."" It was written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He wrote: ""The practice of borrowing a million dollars a day to buy foreign oil has caused the dollar to implode. More than a trillion dollars a year in annual subsidies to oil and gas producers has beggared a nation that four decades ago owned half of the globe's wealth.""\Most experts agree that the choice of corn to create the bio-fuel ethanol was a very bad decision. It uses more energy to create than it produces. The massive switch from other crops to corn has caused food shortages, increased prices and created hunger and food riots in the undeveloped world. Yet we still continue to give massive subsidies to this industry.\Wouldn't it be prudent to take the money that we spend to support the problem and use it to solve the problem?\The oil and coal companies aren't going to stop producing the product because we remove the subsidies. They might increase the price, but so will a tax. It would seem the alternative would be worse -- you would have the subsidies plus a gasoline and a carbon tax.\Let us let the new Obama administration know this is the change we believe in.\Mr. Smith also questions the wisdom of building a new natural gas-fired generator at the Vineland Electric Utility. He raises the question of a carbon tax.\At this point we disagree. It is not an either or question. In the years ahead, it is going to take a smart use of both fossil and renewable energy. President Obama may be able to end our dependence on foreign oil. However, most experts talk in 20- to 50-year time frames for the total elimination of fossil fuels.\The new generation plant is our bridge to a locally green economy. It satisfies the state's demand that we stop burning coal by 2012. It will reduce our present carbon emissions. Natural gas will become more available from domestic wells. It maintains our position on the energy grid. Until we create a way to store large quantities of electricity, and until the nation develops the new smart grid, it gives us a dependable source of power when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. Additionally, if Congress chooses the cap and trade system, which worked well for the acid rain problem, instead of a carbon tax, we would have credits to sell.\We need to develop programs to aid homes and businesses to reduce energy use with insulation, efficient windows and to update heating systems, air conditioners and appliances to new energy-efficient units.\The utility could look at ways to develop partnerships with home and business owners to install solar and wind units. This would provide clean energy to the owner and give extra energy to the utility.\We need to install the new smart meters that charge lower prices when the demand is low. This would encourage customers to save by running washers, dryers and dishwashers during periods of low demand.\We need to be working with local banks, businesses, contractors, unions, suppliers, store owners, Cumberland County College and the Technical Education Center to make sure the jobs and revenues created stay in the community.\Finally, we should be seeking out the federal and state grants that are and will be available to communities to do these things.\Vineland Mayor Romano is promoting citizen participation. He has created committees for human relations, special events, a welcome home committee, youth council and one to plan the city's 150th anniversary.\There should be a sixth committee. It should be composed of leading members of all segments of our community. It should be charged with looking at what is being done in other communities and how their initiatives could be applied locally. They should design and present a green economy program best suited for Vineland's needs.\It would not be easy. However, with thought and effort, we can be one of the communities that take advantage of the changes that are surely coming. Changes not just for right now, but changes for better lives for our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\Charles A. Biddinger\Vineland"

219,"WASHINGTON -- Former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman continued her push for climate change action Wednesday, expressing ""frustration"" to key senators that the federal Environmental Protection Agency's legal authority to regulate carbon emissions is still in dispute.\""EPA does have the authority,"" Whitman, the agency's administrator from 2001 to 2003, told members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works subcommittee on clean air. ""The law says so and the Supreme Court has said so twice. The matter, I believe, should be put to rest.""\Wednesday's hearing followed the Obama administration's proposal, released earlier this month, to reduce emissions from existing coal-fired power plants by 30 percent over the next 16 years. Whitman, now president of the Whitman Strategy Group, an energy lobbying firm, was one of four former Republican-appointed EPA administrators to testify in favor of climate change action at the hearing.\Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said the EPA's proposal is an illegal expansion of the agency's powers to enforce the Clean Air Act.\""EPA's proposed guidelines ... are simply the most recent example of the federal government usurping authorities properly delegated to the states,"" he testified.\Whitman, who has called on other Republicans to act on the issue, said there are ""honest disagreements"" about the EPA proposal, including whether it stretches the agency's legal authority too far in some ways. But during the period for public comment on the proposal, she said, the focus should be on its substance ""and not EPA's broad authority to promulgate it.""\Climate change has real consequences for national security as well as the environment and the economy, Whitman said. Human activity isn't solely responsible for the problem but is a contributing factor and increases the risk the environment will be pushed beyond repair, she said.\""And we should know that when one is contributing to a problem, one has an obligation to be part of the solution,"" she said. ""That's what the EPA is trying to do.""\Whitman and the other former EPA administrators penned a New York Times op-ed last year calling for ""substantive steps to curb climate change, at home and internationally.""\They said Congress should endorse President Barack Obama's 2013 plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and spur increased investments in clean energy technology. A market-based approach such as a carbon tax would be the best way to reduce emissions but isn't possible in the ""current political gridlock in Washington,"" they wrote.\Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said the testimony from the former EPA administrators prove climate change is ""clearly not a left-right issue"" but ""an issue of fact."" Booker said past predictions that the Clean Water and Endangered Species acts would hurt the economy proved incorrect. He said climate change regulations will similarly improve economic conditions through investments, such as building retrofits.\""By doing the right thing, we not only will not hurt the economy but we actually help to improve the economy,"" he said.\Whitman said action won't come without cost, but the EPA has always sought to carry out its mandate in ""a balanced way"" to protect the environment and the economy.\From 1980 to 2012, she noted, total emissions of six common air pollutants dropped 67 percent. At the same time, she said, the population grew by 38 percent, energy consumption increased by 27 percent and the gross domestic product more than doubled in constant dollars.\""If past is prologue, further reductions are achievable and affordable,"" she said.\Subcommittee chairman Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked about the outcome of other environmental regulations that came with fears of ""economic calamity.""\Whitman said the EPA was ""being sued by everybody,"" including the Energy Department, when she worked on making air conditioners more efficient. Now the industry exceeds those standards, she said.\""The ingenuity in the American system kicked in,"" she said. ""The minute that they knew this was real, it was going to happen, not only did we not see a loss in jobs or a loss in dollars, we saw this whole industry achieve new levels that we didn't think were possible.""\Contributing: Mary Troyan, Gannett Washington Bureau"

225,"PARAMUS -- A leading advocate for tough governmental action on climate change warned Thursday that much of the world was ignoring the problem of global warming.\Appearing before an audience at Bergen Community College that was largely receptive to his message, James E. Hansen, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, also urged North Jerseyans to prod their elected representatives to act on the issue.\Hansen, a former Ridgewood resident, first made national news in 1988 when he told a U.S. Senate subcommittee that global warming was a growing threat to the environment and that humans were almost certainly responsible.\The issue has since become a flashpoint not only for President Obama, who has said he supports a cap-and-trade solution, but also for several Republican presidential contenders who, led by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, have questioned the science behind climate change.\On Thursday, Hansen called the cap-and-trade idea ""cockamamie,"" but he sounded some notes of hope that there might be movement on the issue in the national sphere. The best solution, Hansen said, would be a carbon tax, which the Obama administration has said is not politically viable.\""There's a huge gap between rhetoric and reality,"" Hansen said at the event, which was sponsored by the North Jersey Public Policy Network. ""Politicians have learned to say the right words. ... But they're not actually taking any actions.""\Hansen has a long public history with the issue, sparring with administrations of both parties while looking for solutions.\In 2001, Hansen was invited to brief then-Vice President Dick Cheney, who was intrigued by Hansen's opinion then that mitigating soot in the atmosphere should be prioritized over curbing carbon dioxide because it was cheaper and more effective. Three years later, Hansen came out publicly for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. In 2006, he accused the Bush administration of trying to silence him after he gave a speech calling for cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions.\Since then, Hansen has retained his post at NASA while continuing to press for more national action on climate change, including a carbon tax. This approach has again put him at odds with the president, and Hansen was arrested while protesting in front of the White House in 2009.\Hansen said that a persistent gap between what scientists understood and what the public knew about the subject pushed him further into the public sphere, years after he made waves with his congressional testimony.\""I quickly decided that the public aspect of this was not for me,"" Hansen said. ""It wasn't until years later that my grandchildren kind of forced me to explain what was going on.""\A lengthy question-and-answer session produced a steady stream of gratitude for Hansen and further calls to action.\One man, who was wearing a shirt that said ""Spill oil, beaches spoil,"" called the arguments offered by climate-change skeptics ""garbage.""\""Win the debate, that's what I suggest,"" the man said. ""Eventually, the climate will force the issue.""\Hansen ended the talk on an optimistic note, saying that China is making major investments in alternative energy. He also said the courts could lead the way if the public starts to demand it.\""Young people had better start to get angry about it,"" Hansen said. ""We're going to determine the climate in the next century, centuries, next millennia."""
226,"Just because the environment is getting short shrift this election season due to our nation's lingering economic woes doesn't mean that President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney can ignore the issue.\Environmentalists have cheered several of Obama's moves during his first term, including: passage of the Recovery Act and its funding for environmental and habitat restoration and water quality improvements; passage of the first comprehensive National Policy for the Stewardship of the Ocean, the Coasts and the Great Lakes; and the signing of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, which expanded land protections and water conservation across two million acres of federal wilderness.\Obama also formed the Partnership for Sustainable Communities to bring together federal agencies to help communities nationwide improve access to affordable housing and increase low cost transportation options while protecting the environment. He also established new rules to reduce the negative impacts of mountain-top removal coal mining, set historic standards limiting greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, made substantial investments in clean energy, proposed the first-ever carbon pollution limits for new fossil-fuel-fired power plants, and reduced carbon emissions within the federal government.\On the downside, green leaders dismay Obama's lack of follow-through on a 2008 campaign promise to label genetically modified foods so that consumers know what they are getting when they buy corn, sugar or breakfast cereal. Also, a 2011 Obama decision to deregulate the planting of genetically modified alfalfa and sugar beets incensed organic farmers and environmental leaders. Greens also worry about Obama's enthusiasm for an ""all-of-the-above"" energy policy that includes the practice of hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") to access natural gas in shale beds under wide swaths of the northeast and western U.S.\If re-elected, Obama would no doubt work to expand U.S. leadership on setting emissions limits in unison with other nations, and has pledged to continue to reduce our dependence on oil so as to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Conservationists are also hopeful that Obama will set aside threatened lands for protection from development as both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did soon before leaving the White House.\While Mitt Romney doesn't have much of an environmental track record from his days as Massachusetts' governor, he did get kudos for being open minded to both regulatory and market-based policy ideas. He also supported a 2003 northeastern states agreement to reduce carbon emissions from power plants via a regional cap-and-trade emissions reduction plan. But in 2005 Romney abruptly pulled Massachusetts out of the plan, telling reporters that it didn't protect businesses and consumers from increased energy costs.\Romney is now pitching an energy plan that embraces all the options, including fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewables. But he recently told ScienceDebate.org that he opposes any kind of carbon tax or cap-and-trade system ""that would handicap the American economy and drive manufacturing jobs away,"" adding that economic growth and technological innovation, ""not economy-suppressing regulation,"" are key to protecting the environment in the long run.\EarthTalk is written and edited by Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss and is a registered trademark of E - The Environmental Magazine."
227,"At a former Superfund site in East Rutherford on Monday, the widow of Sen. Frank Lautenberg praised Rep. Frank Pallone's environmental record and argued that Pallone's experience working with Lautenberg makes him the best of the four Democrats running for the Senate seat.\Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg also emphasized her friendship with one of the other candidates, Rep. Rush Holt, and she continued her family's criticism of another candidate, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, suggesting he is running on his celebrity status and not on his experience.\""Being great on TV and raising money outside the state doesn't mean that you're going to be the most effective in the United States Senate,"" she said without identifying Booker by name.\Booker unveiled a new advertisement on Monday laying out his priorities, including equal pay for equal work, raising the minimum wage and protecting Social Security and Medicare. The ad will appear on cable television in English and on cable and broadcast TV in Spanish.\It will be competing for attention against new spots released Monday by Pallone and Holt, as well as an ad expected to be unveiled today by a new conservative political action committee. The online-only ad by the American Commitment Action Fund -- which it says it will spend $100,000 to promote -- attacks Booker's record as mayor and his leadership abilities.\Holt's new advertisement, which also is slated to appear only on the Web, opens with a statement that ""millions will die"" if the federal government does not address climate change. It is the latest in a series in which Holt takes provocative stances.\The Mercer County congressman calls for a carbon tax to help cut back on greenhouse gas emissions -- a proposal that Steve Lonegan, one of the two candidates on the Republican side, quickly lambasted. Lonegan said the claim about millions of possible deaths is ""silly hysteria,"" and he pledged to oppose a climate tax.\Pallone's new spot, which will air on New York and Philadelphia broadcast stations, touts the candidate as ""one of us,"" and it highlights his work on the federal health insurance overhaul, which Pallone helped steer through Congress as chairman of a House health subcommittee.\Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, whose Senate campaign has been much quieter than those of the other three Democrats, announced Monday she will open her campaign headquarters today in Newark.\Englebardt Lautenberg said Pallone and her husband worked hand in hand to clean up New Jersey's environment.\""Especially on the environment, Frank Lautenberg had a critical ally,"" she said, calling Pallone ""the go-to guy.""\She spoke at a former Superfund site that is now a parking lot for a Lowe's Home Improvement store.\Pallone said the Superfund and brownfield programs helped New Jersey's economy as well as its environment.\""Not only do we clean up sites, but we create jobs and grow the economy through what happens after,"" he said, pointing to the store.\The Lautenberg family endorsed Pallone two weeks ago. Its decision was perhaps most damaging to Holt, whose voting record is similar to Pallone's and who argues that he is Lautenberg's natural successor.\""I'm very fond of Rush Holt. I really am, on a personal level,"" Englebardt Lautenberg said. ""But we just felt that Frank Pallone was the congressman who could possibly win this seat and do a great job for the citizens of New Jersey.""\Holt brushed off the implication that Pallone's chances would be better than his in the Oct. 16 special election for Lautenberg's seat.\""I'm pleased that the Lautenberg family thinks highly of me; I thought very highly of Frank,"" Holt said. ""With regards to the current race, it's clear that my experience, accomplishments and organization put me in the best position to win this campaign.""\The primary is being held Aug. 13 to pick nominees for the special election to fill the remaining 16 months of Lautenberg's term. Then there will be a Senate election next year for a new six-year term.\Credit: Email: linhorst@northjersey.com and jackson@northjersey.com"
228,"Q: Where do the leading Democratic candidates for President stand on environmental issues? -- Leslie Mazur, Hauppauge, NY\Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders stands out in terms of environmental commitment. He has been a vocal defender of the need for an international climate accord, initially championing U.S. participation in 2000's Kyoto Protocol, a climate pact that ultimately failed due to lack of participation by China and the U.S. Since then, he has remained one of the most outspoken advocates for climate action in Congress. His current platform includes instituting a nationwide carbon tax and using the funds to finance the development of renewable sources of energy. He would like to see the country move quickly toward ""fossil fuel independence"" and is advocating that at least 25 percent of U.S. energy come from renewable sources by 2025. He is against letting the Keystone XL pipeline cross the United States with Canadian tar sands oil. He would like to see the federal government cut subsidies to large animal ""factory farms"" and move that money toward stimulating the organic agriculture sector. And he backs efforts to require labeling for any products containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\Hillary Clinton is no slouch on the environment, either. Like Sanders, she supported U.S. participation in the Kyoto Protocol and has been outspoken about the need to address climate change ever since. She terms the effort to achieve carbon neutrality nationwide as our ""modern Apollo moon shot"" and would like the federal government to pledge $100 billion annually to mitigate the effects of climate change. She recently came out in opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, and shares Sanders' desire for achieving 25 percent clean energy nationally by 2025. She is also pushing for more research and development in the alternative energy sector paid for out of funds otherwise earmarked to subsidize Big Oil. Otherwise, Clinton generally supports efforts to conserve sensitive lands and protect endangered species, and has consistently backed efforts to beef up the Clean Air and the Clean Water acts.\The remaining candidates for the Democratic nomination also boast strong environmental track records. As Governor of Maryland, Martin O'Malley spearheaded a statewide effort to protect roughly a million acres of land around Chesapeake Bay to bolster waning blue crab and oyster populations. He supports helping the clean energy sector get off the ground to protect the environment and provide jobs, and wants to double the nation's energy efficiency in just 15 years and get the U.S, off of fossil fuels fully by 2050.\Former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee supports increasing federal funds for fighting climate change and is a staunch opponent of drilling in Alaskan wildlife refuges. Historically, he has supported increasing public transportation infrastructure, and federally subsidized remediation for brownfields (contaminated lands previously used for industrial purposes).\Environmental advocates have their fingers crossed that, regardless of the outcome of the 2016 elections, the U.S. can maintain momentum on climate and related issues.\EarthTalk(R) is produced by Doug Moss & Roddy Scheer and is a registered trademark of Earth Action Network Inc. e-mail us your question: earthtalk@emagazine.com."
229,"Quick action needed on climate change\We are at a defining point in time. This generation is witnessing extreme consequences of climate change and, at the same time, is the only generation that can implement solutions to avoid the most horrific disasters yet to come.\The 12 hottest years on record are all recent. Ocean temperatures are increasing, sea levels are rising, Arctic sea ice is melting faster than predicted, extreme flooding is taking place all over the world, enormous forest fires are rampant and droughts are ruining precious food crops.\We can no longer pretend that everything is normal. If we do not have a livable planet, there will be no economy. Business needs the environment. Society needs the environment. Cutting carbon pollution is urgent and necessary. If we do not act now, our children's future will be in question. One way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to implement a carbon tax.\Last year, I was chosen from thousands of applicants to become a ""Climate Reality Leader"" and was personally trained by former Vice President Al Gore to educate people about climate change. This year, I was elected to a select group of mentors who are working with the former vice president to train new climate leaders. Join me to educate your friends, family and colleagues about climate change. We have implemented and can implement solutions that will heal our planet and reduce carbon pollution. But we must do so before time runs out.\Nicole Altneu\Montclair, Aug. 6\Paramus should make its library a priority\We are longtime Paramus residents. We used to be proud of the main library's appearance, but that is no longer the case. The neglect is obvious and embarrassing. The landscaping at the parking lot entrance is poorly maintained.\The carpeting and upholstered furniture inside the library are stained and threadbare. When it rains, the roof leaks and buckets are everywhere. The bathrooms are overdue for remodeling; everything is rusted.\Paramus' priorities are not in order. The library is in constant use by residents, yet the town will not spend the money to properly maintain it. However, the town recently installed an electronic sign, new landscaping and an impressive clock at the junction of North Farview and East Midland avenues.\Daniel and Madeline Buonagurio\Paramus, Aug. 5\A-Rod case should go to federal court\Regarding ""A way out for A-Rod"" (Page A-1, Aug. 6):\First, I must say I have no sympathy for cheaters. If Alex Rodriguez is proved guilty, he and all others so convicted should be severely punished.\But due process must be guaranteed. A-Rod should take his case to the federal courts. All significant parties should be subpoenaed to testify under oath with cross-examination.\If Major League Baseball's ""smoking gun"" evidence is not decisively proved, it should be dismissed and heavy damages assessed.\Also, I believe the ""blind eye"" and the ""deaf ear"" demonstrated by the owners and MLB since the beginning of this mess should be publicly emphasized. A cleanup is obviously necessary, and it should be for both sides.\Second, I feel there is a smell of hypocrisy in the air. This includes MLB and many of the anti A-Rod fans and journalists. If A-Rod somehow manages to do well beginning with his return to the Yankees this week, will these people change their attitude toward him? I suspect that many will.\Jerrold Terdiman\Woodcliff Lake, Aug.5\Voters should question Lonegan's principles\Regarding ""Lonegan would stick to his principles,"" (Page A-1, Aug. 6):\Republican voters have to ask, which principles?\Steve Lonegan is silent on the issue of federal taxation. I wonder why? In the 2009 gubernatorial primary campaign, Lonegan supported a massive income-tax hike on low- and middle-income families with his call for a flat income tax. Does Lonegan still support tax hikes on low- and middle-income families?\Lonegan claims to be a staunch civil libertarian, opposing the National Security Agency's unconstitutional surveillance program against the American people. However, he supported President Bush's Patriot Act, an egregious violation of the American people's civil liberties. Lonegan is also quoted as saying, ""America cannot, and should not, and is not the police force for the rest of the world.""\Yet, Lonegan supported the Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq.\Lonegan's latest principle is supporting a ban on gambling outside of Atlantic City. He therefore is a proponent of crony capitalism, the antithesis supposedly of fiscal conservatives, independents and others whose votes he is seeking in the U.S. Senate Republican primary.\The bottom line: Lonegan will say what he thinks he needs to say to win votes. His opponent, Alieta Eck, is a proven fiscal conservative and a defender of individual liberty, and she will stick to her principles of limited government and local solutions to health care and other issues.\Murray Sabrin\Fort Lee, Aug. 6\The writer has been a candidate for state office as a Republican and a libertarian.\Don't forget slain Lodi police officers\It soon will be 50 years since the residents of Bergen County learned the true meaning of crime, criminals and the faults of our judicial system.\For those too young to remember, I am referring to the murders of two Lodi police officers: Detective Sgt. Peter Voto and Probationary Officer Gary Tedesco.\If you say ""Dealey Plaza,"" you are talking about Dallas and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Likewise, in northern New Jersey, if you say ""the Angel Lounge in Lodi,"" you are talking about what happened to two police officers on Aug. 26, 1963. What actually occurred in the bar is not worth detailing other than the fact that Voto and Tedesco were killed.\One of the killers died in a shootout with police in New York City. But the other, Thomas Trantino, spent 38 years in prison at taxpayers' expense before being paroled in 2001.\God bless the Voto and Tedesco families and every police officer who protects us.\Rich Delotto\Clifton, Aug. 6\We can't ignore illegal cycling\Regarding ""Some bikers hog the road"" (Your Views, Aug. 3):\As a local driver and frequent commuter through Alpine on 9W, I'd like to add to the letter writer's observations.\Politely tooting my horn at two, three or four cyclists riding across the road has often elicited an obscene gesture and/or a refusal to move into single file.\There were numerous signs on 9W from Englewood to the state line three years ago that said ""Bicyclists: Single File."" But they were removed and changed to ""Share the Road.""\Big mistake. This misleads many cyclists to take charge of the full roadway. There's a camera at the intersection of Closter Dock Road and 9W, which could be used to observe cyclists running the red light, but they would need a license plate to be identified.\Bicyclists over the age of 18 should have insurance, like motorcyclists, since they are on moving two-wheeled vehicles and can cause accidents. Having no insurance makes the auto driver's insurance liable.\Adult bicyclists should study state bicycling and road laws, take a written test, obey the laws and get the same tickets and fines for offenses as drivers of motor vehicles do. If they get 12 points, they lose their right to cycle.\Something has to be done to curb the overwhelming illegal cycling habits.\Chris Rover\Cresskill, Aug. 6"
230,"Thanks to the APP for the article of Aug. 13 titled ""Five signs that climate change is starting in New Jersey."" This article should be a clarion call to action by the public and elected leaders. Unfortunately, because of our current combustion of fossil fuels, we are already committed to a changing climate that has significantly impacted our environment, health and society, and will continue to do so for many generations.\The APP article states that there is some uncertainty what to do given the administration's withdrawal from the Paris Accord. But actions can be taken now by our elected local, state and federal officials. For example, municipal leaders can commit to using 100 percent renewable energy sources, encourage local development of solar and wind farms, and adopt sustainable coastal and environmental management policies. Our state and federal representatives can adopt policies to reduce fossil fuel use such as a carbon tax and dividend program as proposed by former Secretary of State George Shultz and former White House Chief of Staff James Baker. Our members of Congress can join the Climate Solutions Caucus.\But first and foremost, strong leadership is needed.\To this end, our elected officials should be telling constituents very clearly whether they agree or disagree that the climate is changing due to human activities, and their current and future actions. Many of our elected officials have acknowledged climate change and are acting now (kudos!), but unfortunately some have not.\Mark Fukayama\Marlboro\NRA is to blame for\events in Charlottesville\The contemptible events in Charlottesville this weekend were exactly what the NRA leadership has been working toward. To say this isn't an NRA issue because nobody was shot would be an dangerous error. Their tactics are simple: Stoke rage and fear into one group to sell them guns. Then, advertise to the other group and convince them to buy guns as protection from the first group. Their goal is to divide and cash in!\They are using us like puppets, and many NRA members are resigning because the leadership does not represent them any more.\The NRA paid $30 million for Donald Trump. His lack of clarity on this issue is not a mistake. Today's radicalized NRA was not the only reason for the violence this weekend, but it wouldn't have happened without them.\Brett Sabo\Red Bank"

Our energy challenges require a major shift in our economic activity so that all of us fundamentally change our behavior.\The market costs of producing and consuming fossil fuels must increase either through a comprehensive carbon tax or cap-and-trade policy to reflect their non-market costs such as environmental damage.

This combination of policy changes will shift economic activity away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner energy resources and economic growth.\Since lower-income families spend a greater percentage of their income on energy than wealthier families, policy-makers need to also make sure that vulnerable communities are protected from higher direct costs.

233,"HARRISON\I'm a selfish person. I don't volunteer time or much money to charities. I don't like to recycle. I drive everywhere I go. I consume more than my share of material and energy, and I waste even more.\Basically, I'm like a lot of Americans.\Author Ayn Rand wrote about the virtues of selfishness - not self-interest at the expense of others, but merely a rational priority for one's own well-being. But while I'm not sure if Rand's philosophy is the best way to run a society, I'm completely perplexed by the current cynical, self-destructive debate over something in everyone's interest: The environment.\When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported last month that it was 90 percent certain human activity has contributed to the rise in global temperatures, the scorn spewing from so-called conservative talk radio was both expected and befuddling.\Hundreds of scientists from 113 countries predicted the likelihood of hotter days, longer heat waves, the depletion of the polar ice caps, the rise in sea level and more intense tropical storms. Next month the IPCC will present a report predicting that in a few decades hundreds of millions of people won't have enough water, tens of millions will be flooded out of their homes and tropical diseases and starvation will spread.\Partisan apparatchicks like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity mock these pronouncements as Chicken Little hysteria, choosing instead to parrot the denials of oil-company-sponsored scientists and the guy who wrote that book about dinosaurs coming back to terrorize people.\I'm not about to debate the science here. I suppose there's a chance that the most authoritative and independent body of scientists in the world have it all wrong. The Earth's temperature has always fluctuated. And even the IPCC admits there isn't likely much we can do to fix the problem any time soon. But does that mean we shouldn't try?\Those who attack environmentalists as tree-hugging hippies continue to tell complacent Americans what they want to hear. They show them the world as they already imagine it to be, singing poisonous lullabies while ignoring some perfectly convenient truths.\Pollution is bad. It might not make short-term business sense to curtail industry to stave off the pollution that contributes to global warming. It might be impossible to force India and China to limit their growing, voracious energy needs. But no economy can exist without healthy ecology. Everything we eat, the air we breathe, the trucks we fill and the televisions we watch - everything requires clean, thriving oceans, streams and forests.\Corporations live from quarter-to-quarter, worrying little about where they dump their chemical waste or how much they deplete shared resources. But only sustainable ecosystems can sustain an economy. Shouldn't this be a major tenet of true conservatism? Sure, some environmental groups take their agenda too far and give the whole endeavor a bad name. But does it make sense to stymie environmentalism for partisan or short-sighted business reasons?\A recent Fox News poll showed that 82 percent of people believe global warming exists, though a Gallup poll shows most people think the impact will be far in the future. Maybe a little hysteria can help motivate individuals and nations to act in their own interests.\I'll leave solutions to smarter people, though a cap on emissions and a carbon tax to stem oil consumption and spark clean fuel innovations could be a good start. Even if we can't stop global warming, we can certainly make our planet safer, cleaner and more efficient while ending our addiction to oil found in Middle Eastern countries that foment religious wars.\Selfish?

235,"Last month, Gov. Chris Christie announced that he's pulling New Jersey out of the nation's only intrastate, cap-and-trade compact to limit the emission of greenhouse gases from power plants in the Northeast. New Jersey joined what became the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2005.\RGGI's goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 10-state region 10 percent by 2018. Christie contends that RGGI isn't working and that it constitutes nothing more than an added tax on energy suppliers that hurts consumers and businesses. Democrats in the Legislature are moving forward with legislation to try to stop Christie from pulling the state out of RGGI.\We at the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce agree with Gov. Chris Christie's decision to pull New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) for two major reasons: The two-year-old program was not effective in cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, and the program ultimately contributed to higher energy prices for residents and businesses in New Jersey.\Make no mistake about it: The high cost of energy in New Jersey is a sensitive issue for companies considering moving to or expanding in New Jersey.\When we poll our member companies and ask them what issues are impediments to their operations in New Jersey, steep energy costs consistently rank among the top three, along with the cost of health insurance and taxes.\New Jersey's commercial and industrial customers pay among the highest energy rates in the nation, partly because of the taxes paid by power plant owners in New Jersey under RGGI's cap-and-trade system.\As our economy continues to struggle, it is incumbent upon our leaders to revisit policies that stifle economic growth. In this case, Christie's goal is to reduce energy rates and make them comparable to costs in other regions and states -- important steps for encouraging economic growth.\Still, the governor is to be commended for not ignoring the need for clean energy. In fact, he reiterated -- with the state chamber's endorsement -- that he would prohibit any kind of new coal-fired power plants in New Jersey. Further, his plan calls for the state to focus on developing solar projects on brownfields and landfills, encourage the construction of natural gas power plants and develop a program to conserve energy in state facilities.\The state Chamber of Commerce will continue to get behind a number of initiatives to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including new technologies such as fuel cells and offshore wind. And we will push for policy that encourages developers of these technologies to locate here in New Jersey, where we have the thinkers to advance those fields and the highly skilled workers to manufacture their products.\In addition, nuclear energy must play a role in the clean energy solution. Nuclear power has one of the lowest impacts on the environment of any energy source because it does not emit air pollution.\Yes, there have been reduced emissions in recent years. It has been attributed, not to RGGI, but to reductions in energy use that came with the downturn in the economy and an increase in the use of natural gas.\Only 10 Northeastern states chose to be part of RGGI, while states including our neighboring Pennsylvania declined. Because Pennsylvania relies more on fossil fuels such as dirty coal, energy costs there are lower, making it more business-friendly than New Jersey. Pennsylvania and other states in the Midwest can offer their energy at lower prices because they were never mandated to pay RGGI's carbon tax.\If we are to have a level playing field when it comes to addressing energy, it must be a nationwide, not a piecemeal, approach. Otherwise, states outside our region will continue to run older, more polluting power plants and offer energy at rock-bottom prices with no environmental benefit to any of us.\Michael\Egenton\ID_Code: CN201110306190021"
236,"If he is elected to the Senate, Newark Mayor Cory Booker says he will bring a spirit of ""entrepreneurship"" that the federal government lacks.\As mayor of New Jersey's largest city, Booker said, he has worked outside the typical boundaries of government, and he promises to bring that ""innovation"" to the Senate.\In a meeting with The Record's editorial board Tuesday, Booker framed many of the country's major problems -- including education, the environment, crime and health care -- around his experiences working in urban areas.\""There's no urban agenda being talked about at the national level,"" he said.\Booker said many of his accomplishments came from going beyond ""my statutory duties as mayor"" -- partnering with non-profits and businesses to create programs outside the normal city government.\""One of the best things that we decided to do early on was we said that we can't just do a mayor's job as the statutes of this state give us,"" he said. ""We've got to be entrepreneurial, we've got to be innovative and we've got to figure out ways of getting things done that people might think are very unorthodox.""\In one example he cited, the city worked with other groups to encourage residents to report illegal guns. The program allowed a resident to anonymously report a firearm, and if police confiscated the gun, the person who reported it could go to an ATM and withdraw $1,000 using a code provided by the system.\""That's a great innovation,"" Booker said. ""You can't do it with government because, as you all know, there are a whole bunch of reporting requirements for the transfer of funds.""\The mayor is running in the Aug. 13 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, trying to defeat Rep. Frank Pallone, Rep. Rush Holt and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver. The winner will go on to an Oct. 16 special election Governor Christie called after Sen. Frank Lautenberg died last month.\Booker's opponents have suggested he sounds good but does not deliver, and they criticize his celebrity status - he boasts 1.4 million Twitter followers and has made more than $1.3 million since 2008 giving speeches around the country.\At a campaign event with Pallone on Monday, Senator Lautenberg's widow, Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg, said that ""being great on TV and raising money outside the state doesn't mean that you're going to be the most effective in the United States Senate.""\But Booker argued that his celebrity would help him build political capital and alliances in the Senate faster than his opponents could.\""I've been told time and time again, 'You're going to be a different kind of freshman senator,' "" he said. ""My ability to go in there and ... create partnerships, from Day One, will be significant.""\He also used Englebardt Lautenberg's criticism against his opponents.\""I listen to my opponents say, 'I voted for,' 'I stood up for.' 'Well, to me it's about getting things done,"" he said. ""There is a groundwork for someone different coming in: different perspectives, different life experiences""\On education, Booker said America needs to fix its system of ""educational apartheid"" that generally determines children's outcomes based on their neighborhood, rather than their effort or ability.\""Kids born into certain ZIP codes will most likely have certain educational outcomes,"" he said. ""And we've got to end that. If we end that, we explode economic development.""\Booker argued that pollution is a problem for urban residents.\""I represent an area that lives with the daily agony of the environmental mistakes of the past,"" he said. Newark residents are ""separated from nature"" because pollution prevents them from planting gardens in the city's soil or fishing in the water. But he said he has not formed an opinion on the carbon tax that Holt proposed to try to fight global warming.\For Social Security, Booker said he opposes raising the retirement age for most people in the country - except, perhaps, for people in their 20s or younger - because the country made promises to them.\And he says the government has gone too far in its surveillance programs, but he called Holt's position that Congress should throw out the Patriot Act and start over ""a little irresponsible."""

239,"MALWITZ\I'm a selfish person. I don't volunteer time or much money to charities. I don't like to recycle. I drive everywhere I go. I consume more than my share of material and energy, and I waste even more.\Basically, I'm like a lot of Americans.\Author Ayn Rand wrote about the virtues of selfishness - not self-interest at the expense of others, but merely a rational priority for one's own well-being. But while I'm not sure if Rand's philosophy is the best way to run a society, I'm completely perplexed by the current cynical, self-destructive debate over something in everyone's interest: The environment.\When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported last month that it was 90 percent certain human activity has contributed to the rise in global temperatures, the scorn spewing from so-called conservative talk radio was both expected and befuddling.\Hundreds of scientists from 113 countries predicted the likelihood of hotter days, longer heat waves, the depletion of the polar ice caps, the rise in sea level and more intense tropical storms. Next month the IPCC will present a report predicting that in a few decades hundreds of millions of people won't have enough water, tens of millions will be flooded out of their homes and tropical diseases and starvation will spread.\Partisan apparatchicks like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity mock these pronouncements as Chicken Little hysteria, choosing instead to parrot the denials of oil-company-sponsored scientists and the guy who wrote that book about dinosaurs coming back to terrorize people.\I'm not about to debate the science here. I suppose there's a chance that the most authoritative and independent body of scientists in the world have it all wrong. The Earth's temperature has always fluctuated. And even the IPCC admits there isn't likely much we can do to fix the problem any time soon. But does that mean we shouldn't try?\Those who attack environmentalists as tree-hugging hippies continue to tell complacent Americans what they want to hear. They show them the world as they already imagine it to be, singing poisonous lullabies while ignoring some perfectly convenient truths.\Pollution is bad. It might not make short-term business sense to curtail industry to stave off the pollution that contributes to global warming. It might be impossible to force India and China to limit their growing, voracious energy needs. But no economy can exist without healthy ecology. Everything we eat, the air we breathe, the trucks we fill and the televisions we watch - everything requires clean, thriving oceans, streams and forests.\Corporations live from quarter-to-quarter, worrying little about where they dump their chemical waste or how much they deplete shared resources. But only sustainable ecosystems can sustain an economy. Shouldn't this be a major tenet of true conservatism? Sure, some environmental groups take their agenda too far and give the whole endeavor a bad name. But does it make sense to stymie environmentalism for partisan or short-sighted business reasons?\A recent Fox News poll showed that 82 percent of people believe global warming exists, though a Gallup poll shows most people think the impact will be far in the future. Maybe a little hysteria can help motivate individuals and nations to act in their own interests.\I'll leave solutions to smarter people, though a cap on emissions and a carbon tax to stem oil consumption and spark clean fuel innovations could be a good start. Even if we can't stop global warming, we can certainly make our planet safer, cleaner and more efficient while ending our addiction to oil found in Middle Eastern countries that foment religious wars.\Selfish? That's the idea.\Rick Harrison looks forward to globally warming himself at the beach and can be reached in the interim at rharrison@thnt.com and (732) 565-7259."
240," IN A TIME of increasing environmental awareness, arguments over combating global warming often exhibit the fallacy of all-or-nothing thinking.\ Some people seem to feel that our high-technology society can lead the world in restoring the atmosphere to pre-industrial purity. Others maintain that nothing should be done about reducing man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases until science can prove beyond a doubt that they are warming the planet. Neither viewpoint is realistic.\ In the first place, those who insist that the United States and other developed nations have a solemn obligation to foot the bill for massive reductions in greenhouse gases, such as clamping a tax on the use of fossil fuels, fail to grasp the dimensions of the problem. Given that China and India alone will soon produce half the world's greenhouse gases, a global warming treaty without their participation would be futile. Moreover, if developing countries are let off the hook and are not required to reduce emissions, the huge cost imposed on America's energy-intensive industries would result in the export of much of their production to countries without pollution controls.\ Yet, although there is plenty of talk about a climate treaty's national impact, we must remember that environmental policy is felt first and foremost at the local level. In that respect, New Jersey is squarely in the crosshairs.\ Independent studies point to severe economic consequences for industries in our state from efforts to force down carbon dioxide emissions, especially if it's done by imposing a $200-per-ton carbon tax. Such a tax, a DRI/McGraw Hill study determined, would cost New Jersey tens of thousands of jobs.\ This does not mean that we should hope for the best and do nothing about reducing greenhouse emissions. A National Academy of Sciences study has predicted that without remedial action, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise and that this rise could cause an increase in average global temperature. But scientists concede they can make only educated guesses about the regional effects of possible climate change.\ Inasmuch as the effects of rising emissions remain uncharted territory, we should steer clear of any strategy that requires heavy costs or commits us to a single line of action. Simply put, we should follow ""Lewis and Clark planning,"" after the famous explorers who set out nearly 200 years ago to chart the territory west of the Mississippi River. Faced with enormous uncertainty, they gathered information, took a limited number of steps, reassessed, and then repeated the process. They proceeded - and succeeded - by taking incremental steps, each of them based on new and better information. We should adopt measures that will make long-term economic and environmental sense even if the current concern over global warming turns out to be misplaced.\ A good start would be to shift toward more efficient coal and natural-gas-fired electric generation plants. Renewing the operating licenses of nuclear power plants, the only major source of energy that emits no greenhouse gases, also makes good sense. And there needs to be increased research into alternative energy sources.\ Above all, every effort should be made to transfer the energy efficiency ethic that has taken hold in the United States and other advanced nations to the developing world. Hundreds of new electro-technologies, ranging from electric arc furnaces for steel-making to infrared heating and drying systems, can replace the direct burning of fossil fuels, thereby reducing greenhouse emissions.\ Toward this end, why not encourage our national laboratories to develop new electro-technolgies that boost productivity and profitability and lower greenhouse emissions? Transferring the results of such research to the private sector would position U.S. firms to capture a large share of what could become a huge global market, regardless of whether global warming is or is not happening. In the end, the only certainty is that the issues will look different in 10 years than they look today. Just as Lewis and Clark were never able to predict all the twists and turns of their route, so the ability of scientists to consider the permutations of greenhouse gases on the climate is limited in the extreme.\ Nevertheless, we must be protected against the possibility of global warming. Something can be done about it now, if we take practical steps that work to the benefit of our economy and environment.\ Benjamin Stevenson is an associate professor of physics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark."
241,"Last month, Gov. Chris Christie announced that he's pulling New Jersey out of the nation's only intrastate, cap-and-trade compact to limit the emission of greenhouse gases from power plants in the Northeast. New Jersey joined what became the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2005.\RGGI's goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 10-state region 10 percent by 2018. Christie contends that RGGI isn't working and that it constitutes nothing more than an added tax on energy suppliers that hurts consumers and businesses. Democrats in the Legislature are moving forward with legislation to try to stop Christie from pulling the state out of RGGI.\We at the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce agree with Gov. Chris Christie's decision to pull New Jersey out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) for two major reasons: The two-year-old program was not effective in cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, and the program ultimately contributed to higher energy prices for residents and businesses in New Jersey.\Make no mistake about it: The high cost of energy in New Jersey is a sensitive issue for companies considering moving to or expanding in New Jersey.\When we poll our member companies and ask them what issues are impediments to their operations in New Jersey, steep energy costs consistently rank among the top three, along with the cost of health insurance and taxes.\New Jersey's commercial and industrial customers pay among the highest energy rates in the nation, partly because of the taxes paid by power plant owners in New Jersey under RGGI's cap-and-trade system.\As our economy continues to struggle, it is incumbent upon our leaders to revisit policies that stifle economic growth. In this case, Christie's goal is to reduce energy rates and make them comparable to costs in other regions and states -- important steps for encouraging economic growth.\Still, the governor is to be commended for not ignoring the need for clean energy. In fact, he reiterated -- with the state chamber's endorsement -- that he would prohibit any kind of new coal-fired power plants in New Jersey. Further, his plan calls for the state to focus on developing solar projects on brownfields and landfills, encourage the construction of natural gas power plants and develop a program to conserve energy in state facilities.\The state Chamber of Commerce will continue to get behind a number of initiatives to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including new technologies such as fuel cells and offshore wind. And we will push for policy that encourages developers of these technologies to locate here in New Jersey, where we have the thinkers to advance those fields and the highly skilled workers to manufacture their products.\In addition, nuclear energy must play a role in the clean energy solution. Nuclear power has one of the lowest impacts on the environment of any energy source because it does not emit air pollution.\Yes, there have been reduced emissions in recent years. It has been attributed, not to RGGI, but to reductions in energy use that came with the downturn in the economy and an increase in the use of natural gas.\Only 10 Northeastern states chose to be part of RGGI, while states including our neighboring Pennsylvania declined. Because Pennsylvania relies more on fossil fuels such as dirty coal, energy costs there are lower, making it more business-friendly than New Jersey. Pennsylvania and other states in the Midwest can offer their energy at lower prices because they were never mandated to pay RGGI's carbon tax.\If we are to have a level playing field when it comes to addressing energy, it must be a nationwide, not a piecemeal, approach. Otherwise, states outside our region will continue to run older, more polluting power plants and offer energy at rock-bottom prices with no environmental benefit to any of us.\Michael\Egenton\ID_Code: B3201110306190024"

The power provided by the array is equal to that used by 600 homes and will provide 80 percent of the power needed by the fulfillment center, which provides over 2,000 local jobs.\In addition to its fulfillment center solarization projects, Amazon has pledged to move 100 percent of the power for its web services to renewable sources.\I also appreciate the efforts of Congressman Frank Pallone, who has been a vigorous advocate for the solar energy tax credits that helped convince Amazon to install the array in our community now, rather than waiting until the cost of solar power drops even more. To help our entire country move more quickly to renewable energy, I hope Congress can institute a national, refundable or revenue-neutral carbon tax, as proposed by Citizens Climate Lobby.\With refund checks to every household, it's projected that CCL's proposal would lead to an increase of 2 million jobs over 20 years, while reducing air pollution and carbon emissions. Ultimately to deal with climate change I think we will also need to recognize that we live on a finite world, and must not only find technological fixes to the climate problem, but replace our present high-growth, high-consumption economic model with new and better ways of providing a good life for all of us\Philippa Solomon\EDISON\Springsteen on Broadway a huge disappointment\Regarding the recent ticket sales for Bruce Springsteen on Broadway, a big thanks to Springsteen and Ticketmaster for squashing my dreams, and the dreams of many other fans who have been shut out.\Like so many other dedicated Bruce followers, I have been a Springsteen fan for a long time, since I turned 13 years old, having attended countless shows in different states throughout the U.S. And I have been fortunate to spend summer nights at the Stone Pony when Bruce would show up and play with whoever was on the bill that night. I have also chatted with him on the streets of Red Bank, and have enjoyed a great fan/rock star relationship for more than 40 years.\Fast forward to 2017 and the announcement of his new show on Broadway. How exciting! Yes, exciting, indeed, until I have to be confirmed as a ""verified fan"" by Ticketmaster. Then, I am put on ""standby"" for both rounds of ticket sales -- not even given a chance to buy tickets. Isn't not giving someone a chance to achieve their dream against the principles which guide Springsteen and which he preaches in his songs? And then to find tickets are available on third-party sites for exorbitant prices? Sorry, but some of us have mortgages to pay.\I understand the protocols were put in place to discourage scalpers. And I also understand that the theatre is small and demand is high. But not giving someone a fair chance to be part of something so spectacular has left me disillusioned and brokenhearted.\Diane Portantiere\BRADLEY BEACH"
243,"Compromise on pensions\The Legislature in June passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan effort a bill that would require the state to make pension contributions quarterly -- in July, October, January and April.\The governor quickly vetoed the bill.\There is a compromise now available that will both meet the desire of the Legislature for quarterly pension payments and satisfy the governor's requisite that expenditure of funds match the fiscal realities of revenue collections.\The governor signed a $32.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2015. The previous pension reform law signed by this governor in 2011 required a $2.25 billion pension payment for 2015, which represents 6.9 percent of the overall budget. If the governor wants expenditures to match revenues, he simply needs to make quarterly pension payments equal to 6.9 percent of the state's overall revenues for each quarter.\If the governor's argument is that revenues come in uneven throughout the year, that's fine, as long as each quarterly pension payment is equal to 6.9 percent of that quarter's total revenue. At the end of the fiscal year, the state will have then met its pension obligations. In this scenario, if there is a ""blindsiding"" economic meltdown late in the budget year, the state at least will have paid the first three quarters with actual revenues -- not wished-for money.\I would ask Democratic leaders to consider amending the bills in question, S-2265 and A-3487, in the suggested manner. This plan meets the governor's requirement to ""properly match the timing of large annual expenditures with the timing of the actual receipt of state revenues,"" fulfills the Legislature's desire for quarterly pension payments, and follows the law passed in the 2011 pension reforms.\Edward Buttimore\Cedar Grove, Aug. 15\The writer is a former administrator of investigations in the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, Criminal Division.\Obama wrong about offshore exploration\The Obama administration recently announced the authorization of the use of sonic cannons along the Eastern Seaboard, from Florida to Maine, for oil and gas exploration.\This is the first time in decades that the area would be opened. The cannons shoot sound waves and allow companies to locate oil and gas deposits. Sadly, these sound waves are 100 times louder than a jet engine and could harm or kill 138,000 sea mammals such as dolphins, turtles and whales.\This is certainly not what we need to be doing. Instead, the administration should be announcing federally subsidized rebates for solar panels and a revenue-neutral carbon tax.\Did you ever watch a dolphin as it gracefully arcs in the water, or a whale as it surfaces?

245,"Superstorm Sandy and the 2012 drought drove home the need for President Barack Obama to lead the fight against global warming. Freed from the political constraints of the re-election campaign, he holds three tools.\Wielding them successfully, he will make bold action against the world's most pressing environmental problem a legacy of his second term.\The president can sharply curtail power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, the largest global warming pollutant, by using existing law to require that utilities start converting from coal to cleanly extracted natural gas and introduce more renewable energy. To cut demand for electricity, he can set standards that increase the efficiency of power-gobbling appliances.\But scientists warn that far more will be necessary. The deadly storm, devastating drought and 332 consecutive months of above-average global temperatures are just the sort of conditions they say will accompany global warming.\So, taking a page from the nation's first environmental president, Theodore Roosevelt, Obama can use his third tool -- the bully pulpit -- to change the political climate on climate. He must mobilize public pressure on Congress to adopt far-reaching measures that he cannot enact on his own, including steps that begin to end our addiction to oil.\Certainly, passing such legislation will be a challenge in the toxic political arena. But even before Sandy struck, 77 percent of those surveyed in September by the Yale Project on Climate Change said global warming should be a priority of the president and Congress. Leveraging such broad support into pressure on the House and Senate, Obama can demand strong congressional action, from phasing in renewable energy to phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels.\And if we are really serious about breaking our reliance on coal and oil, Congress must enact a carbon tax. It would discourage reliance on fossil fuels and raise revenue, helping to solve another problem. Only a concerted campaign by the president that builds on public concern about global warming will generate the necessary support.\Scientists at the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warn that the world must cut carbon dioxide emissions more than 80 percent by 2050 or face dramatically higher seas, the spread of tropical diseases and more severe floods and droughts.\The United States has a special responsibility to act. Burning coal, oil or natural gas creates carbon dioxide. Cumulatively, we have pumped more of it into the atmosphere than any other nation. And more than any other nation, we have the affordable solutions to cut this planet-threatening pollution.\Obama understands the need to protect America from what on election night he called ""the destructive power of a warming planet."" Last summer, he ordered that new cars in 2025 average 54.5 mpg, the biggest single step any nation has taken against global warming.\The decision demonstrates how a president can use congressionally authorized executive powers. Under the Clean Air Act, he is cutting automobiles' carbon dioxide emissions by 570 million metric tons annually by 2030.\By using the same legislation to force the power industry to phase out the dirtiest fossil fuel, replacing coal with natural gas and, increasingly, solar and wind power, he can more than match the auto program's emissions reductions.\Appliance standards have cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than 200 million metric tons since 1990. Extending more stringent standards under federal energy laws to such ubiquitous items as televisions and their set-top boxes, water heaters and electric motors, among others, could nearly double those savings by 2035, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project.\This would cut electricity consumption by 7 percent, the equivalent of shutting 49 coal-fired power plants. The technology to deliver more efficient appliances is sitting on manufacturers' shelves.\The goal: We lower demand for electricity by improving efficiency to the point that the sun and wind meet most of our electricity needs, as outlined in a 2007 report by the American Solar Energy Society.\These steps will also help the economy. Just as improving automobile efficiency saves oil and cuts costs at the pump, reducing energy waste lowers household and business bills. And the production of green energy technology will create good jobs.\With the nation reeling from Sandy and the public favoring action, what better time than now for the politically secure president to take full advantage of the executive and persuasive powers of his office?\In his first term, Obama cemented his legacy protecting the health of individual Americans. By cutting emissions and setting an example that will lead other nations, the president can seal his second-term legacy: protecting the health of the planet.\Dan Becker directs the Safe Climate Campaign.

246,"How is it possible that BP chief executive Tony Hayward hasn't beenfired? At this point, how can anyone believe a word the man says? If he told me my mother loves me, I'd want a second source.\Hayward has apologized for his one lapse of candor -- the now-famous whine last Sunday that ""I'd like my life back."" It must be a nice life indeed: According to Forbes, Hayward's total compensation from BP in 2009 was about $4.6 million. The Louisiana fishermen who've been put out of work by the oil spill are accustomed to getting by on considerably less. In a Facebook posting, Hayward said his callous words ""don't represent how I feel about this tragedy, and certainly don't represent the hearts of the people of BP.""\Within hours, though, Hayward's foot was firmly lodged in his mouth yet again. The effort to contain the oil and keep it away from the Gulf Coast has been ""very successful,"" he told the Financial Times. ""Considering how big this has been, very little has got away from us.""\This sunny assessment came as television networks broadcast images of oil-soaked Louisiana marshes, where hazmat-suited workers -- who said they were under orders from BP not to talk to the media, on pain of getting fired -- were trying to sop up the mess with what looked like rags, as if this were a gargantuan kitchen mishap.\Meanwhile, mousse-like clumps of ""weathered"" oil were being washed onto beaches in Alabama, and authorities in Florida were watching the approach of a menacing, oily sheen. Scientists have not even begun to assess the potential long-term effects of the oil spill on human health, marine life and coastal ecology.\Carol Browner, the president's chief adviser on energy and the environment, said that the Deepwater Horizon incident is already the worst environmental disaster in United States history.\Give yourself another pat on the back, Tony.\Adm. Thad Allen, who is directing the response effort, is a nice guy -- in terms of his public handling of BP, too nice. On Thursday, as BP proceeded with its latest attempt to cap the flow, Allen praised the company for providing several different camera views of the action on the sea floor. But for weeks, BP refused to make public any television images of the oil leak, and relented only under pressure from U.S. officials.\Hayward's statements about the effort to plug the well have been consistently unreliable, and it hardly matters whether he's being deliberately misleading or just overly optimistic. The giant containment dome was going to work; it didn't. The second, much smaller containment dome would do the job; it was never even deployed. The ""top kill"" procedure was surely going to stop the flow, and early indications, according to Hayward, showed it was succeeding. Yet oil industry veterans such as T. Boone Pickens said the top kill was a long shot at best, and they were right.\And as for those giant underwater oil plumes that scientists and journalists keep discovering? Hayward denies they exist. His position is that of a philanderer caught in the act by an irate spouse: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?""\Since the explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig six weeks ago, BP's stock has lost more than a third of its value. Two ratings firms, Fitch and Moody's, have downgraded the company's long-term debt, and estimates of what it will finally cost BP to stop the leak and clean up its mess range from $3 billion to $30 billion. All this happened on Hayward's watch.\Somebody, please, give the man his life back.\But once that's done, let's turn our ire on the real villains. This exercise will require a mirror.\An accident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout was bound to happen sooner or later. There are nearly 4,000 oil rigs off the Gulf Coast, and those pumping most of the crude are in deep waters -- where, as we now know, state-of-the-art safety procedures are inadequate. President Barack Obama's moratorium on deep-water drilling will last only long enough for some sort of technological band-aid to be devised. Then we'll crank up the drills once again.\We know that our dependence on oil is ultimately ruinous, yet we refuse to take measures -- a meaningful carbon tax, for example -- to ease it. Long after Tony Hayward answers for his sins, we'll be paying for our own.\Eugene Robinson is a nationally syndicated columnist."
247," PARIS Forty-five nations answered France's call Saturday for a new environmental body to slow inevitable global warming and protect the planet, perhaps with policing powers to punish violators.\ Absent were the world's heavyweight polluter, the United States, and booming nations on the same path as the U.S. China and India.\ The charge led by French President Jacques Chirac came a day after the release of an authoritative and disturbingly grim scientific report in Paris that said global warming is ""very likely"" caused by mankind and that climate change will continue for centuries even if heat-trapping gases are reduced. It was the strongest language ever used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose last report was issued in 2001.\ The document, a collaboration of hundreds of scientists and government officials, was approved by 113 nations, including the United States.\ Despite the report's dire outlook, most scientists say the worst disasters huge sea-level rises and the most catastrophic storms and droughts may be avoided if strong action is taken soon.\ In his call to action at a French-sponsored environment conference on Saturday, Chirac said, ""It is our responsibility. The future of humanity demands it.""\ Without naming the United States producer of about one-quarter of the world's greenhouse gases Chirac expressed frustration that ""some large, rich countries still must be convinced."" They are ""refusing to accept the consequences of their acts,"" he said.\ So far, it is mostly European nations that agreed to pursue plans for the new organization, and to hold their first meeting in Morocco this spring.\ Chirac, 74, is seeking to leave his mark on international affairs before he leaves office, likely in May, though his own environmental record over 12 years as France's president is spotty.\ Former Vice President Al Gore, whose Oscar-nominated documentary on the perils of global warming has garnered worldwide attention, cheered Chirac's efforts.\ ""We are at a tipping point,"" Gore told the conference by videophone. ""We must act, and act swiftly. ... Such action requires international cooperation.""\ The world's scientists and other international leaders also said now that the science is so well-documented, action is clearly the next step.\ ""It is time now to hear from the world's policymakers,"" Tim Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation, said Friday. ""The so-called and long-overstated 'debate' about global warming is now over.""\ Granger Morgan, an energy expert at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States predicted the new climate report ""will kick a few more folks to get onboard.""\ And Jason Grumet, head of U.S. bipartisan advocacy group the National Commission on Energy Policy, said: ""The debate has clearly shifted from a battle over the science to fighting over the scope and design of the solution.""\ However, many questions remain about Chirac's proposed new environmental body, including whether it would have the power to enforce global climate accords.\ Chirac's appeal says only that the group should ""evaluate ecological damage"" and ""support the implementation of environmental decisions.""\ Many countries have failed to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions laid out in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The United States has never ratified the pact. And on Friday, the Bush administration reiterated its rejection of imposed cuts on greenhouse gases.\ Last week, Chirac warned in a published interview that the United States could face a carbon tax on its exports if it does not sign global climate accords.\ The European Union, which agreed to the Kyoto Protocol curbing emissions, has committed to a 20 percent reduction in carbon pollution by 2020, said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. And if others join them, they could even try for 60 percent cuts by 2050, he said.\ The United Nations also is considering a summit of world leaders to tackle global warming, and de Boer said he would expect the United States to send high-ranking officials to it.\ Despite White House resistance to carbon-cutting measures with teeth, de Boer and Carnegie Mellon professor Morgan said they see movement in the United States anyway.\ ""We are certainly building critical mass among opinion leaders and non-technical folks,"" Morgan said from Pittsburgh, citing recent calls to action by corporate CEOs, even in the energy industry. ""We are at the point over the next three to five years where the U.S. is going to get quite serious about it."""
248,"I was appalled at a recent letter from Betty Ratliff (""Illegal immigrants a drain on our society,"" Sept. 9). It comes right out of Trump's playbook and is truly insensitive, assaulting and almost inhuman.\Regarding DACA, we are talking about 800,000 Americans who were brought here as young children because their living conditions were abominable in their parents' native countries. They have grown up as reliable citizens and are not the criminals, rapists, etc. as Trump painted them to be in his presidential campaign.\They are actually a help to the economy and learning to be good citizens. Our medical costs have risen because of greedy pharmaceutical companies and not people needing medical help.\Ms. Ratliff, you are correct. You have no empathy, compassion or humanity. Be they Latinos or other individuals, they should be given the same chances that all Americans are entitled to. Shame on you.\Maxine Stern\MONROE\Amazon doing its part\to help environment\In light of the current administration's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords and failure to heed the near universal warnings from scientists about global warming, it was heartening to read the Aug. 29 report on the opening of a 7.5 megawatt solar array atop the Amazon fulfillment center in Carteret. The power provided by the array is equal to that used by 600 homes and will provide 80 percent of the power needed by the fulfillment center, which provides over 2,000 local jobs.\In addition to its fulfillment center solarization projects, Amazon has pledged to move 100 percent of the power for its web services to renewable sources.\I also appreciate the efforts of U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, who has been a vigorous advocate for the solar energy tax credits that helped convince Amazon to install the array in our community now, rather than waiting until the cost of solar power drops even more. To help our entire country move more quickly to renewable energy, I hope Congress can institute a national, refundable or revenue-neutral carbon tax, as proposed by Citizens Climate Lobby.\With refund checks to every household, it's projected that CCL's proposal would lead to an increase of 2 million jobs over 20 years, while reducing air pollution and carbon emissions. Ultimately to deal with climate change I think we will also need to recognize that we live on a finite world, and must not only find technological fixes to the climate problem, but replace our present high-growth, high-consumption economic model with new and better ways of providing a good life for all of us\Philippa Solomon\EDISON\Springsteen on Broadway a huge disappointment\Regarding the recent ticket sales for Bruce Springsteen on Broadway, a big thanks to Springsteen and Ticketmaster for squashing my dreams, and the dreams of many other fans who have been shut out.\Like so many other dedicated Bruce followers, I have been a Springsteen fan for a long time, since I turned 13 years old, having attended countless shows in different states throughout the U.S. And I have been fortunate to spend summer nights at the Stone Pony when Bruce would show up and play with whoever was on the bill that night. I have also chatted with him on the streets of Red Bank, and have enjoyed a great fan/rock star relationship for more than 40 years.\Fast-forward to 2017 and the announcement of his new show on Broadway. How exciting! Yes, exciting, indeed, until I have to be confirmed as a ""verified fan"" by Ticketmaster. Then, I am put on ""standby"" for both rounds of ticket sales -- not even given a chance to buy tickets. Isn't not giving someone a chance to achieve their dream against the principles which guide Springsteen and which he preaches in his songs? And then to find tickets are available on third-party sites for exorbitant prices? Sorry, but some of us have mortgages to pay.\I understand the protocols were put in place to discourage scalpers. And I also understand that the theater is small and demand is high. But not giving someone a fair chance to be part of something so spectacular has left me disillusioned and brokenhearted.\Diane Portantiere\BRADLEY BEACH\Disaster relief no reason to rush tax reform\President Trump is using the tragedies of multiple hurricanes hitting the United States as an excuse to rush through Congress his plan to reform the country's income tax code.\Attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of people in order to circumvent the normal process of careful and systematic analysis of the impacts of making major changes to the tax code can only mean that his proposals would fail to stand up to the detailed scrutiny that normally accompanies such major legislation.\More importantly, unless President Trump releases all of his tax returns (which, during the campaign, he promised to do after the election), we can never know how much he and his family personally benefit from his proposals. Given that he has repeatedly used the office of the presidency for personal aggrandizement (doubling the membership fees at Mar-a-Lago, hosting foreign leaders at Trump hotels, using personal residences for meetings, even using photo ops to see hats!), we can only believe that his plan is less a ""Make America Great Again"" plan than a ""Let's Make the Trump Family Ever Richer"" plan.\Robert Checchio\DUNELLEN"
249,"""""Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator Sunday in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what AP's news story called the Bush administration's """"eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.\Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes\after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to\statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years\ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate\Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page\""""information note"" to """"facilitate discussions."" For example:\""""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly\goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG\(greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says\protectionism """"in the service of climate change objectives"" might\virtuously """"shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""\Furthermore, using """"border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might\virtuously """"impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by\domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a\cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers\might require foreign manufacturers """"to buy offsets at the border equal to\that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the\good been produced domestically.""\Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including\the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to\protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems\with one """"climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week The New\York Times front page carried this headline: """"The Bulb That Saved the\Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""\The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light\bulbs that almost all Americans ... all but those who are filling their\closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs ... will have to use\after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of\the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)\A San Francisco ... naturally ... couple emerged from Al Gore's movie """"An\Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act\locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the\compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. """"Instead\of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, """"they\wound up coping with a mess.""\Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, """"as\much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few\hours. Some experts, reports the Times, """"blame the government for the\quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted\manufacturers to use inferior components.\Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs\require """"a little insight and planning."" The Times says that """"may be an\understatement.""\The bulbs, says the Times, """"do not do well in hot places with little\airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work """"with\dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: """"Be aware that compact fluorescents\can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a\defect."" Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a\toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other\chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these\disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental\benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection\Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers\caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:\""""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15\minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff\paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the\area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed\glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA\recommends checking local rules.""\Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10\percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash.\Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol\industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?\George Will is a nationally syndicated columnist."
250,"PUBLIC HEARINGS: N.J. ENERGY MASTER PLAN\Construction crews at a solar farm in New Jersey's rural Salem County are aligning and angling 71,712 panels -- work intended to minimize glare and absorb more than 95 percent of available sunlight when the 20-megawatt Con Edison Development project is up to full generating power later this year.\The solar electric generating station on 100 acres in Pilesgrove Township is one of the largest such projects in the United States.\But New Jersey's standing as a leader in green energy -- only California has more solar projects -- may be in jeopardy, some fear, if Gov.

Thanks to thank all our supporters for helping to make 2006 -- and New Jersey -- a little greener, and to urge to join us for the fights ahead in 2007. We've had some big victories, such as getting one of the strongest clean energy standards in the country passed and winning more dedicated funding for our state and local parks. We've tackled some even bigger goals -- fighting to get Gov. Corzine to become a national leader to reduce global warming, and working to get more coastal waterways protected from runoff pollution. We'd like to share a few of our 2006 highlights, including:
\
-- Global warming solutions: We've had a lot of success this year building support for our Global Warming Solutions campaign, calling on Corzine to pledge to reduce New Jersey's global warming emissions by 70 percent by 2050 and to work with the state Legislature to pass the Global Warming Response Act requiring mandatory limits on total global warming emissions. We launched the campaign with a map of what New Jersey would look like in 2100 if we don't curb our global warming emissions. The map, based on a Princeton University study, shows that a predicted 2-foot to 4-foot sea level rise would cause all of our prized beaches and coastal treasures to be submerged or subject to chronic flooding. Over the summer, our citizen outreach staff knocked on tens of thousands of doors, collected more than 4,000 petition signatures, generated hundreds of calls into the governor's office and achieved extensive media coverage and editorial support. In September, we released ""A Blueprint for Action: Policy Options to Reduce New Jersey's Contribution to Global Warming."" The report, co-authored by advocate Suzanne Leta Liou and peer-reviewed by many of the state's leading global warming scientists and policy experts, details 11 policy strategies that can cut New Jersey's emissions of carbon dioxide -- the leading greenhouse gas -- by 7.4 percent below 2005 levels in the next two decades. In October and November, we worked to keep up the pressure on Corzine. We ran a series of radio ads, delivered thousands of additional petition signatures to the governor and built a broad coalition of scientists, businesses, elected officials, religious clergy and community leaders.
\
Save our shore: The Shore is one of the most treasured natural places in the state, but increasingly, development threatens to make its waters unsafe. As development booms along the rivers and streams that flow down to the Shore, pollution and contaminants in the form of runoff pollution make their way to New Jersey's coastal waters. Environment New Jersey is continuing the fight to put the banks of shore-bound rivers off limits to developers looking to build strip malls and subdivisions along waterways important to water quality at the shore. In November, we filed a legal petition with the state to formally protect the Toms River. The Toms River provides a great example of a pristine and important waterway at risk from runaway development. It flows through the New Jersey Pinelands, it is the largest tributary to Barnegat Bay, and it boasts great water quality. Its place in the middle of a high-growth part of the state, however, means that its waters are threatened as development moves closer and closer to its banks. By filing the petition, we've laid out the scientific case for the state to permanently protect this important waterway.

-- Parks and open space: This year we joined a broad coalition working to win new funding for state and local parks, as well as for open space preservation, called the Outdoor Recreational Alliance. Environment New Jersey worked with ORA's many outdoor clubs, fishing enthusiasts, land trust groups, urban community groups, and state and local environmental groups to win more than $150 million for the next 10 years in new funding to repair state and local parks in need of trail maintenance, ranger station repairs, bathroom facilities and campground expansions. Our victory will ensure New Jerseyans can access and enjoy its parks, a necessary outlet to the normal hustle and bustle of life in New Jersey. Our next step is to ensure that the state's wildly successful but soon to be bankrupt Garden State Preservation Trust Fund is replenished.

-- Clean energy: We celebrated a major victory for clean energy this April when, after two years of research, advocacy, coalition building and thousands of public comments, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities adopted one of the best clean energy standards in the country. The Clean Energy Standard, known as a Renewable Portfolio Standard, requires that 20 percent of the energy coming into New Jersey is from clean, safe, renewable sources like wind and solar by the year 2020. The standard also establishes the best solar energy commitment in the country, relative to population and electricity consumption, by requiring that 2 percent of New Jersey's energy is generated from solar by 2020. New Jersey's Clean Energy Standard will remove a total of 15.3 billion pounds of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that causes global warming, which is the equivalent of taking 1.3 million cars off the road. The standard will also remove 29.1 million pounds of nitrogen oxides, a smog-creating ozone precursor that is also associated with pulmonary and respiratory disease, which is the equivalent of taking 761,781 cars off the road. New Jersey's new standard will also build on the clean energy initiatives that are already happening in the state.
\
New Jersey's first coastal wind farm in Atlantic City is up and running, and in 2005, New Jersey emerged as the fastest growing solar market in the nation, having gone from six solar installations to well over 1,000 today.

257,"New chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court Stuart Rabner said Wednesday we need to give our judges another pay raise to attract ""the best and the brightest.""\I'm just a simple citizen, but I think Rabner is inferring we need more judges and we cannot entice them unless we provide a higher salary for them. Assuming he means this, I cannot stop laughing. We are in desperate need of more judges for only one reason: Gov. Corzine has refused to appoint judges to fill 36 Superior Court judicial vacancies, almost 10 percent of the trial bench. This was reported in newspapers and a major law journal.\The problem is not that we cannot attract judges. The problem is Corzine, for his own reasons and unknown to all of us, will not do his job. The efficiency of the judiciary is suffering. Judicial services to our citizens are less than they should be.\Remember the phrase, ""Justice delayed is justice denied""? Corzine is just singing a different tune than all of us in many areas. Sorry, but Ithink Rabner misstated the problem.\David F. Lipton\BEACHWOOD\Stay focused on energy bill\On the heels of the release of the final United Nations report on global warming, it is clear we need Congress to get off the sidelines and to get to work on fighting global warming. The good news is Congress is in a position to pass the Clean Energy Standard, which would require that 15 percent of our energy be obtained from clean, renewable energy sources by 2020.\Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., has championed this initiative. He helped introduce a similar measure in February and helped win initial passage of the measure in August. New Jersey already is implementing its stronger clean energy standard, as are about two dozen other states.\However, there is talk of dropping the Clean Energy Standard from a final energy bill. We urge Pallone to continue his advocacy for clean energy and to work to include a strong cleanenergy standard, focused on wind and solar power, in the final energy bill.\Jenna Kennett\ENVIRONMENT NEW JERSEY\TRENTON\Farm tax break odd cause of loss\It came as an unpleasant surprise that Sen. Ellen Karcher, D-Monmouth, lost her seat to Assemblywoman Jennifer Beck, R-Monmouth, primarily because Karcher took advantage of a tax loophole.\The campaign literature from both sides and the media coverage were insufficient to make an intelligent decision between the two candidates. Hence, I did not vote for either one.\However, Karcher exercised her legal right to use the farmland assessment tax loophole that probably would be recommended by every certified public accountant in the state - as well as by anyone with common sense.\One could argue that having the smarts to take the tax break is a reason why one should have voted for her. Voting her out of office for that reason was absurd.\Norman Sinowitz\FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP\Story Chat values honesty\One individual's perception of hate may be quite different from another person's. (""Bloggers hide via anonymity,"" Nov. 4.)\The Press' Story Chat is an interesting forum. I contribute frequently and enjoy reading the views others have on current topics and stories. I never have found the Story Chat even remotely hateful. Profanity is not allowed, but anger certainly may be expressed. It's healthy that an author feels comfortable expressing a true opinion and is not compelled to engage in doublespeak.\To assume a participant expressing a view is hiding because a signature is not required is incorrect. With the emphasis on political correctness today, just about anything could offend someone and result in being sued.\Critics of forum writers shouldn't act as if they have a moral right to force people to write in a politically correct manner. I wonder why someone who feels the Story Chat and blogs are filthy, hateful troughs would be trolling these sites.\Sarah Montana\RED BANK"
258,"Late last year, in the midst of the holiday season, Congress dropped the ball on clean energy. After the House passed a strong clean-energy standard, which included tax incentives, the measures failed in the Senate after ferocious lobbying by big utilities and oil companies.\But the new year is for second chances and the House last week passed a measure to fund critical renewable energy and energy efficiency tax incentives. U.S. reps. Rob Andrews, D-N.J., and Jim Saxton, R-N.J., deserve strong praise for their supportive votes.\The measure will sustain our national clean-energy economy by preventing the loss of 116,000 existing jobs, create thousands of new ones and help fight global warming through wind and solar power. According to a Blue Green Alliance report last fall, Camden County alone has the potential for $136 million in clean energy investment and more than 900 jobs.\Now, the focus turns to the Senate. I urge U.S. sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg, both D-N.J., to continue their leadership on this issue and fight hard to get the votes to boost our clean-energy economy. The Senate should not let President Bush's opposition to expanding clean energy stand in their way.\DOUG O'MALLEY Field director Environment New Jersey Trenton"

261,"
WEST WINDSOR -- Everyone knows the banking industry is changing, but when a major financial institution suddenly claims it it's the ""energy banker,"" well ... you sort of get the idea that things may be happening a lot quicker than you think.
\
Such was the situation yesterday at the Princeton/Route 1 headquarters of UJB Financial Corp. as Mercer County Executive Bob Prunetti and Ron Phillips, UJB's senior vice president/corporate facilities, announced the creation of a first-of-its-kind ""emissions-reduction bank."" The emissions bank is based on Mercer County's comprehensive energy enhancement program and those emission reductions credits currently being generated by an electrical retrofitting of various UJB Financial facilities.
\
Prunetti was quick to point out that Mercer County is the first county in the nation to participate in this innovative program to meet tough environmental laws. He said the emission reduction bank was created by using creditable emission reductions -- or energy savings -- which eventually are to be calculated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
\
Prunetti said the emissions-reductions bank is the product of energy savings the bank holding company has been realizing from a ""Greenlights"" retrofit of its Carnegie Center administrative offices on Route 1, as well as several other of its banking offices. Under the DEP plan these energy savings are being transferred to the Mercer County Improvement Authority (MCIA) as credits so they can eventually be used by the county in conjunction with its economic development initiatives.
\
Actually, Mercer works with Public Service Electric & Gas Company (PSE&G) as a ""borrower"" of the emissions-reduction bank, making the credits available to local companies that may not otherwise be able to comply with stringent environmental regulations.
\
""The credit borrowing process provides businesses with some 'breathing space' to operate while they retrofit their facilities to achieve compliance, save energy and reduce air pollution,"" said Prunetti.
\
""Attracting new businesses and helping older ones stay open helps the whole community,"" he remarked. ""The emissions reduction bank is a great example of how the public and private sectors are able to work together to stimulate economic development.""
\
Phillips acknowledged that both his own bank -- UJB Financial, the holding company for United Jersey Bank -- and Sycom Enterprises, a South Plainfield energy services firm, had played major roles in the creation of the emissions-reduction bank. UJB received a block of credits resulting from the installation by Sycom of high-efficiency lighting in five of its buildings and donated the credits to Mercer County in order get the new bank up and running.
\
""I suppose it makes perfect sense for us to be the pioneer in energy banking,"" said Ron Phillips of UJB Financial, ""even though we didn't set out with that goal in mind. We simply wanted to promote job creation in Mercer County, where we have our corporate headquarters.""
\
Sycom, which bills itself as a ""demand-side management energy services firm,"" acts as the 'depositor' of the credits with the utility company. Sycom says its expert verification of energy consumption allows it to acquire energy credits from its clients and then sell them to utilities as power, at cheaper rates than original generation.
\
DEP has yet to establish actual rules of use for the banked credits, but that hasn't prevented the Prunetti administration from encouraging local governments and school districts to participate in the Greenlights program. The county itself got involved in the program about 18 months ago and, according to Prunetti, is ready to let bids for the Greenlights retrofit of its own buildings.

267,"With little support in the Legislature for Governor Whitman's plan to raise the state's gas tax, key Republican legislators are now looking for other ways to fund open space preservation without raising taxes.\""Before increasing taxes we have to research other ways to advance the program,"" said Assembly Majority Leader Paul DiGaetano, R-Passaic. ""In good economic times, maybe there is some other way to do it.""\Whitman has proposed raising the gas tax 7 cents per gallon, in part to fund a $170 million-a-year plan to preserve 1 million acres of open space _ half the available land in New Jersey _ over the next 10 years.\DiGaetano said he asked the administration to consider a more modest $50 million per year program that would preserve one acre of open space for every acre that is developed. DiGaetano said his plan would reach Whitman's goal of preserving half the available land, but over a longer period.\In addition, Don Sico, executive director for the Assembly Republicans, said he and his staff are putting together an alternative proposal for Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, if Whitman's should fail.\Whitman _ who will meet privately on Thursday with Collins and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union _ said she is willing to consider other options but didn't think any existed.\""If you're serious about it, you're talking big numbers,"" Whitman said about the cost of preserving open space. ""I don't know how we reach those numbers in ways other than we proposed. But I'm always willing to listen to everyone.""\Whitman made her comments during a tour of a train station under construction in Mercer County, which she used to underscore the need to raise money to finance transportation projects. Under her plan, Whitman also would raise the gas tax a nickel to refinance the Transportation Trust Fund, which expires June 30, 2000. Today, the governor will visit transportation construction sites in South Jersey to once again try to drum up public support for her plan.\But legislators _ particularly Republican Assembly members who are up for reelection next year _ want to fund open space without raising taxes, and would prefer to wait until after the election to refinance the transportation trust fund, DiGaetano said.\""The Transportation Trust Fund goes until and including the year 2000,"" DiGaetano said. ""If that's the case, why do we have to do something now? That's a very good question to answer, especially from a political standpoint since we have to run in 1999.""\But Whitman said voters will ultimately decide the issue themselves. Under Whitman's plan, voters would have to approve a referendum allowing legislators to raise the gas tax and dedicate it for transportation and open space.\""You're talking to one of the greatest tax cutters that I know, and I have been at the forefront of cutting taxes,"" she said. ""I don't like proposing tax increases. That's why I think it is important that the people vote.""\The open space portion of her plan _ which has generated the most concern among legislators _ would cost the state $1.7 billion over 10 years. Under Whitman's plan, the state would get $84 million a year from a hike in the gas tax and the rest would come from a proposed $3 per day fee on short-term car rentals, and existing revenues.\DiFrancesco has said he supports Whitman's plan to put the issue before voters this fall. But he opposes the car rental fee and the dedication of other revenues, saying the $84 million from the gas tax should be enough.\However, Gregg Edwards, DiFrancesco's top aide, said the Senate president will defer to the Assembly on the issue. ""He wants to determine what the Assembly wanted to do, since they will face the voters first,"" Edwards said.\But that hasn't stopped senators from offering their own proposals.\Sen. Robert J. Martin, R-Morris Plains, has proposed a bill that would dedicate one quarter of 1 percent of the state's sales tax for open space preservation. Martin's plan, which would raise $200 million a year, has the support of the chairmen of the Senate budget and environment committees.\""What we need to do is to have some serious discussions on all these ideas and see what is palatable and what is not,"" said Sen. Robert E. Littell, R-Sussex, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee.\Trenton Correspondent Herb Jackson contributed to this article."
268,"After weeks of false starts and stalled negotiations, key lawmakers introduced measures Monday that would ask voters to raise the gasoline tax by a nickel a gallon and dedicate existing revenue to preserve open space.\The measures would accomplish two of Governor Whitman's top priorities: to rebuild crumbling roads and bridges and preserve 1 million acres of open space during the next 10 years.\Whitman initially sought to meet her open space goal with a 2-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax, but the proposal encountered opposition in the Legislature, which did not like the idea of diverting gas tax revenues from transportation projects.\The latest open space proposal calls for a referendum that, if approved, would amend the state constitution to dedicate up to $100 million a year in existing revenues for open space preservation. It does not require any new taxes.\But meeting Whitman's transportation goals will. The gas tax proposal would ask voters to amend the constitution to dedicate all of the gas tax revenues to transportation projects and raise the tax by 5 cents per gallon.\The state's gas tax is 10.5 cents per gallon, one of the lowest in the nation. Currently, only 7 cents is constitutionally dedicated to transportation. It will rise to 8 cents on July 1 and to 9 cents on July 1, 1999.\The increased gas tax revenue would extend the life of the Transportation Trust Fund, which is due to expire in June 2000. The trust fund pays for roads, bridges, and mass transit projects.\The gas tax proposal has some political heavyweights supporting it, including Assemblyman Richard H. Bagger, R-Union, who heads the Appropriations Committee, and Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, R-Parsippany-Troy Hills, who heads the Transportation and Communications Committee.\In the Senate, the measure is sponsored by Walter Kavanaugh, R-Somerset; Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., R-Monmouth; and Bernard F. Kenny Jr., D-Hoboken.\""The proposal makes sense _ the economy is thriving and gas prices are low,"" said Kenny, the Democratic budget officer. ""Plus, a considerable portion of the gas tax is paid by out-of-state drivers.""\Even with non-residents paying their share, Assembly Majority Leader Paul DiGaetano, R-Passaic, said some Assembly Republicans are exploring other ways to fund transportation without raising the gas tax, including taking money from general revenues.\If that happens, transportation and open space could end up competing for the same pot of money.\DiGaetano said there will be a ""total war"" for the money.\""We got elected by cutting taxes,"" DiGaetano said. ""Anytime you mention raising taxes, Republicans cringe.""\If approved by voters, the open space proposal would create a trust fund that would issue up to $100 million in 20-year bonds over 10 years. It would also make available $445 million during the 10-year period for pay-as-you-go land purchases.\During the first year, the trust fund would provide as much as $188 million for land purchases. By the 10th year, $100 million would be available for open space and $91 million would be spent on paying interest and principal on the bonds. After the 10th year, all the money would service the debt.\""This will be Governor Whitman's greatest legacy 100 years from now,"" said Assemblyman Leonard Lance, R-Hunterdon, who is sponsoring the Assembly version along with Steven J. Corodemus, R-Monmouth, who heads the Environment Committee.\DiGaetano, who was one of the most vocal opponents of Whitman's proposal to raise taxes to pay for open space preservation, said the latest approach has a much better chance of passing the lower house.\""Open space is a pretty positive issue,"" DiGaetano said. ""If you can do it without raising taxes, it has a good chance of support.""\In the upper chamber, the measure has the backing of Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union. It also has the support of Sen. Robert J. Martin, R-Morris Plains, who serves on the Governor's Council on New Jersey Outdoors, which recommended preserving 1 million acres.\Although open space supporters originally wanted a pay-as-you-go program, the latest proposal is acceptable, said Michael Catania, executive director of the Nature Conservancy's New Jersey Field Office, who supported Whitman's earlier gas tax plan for open space."
269,"Here we go again, another punishment for the people. A gas tax. As if the billionaires do not get enough.\There is no true purpose for this to even happen. Maybe better ideas need to be explored:\1. Let's make tax abatement unconstitutional: People who come to New Jersey should not be exempt from taxes as an incentive. This doesn't help create jobs either. And local residents do not benefit much.\2. A charter school tax: Why make the privileged even more privileged at our expense?\3. A living wage that exceeds $15 an hour: The taxes derived at a $21 minimum wage would inject $68 billion dollars into the economy, creating more jobs and a taxable income exceeding the gas tax.\4. Take steps for the state and federal government to use synthetic fuels instead: Audi and other European auto companies have developed these, and Europe will be off fossil fuels by 2025.\5. Reverse privatization: The taxes allotted to corporate welfare like MetLife Stadium should see a return profit for the people of New Jersey. Our money, our investment; MetLife Stadium belongs to us. Anything used as a investment by the government should become the people's property.\American taxpayers have subsidized the fossil-fuel industry through the tax code for decades. The taxpayers have received nothing in return. The United States has grown no closer to being independent of foreign oil imports, even as domestic drilling practices threaten our environment here in the U.S.\Congress should, as a start, stop subsidizing the oil and gas industry with these unjustified tax breaks.\Our state representatives are secondary agents to the Wall Street profiteers. As more money flies out of our paychecks with high mortgages, rent and ultra-high property taxes that are the highest in the nation, this gas tax adds insult to injury.\It is not just our nation that needs a political revolution. The state of New Jersey, the corporate welfare state, needs one also.\Tino Rozzo\Vineland"

272,"Democratic leaders in the Legislature announced a new plan Friday to fund transportation projects by raising the gas tax, but Governor Christie's cool response to the proposal is certain to extend a political standoff that has idled hundreds of construction projects across the state.\In a proposal similar to one in the Senate in June, state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto called for a 23-cent gas tax hike coupled with tax cuts that include phasing out the estate tax, boosting the earned-income tax credit for working families, and allowing retirees to exclude more income from taxes. The rollout follows three weeks of relative inaction in Trenton and on the state's roadways, after Christie signed an executive order halting work at many construction sites effective July 1.\If the governor decides not to support the plan, Sweeney said he will try to muster enough Republican votes to override a veto. If Sweeney succeeds, it would be the first override in Christie's tenure as governor.\""Hopefully we'll get the governor to come around,"" Sweeney said. ""But if not, we feel comfortable in the Senate"" that they have enough votes in both parties to override a veto.\Christie, who opposed the original plan, appears likely to resist this one, too.\Sweeney, D-Gloucester, and Prieto, D-Secaucus, ""must be more interested in publicly pretending that they have accomplished something ... rather than actually accomplishing something,"" Brian Murray, a spokesman for Christie, said Friday. ""They have not shared the specific details of their joint proposal with the governor beyond the vague generalities contained in their press release.""\The plan that Sweeney and Prieto introduced Friday would increase the wholesale tax on motor fuels by 12.5 percent, the diesel tax by 4 cents per gallon, and the tax on non-fuel petroleum by 7 percent. The only change is the omission of a tax increase on jet fuel, which was opposed by many state legislators whose districts have airports.\Both plans would have the same result: A gas tax increase of about 23 cents per gallon. That would raise $1.2 billion in new revenue, which, combined with borrowing, would give the state $20 billion for road, bridge and rail construction projects over the next 10 years.\Christie proposal\The tax hike remains hugely unpopular with voters, however, according to polls conducted over the last 18 months by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. To reduce the financial impact on taxpayers, and minimize the political fallout on elected leaders, Christie, Sweeney and Prieto packed their proposals with tax cuts. Christie's proposal was simple and huge: Cut the sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent. That would cost the state $1.7 billion a year, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.\Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature recoiled at the cost.\""We couldn't afford it because we have other bills we need to pay,"" Sweeney said.\The Democratic plan is more complex and would cost the state less money. It would phase out the estate tax over 3 1/2 years, boost the earned-income tax credit for working families, and phase in tax savings for retirees that would allow individuals to exclude up to $75,000 and couples up to $100,000 from taxes by the fourth year. The original proposal included language allowing residents to deduct charitable donations from their taxes. The new one instead would give a $500 income tax deduction to all motorists with incomes below $100,000, and allow military veterans to exempt $3,000 in income.\The total cost of both Democratic plans is roughly similar, Sweeney said -- about $896 million a year once all the tax cuts and credits are phased in. With its lower cost, and incentives offered to a broad swath of New Jersey residents, the revised proposal is more likely to win over the two-thirds supermajority it needs to become law without Christie's support, Sweeney said.\""There were enough Republican commitments to pass an override last time,"" Sweeney said. ""We fully expect our Republican colleagues who made commitments to us, that they're going to stick to them.""\In addition to the governor's reluctance, the Democratic proposal faces the same opposition as it did the first time around, and for the same reasons. Anti-tax advocates, including Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by Charles and David Koch, oppose the plans advanced by both parties because they think the gas tax increase should be handled separately from unrelated tax cuts.\Erica Jedynak, the state director for Americans for Prosperity, also doubts whether either side can get a bill signed.\""By our count the votes aren't there,"" said Jedynak, whose group is running phone banks and conducting door-to-door canvassing against a gas-tax hike in the district of state Sen. Steve Oroho, R-Sussex, who co-wrote the Senate's original plan.\Can't afford cut\On the other side of the spectrum, liberals and environmentalists argue the state cannot afford the tax cuts, which they said will force cuts to environmental programs and mass transit.\""This deal still blows a massive hole in New Jersey's budget, and this soap opera in the last month shouldn't obscure the fact that we're barely able to keep the state running,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey.\And then there's the question of whether the proposal issued Friday moves the discussion forward at all. Christie said he will review the proposal only after Sweeney gives him more details.\Meanwhile, workers at hundreds of construction sites around the state remain off the job due to Christie's executive order that as of July 1 canceled most non-emergency projects paid for by the Transportation Trust Fund. The delay will cost taxpayers millions of dollars extra to close, secure and then reopen construction sites, in addition to any legal costs borne by municipalities and the state from lawsuits by contractors over broken contracts, said Anthony Attanasio, executive director of the Utility and Transportation Contractors Association of New Jersey.\""The thing you've got to be most concerned about is a lengthy stalemate,"" said Martin E. Robins, director emeritus of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. ""With each passing day, it gets to be a bigger deal.""\Legislators can get little accomplished next week because most Democrats will be attending their party's convention in Philadelphia. That means no action will take place before next Friday, when the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee is schedule to meet and vote on the plan.\Staff Writer Salvador Rizzo contributed to this article.\Sidebar: \Highlights of latest approach\Under the plan released Friday by Democratic leaders in the Legislature, the state would spend $20 billion over the next 10 years on roads, rails, bridges and other transit projects, using new revenue from higher gas taxes and borrowing.

Phil Murphy (a Democrat) and the Office of Legislative Services been?\For years now, the scientists have been telling us about global warming and the need to cut back on the burning of fossil fuels. The citizens of New Jersey have heeded this and are driving less and driving vehicles that get better gas mileage and even use alternative fuels like electric.\Now, since we have been doing this and trying to save our environment, they say that it may be necessary to increase the fuel tax if fuel consumption does not substantially increase. What?\This is nothing but pure speaking out of both sides of your mouth — clean the environment but yet we need to burn more fossil fuel. It is time for state Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio and Murphy to do a reality check and review this legislation and bring it up to date.\Denis E. Hruza, Brick\Stormwater runoff is the biggest source of water pollution in New Jersey, creating more flooding and impacting public health. Climate impacts causing more severe and frequent storms are adding to the damage.\Bill S1073 signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy allows towns and counties to voluntarily establish stormwater utilities that can seek payment from developers for the pollution problems they create. This provides another tool for towns to better manage their stormwater and prevent flooding.\Most existing stormwater control systems are broken or do not work. In heavy rains stormwater increases the combined sewer systems overflow, discharging raw sewage into streams and rivers, creating serious health problems. The revitalization of our cities and older towns is undermined because no one wants to invest in areas flooded with raw sewage after major storms.\This law is not a rain tax and it will not affect homes. It targets new commercial development and existing large-scale development. Stormwater utilities may collect fees from property owners where runoff originates to pay for stormwater management. The law will also help towns develop a program and infrastructure to reduce stormwater pollution. It is a good start. However, the state Department of Environmental Protection must also strengthen its rules protecting clean water and reverse former Gov. Chris Christie's rollbacks.\This law is not mandatory, so it is up to towns to move forward. We have so much non-point pollution destroying our waterways and it's one of the most serious challenges we face when it comes to cleaning up our waterways.\Jeff Tittel, Director, New Jersey Sierra Club\According to the April 2 article, ""Alcohol banned at Sandy Hook,"" there were some 328 alcohol-related issues on Sandy Hook from 2016 to 2018.\I wonder how many marijuana-related issues Sandy Hook had in a three-year period?

274,"GAS TAX HIKE MAY BE ON HORIZON\DECROCE WARNS OF LESS FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION\BY CHRIS GOSIER, DAILY RECORD\WHIPPANY -- The stiff competition for federal transportation dollars likely will put pressure on New Jersey to come up with new revenue sources for highway and rail projects -- such as an increase in the gas tax, transportation experts said Friday.\The Bush Administration's proposed reductions in highway spending and legislative redistricting that will reduce the Northeast's political clout are among the chief reasons New Jersey is likely to feel a funding pinch.\That means the federal government probably will expect New Jersey to raise more money where it can, said Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, R-Parsippany.\""If you want cooperation from the feds, they're going to want more cooperation from the state of New Jersey,"" he said.\""As long as gas prices are low, somebody should really think about"" an increase in the gas tax, he said.\He added that any increase should be approved by voters, and be dedicated to transportation expenses.\DeCroce, until recently the chairman of the Assembly's transportation committee, spoke Friday at a meeting of the Morris County affiliate of the New Jersey Alliance for Action, a coalition of more than 600 business, labor, professional, academic and government organizations.\The alliance advocates for infrastructure investments to improve the state's economy and environment.\The need for repairs to many New Jersey roads and bridges was one topic Friday, along with the need for funding of projects such as the Lackawanna Cutoff, which would help alleviate Route 80 congestion by providing rail service between northeastern Pennsylvania and Hoboken.\New Jersey collects a state gasoline tax of 10.5 cents per gallon, which last was raised in 1988, from 8 cents a gallon. The cost of road and bridge projects has soared since then, however.\""Today, $100 million isn't even a down payment on a bridge,"" said Philip Beachem, president of the alliance. ""The cost for these projects has gone through the roof.""\But he added that elected officials from the South and West, which gained more clout in Congress following the 2000 Census, may be skeptical of the amounts sought by New Jersey and other Northeastern states.\New Jersey kept its 13 House seats, but Pennsylvania and New York each lost two and Connecticut lost one. Some Midwestern states also lost seats.\By contrast, Georgia, Florida, Texas and Arizona each gained two seats. Nevada, North Carolina, California and Colorado each gained one.\Another hurdle is the recession, which has brought budget pressures that led the Bush Administration to propose cuts of about $9 billion in next year's highway dollars, compared to this year.\Administration officials have said the reduction was mandated by the formula that ties highway spending to revenues from the gasoline tax and other monies that flow into the national Highway Trust Fund.\Beachem said ""I'm not so sure it has to be a gas tax"" that raises the needed revenue in New Jersey. But he said it ""makes the most sense because it's a user fee,"" with most of the proceeds going to pay for past transportation improvements, he said.\""People tend to understand that,"" he said."
275,"| Washington Bureau\Increasing the federal gas tax ""makes sense"" to help prevent a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund, according to a lawmaker who will play a key role in financing the next transportation bill.\Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware said Congress likely will have to tap a variety of funding sources to replenish the trust fund, which is projected to run out of money later this year.\One idea Carper will pitch to Senate colleagues is for raising the gas tax by three or four cents a year for up to four years, then indexing it to inflation. He said that would slowly restore the purchasing power the 18.4-cent tax had when it as set in 1993.\""If we think it's important to have roads that are in good shape, bridges that are not about to collapse, that our highways are efficient and in good condition, then it's worth paying for,"" Carper said. ""If we're not willing to pay for those things, we frankly shouldn't have them.""\Carper chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is writing the next bill to renew surface transportation projects. He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which is in charge of paying for it.\There is no Senate legislation yet to increase the gas tax -- just one idea out of many for protecting the Highway Trust Fund -- and Carper isn't working on a formal proposal.\But in the House, Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., proposed legislation in December to increase the gas tax 15 cents over 3 years, then index it to inflation. Another of his bills would tax motorists based on the number of miles they drive. He expects the House Ways and Means Committee to hold a hearing on transportation financing as a first step toward addressing the problem.\""People understand that after 21 years, we are in a downward spiral that has to be corrected, and I do think that there's an opportunity for an adult conversation about the situation we're in and what our choices are,"" said Blumenauer, a Ways and Means Committee member. ""It's time to have a stable, sustainable, long-term solution, and the gas tax to this point is the best alternative.""\The Highway Trust Fund, financed mainly by gas taxes, has dwindled as people drive less, vehicles become more fuel efficient and the current tax rate's purchasing power has declined.\States have delayed transportation projects because of uncertainty caused by the federal fund's impending insolvency. Federal officials have told states that as the Highway Trust Fund shrinks to $4 billion, expected to happen in July, they will have to slow or stop payments on projects.\""Until I hear that is not occurring, we're just in a very guarded mode, a very defensive posture about any of our projects with federal funding,"" said Shailen Bhatt, Delaware's transportation secretary.\Thirty-three percent of America's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 25 percent of the country's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, according to an analysis by TRIP, a nonprofit transportation research group, of the latest information available. Driving on roads in need of repair costs U.S. motorists $80 billion a year -- $377 per motorist -- in extra vehicle repairs and operating costs, the report says.\Unless Congress provides more transportation revenue, federal funding for highway and transit improvements across the nation could be cut by $50.8 billion starting in October, according to TRIP.\The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO and other groups have called for increasing the gas tax, but lawmakers have resisted.\When the Senate Finance Committee took up the last transportation reauthorization in 2012, Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., a committee member, proposed indexing the gas tax rate to inflation. He later withdrew his amendment, deciding the time wasn't right for a vote, according to his staff.\""Every time this comes up, in my experience, one side or the other will nail it to the other side for being a tax increase,"" said Jack Basso, a former Transportation Department official and now an adviser on transportation finance issues. ""So it tends to go away.""\If lawmakers can't agree, they could transfer money from the Treasury's general fund to the Highway Trust Fund, as they've done in recent years. Since 2008, about $53 billion has been transferred to the highway fund, and the Congressional Budget Office projects the fund will require a $15 billion transfer in fiscal 2015, according to State Policy Reports. But that could lead to more deficit spending.\Carper said he hopes it won't come to that. His plan is to meet individually with his colleagues on the Finance Committee when Congress returns from recess and discuss revenue options for the Highway Trust Fund. He expects Congress will end up relying on a combination of ways to raise revenue.\""I don't know that there's any one silver bullet to funding our transportation infrastructure needs, but there are, I like to say, many silver BBs,"" he said.\A gas tax increase makes sense, he said, because the collection system is already in place and people who drive more end up paying a significant part of maintaining and improving the system.\""I think it's one of those things where people know we have to summon the political courage to do something,"" he said.

276,"While Governor Whitman works at building support for a gas tax increase to preserve open space and finance transportation projects, lawmakers moved ahead Monday with plans that could derail her proposal.\Whitman's proposal calls for asking voters to raise New Jersey's gasoline tax 7 cents per gallon, with 5 cents dedicated to transportation projects and 2 cents for preserving open space. But legislators have their own ideas.\The most damaging blow came from the Assembly Transportation and Communications Committee, which unanimously passed a measure that would ask voters in November to amend the state constitution so all gas tax revenues would be dedicated to transportation projects. That would effectively block Whitman's attempt to use gas tax revenues to help preserve 1 million acres.\Currently, only 7 cents of the state's 10.5-cent gas tax is dedicated to transportation, although that amount will rise to 8 cents on July 1 and 9 cents on July 1, 1999.\Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, R-Parsippany-Troy Hills, chairman of the Transportation Committee and a sponsor of the measure, said gas tax revenues should be used only for transportation-related projects. DeCroce has said he would support raising the gas 3.5 cents to replenish the Transportation Trust Fund, which expires June 30, 2000.\""I am prepared to work with you and the administration,"" DeCroce told Transportation Commissioner John J. Haley Jr. before the committee voted. ""We're prepared to listen to any alternatives. In the meantime, if we don't hear from anyone, we're going to move forward.""\Haley stressed the need to raise the gas tax for transportation, saying the state is facing a funding crisis. He avoided questions about whether he supported DeCroce's measure, saying only that he supported Whitman's plan.\Whitman's gas tax plan also suffered a setback in the Senate Environment Committee, which unanimously approved a $210 million Green Acres bond referendum that would be placed on the ballot in November.\Whitman has been seeking to move away from Green Acres bonds as a way to purchase land. Advocates of a so-called stable funding source say it is a cheaper and more reliable way to preserve open space.\Behind the scenes, however, the Whitman administration is taking a serious look at plans suggested by legislators to borrow some of the money needed for land preservation instead of paying cash. That would minimize or eliminate the need to raise the gas tax for open space.\Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for Whitman, declined to speculate about how voters would react in November if a bond referendum and a gas tax were on the same ballot. The administration is hoping to avoid that possibility.\""It's really too early to get into discussions on what's going to happen in November until we know exactly what the proposal will look like,"" O'Connor said. ""The governor is looking for a comprehensive plan to address transport needs and open space preservation. She has her plan and we'll continue to talk to legislators until a final proposal is forged.""\During the hearing, one environmentalist after another took the awkward position of opposing the Green Acres bill. Environmental lobbyists said they fear the Legislature will pass the bond issue and fail to tackle the more difficult issue of preserving 1 million acres.\""When you've got a tough struggle on your hands and somebody puts an alternative out that moves in same direction . . . there's a legislative temptation to go for the least comprehensive solution,"" said William R. Neil, assistant director of conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society. ""We've been doing that for too long.""\Sen. Robert E. Littell, R-Sussex, a sponsor of the referendum bill, said he supports a stable funding source, but that he felt the Green Acres program needed funding as soon as possible. Both Green Acres and the farmland preservation program are nearly out of money.\The Senate Environment Committee also passed one bill that is a small part of Whitman's plan. It would provide $50 million annually in matching funds for counties and communities that have their own open space programs."
277,"Governor Whitman, who built a national reputation as a tax cutter, reversed course Thursday and called for a 67 percent increase in New Jersey's gas tax by raising the price at the pump by 7 cents per gallon.\Whitman said she does not take the issue of raising the gas tax ""lightly,"" but insisted it was necessary to rebuild crumbling roads and bridges and preserve the state's remaining open spaces.\Still, Whitman wants to give voters the final decision. Under her plan, the governor is asking the Legislature to place on the November ballot a question that would ask voters to constitutionally dedicate 5 cents for transportation projects and 2 cents for open space preservation.\At 10.5 cents per gallon, New Jersey has one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation. Even at 17.5 cents per gallon, New Jersey's gas tax would be lower than levies in New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.\""I don't for one instant believe it's going to be easy,"" Whitman said at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, where she made the announcement. ""But I am very confident as the voters get to know the plan and what would be accomplished with these extra dollars that they will support it.""\But before the question can be put on the ballot, it must receive three-fifths vote in both houses of the Legislature _ a step that won't be easy given the growing opposition from some prominent members of her own Republican Party.\Whitman's plan to raise the gas tax a nickel for the Transportation Trust Fund has broad bipartisan support, because the fund is running out of money and needs to be replenished. Whitman says the 5-cent increase will enable New Jersey to increase state spending on transportation projects by nearly 50 percent, from $700 million a year to $1 billion by fiscal year 2003.\But key legislators _ including Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, and Assembly Majority Leader Paul DiGaetano, R-Passaic _ have expressed concerns about raising the gas tax for open space.\Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, R-Parsippany-Troy Hills, chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, has introduced a bill to amend the state constitution to prohibit the use of gas tax revenues for anything but transportation projects.\Sen. Robert E. Littell, R-Sussex, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, said he will only support the tax plan if it gives voters the choice to approve the transportation and open space taxes separately.\""The tough part is going to be with the Legislature and I think that's going to be tougher than the people,"" said Maureen Ogden, a former assemblywoman from Essex County.\Ogden was chairwoman of the Governor's Council on New Jersey Outdoors, which issued a report earlier this year that recommended raising the gas tax to help preserve 1 million acres of farmland and open space in the next 10 years.\Whitman's plan would raise $170 million a year for 10 years for open space. The 2-cent per gallon increase in the gas tax would raise $84 million a year. In addition to the gas tax, the plan calls for creating a $3-a-day surcharge on car rentals, which would raise $36 million, and dedicating $50 million from the realty transfer fee, which now goes into the general fund.\Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, said he supports the 2-cent gas tax for open space _ but not the car rental surcharge or dedicating money from the general fund.\""Going beyond the 2 cents might be going too far,"" he said. ""Either you fund it out of general revenues or raise the gas tax. To do both is difficult.""\In addition to legislators, some powerful interest groups are concerned about using gas-tax revenue for open space preservation.\""AAA really doesn't have a problem with gasoline taxes when the gasoline tax is dedicated solely to road bridges and highway safety programs,"" said William Visser, a spokesman for the AAA North Jersey. ""When you mention other uses for these taxes _ that's when we get concerned. I don't know if it should be motorists who are picking up the cost for this.""\But supporters of the tax hike see strength in numbers. They have built an unusual coalition of transportation advocates and environmentalist groups, which are often at odds with each other.\The Alliance for Action Inc., a coalition of more than 600 business, labor, professional, academic, and governmental organizations with a strong voice on transportation issues, supports the tax hike, said Philip K. Beachem, the alliance's president.\The Coalition to Preserve Natural Resources has signed up 159 corporations, environmentalists, farmland, and historic preservationists, and local governments who support the tax hike, said Michael Catania, a co-chairman of the coalition.\""The challenging part comes now,"" said Catania, who is also executive director of the Nature Conservancy. ""We're up against a myth that it's not a good idea to raise taxes. That's why the coalition is going to be there, out front, with the public telling the Legislature that not only is this the safe thing to do but the right thing to do.""\In her inaugural address in January, the governor called for the preservation of 300,000 acres of open space during her term, with the eventual goal of saving 1 million acres from development in the next 10 years.\The plan Whitman unveiled Thursday would create a stable source of funding for open space _ a long-sought goal of environmentalists who say the current method of preserving land with Green Acres bond issues is too costly and unpredictable, since funding is not always available when needed.\Whitman's announcement came on the day before the Memorial Day weekend, when gas prices traditionally rise as the demand for fuel increases.\At the Sunoco gas station on Route 17 south in Paramus, where regular gas was selling for $1.03.9 per gallon, drivers had mixed reactions.\""I feel that any additional tax at this time is uncalled for,"" said Jim Coleman of Bloomfield, manager of the Red Lobster on Route 17 in Paramus. ""They need to get the money from some other place, because everybody has got to use gas.""\Jim Duffy of Ramsey voiced support for the gas tax.\""Gas prices have been a lot higher in the past, and people paid it with no problem,"" said Duffy. ""If the gas tax is used for improving mass transit and helping the environment by buying land I don't see any problem with it. The economy is strong and I think people can divvy up the extra money.""\In 1995, Whitman backed down from an increase in the gas tax after her administration used focus groups to test public opinion on the issue. Whitman decided instead to increase the bonding capacity of the trust fund and refinance the existing debt for a longer period of time.\Asked how her support of a tax increase could affect her standing nationally, Whitman responded: ""I could care less.""\Trenton Correspondents Herb Jackson and Eugene Kiely contributed to this article."
278,"HOWELL - The state's key environmentalists yesterday described former Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg as a champion of clean water, clean air and the public's right to know when it comes to the environment.\Against the backdrop of the Manasquan Reservoir, Lautenberg received endorsements from the New Jersey Environmental Federation and the Sierra Club.\Meanwhile, President Bush and other legislators spent the day celebrating the 30th anniversary of the passage of the Clean Water Act. Bush's critics have said the president has spent his first two years in office working to rollback those protections.\Yesterday, representatives of these environmental groups said Lautenberg is needed to protect the act.\""(Lautenberg) early on recognized that protecting our environment isn't only about protecting our beautiful places,"" said Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Clinton, during a press conference to announce the endorsements. ""It's also about protecting our health.""\In what he called his quest to ""find Forrester,"" Lautenberg said his opponent has no environmental record. Lautenberg, along with environmentalists, criticized Forrester's intentions to use public tax money to clean the state's Superfund sites and that money raised by increasing the state's gasoline tax could be used to fund the cleanup of those sites. Federal officials have said the Superfund will run out of money next year.\Forrester spokesman Mark Pfeifle defended the candidate and said it is Lautenberg's environmental record that is shoddy.\""In Frank Lautenberg's 18 years in Washington, he managed to cleanup only 19 of 132 (Superfund) sites. To me that's abysmal,"" Pfeifle said. ""Give someone a backhoe and a toxic jump-suit and they can clean up Superfund sites faster than Frank Lautenberg.""\Pfeifle said Forrester supports taxing polluters to pay to clean Superfund sites and that general fund money needs to continue to be used to clean-up orphan sites, or sites where the pollutant is long out of business.\He also said Forrester is not in favor of increased the gas tax and remains committed to maintaining the tax, if not decreasing it, despite mentioning the possibility of raising the tax to generate money to clean the Superfund sites.\""In the almost two decades he served, no one did more to fight for the environment and for the concerns we have here at the Shore,"" said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J.,in a long introduction speech listing some of Lautenberg's environmental accomplishments.\Pallone and others mentioned Lautenberg's fight to clean medical waste from the Shore and to strengthen the Clean Air and Clean Water acts.\Lautenberg said his record is one he is proud of.\""To me it's not simply a matter of altruism. I look at this thing as helping my family,"" he said. ""To me, every senator has the responsibility of protecting the environment.""\Despite entering the race only two weeks ago, Lautenberg leads Forrester in the race by a margin of 44 percent to 38 percent, according to data released Thursday by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind.\In addition to yesterday's endorsements, Lautenberg has been endorsed by the New Jersey Educational Association, the League of Conservation Voters and a group of black ministers from across the state led by the Rev. Reginald Jackson, who had led the effort to ban racial profiling.\Yesterday, Forrester, who has been backed by the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Troopers' Coalition, attended the Commerce and Industry Association luncheon in Woodcliff Lake, Bergen County, and addressed the Passaic County Chamber of Commerce and attended a Forrester-for-Senate rally in Ridgewood, also in Bergen County.\Naomi Mueller: (732) 643-4024 or nmueller@app.com"
279,"In 1999, a Ford executive stated that there might not be a sufficient market for a fuel-efficient vehicle his company was developing. I wrote to Bill Ford, the chairman of the board, pointing out that an increase in the federal gas tax would create a market for such vehicles. American car companies did express a preference for higher gas taxes over stronger cafe standards in 1993.\Ford replied, copying his VP for Legislative and Policy Affairs. Nothing came of it, of course; it would have been naive to think I could have influenced one of the big three auto companies. But a few years later, when oil prices spiked, unprepared American auto companies lost market share to foreign, fuel-efficient vehicles. The (no longer) big three were brought to their knees. Ultimately, who was naive?\Let's apply that story to the Republican Party. This series has cited examples of laudable Republican positions on environmental issues, including George W. Bush's support for congestion pricing, state Sen. Peter Inverso's legislation creating New Jersey's Clean Energy Program, signed into law by Gov. Christine Whitman, and the Somerset County freeholders' investment in efficiency and solar upgrades in public buildings.\Instead of requiring ""inconvenience,"" these Republican measures made -- or would have made -- life easier. Recall that the efficiency upgrades in my own house, made possible by the Clean Energy Program, brought comfort to my family on a cold, November morning while the furnace was off. Implementing the Bush administration's congestion pricing proposal would have induced entrepreneurs to run van and bus services to New York City. Transit vehicles and private cars alike would have been able to sail through uncongested tunnels and bridges. Somerset County's energy upgrades will save taxpayer dollars.\Add to the above the fact that the National Park Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act and the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act (which utilized market mechanisms to reduce SO2 emissions at low cost) were all implemented by Republican presidents, and an inescapable conclusion follows: environmentalism is Republican. It's not just moderate Republicanism, it IS Republican.\It makes no sense, therefore, for some Republicans to espouse anti-environmental positions. Their strategy is working at the moment, but I'm old enough to have seen political fortunes (like American car sales) shift like the wind, and environmental obstructionism will cause support for the Republican Party to melt along with the polar ice caps.\This is not just my advice. During the 1992 presidential campaign, former President Richard Nixon advised Bush senior to stop ridiculing Al Gore's environmentalism. Nixon, for all his faults, had a shrewd sense of the political scene.\New Jersey Republicans must take a stand. By all accounts, the governor is planning to have the Clean Energy Program offer loans instead of rebates; incentives will be reduced dramatically. This is not just bad for the planet and the economy, it will undermine the future of the Republican Party. GOP leaders, therefore, should urge the governor to reinstate the strongest-in-the-nation incentives for efficiency and renewable energy that were in place last year. The governor can be receptive to environmental arguments. He has earned occasional praise from New Jersey's environmental organizations, and his chief of staff, Rich Bagger, has a good environmental record.\Republican backtracking on efficiency and clean energy could cause the GOP to go the way of the Whigs. But if it means my children will inherit environmental disaster, I will take little pleasure in saying, ""Ultimately, who was naive?""\Dan Aronson is an associate professor of economics at Raritan Valley Community College.

280," Budget\ Jon Corzine:\ * Grow state economy to bring in more tax revenues.\ * Limit spending on new programs to $100 million next year.\ * Cut the number of political appointees 50 percent.\ Doug Forrester:\ * Cut about $900 million by targeting ""waste, fraud and abuse.""\ * Review all government spending and start ""zero-based"" budgeting to make departments justify all expenses.\ * No increases in income, sales or corporate taxes.\ Child welfare\ Corzine\ * Appoint a new commissioner of the Department of Human Services who shares his commitment to the reforms.\ * Hold child welfare leaders accountable.\ * Look into whether the state Division of Youth and Family Services should be removed from DHS and a separate child welfare department created.\ * Improve communication between Trenton and local family- services offices.\ Forrester\ * Appoint a new DHS commissioner and meet weekly with that person to monitor the progress of the reforms.\ * Seek fundamental changes at DYFS by drawing on his experience running the pension division during the Kean administration.\ * Does not believe DYFS needs to be separated from Department of Human Services.\ * Create more substance-abuse programs to help families suffering from drug and alcohol abuse.\ Education\ On paying for school construction:\ The New Jersey Schools Construction Corp.'s $8.6 billion pocketbook will soon be empty after only 132 of 530 planned school projects. Both Corzine and Forrester say that taxpayers must pay for the rest of the schools. They differ on how they'd make sure the money is spent wisely this time around.\ Forrester: Would abolish the SCC and turn the project over to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.\ Corzine: Would assign the project to whichever government agency would earn the best rating on the hypothetical bonds, including the SCC or Economic Development Authority.\ On UMDNJ:\ The publicly funded University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark has been a font of scandal over the past year, after reports surfaced that university administrators were collecting hefty pay bonuses and that politically connected companies were collecting millions in no-bid university contracts. Its president, John Petillo, is the state's highest-paid public employee.\ Corzine: Would analyze how the university spends its money, interview Petillo and review the qualifications of current board members, including whether they are ""generally free of conflicts"" with the university. He would not immediately ask for Petillo's resignation, and wouldn't say if he would remove board members.\ Forrester: Would oust Petillo. He said he would consider removing board members after reviewing their qualifications and actions on the board.\ On statewide caps on local school budget increases:\ The so-called ""1701"" law is an attempt to control school costs by limiting district budget increases to 2.5 percent every year and restricting how much money districts can set aside as surplus. Boards of education have complained that costs increase every year faster than the caps.\ Forrester: Would review the caps on reserves, not operating budgets. He called the caps on reserves ""counterproductive,"" since the point of reserves is to have them in case of emergency.\ Corzine: Would have the Department of Education review spending caps every three or six months, and surplus caps every year. He said the rules on spending should be relaxed in the case of unforeseen extra costs, and that the Education Department should issue waivers regarding the surplus caps to individual districts, so long as they were not using the surplus for operating costs.\ On expanding the state's public universities:\ Both candidates agree that New Jersey should build more classrooms and dorms at its public universities, paid - at least in part - by voter-approved bonds. The state has not had a significant construction effort at its public universities in years.\ Corzine estimated the cost could be in the ""hundreds of millions of dollars."" Forrester said it could be up to $1 billion.\ On the autonomy of Douglass College at Rutgers University:\ Both candidates have said that the women's-only college should remain its own school. Rutgers is contemplating combining four of its undergraduate colleges, including Douglass, into a single entity, which has drawn criticism.\ Economic development\ Corzine\ * Would stop using bond proceeds from the state Economic Development Agency for state operating expenses.\ * Plans to create an ""Edison Fund"" composed of public-private dollars to distribute research, development and business grants.\ * Wants to make state colleges and universities hubs for research and development.\ * Has refused to sign a pledge not to raise taxes, but says it would be an option of last resort.\ Forrester\ * Would make health plans for small businesses more affordable by establishing a health benefit's program modeled after the state Health Benefits Plan. The plan would provide greater bargaining power for small employers and individuals and help reduce costs.\ * Pledges not to raise any taxes; supports constitutional measure requiring a ""supermajority,"" or support of two-thirds of the Legislature before raising taxes.\ * Vows to appoint only ""qualified, respected and reputable people"" to state government posts, including appointments that impact New Jersey's economic development.\ Environment\ Sprawl\ Both want the fast-track law repealed but offer few specifics about how to contain sprawl.\ Corzine says the ""smart growth"" ombudsman should become a representative for the public, not permit applicants. Proposes allowing municipalities to charge developers impact fees.\ Forrester would eliminate the ombudsman position, saying it places too much power in one person's hands. Would consider giving municipalities impact fee powers.\ Air quality\ Forrester is inclined to join a nine-state alliance to curb global warming gases, but would have to review the final agreement before deciding. Does not support regulating carbon dioxide emissions if New Jersey plants end up paying more fees than out-of- state competitors. Wants to make privately owned diesel trucks eligible for grants to install pollution controls.\ Corzine wants to take a leadership position in negotiations for the global warming pact to ensure the alliance adopts stricter power plant emissions caps than those currently proposed. Wants carbon dioxide emissions to be considered a pollutant. Supports better roadside inspections of diesel trucks and buses.\ Energy alternatives\ Both support increasing the state's renewable energy target of 20 percent by the year 2020 to spur development of solar, wind and other alternative technologies.\ Corzine wants to update energy efficiency codes for residential and commercial buildings. Has proposed a bond initiative to invest in renewable energy projects. Believes wind turbines could be built far enough off the Jersey Shore so that they wouldn't be visible from the beach.\ Forrester wants more investment in alternative energy technologies. Has concerns that wind turbines off the Jersey Shore could hurt tourism.\ Petty's Island\ Forrester opposes a plan by local officials to secure the land through eminent domain for a developer. Wants the site designated a nature preserve.\ Corzine says it's premature to discuss uses of the island until the cleanup is complete and money damages are collected from polluters.\ Health care\ Health insurance\ * Corzine would create a state pool to pay 75 percent of catastrophic care costs above $30,000 for small businesses insuring employees. Groups of small businesses would form cooperative purchasing pools to buy insurance. He would extend coverage to 776,000 New Jerseyans through universal care for children and pregnant women, and by expanding the state's Family Care program for low-income residents. He would create voluntary health plans for specific chronic conditions, such as diabetes, and require insurance companies to allow parents to cover adult children ages 19 to 30. He has not fully explained how he would pay for his proposals.\ * Forrester would let small businesses form association health plans to purchase insurance for employees in a new risk pool created by the State Health Benefits Plan for state and local employees.\ * Forrester would require hospitals to charge the lowest commercial rate to patients whose benefits have run out. He also wants a state task force to simplify medical billing.\ Charity care reimbursement\ * Corzine says insuring more people will get them off charity care but in the interim, reimbursement levels should match the growth of medical costs.\ * Forrester would assure that charity care reimbursement is based on the number of patients served, not political connections.\ Malpractice insurance\ * Forrester wants tort reform and caps on damage awards, particularly for high-risk specialists. He proposes that the state medical board analyze claims to identify specialties most vulnerable to malpractice suits, and create ""safe harbor immunity"" for doctors who can prove they gave the best possible care in cases with bad outcomes. Limited no-fault compensation should be paid in certain high-risk specialty cases with bad outcomes but without gross negligence, he says.\ * Corzine, who believes damage caps do not result in lower premiums, wants the state to crack down on insurance pricing and screen out frivolous lawsuits.\ Stem cell research\ * Corzine endorses research on adult and embryonic stem cells.\ * Forrester endorsed only adult stem cell research, but recently hailed possible use of ethically acceptable, genetically engineered embryonic stem cells.\ Latino issues\ Corzine\ * Job creation: Proposes to ""invest, grow and prosper,"" rather than ""borrow and spend,"" by rehabilitating ports in Newark, Elizabeth and Camden, building roads, and shoring up rail infrastructure. Pledges to end disparities in government contracts, increasing the 2 percent that he says have gone to minorities from 2000-04.\ * Housing: Promises to fund low-interest mortgages for first- time home buyers. Wants to expand Section 8 vouchers to include mortgage payments. Proposes to boost property tax rebates by 40 percent over the next four years for low- and middle-income families and seniors.\ * Education: Favors all-day kindergarten; giving needy college students additional aid for books, room and board, and increasing the number of Pell grants. Supports legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants to attend college and pay in-state tuition.\ * Health care: Proposes community clinics to reduce the expense of using hospital emergency rooms. Wants to increase access to health coverage for the 1.2 million uninsured New Jerseyans, of which 28 percent are Latinos.\ * Diversity: Vows to require that all state agencies meet ""serious diversity goals."" Says he will appoint Latinos to key positions in his administration.\ Forrester\ * Property taxes: Intends to cut property taxes by 30 percent, and thus enable many Latinos to afford buying a home.\ * Corruption in urban areas: Promises to fight the pay-to-play system that excludes people who don't have connections to the political bosses - namely, new businesses and minority contractors.\ * Entrepreneurial opportunities: Pledges to have the Commerce Department provide training for people who want to start new businesses. Wants to allow small businesses to pool employee health insurance to get lower rates.\ * Inclusive government: Says his administration would be representative of the state's Hispanic population and would ""look like New Jersey,"" because he recognizes the importance of being inclusive in terms of race, ethnicity and gender.\ * Values: Like Latinos, he says he believes in family, hard work, honesty and entrepreneurship. Says he would promote those values in Trenton.\ Political corruption\ Corzine\ * Seek comprehensive ban on pay-to-play political contributions from government contractors; include developers seeking local approvals.\ * Eliminate ""wheeling"" or unregulated transfers of money among political funds.\ * Expand public financing of campaigns.\ * Institute an elected state comptroller to audit and investigate state and local government entities.\ * Expand ""revolving-door"" restrictions on government officials becoming lobbyists; extend one-year ban on lobbying by former governors and cabinet officials to all senior staff in the executive branch and state authorities.\ Forrester\ * Comprehensive ban on pay-to-play political contributions from government contractors; including money each party raises in a special account for federal candidates.\ * Eliminate ""wheeling.""\ * Expand public financing of campaigns.\ * Institute elected state auditor to review and investigate state and local government entities.\ * Expand ""revolving-door"" restrictions on government officials becoming lobbyists; double the ban on former governors, cabinet officials and legislators to two years, impose three-year restriction on authority members.\ * Ban holding of multiple elected offices.\ Security\ Corzine\ * Wants to appoint a homeland security czar who will report directly to the governor. He said an anti-terror office he plans to create will have at least 10 employees.\ * Wants to create a blue-ribbon panel modeled after the Sept. 11 commission.\ * Says he will create a ""Serve New Jersey"" program that will forgive loans or provide tax credits to college graduates who become law enforcement officials, firefighters or medical professionals.\ Forrester\ * Wants to appoint a homeland security director who will head a statewide office.\ * Wants to install security cameras in major commuter stations.\ * Has called for increased security in small airports.\ Both say they plan to create a clear line of authority in the state anti-terror apparatus to prevent the messy turf battles that have long-plagued the homeland security division.\ Transportation\ Corzine\ *-Recapture nearly $300 million in gas tax revenue, turnpike payments and motor vehicle fees used to balance the state budget.\ *-""Securitize"" the $25 million annual turnpike payments.\ *-Look for refinancing opportunities.\ *-Possibly sell state property, such as highway rest areas.\ Forrester\ *-Recapture the $300 million.\ *-Cut fat from the state budget.\ (SIDEBAR, page L03)\ Property tax relief\ Polls show property taxes are the voters' top concern in this election, and Democrat Jon Corzine and Republican Doug Forrester have each put forth plans that mirror their political philosophies. Here are answers to some questions about their plans, and the accompanying chart shows how different taxpayers would fare if the plans were enacted as proposed.\ Q: What's Forrester promising?\ Though he says his plan is simple, it's actually quite complicated. The state would provide a credit on a homeowner's local property tax bill equal to 10 percent of the tax bill or the amount the homeowner received from the Homestead and/or Saver rebate this year or last year, whichever is higher. The credit would replace rebate checks that come in the mail.\ This credit rises to 20 percent of the property tax bill in 2007 and 30 percent in 2008. There would be no income test for benefits, but tax credits for new recipients would be capped at $1,000 in 2006, $3,000 in 2007, and $5,000 in 2008. No one would receive less than they received in 2004, however.\ Q: What's Corzine promising?\ Corzine's plan sounds simpler, but only because it continues the confusing program in place now and simply increases the size of rebate checks by 10 percent a year. Corzine says he'll switch from rebates to direct credits on property tax bills in the future. That would translate into an additional $50 to $120 next year for senior or disabled homeowners.\ Q: How much were rebates this year and last year?\ In both years, senior citizens and disabled homeowners got between $500 and $1,200. Homeowners who are younger than 65 and not disabled got between $300 to $350 this year and between $500 to $800 last year. No one with gross income over $200,000 got a rebate in either year.\ Q: Who wins and loses with these plans?\ Once Forrester's plan were fully phased in after three years, there would be no difference between the amount of state relief provided to senior citizens and everyone else. That could make senior citizens feel like losers and non-seniors feel like winners. Some seniors may also miss getting a rebate check even if they are saving the same amount on their property tax bill.\ Also, seniors whose rebates already equal 30 percent of their tax bills, such as a couple with property taxes of $4,000 who got a rebate of $1,200, would not get any additional state support from Forrester's plan for at least two years. If they believed they were going to get more relief during those years, they could feel like losers.\ Corzine continues to give seniors more relief than other homeowners. But non-senior homeowners, who in 2004 outnumbered seniors 2-to-1, would get bigger benefit increases under Forrester's plan than Corzine's.\ Corzine's plan continues the state's policy of providing no relief to about 100,000 homeowners with gross incomes over $200,000, so they would be losers under his plan.\ Q: How much is all this going to cost?\ That's the subject of intense debate, even for the budget that the next governor would have to propose in February, just a month after being inaugurated.\ Corzine is promising to pay homeowners 10 percent more than what they got in 2004, which totaled $1.5 billion. That would make his first-year total cost $1.65 billion. The state is paying $1.1 billion in rebates this year, so Corzine would have to find an additional $550 million.\ Forrester also is saying people would get no less than they got in 2004, so that would also presumably make his starting point $1.5 billion. On top of that, he would have to find money to pay relief to homeowners making more than $200,000, who got no rebates, and to provide more relief to other homeowners whose rebates did not equal 10 percent of their property taxes. Nevertheless, Forrester's campaign says the total cost of his program in the first year would be just $1 billion, which is less than the state is paying this year.\ - Herb Jackson\ (SIDEBAR, page L03)\ By the numbers\ Plans to address property taxes proposed by Republican Doug Forrester and Democrat Jon Corzine, if enacted, would provide different amounts of relief based on homeowners' income, property tax bill, and amount of relief they already get through rebates.

Bob McDonnell, a Republican, signed a new law last month that lowers the gas tax for everyone but slaps a $64-per-year fee on hybrid and electric car owners to help make up for what those drivers aren't paying at the pump.\""What's not to like about getting better than 40 miles per gallon of gas?"" asks Kraus. ""Oh, wait -- less revenue for Virginia. Well, excuse us for helping to reduce the nation's oil dependency.""\Legislation that would levy a fee or tax on greener wheels is now pending in Texas, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Arizona. A similar bill died in committee in Idaho. Washington state added a $100 registration fee in February for all-electric vehicles.\To some, it seems like crazy, conflicting policymaking. After all, even President Obama is telling consumers to use less gas and buy hybrid and electric vehicles. But policymakers argue it makes sense because gas taxes pay for highways -- and battery-powered vehicles use the roads, too.\""The good news is they use less gas,"" Virginia Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton says of hybrid and electric vehicles. ""The bad news is they have the same impact as a regular gasoline-powered car, yet provide little or no money for highway maintenance.""\It's a conundrum facing state legislatures: How to make up for the decline in gas tax revenue -- which is in part due to the increase in sales of hybrid and electric vehicles -- without unduly penalizing those who are doing their part for the environment.\Hybrid and electric vehicle sales are expected to increase by about 17 percent to 550,000 vehicles from 2012 through 2016, according to the automotive forecasting company ALG. But they made up only 3 percent of new vehicle sales last year, so are hardly the only gas-tax culprit.\State and federal gas tax revenues are also down because:\- Federal and most state fuel taxes haven't been increased in years -- decades in some cases -- so inflation means those dollars have far less purchasing power today.\- Gas taxes are typically a flat per-gallon amount that doesn't increase as the price of gasoline does.\- People have been driving less since the recession.\- Cars are far more fuel-efficient.\Massachusetts State Sen. Richard Moore, a Democrat who sponsored that state's pending legislation, says he proposed a sales tax exemption for electric vehicles and their chargers but wants those vehicles to be charged for miles traveled, too.\""We need to encourage purchase of alternative-fuel vehicles like electric and hybrid to help diversify the sources that power our transportation ... (and) reduce vehicle emissions for the benefit of the environment,"" Moore said in an e-mailed statement. But a miles-driven tax is needed for road and bridge upkeep, he says.\The Chesapeake Climate Action Network believes politics were at work when Virginia added the tax on hybrid and electric vehicles while lowering the gas tax.\""We don't normally work on transportation, but this was such a strong, clear attack on solutions to climate change that we thought we had to do something,"" says Beth Kemler, the group's Virginia state director.\In Indiana, Republican Rep. Randy Frye had a hybrid/electric vehicle tax amendment removed from a transportation bill so a group of legislators could study the issue this summer and get advice from experts on how the tax should be set.\""We don't want to overtax or undertax,"" says Frye. Hybrid and electric vehicles ""do use the roads, so they need to pay their fair share.""\Virginia tried a fairly novel approach to address the issue, which Connaughton says represented a complete overhaul of how the state collects revenue for transportation. And he says it was long overdue.\Gas taxes are based on vehicle fuel economy in 1996 when cars averaged about 10 miles per gallon. After calculating that the typical internal combustion-powered car contributes about $100 a year in gas taxes, McDonnell decided to raise the state sales tax from 5 percent to 5.3 percent, lower the overall gas tax rate from 17.5 to 10.5 cents a gallon and add the hybrid/electric tax. It was proposed at $100, but lowered to $64.\Kraus questions Virginia's move because it's a ""flat tax on investment in energy-efficient technology.""\""Gas taxes do more than just pay for roads,"" he says. ""Gas taxes also discourage gas consumption, which means less traffic, more use of public transit, and less demand for new roads.""\Connaughton says Virginia had no choice, and soon the rest of the country will have to follow with innovative ways to fund highways. After all, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials projects there will be an average gap of $14.7 billion a year in the money needed by the federal Highway Trust Fund and the money coming into it from 2015 through 2023.\The trust fund, which pays for transit, highway construction and maintenance and safety, gets 89 percent of its revenue from the federal fuel tax.\""There is obviously the concern this will discourage people from buying these types of vehicles; however, the fee is not excessive,"" Connaughton says. ""It is a necessary evil.""\ID_Code: B3-304280124"
282,"Governor Whitman's State House stage play has featured an auto insurance opening act, school funding drama, classic clash over gas taxes, feel-good schmaltz about saving open space, and summer sound and fury over using a private company to test auto emissions.\This year's seven-month production had its ups and downs.\At times, Whitman showed she could still command center stage, getting her coveted open space plan. But the second-term governor was sometimes forced from the spotlight by Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, who may have future designs on Trenton's leading role.\Now Whitman will take her show on the road, where audiences are much kinder.\The governor will have a perpetually packed suitcase this fall as she zigs from foreign jaunts to trade missions and zags cross-country to help Republican political candidates.\""Governors always look better out of state,"" said Rider University political scientist David Rebovich. ""It would not surprise me if she takes her brand of Republicanism to the nation and develops an important voice in national Republican politics.""\Whitman's year was always plotted this way. She began by laying out her wishes for a second term, then planned a fall on the campaign trail.\Within one week this spring, Whitman believed she slayed the two dragons of New Jersey state government: auto insurance and school funding. She signed an auto insurance reform bill promising 15 percent rate cuts, then rejoiced as the state Supreme Court accepted much of her plan to change a system the court said cheats poor students.\Although the auto insurance law bore little resemblance to Whitman's proposals and implementing the school funding program could prompt big problems, the governor views both issues as early victories.\But her performance on the State House stage clashed with her traveling road show on one important topic.\While she was trying to increase New Jersey's gas tax to pay for transportation projects, Whitman boasted to Republicans in New York about the GOP being the party of tax-cutters. This didn't sit well with Assembly Democrats, who figured Republicans should go it alone in raising the gas tax. Collins, afraid of being tagged with the tax hikes in next year's elections if Democrats weren't also voting yes, bailed out.\Though politically embarrassing, the loss isn't a huge blow to Whitman. Road work won't stop, and lawmakers can revisit the issue after next year's Assembly elections.\Whitman's biggest victory was getting lawmakers to agree to a constitutional amendment to dedicate nearly $100 million a year to help purchase about 1 million acres of open space over the next decade. Whitman called it her ""most gratifying"" victory, believing stemming suburban sprawl in the nation's most densely populated state could be her greatest legacy. Voters get the final say in a Nov. 3 referendum.\A $400 million-plus contract to a private firm to build and operate a tougher auto emissions testing system brought Whitman a summer of discontent.\Lawmakers who fear driver wrath because of the tougher tests attacked the contract for weeks on end, saying state workers can do it cheaper. Democrats see the issue as a way to hit Republicans. GOP lawmakers also criticize Whitman _ to take cover if motorists howl.\The contract with lone bidder Parsons Infrastructure and Technology of San Diego provided fodder. Of all the special interest groups that gave to campaign committees led by Republican leaders last year, only four gave more than Parsons' $62,000. Parsons also hired politically connected firms for its public relations, lobbying, and engineering.\The contract was signed after the issue dominated state media for several weeks _ summer weeks, when many voters were on vacation. The fights could resume as the new system is implemented.\Whitman's road show begins in Israel later this month, where she'll receive a Friend of Zion Award from the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah on Aug. 27. In early September, there's a western swing to stump for candidates, followed by a trade trip to Mexico. Speeches and campaign stops across the country will follow.\The campaign chores bring Whitman positive publicity, grateful candidates who may help her some day, and contact with Republican voters who could be future contributors if Whitman seeks another office.\The governor is characteristically mum about her future, fending off questions about interest in a U.S. Senate run in 2000. She knows talking about another office would weaken her as a governor, and says stumping for other candidates is what good Republicans do.\Whitman makes no bones about her fight for GOP unity, saying moderates should fight attacks by the party's right wing. Last year, antiabortion groups targeted Whitman during her reelection bid. Whitman's veto of a bill to ban so-called partial-birth abortions makes some party leaders queasy about her as a potential national candidate.\But as a governor who cut taxes, Whitman is still a draw. And within the party, she doggedly espouses the ""big tent"" theory, saying Republicans should stress areas where they agree rather than focusing on abortion and other issues dividing them.\""Given the highly volatile and emotional political environment, Governor Whitman does sound like a voice of reason, of pragmatism,"" Rebovich said.\When the road show ends, Whitman's next State House engagement could find property taxes in a starring role. New Jersey still has the nation's highest local levies, and a commission appointed by the governor is expected to announce its recommendations soon."
283,"Robust debate is a priority\U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan Jr. wrote in the landmark New York Times v. Sullivan case ""that public discussion is a political duty, and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.""\Such discussion, he added, must be ""uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,"" and ""may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.""\The First Amendment embodies our profound national commitment to the above principle. New Jersey has a long and proud history of open and transparent government. But in Hillsdale, Mayor Max Arnowitz repeatedly states it is ""my meeting"" and refuses to respond to my questions on government affairs.\When closed-session minutes are withheld for 14 months, when rules are ignored, when health care benefits are extended to people failing to meet the mandates, the public has a right to voice a concern about the conduct of public officials.\When there are backroom deals, including the possible use of borough assets contrary to the mandates of the state Legislature, the people should shed light on the dark side of government.\Citizens and media organizations in other countries, including China and India, do not enjoy the same protections we do. In many parts of the world, people are harassed, imprisoned and worse, simply for challenging or criticizing government officials. Political issues create light as well as generate heat.\Kevin M. O'Brien\Hillsdale, Dec. 4\The Palestinians must work for peace\So often we hear about the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, but where is the justice? It seems as though people are constantly ignoring the importance of this.\The Palestinian Authority has done nothing to control terrorist groups running rampant. Without the arrest of the leaders of Hamas, where is any type of peace?\Last month, brutal killings occurred in a Jewish synagogue. It seems as if some terrorist groups are not stopping until Israel is destroyed. Unless these groups are controlled by the Palestinian Authority, these brutal killings will never stop.\In a place with much hate and rage, there is no way anything productive will occur. Because the Palestinian Authority is not making any large strides to stop the violence, a solution may never be reached. The Palestinian leadership must work to stop the unrest.\Jaclyn Scott\North Haledon, Dec. 4\Stop toxic gases now\With toxic greenhouse gases being released daily throughout the world into our atmosphere, it is no wonder that the United Nations wants to reach an agreement with all 190 nations. This is a problem that affects not just one nation or region but the world.\It is the responsibility of every nation to do its part in reducing these gases and keeping our atmosphere clean. Wealthier nations should help developing nations grow their economies in a way that is clean for the environment.\If a change is not made today, things only will continue to get worse. This issue deserves a united solution from the nations across the world because it affects not only today, or tomorrow, but centuries to come.\Hannah Postma\Wayne, Dec. 4\Be tough on Iran\The U.S. negotiations over nuclear weapons with Iran have missed the November deadline and are extended until July 2015. Iran has used delays in the negotiation process to continue to advance its nuclear enrichment facilities and to gain relaxed sanctions from the United States.\Iran has promised increased transparency to inspections while demanding the right to expand its nuclear development. The United States must avoid being naive enough to accept Iran's pledge to only develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. We must not be taken in by a country that has threatened our Middle Eastern ally Israel with obliteration and whose citizens cry ""Death to America.""\Iran wants to avoid crippling sanctions, which could be imposed by the U.N. Security Council and to continue to build and expand its nuclear program. We must insist that thorough inspections be permitted at any and all times. Any withdrawal on the part of Tehran to agreements must be met swiftly with severe sanctions that will harm Iran economically.\We must not allow Iran to gain nuclear weapons. The Obama administration must consider the threat to our national security and take decisive measures to block Iran's march toward that end.\Lyndsey Smith\Pompton Plains, Dec. 4\Keep the vote on selling water systems\Regarding ""Municipal water sale legislation overhauled"" (Page L-1, Dec. 2):\In the recent election, I ran for Sussex County freeholder, and one issue was dealing with Aqua America, a private water company. I lost the election, but I was a big influence in beating the company in a referendum in its efforts to take over a public water company in the Borough of Sussex.\Aqua likely will try again to expand its operations in Sussex and Warren counties. State Sen. Paul Sarlo, D-Wood-Ridge, is sponsoring a bill to make it easier to privatize public water companies. In this bill, the public would have no say if a town wants to sell its water system to a private company. Why have such a bill, when there is a broad-based movement to move back to public utilities here and internationally?\Bill Weightman\Hardyston, Dec. 4\State retirees treated poorly\Imagine my shock when my annual ""Statement of allowances and deductions"" from the state Public Employees' Retirement System arrived and there was not one penny increase in my hard-earned benefits after so many years of service to the state of New Jersey.\Our governor certainly has come through with his ""promise"" to not increase benefits to the elderly retirees of this state. I didn't vote for him before and I shall certainly not vote for him at any time in the future.\We do not deserve this punishment, and it is punishment.\Carolyn R. Stefani\Bergenfield, Dec. 5\The writer is retired director of the New Milford Public Library.\Detaining leader's wife may not help\I read recently about Lebanon saying it has detained a wife of an ISIS leader.\I had a very mixed response. Originally, I assumed it was a good accomplishment to detain the wife of a powerful terrorist leader such as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi because of the leverage it could bring and the potential aid it could be in combating such a powerful force as ISIS.\But with a second look, it was interesting to note that she was detained without authorities knowing if she was actually his wife. I think this is incorrect.\And even if she should actually be his wife, I think it is wrong to make her and her son suffer, especially in a culture where women are so beneath men. She is only one of his many wives, so detaining her will just hurt her and her son more than the actual terrorists.\Angely Montilla\Fair Lawn, Dec. 4\Gas tax should not be raised\The state Transportation Trust Fund is underfunded because, for decades, Trenton has been spending gas tax revenue on pet projects, similar to Washington's misuse of the Social Security trust fund. Any increase of the gas tax would only encourage more wasteful spending by Trenton. As the old saying goes, ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.""\Gary Poduska\Teaneck, Dec. 3"
284," Governor McGreevey's plan to divert some of the proceeds from a proposed increase in the gasoline tax to pay for the removal of tolls on the Garden State Parkway could violate the state constitution and be more expensive than officials thought, according to a study obtained by The Record on Wednesday.\ And those aren't the only roadblocks to the plan.\ Transportation and environmental groups have also attacked the proposal in recent days, saying it would let parkway drivers off the hook while saddling other commuters with higher costs at the pump.\ But McGreevey isn't shying away from the idea. He expected some hurdles and still views taking down the tolls as a good way to make a tax increase palatable, said Micah Rasmussen, the governor's spokesman.\ ""We think the people are sick and tired of hearing excuses about why things can't be done,"" Rasmussen said. ""These are the same things people said about the toll road consolidation - that it would never get done.""\ The report, drafted last month by the Office of Legislative Services, the non-partisan research and legal arm of the legislature, is an updated version of a study the office conducted two years ago.\ The plan to use gasoline tax revenues to replace parkway tolls was first touted last week by Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Roberts, D-Camden, as a way to persuade lawmakers from both parties to accept an unpopular tax increase in the waning days of the current lame-duck legislature, when outgoing or retiring lawmakers are counted on to cast their votes for a politically risky measure. The session ends on Jan. 13.\ The study reviewed by The Record was produced independent of Roberts' request that the OLS analyze the proposal.\ Roberts floated his idea on the same day a blue-ribbon commission recommended boosting the state's tax of 10.5 cents per gallon on gasoline sales to as much as 25 cents a gallon to pay for repairs to New Jersey's roads and bridges. Proceeds from the tax pay for road and rail construction throughout the state.\ By the 2006 fiscal year, however, the tax will not generate enough money for new projects, and all of its proceeds will go to paying off debt on existing work. New Jersey's gas tax is the third- lowest in the nation.\ Roberts and others have discussed diverting 3 cents of a proposed increase from regular road projects to parkway operations. But the OLS report says an increase of more than 4 cents, and possibly more, might be necessary to adequately replace toll revenue.\ The parkway raises $200 million a year from tolls. Paying toll collectors and running toll plazas costs less than $40 million - money the parkway wouldn't have to spend if the tolls were removed. That means proceeds from the gas tax would have to make up for the remaining $160 million that pays for parkway operations.\ Because each penny from the tax raises around $50 million, diverting 3 cents from it would give the parkway $150 million - $10 million less than what's needed, the report says.\ And that assumes toll collectors and other employees wouldn't be rehired in other state agencies. If those workers remained on the state payroll, McGreevey would still have to pay their $40 million in salaries. That's equivalent to almost another penny in gas taxes, the report says.\ The parkway's debt may be a thornier problem. The road owes $574 million in bonds to creditors who have contracts saying tolls will provide their investment with a steady source of revenue. Eliminating the tolls would break those contracts, the report found.\ The state could refinance the bonds and negotiate new contracts that don't require toll revenue for repayment. But that might involve shifting responsibility for the debt from the independent agency overseeing the parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, to the state, the report says. Under the state constitution, the Legislature and voters have to approve debt assumed by the state. Whether lawmakers and voters would go along with McGreevey's plan remains to be seen. But even if they did, refinancing would not come at a modest cost.\ The state's toll road agencies refinanced and consolidated $2.48 billion in parkway and turnpike debt this summer to pave the way for the merger of the parkway with the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. It's not clear whether the agencies would save any more money from refinancing again, because the cost would depend on the interest rates at the time, and there are other costs associated with refinancing. Bond fees and expenses from consultants incurred in merging the two toll roads were expected to reap $16.4 million to refinance and consolidate the debt.\ The study also does not outline the cost of removing tolls barriers, which was pegged at about $100 million, according to a report commissioned a few years ago by the New Jersey Highway Authority when it was exploring the idea of high-speed toll collection.\ Roberts argues that the concerns raised in the OLS report could be tackled easily. Eliminating the tolls could be phased in over time, allowing the parkway to lose employees by attrition or early retirement, he said. Roberts also didn't foresee a problem backing parkway bonds with new gas tax revenues. ""If you do that, I would argue you're making the bonds even safer for the bondholders,"" he said.\ The OLS report isn't the only place where concerns about McGreevey's plan have been raised.\ The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group, calls the toll removal plan a ""short-term political gimmick"" that would use nearly 40 percent of the gas tax increase to benefit just 9 percent of the state's drivers - those who use the parkway.\ McGreevey officials are spending roughly $45 million to add high- speed E-ZPass lanes at seven interchanges around the state, including four on the Garden State Parkway, the group notes. Each of the plazas cost $8 million to $10 million apiece to upgrade.\ ""We're really in favor of non-stop tolling, and it's kind of ironic that they're unveiling this toll and tax plan at the same time that drivers will be able to cruise through Hillsdale using the express lanes,"" said Jennifer Siegel, New Jersey coordinator for Tri- State.\ Jeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, said he didn't want the tolls removed either, because he wanted to make sure drivers bore an extra cost for polluting the environment.\ Tittel also feared McGreevey would gain support for the plan by promising to build new roadways in reluctant lawmakers' districts, a giveaway that could lead to more sprawl.\ * * *"

Sure, New Jersey state politics are tricky. But policymakers in the Garden State are, for no good reason, creating a big problem for themselves and their constituents.
\
By not raising the state's gas tax, which is the second lowest in the nation and hasn't been increased since the late 1980s, their transportation funding is running on empty, resulting in Gov. Chris Christie's administration having to discontinue work on various road projects. Although ""essential"" projects and certain main toll roads were spared, the shutdown resulted in layoffs and in the suspension of needed repairs on roads across the state.
\
In a nod to the urgent reality of the situation, both the New Jersey Senate and Assembly have proposed bills that would raise the state's gas tax from 14.5 cents to 37.5 cents per gallon to generate $2 billion per year for the Transportation Trust Fund. But in a nod to foolish politics, they've paired the gas tax increase with much larger cuts to other taxes.
\
The Senate bill would repeal New Jersey's estate tax, raise an income tax exemption for retirement income, raise the state earned income tax credit from 30 percent to 40 percent of the federal credit, and create a tax deduction for charitable donations. The Assembly bill, backed by Christie, also would raise the retirement tax exemption and would reduce the sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent. After the first year of implementation, the Senate bill probably would cost more than $800 million annually and the Assembly bill more than $1.8 billion.
\
Christie blames Senate Democrats for holding up a solution by not voting on the Assembly bill, but the truth is that he has long stalled efforts to address the transportation funding issue, which comes after years of inaction from lawmakers.
\
Neither the Assembly bill nor the Senate bill is an acceptable way to solve the problem. Simply put, New Jersey, just like the federal government, needs to raise its gas tax, full stop. Let me explain.
\
State infrastructure expert Elizabeth McNichol points out that 90 percent of non-defense infrastructure is owned by state and local governments that pay 75 percent of the cost of maintaining and improving this stock of roads, bridges, schools, water systems and so on. So New Jersey, like every other state, has a simple choice: either raise what you need to meet this obligation or let your infrastructure deteriorate. If you don't believe that, let me assure you -- as someone who rides the D.C. Metro -- that if you ignore transportation infrastructure, it breaks.
\
There are at least two reasons why taxes that fund transportation trust funds -- making them as much ""user fees"" as taxes -- must be periodically raised. First, inflation. The costs of wages, benefits, rents and construction materials all go up over time. In this regard, it makes no more sense to believe you should pay 1990s prices for a gallon of milk today than to believe we can maintain our infrastructure on a gas tax that has been unadjusted for decades.
\
Second, and this is a very good thing, the national fleet keeps getting better mileage. In 2007, new cars got about 20 miles per gallon. Now they're up to 25. That's good for wallets and it's good for the environment. It's bad for gas tax revenue.
\
And to be clear, New Jersey is not alone. The federal government is in exactly the same bind, with a failing highway trust fund because of a refusal to raise the federal gas tax that has been set at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993.
\
Given these realities, it requires magical thinking to convince yourself that we can provide and maintain a healthy, productive infrastructure with no increase in its funding source -- i.e., the gas tax. You wouldn't teach your kid that he or she can have what they want in life without paying for it. Yet that is the implicit message in this gas tax debate thus far.
\
But aren't I being unfair here? Haven't Christie and the Legislature agreed to raise the state's gas tax?
\
Yes and no. As noted above, their proposed increases in the gas tax have been made wholly contingent on cutting some other taxes, which is just another version of the same magical thinking.
\
If the gas tax increase is revenue neutral or worse, revenue losing, that means that although there may be more money in the highway trust fund, there's less somewhere else, and thus other spending cuts must be forthcoming. As the analysts at New Jersey Policy Perspective point out, the proposed Assembly bill would lose about $17 billion over the next 10 years ""as the price for finally enacting a gas tax increase for essential transportation capital funding. ... At a time when the state already cannot meet its current and future obligations, invest in the assets that grow a strong state economy or provide a strong safety net for its neediest residents, blowing a hole of this magnitude in the state's budget is reckless, shortsighted and -- indeed -- unfair.""
\
Perhaps there are some more benign tax trade-offs that would still be revenue positive. But if you ask me, the thing to do, both in New Jersey and the nation, is man up, stop the magical thinking and the bad fiscal parenting, and raise the gas tax to make the necessary investments in productivity-enhancing, job-creating transportation.
\
It's that simple. Or, at least, it should be.

287,"ATLANTIC CITY -- New Jersey business leaders called for a rethinking of some of the state's education, tax and transportation policies Friday at the end of a two-day forum in Atlantic City.\The forum on how to improve the state's struggling economy drew 500 business leaders from around the state.\Yet the ideas, compiled in a series of panels Thursday, soon ran into reality. At the final panel in which some of the issues were pitched to the state's four most-prominent legislators -- Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, both Democrats, and state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. and Assemblyman Jon Bramnick, heads of the Republican caucuses -- the focus on business issues often disappeared amid raucous political jockeying.\Still, Tom Bracken, head of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, which organized the event with the backing of about 40 chambers from around the state, said he was optimistic the legislators understood the gravity of the situation, and that the state had to act now to improve its business climate.\Thoughts of leaving\Several speakers from the panels described the state's situation as an ""emergency"" or ""crisis,"" with some offering anecdotes in which company executives privately discussed leaving New Jersey because the cost of doing business and the state's economic environment made it difficult for companies to flourish.\""Our goal was to start the discussion and provide some points of thought for legislators,"" Bracken said, saying the forum achieved its aim when legislators agreed to hold discussions with business leaders on the issues.\The sense of urgency was underscored with the release of state employment figures Thursday. Although they showed New Jersey's jobless rate dropping to 5.7 percent from 5.9 percent, with the state adding 13,600 jobs, the report also showed it struggling to rebound vigorously six years after the recession ended, with the jobless rate far higher than the national rate of 5.1 percent.\Prior to the legislative panel, forum speakers discussed four themes considered by the state chamber to be the most urgent facing business and the state economy: how to improve the state workforce; transportation and infrastructure; taxes; and red tape and regulation.\The list of suggestions included: ways to cut the state's income taxes; improving the way higher education programs are planned to better reflect the needs of employers, and immediately refunding the state's infrastructure investment fund.\Among the most vigorously discussed was whether the state should increase the gas tax to fund the state's near-empty Transportation Trust Fund -- an idea that appeared to have broad support among the panelists. Several speakers said the state's roads and bridges are in such bad shape that New Jersey would soon fall far behind rival states if nothing is done.\That sparked heated discussion on the legislative panel over the state's finances, with Bramnick saying he would support it only if the state reduced or ended the state inheritance tax or estate tax.\Sweeney urged business leaders to highlight more the measures that the state has already taken to improve its business climate, such as a reduction in business taxes.\""If everybody is saying, 'It's bad, it's bad, it's bad,' who the hell is going to come here?"" he said. ""How about if we partner together? I will work with this business community, not with some hokey pledge, but with a commitment that we will work together to cut taxes, cut regulation and move this state forward.""\Credit: Email: morley@northjersey.com"
288,"An angry Governor Christie, who often boasts of his bipartisan accomplishments while campaigning for president, admonished New Jersey business leaders Tuesday for ""playing footsie"" with Democrats he says want to pick the pockets of taxpayers through tax increases, and for allowing Republicans to lose seats in last month's Assembly election.\Christie used forceful and sometimes dramatic language to challenge those leaders at the annual New Jersey Business and Industry Association's public policy forum in East Windsor to ""get a spine"" and fight against ""crazy and liberal"" Democrats with policies that stifle business and job growth.\He framed the future of the state as a battle between pro-business Republicans who want to hold down spending and money-hungry Democrats who are beholden to unions.\""You're either going to fight this fight or you're going to cave. And if you cave, this is going to become a poorer, less prosperous, less happy, less innovative state. And the shame that we're going to know is that we were here to preside over its death,"" Christie said.\It was Christie's first policy-related speech in New Jersey since September. And like his announcement the day before Thanksgiving of a pardon for a rehabilitated drug addict, Tuesday's event seemed intended to reach an audience beyond the Garden State. But unlike his presidential stump speeches that offer a picture of him as a firm but pragmatic leader who says ""compromise is not capitulation,"" Christie on Tuesday likened his existence as the state's chief executive to standing in front of a tank driven by ""pigs"" in the Legislature with narrow interests and spendthrift proposals.\""We're six years and 430 vetoes into this governorship, and yet I still keep getting sent job-killing tax increases, job-killing regulatory increases and other types of legislation that is just making the business environment -- if it were enacted -- would make the business environment even worse and worse. You see, we're in the thick of this fight every day,"" Christie said. ""I think it's hard for people around the country to truly understand what it's like to be a pro-growth, pro-business Republican in a state like this, where every day you have the next idiotic idea coming out of the majority of this Legislature.""\Pension fund payment\The latest idea that fits Christie's billing came Monday, when Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, moved to constitutionally mandate that the state make its annual public employee pension contribution quarterly. In his first term, Christie worked with Sweeney to reform the state's pension system, including legislation requiring that the state annually increase its payments into the fund, but he has slashed the last three contributions and vetoed legislation earlier this year to make quarterly payments.\Sweeney is anticipated to run for governor in 2017. Christie said Sweeney and other Democrats in the Legislature are catering to the interests of unions, who, largely through super PACs, heavily and disproportionately financed advertising and campaigns against Republicans last month. In the election, Democrats won four additional seats in the Assembly, bringing its majority to 52 seats, the most in four decades. Unions, Christie said, ""bought and paid for this Legislature, and now comes the payoff.""\Sweeney said the suggestion that his proposal was meant to pander to unions ""couldn't be further from reality.""\""Four years ago, [the bill], which I sponsored along with Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., would have amended the constitution to require pension payments,"" he said. ""It passed the Senate with overwhelming support from both Democrats and Republicans. While it didn't become law, it was a good idea then, and it's a good idea now.\""Had it become law in 2011, the fiscal damage done to the pension system from the missed payments wouldn't be nearly as severe,"" Sweeney said.\Christie urged business leaders to begin fighting back with money.\""Force must meet force. That's it. That's what politics is, everybody, especially in this state,"" he said.\Democratic candidates spent 2.5 times more than Republican candidates in last month's election, and ""virtually all"" of the $10.7 million spent by independent groups benefited Democrats, said Jeff Brindle, executive director of the Election Law Enforcement Commission.\Christie has said he attended half a dozen candidate fundraisers, but the state Republican committee has also spent at least a quarter-million dollars this year for his travel and legal fees related to the George Washington Bridge scandal, according to commission records.\Christie was especially forceful in his criticism of business leaders who have entertained Democrats' ideas. He did not cite specific proposals, but Democrats have regularly said they view a gas tax increase as necessary to support the nearly depleted Transportation Trust Fund. Christie has also said he's open to raising the tax, among the lowest in the nation, but only if it represents ""tax fairness,"" meaning another tax must be reduced or eliminated.\The business association's president, Michele Siekerka, said the organization supports transportation investment and is open to any plan that does so responsibly. And the state Chamber of Commerce said it would support an increase in the gas tax if the money is dedicated to the fund and protected from being diverted for other purposes.\The governor laid blame on the business community for not putting the money and resources into an effort to educate the public about the adverse impact of putting a Democratic proposal on the ballot to amend the constitution to increase the minimum wage. Christie called it an ""embarrassment.""\""Every one of you in this room, you let it happen. You did nothing to stop it,"" he said.\Hard words on vetoes\Christie said he feels that sometimes his leadership and that of Kean and Assemblyman Jon Bramnick, the Republican leaders in the Legislature, are taken for granted, and ""that some elements of the business community can play footsie with the Democrats and say, 'Yeah, but don't worry about it, because we know the governor will be there to veto it, and Kean and Bramnick will be there to sustain the vetoes, so we get the best of both worlds.' ""\He went on, ""We can play kissy-face with the Democrats and we don't have to worry about the ramifications of those policies because they'll never come into effect because Christie and Kean and Bramnick will be the adults in the room to stop the state from going down this inevitably awful path,"" Christie said. ""That's not always going to be a given if you don't fight for it.""\Chamber President Tom Bracken said he agreed with Christie's message, but ""I'm not sure who he's talking about. We have been a very strong proponent of the Christie pro-business administration.""\Siekerka said after the speech that Christie's criticisms were ""spot-on,"" and she called the speech a ""rallying cry"" for the business community. But she also allowed that parts of the speech were more like a lecture.\""We're all adults and we can handle it,"" she said. ""And, you know what, if somebody doesn't give us the reality check in a while, shame on us.""\Credit: Email: racioppi@northjersey.com"
289,"BELMAR -- With a foggy ocean view as a backdrop, politicians and others on Monday condemned proposals to lift a 26-year moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling.\Drilling off the Jersey Shore or even off Virginia could jeopardize the tourism economy and the environment here if a spill happens, elected officials and environmental activists said at a news conference outside the Taylor Pavilion on Ocean Avenue.\Drilling also would yield little oil, take at least a decade to bear fruit and do nothing to bring down gasoline prices, said U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.\""It makes little or no sense to most of us to be drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf anywhere, but particularly in the Atlantic and the mid-Atlantic. ... in specific,"" Gov. Jon S. Corzine said. ""I think it's a nonstarter strategy.""\""What we need to do is be moving to alternative energies and most importantly, conservation,"" he said.\Corzine, a Democrat, was joined by U.S. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., Menendez, Rep. Frank J. Pallone Jr., D-N.J., and others at the news conference. The elected officials want Congress to pass their legislation to make the moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Jersey Shore and other states from Maine to North Carolina permanent, according to a statement.\While the New Jersey officials and activists criticized the prospect of offshore drilling, numerous other proposals for energy projects off the Jersey Shore could pose risks to the environment and economy, critics have said.\And these liquefied natural gas projects and offshore wind turbine projects could be up and running long before any drilling for oil occurs.\Both President Bush, a Republican, and GOP Sen. John McCain, who is seeking to succeed him, have proposed lifting the drilling ban to provide more domestic oil.\Bush wants legislation that would give states the option of opening up resources off their shores and ensure environmental protection, according to a June fact sheet on the White House's Web site.\Bush will lift an executive order banning drilling after Congress lifts the legislative moratorium, the fact sheet says.\McCain wants the moratorium lifted and ""proposes to cooperate with the states and the Department of Defense in the decisions to develop these resources,"" according to his Web site.\McCain spokesman Peter Feldman emphasized that McCain's plan doesn't mandate drilling, but would allow states to decide whether to allow it off their shores.\""New Jersey Democrats continue to distort Senator McCain's plan for cheap, clean, and secure energy for America,"" Feldman said.\Assembly Minority Leader Alex DeCroce, R-Parsippany, said Corzine should spend less energy on presidential politics and more resolving the state's own problems.\He noted Corzine has refused to rule out a gas tax increase to pay for transportation projects and just signed a budget that extended a public utility tax that was supposed to be phased out.\""Instead of criticizing candidates for federal office who are at least offering plausible, scientifically sound solutions to satisfy America's energy needs, Corzine should start leveling with the people of New Jersey about what he intends to do or not do about rising fuel costs,"" DeCroce said.\Meanwhile, three companies have proposed building liquefied natural gas facilities miles off the Jersey Shore.\Excalibur Energy (USA) Inc. wants to construct a deep-water pipeline system for natural gas about 15 miles off Asbury Park.\Atlantic Sea Island Group wants to build an island for an LNG facility 19 miles from Sea Bright, while ExxonMobil has plans for a floating LNG terminal about 20 miles from Manasquan.\In addition, five companies are competing for up to $19 million in state funding to build a potential wind turbine project in an area from Seaside Park to Stone Harbor that is up to 23 miles offshore.\State officials are evaluating whether offshore LNG facilities and wind turbines will be part of New Jersey's overall energy plan, Corzine said.\""We are more aggressive on the offshore ... wind farms, which we are ... trying to get the environmental permitting ... to move on off Atlantic City,"" he said.\""LNG we are looking at both land ... and other options and we haven't come to a conclusion on that...,"" he said.\This fall, the federal government could award leases to several companies that want to put meteorological towers off the Jersey Shore to collect information before possibly building offshore wind projects, federal officials said in April.\Lautenberg said he doesn't consider wind ""an industrialization problem because it takes a force of nature ... that is unused and doesn't diminish anything"" and has great potential like solar panels.\Regarding LNG, ""I think ... the governor said it correctly,"" he said. ""He's looking at it and that's what they've got to do ... and see what the risks are and see what the benefits are and I don't think that's appropriately been done,"" Lautenberg said.\Pallone said he opposes LNG facilities off the Jersey Shore, as well as current proposals for an offshore wind farm. But he would not rule out supporting an offshore wind project in the future.\Jeff Tittel, who directs the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter, said ""I think oil drilling is the big threat to the coast right now.""\If bottom leases for drilling are handed out, ""that's it,"" Tittel said.\""I really think that wind ... has the best potential for renewable energy,"" he said.\""We'd rather see windmills than oil derricks,"" he said.\LNG, which has some positives, is ""something we need to study,"" he said.\""Unless we're willing to look at some alternatives, we're going to perpetuate what's causing the problems now,"" he said.\But when it comes to offshore wind, ""the cart is put well before the horse"" because environmental studies have not been done and federal rules have yet to be approved, said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action.\Shaun McGrath, 25, of Wall, said people need to be educated about renewable sources of energy.\""People need to start embracing it,"" McGrath said."
290,"The new Transportation Trust Fund deal is a sell-out for the people of New Jersey. It would raise the gas tax by 23 cents but also give tax cuts to millionaires and the wealthy.

There will be no money to deal with lead in our schools or homes.\While eliminating the estate tax and cuts are permanent, the TTF is only funded for eight years.

292,"Deal collapses to fix N.J. roads\Regarding ""Plans for gas tax hike collapse"" (Page A-1, July 1):\The proposed 23-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase did not go through.\Governor Christie's response was to put a halt to all ongoing road work. Does this mean that there was no money to meet next week's payroll or does this mean he does not care that unfinished work will get trashed by traffic over the summer months? We can only hope that Donald Trump picks him as his vice-presidential candidate.\For that is the only way we can remove Christie from this state.\Michael Gilligan\Bergenfield, July 1\*\Regarding ""Plans for gas tax hike collapse"" (Page A-1, July 1):\Once again Governor Christie has tried to feather his political cap at the expense of New Jersey residents -- leaving taxpayers holding the bag after he leaves office.\There is a path to lower taxes down the road but that requires an honest bargain involving the Legislature, unions and the governor. After the bad faith shown repeatedly by the state, unions understandingly want a constitutional mandate guaranteeing payment of pension liabilities.\The tradeoff is agreeing to a transition to a capped 401(k) program going forward with matches paid by the employer, along with restoration of capped cost-of-living pension increases. The grand bargain is a gas-tax increase now with reductions in estate and sales taxes and senior property tax relief put off until pensions are restored to parity.\With balanced fiscal discipline at all levels of government we could be on the path to improvement in state credit grades.\David Sandler\Oakland, July 1\*\I wonder if the state government was considering reducing the sales tax by one percentage point to offset a gas tax increase, why not take one cent of sales tax revenues and add it to the transportation fund?\Then you don't have to stop the work that is in progress.\Do we really need a shell game to proceed with repairing and building roads in New Jersey?\Dominick Librera\Garfield, July 1\*\While we continue to turn to the politicians we elected to have our best interests at heart, we see what we really have is a bunch of non-performing, self-serving bunglers. We have no money for the Transportation Trust Fund and the pension fund. Our credit rating continues to drop like a rock in a pond.\We have a governor who has cost this state millions of dollars in lawyer fees and some of the cost of him running for president, which was a farce.\Now Governor Christie has tried to ram a 23-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase down our throats and placate us with a one-cent decrease in the sales tax.\Well, these political geniuses have it all wrong. Let's start with doing away with the Urban Enterprise Zones and the 3.5 percent sales tax. Then, drop the sales tax one or two cents for everybody. That will stimulate economic growth and still put billions of dollars into the state coffers.\Also, raise the gas tax a modest 10 cents per gallon. And then, put into motion a plan to do away with the state's estate tax over four years. That would help keep people from leaving the state and taking their money with them.\That would be the beginning of shared responsibility and shared burden.\Wayne Rallo\Wanaque, June 30\Military weapons not for civilians\Regarding ""Firearms debate after Orlando"" (Your Views, June 25):\Armalite or assault? AR-15 or Sig Sauer MCX?\Semantics and internal operating systems aside, both are devastatingly effective weapons using the same high-velocity impact ammunition as the M-16 which the U.S. military (and its allies worldwide) have yet to improve upon since the Vietnam War.\The standard ""civilian"" versions of both rifles fire .223 rounds (atop a three-inch shell) as fast as you can jerk your index finger. That's about 30 shots within 10 seconds.\Even the Army recommends using the fully automatic M-16 in single-shot mode for greater accuracy and less ammo expenditure. With a little practice you can pop in another 30-round magazine within five seconds and away you go, inflicting ""maximal wound effects"" with ""sympathetic limb fractures.""\I dare say it's beyond our imaginations what those effects were on the 20 young students at Sandy Hook Elementary School and of course on all of the victims of recent mass shootings. This .223-chambered, extra-large-capacity-magazine-equipped ""military-style"" rifle does not belong in civilian hands.\John C. Favreaux\Hasbrouck Heights, June 28\*\As I remember basic training, the M-1 rifle was replaced by the M-14 which was then replaced by the M-16, also known as the AR-15 when it was introduced by Colt.\None of these weapons fires a bullet that tumbles in the air causing maximum carnage. The bullets rotate due to the rifling of the barrel until they hit their targets where they may be deflected by the mass of the target. And that can result in tumbling.\Chuck Forbes\Ringwood, June 30\Garrett driven by contributors\Regarding ""Financial CHOICE Act would spur economic growth"" (Other Views, June 29):\Rep. Scott Garrett's fox-guarding-the-henhouse approach masks the truth: He gets campaign contributions from the securities/investment industry and commercial banks.\He and his cohorts would undo the Dodd-Frank Act, which has put a new cop on the beat for consumers, and that agency's independence and aggressiveness has produced more than $10 billion in direct benefits to Americans wronged by their financial services companies. The agency's real coup is winning $7.5 billion in debt cancellation, principal reduction or other modifications to what customers owe banks and lenders.\Garrett's support of the Financial Choice Act would, among other things, do away with a rule that restricts a bank's ability to make risky speculative investments and increase congressional oversight of independent regulatory agencies, thus effectively subjecting them to political influence. Do we really want another 2008 financial collapse?\Joel Zelnik\Closter, June 29\Trump disconnected from reality\Donald Trump's recent proclamation that he would approve waterboarding shows once again how disconnected he is from reality, decency and how far he has strayed from the moral compass that defines a civilized people.\Waterboarding has been proven not to work, and is a stain on the soul of a nation. It also creates a culture of dehumanization and self-loathing that permanently scars the perpetrator and lays seed to an environment of hate, vindictiveness and brutality for others to emulate and justify. Is this the America that we want our children to read about in the history books?\Apparently, Trump is sufficiently unhinged to articulate and encourage such talk. Each day that we learn more about Trump, it becomes obvious that he doesn't have any knowledge or constructive plan for confronting challenges within the framework of international law or treaties. His reactions to crisis are visceral, devoid of decency and insight.\Hopefully the flames of hatred, ignorance and ego that he stokes will continue to consume his candidacy.\Stephen Talercio\Mahwah, June 29\Horizon must be transparent\The state Appellate Division is preventing discovery of certain documents relating to Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey's plan to divide area hospitals into different tiers under its Omnia insurance plan.\Hospitals that brought a lawsuit against Horizon challenging its controversial plan and seeking criteria related to how hospitals were placed into Tier 1 and Tier 2 designations were denied that information under a decision recently issued.\However, there is nothing in the law that would prevent Horizon from voluntarily sharing the selection criteria used -- and the weight afforded to each factor -- to assign hospitals to different tiers, resulting in various coverage schedules.\Transparency would go a long way toward helping those insured by Horizon to understand the differences in insurance coverage. It would restore the faith of the hospitals that decisions were made openly and fairly.\I urge Horizon to make this information available for the benefit of its consumers and its health care partners.\Loretta Weinberg\Teaneck, June 30\The writer, a Democrat, represents the 37th District in the state Senate.\Tough questions on right to life\Regarding ""Texas law was about safety"" (Your Views, June 30):\Two letter writers illustrate the emotional response of some right-to-life advocates to a U.S. Supreme Court decision on abortion.\Using terms such as ""liberal organization,"" ""smug indifference,"" ""biased arrogance,"" ""despicable court decision,"" ""blatant propaganda,"" ""greed"" and ""dishonesty"" demonstrate the emotions that are involved.

However, psychiatric evaluation accounts for only approximately 20 percent of psychiatric services, while psychiatrists spend 80 percent of their time providing medication monitoring services, which did not receive any rate adjustment.

293," NJ TRANSIT is proposing a 10 percent fare hike that would be mostly borne by the state's biggest users of mass transit poor and working-class bus riders. Something has to change.\ For many, the fare hike would be a hardship. The hardship would be even harder to take because the pain would be unevenly distributed: Bus and train riders in New Jersey keep digging deeper into their pockets, while motorists get a relatively free ride.\ NJ Transit's fare hike would be the third increase in a decade. But it has been 19 years since the state raised its gas tax and 18 since it increased its parkway tolls.\ That is unfair. It is also bad policy. New Jersey needs to encourage more people to leave their cars for buses and trains. One way to do this is to start making life a little harder for motorists and a little easier for mass transit riders.\ The proposed NJ Transit fare hike may be unavoidable. The agency has a budget hole that must be filled. But if the NJ Transit board approves the increase, it should do so on the condition that the state make long-overdue changes in how it funds transportation.\ New Jersey needs to stop hitting up bus and train riders every time mass transit needs money. It needs a stable funding source to pay for running the system. This should not be hard to implement. The Legislature could, for example, dedicate a fraction of some statewide tax to mass transit. Currently, NJ Transit is the only major mass transit system in the nation without a dedicated source of revenue. That's fiscally irresponsible.\ The state also needs to start charging drivers more to reflect the true price to the public of automobile transportation, in air pollution costs as well as in highway maintenance. The first step is to raise the gas tax. New Jersey has the third-lowest gas tax in the nation. If Governor Corzine is serious about making the state a leader in combating global warming, he needs to convince the Legislature to make driving more expensive and buses and trains more attractive. The state could do this by dedicating the revenues from the gas tax increase to NJ Transit's operating budget.\ It might seem far-fetched that the governor and legislators would consider raising the gas tax in a year when the entire state Senate and Assembly are up for election. After all, Corzine and legislative leaders have been trying to paint themselves as tax cutters, not tax raisers.\ But New Jersey voters might be more open now than in the past to a modest gas tax increase. Last year's spike in gas prices woke everyone up to the fact that the era of cheap energy is over. This year's alarming reports on global warming highlighted the need to reduce emissions now.\ Getting more drivers off roads is good for the environment. Keeping mass transit affordable is good for all New Jerseyans. This proposed fare increase may not be avoidable; the next one is."
294,"Washington Bureau\WASHINGTON\Once again, businesses, unions and lawmakers have concluded the gas tax should be raised to pay for improving the nation's deteriorating and increasingly crowded highway and transit systems.\Once again, there's not much chance Congress will go along.\The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is considering a six-year, $500 billion bill -- $450 billion for highways and transit, and $50 billion for high-speed rail -- that its members say is necessary to help the economy recover.\""General Mills in Minnesota loses $2 million for every mile an hour their trucks travel below the speed limit because they have to pay overtime charges and late delivery fees,"" said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who chairs the committee. ""That's not the kind of transportation we need in America to keep this economy moving, to keep our society mobile. We need a robust investment.""\The current six-year transportation bill, which expired Wednesday, cost $286 billion and was funded primarily by the federal 18.4-cent tax on every gallon of fuel. Unable to agree on a new bill, Congress voted Wednesday to extend the existing legislation for one month.\If nothing changes, states would get about $325 billion over the next six years for highways and transit projects, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Reaching the $450 billion target would probably take around a 10-cent increase in the tax, said Greg Cohen, president of the American Highway Users Alliance.\There seems little chance of that, given President Barack Obama's opposition to the idea and a reluctance among congressional leaders to consider increasing a tax that's remained the same since 1993.\""Let's face it, the American people, right now especially, cannot afford an increase in the gas tax,"" Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., said on the House floor last week. ""Such a tax would hit the unemployed, would hit small businesses, would hit those least able to afford it, the hardest.""\Despite the opposition by Cantor and other Republican leaders, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a traditional GOP ally, supports raising the gas tax. But there's little appetite in Congress for doing so when lawmakers have to face the voters again in November 2010.\""Our research shows that the average person is willing to support a gas tax increase for highways,"" Cohen said. ""But in the polarized atmosphere, people are afraid that their vote will hurt them in a hyper-political environment.""\Opposition to raising the gas tax has prompted some to look at other ways to get revenue, such as issuing bonds, raising other fuel-related fees, or even a tax on transit fares. But there's uncertainty over how those ideas would be received and how well they would work.\The need is increasingly dire.\Commuters collectively logged 4.2 billion hours stuck in traffic in 2007, nearly one full work week per traveler, according to the Texas Transportation Institute, which tracks traffic patterns in 439 urban areas. The overall cost in wasted fuel and lost productivity reached $87.2 billion -- more than $750 for every traveler. And the total amount of wasted fuel topped 2.8 billion gallons -- three weeks' worth of gas for every traveler.\Reach Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com\-"
295,"Washington Bureau\WASHINGTON\Once again, businesses, unions and lawmakers have concluded the gas tax should be raised to pay for improving the nation's deteriorating and increasingly crowded highway and transit systems.\Once again, there's not much chance Congress will go along.\The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is considering a six-year, $500 billion bill -- $450 billion for highways and transit, and $50 billion for high-speed rail -- that its members say is necessary to help the economy recover.\""General Mills in Minnesota loses $2 million for every mile an hour their trucks travel below the speed limit because they have to pay overtime charges and late delivery fees,"" said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who chairs the committee. ""That's not the kind of transportation we need in America to keep this economy moving, to keep our society mobile. We need a robust investment.""\The current six-year transportation bill, which expired Wednesday, cost $286 billion and was funded primarily by the federal 18.4-cent tax on every gallon of fuel. Unable to agree on a new bill, Congress voted Wednesday to extend the existing legislation for one month.\If nothing changes, states would get about $325 billion over the next six years for highways and transit projects, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Reaching the $450 billion target would probably take around a 10-cent increase in the tax, said Greg Cohen, president of the American Highway Users Alliance.\There seems little chance of that, given President Barack Obama's opposition to the idea and a reluctance among congressional leaders to consider increasing a tax that's remained the same since 1993.\""Let's face it, the American people, right now especially, cannot afford an increase in the gas tax,"" Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., said on the House floor last week. ""Such a tax would hit the unemployed, would hit small businesses, would hit those least able to afford it, the hardest.""\Despite the opposition by Cantor and other Republican leaders, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a traditional GOP ally, supports raising the gas tax. But there's little appetite in Congress for doing so when lawmakers have to face the voters again in November 2010.\""Our research shows that the average person is willing to support a gas tax increase for highways,"" Cohen said. ""But in the polarized atmosphere, people are afraid that their vote will hurt them in a hyper-political environment.""\Opposition to raising the gas tax has prompted some to look at other ways to get revenue, such as issuing bonds, raising other fuel-related fees, or even a tax on transit fares. But there's uncertainty over how those ideas would be received and how well they would work.\The need is increasingly dire.\Commuters collectively logged 4.2 billion hours stuck in traffic in 2007, nearly one full work week per traveler, according to the Texas Transportation Institute, which tracks traffic patterns in 439 urban areas. The overall cost in wasted fuel and lost productivity reached $87.2 billion -- more than $750 for every traveler. And the total amount of wasted fuel topped 2.8 billion gallons -- three weeks' worth of gas for every traveler.\Reach Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com\-"
296,"Schedule hearings\on light-rail plan\Union County officials keep talking about a cross-county light-rail line from Elizabethport to Plainfield - though there appear to be no live plans or official support for extending it west of downtown Elizabeth.\Two county residents who were among the original proponents of a cross-county line told our editorial board the other day that the entire project is being developed behind closed doors with little opportunity for public input.\The benefits of such a light-rail connection extend west of Plainfield to Somerset County; they are not confined to a single county. Nor, given the tax dollars involved, can this be treated as a private slice of pork.\NJ Transit should convene public hearings in Union County to describe what is presently proposed and entertain suggestions about alternatives and modifications that deserve consideration.\It does seem that the process for developing the plan has been tightly controlled by Democrats in control of Elizabeth and Union County governments. It also seems to have advanced despite an obvious conflict of interest involving Raytheon Corp., prime contractor for the light-rail line under construction along the Hudson River waterfront.\County freeholders awarded the contract for designing the line to Raytheon and two major New Jersey engineering firms - which appear to have had relatively little involvement. Not surprisingly, Raytheon came up with a plan for a 5.8-mile loop from downtown Elizabeth to the Garden Mall at Elizabethport to Newark International Airport - linking there with the other light-rail line Raytheon is building.\The problem is that Raytheon's light-rail systems are electrified. There is insufficient width in the Raritan Valley Railroad right-of-way to add electrified track west of Cranford to Plainfield.\So, as Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage is said to strongly prefer, the only part of the cross-county plan that is being approved by NJ Transit for state and federal funding is the loop designed by Raytheon.\As a former public relations representative for Raytheon, NJ Transit Executive Director Jeffrey Warsh is thoroughly familiar with the reasons for reducing the cross-county line to an Elizabeth-Elizabethport-Newark Airport loop.\He needs to share them with Union County residents and listen to their proposals for a Plainfield-Elizabeth link using self-powered diesel cars on Raritan Valley tracks.\Our position\NJ Transit needs to hold a public hearing to explain the truncated version of a Union County Light Rail Line and to hear proposals for alternative service from Elizabeth to Plainfield.\Legislature must postpone\action on big-ticket items\Sugarplums dance in the eyes of New Jersey's elected and appointed officials. Big, expensive ones. A $272 million new arena in the Meadowlands is being proposed by new Sportsplex President James DiEleuterio. Assemblyman Guy Gregg, R-Washington Township, wants to bulldoze all toll booths on the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City Expressway - retiring their $3.3 billion debt with a gas-tax increase.\Well, the days of this lame-duck session draw down to a precious few - too few to properly evaluate all the proposals born of a combination of necessity and opportunity.\Gov. Christie Whitman wants both houses to reconcile a multibillion-dollar school construction bill before the session adjourns Jan. 10.\We doubt even that task can, or should be, completed in that brief time-span.\Appropriations Committee chairmen, Sen. Robert Littell, R-Franklin, and Assemblyman Richard Bagger, R-Westfield, should seek agreement of Senate President Donald DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins to postpone consideration of all big-ticket items - school construction, refinancing of the Transportation Trust Fund, divvying up the tobacco suit settlement, a new Meadowlands Arena and removal of all New Jersey toll booths - until the new session.\These are serious proposals that deserve full consideration in a less pressured Statehouse environment than prevails in a lame-duck session.\Clearly, all these good works can't be financed from surplus revenue, gas-tax hikes, tobacco suit proceeds or - call 911 - additional borrowing. Lawmakers will have to choose very carefully."
297,"You may have heard that New Jersey has a transportation funding crisis on its hands. The state's Transportation Trust Fund is nearly depleted, and officials have yet to decide upon an ongoing source of revenue to replenish the pot. While some federal money will continue to be available, an empty state fund would delay or indefinitely postpone many needed projects.\Meanwhile, bleak news continues to pour in regarding the deterioration of the state's infrastructure. A new report from the Federal Highway Administration ranked New Jersey's bridges as the sixth worst in the nation.\Democrats and transportation advocates have increasingly been beating the drums for an increase in the gas tax. Republicans have been largely silent on the issue, signaling a grudging acceptance that a hike may be unavoidable. Transportation Commissioner Jamie Fox has warned that fast action is needed, and we've recently seen some key bridges shut down for repairs. More closures will follow, potentially for extended periods.\So there is a broad, bipartisan realization that we've reached the end of an increasingly rocky road toward a long-term solution on transportation funding and tough decisions have to be made very soon. But there's a lone voice out there still denying there's any crisis at all. Unfortunately that misguided soul is a powerful one -- Gov. Chris Christie.\Last week's budget address was notable for many reasons, including Christie's complete avoidance of the transportation funding concerns. While he prattled on about his herculean efforts to tackle the pension crisis head on and the need for further reform, he didn't go near the gas tax.\Critics rightfully slammed him for ducking such a vital and much discussed problem, so much so that Christie felt compelled to respond later in the week. He downplayed any talk of a crisis ""at the moment"" and insisted New Jersey's was ""funded pretty well"" for transportation projects.\Which ""moment"" is he talking about? The governor is quick to summon dark clouds of doom about countless other fiscal issues, but on this he wrings his hands about rushing into things and decides everything's OK?\This is the worst manifestation we have yet to see of Christie's abandonment of New Jersey in favor of his presidential campaign. Christie clearly has no idea how to fund transportation. But he is loath to publicly give succor to those supporting a gas-tax hike, since that would displease national conservatives.\So what does Christie do? He simply denies the problem exists, as undoubtedly recommended by his campaign strategists. His budget proposal relies on $600 million worth of borrowing to keep things afloat for awhile, the kind of short-term funding maneuver he has so often criticized in other contexts. Honesty doesn't matter here; it's about carefully cultivating his image, however false that image may be.\But New Jerseyans can't afford to wait for it all to get worse. Christie preaches fast action on pension reform and promotes his refusal to put off solutions as a virtue. But he's doing the complete opposite on transportation.\There's one possible out here, short of Christie's presidential aspirations going up in scandalous flames. Christie's choice of the Democrat Fox to return as transportation commissioner wasn't merely some across-the-aisle bow to a qualified leader. Christie had to know Fox would embrace a gas-tax solution to the funding crisis. He knows many Democrats are already on board. He helped create an environment he knew would generate momentum for hiking the gas tax.\So Christie may be laying the groundwork to claim he's been forced to accept a tax hike. He could be readying a deal with Dems to trade the increase for something else he wants. Or maybe he'll play it out all the way, letting legislators approve an increase before vetoing the measure -- then privately telling a few Republican lackeys to help override the veto.\That may look like he's ""lost control"" of his party, but at least he could argue that he fought the good fight as far as he could go and never supported a tax increase.\So how can New Jersey raise its gas tax and fix its transportation funding while its governor pretends there isn't a problem and publicly opposes any tax hikes? We may soon find out."

\
Top officials in Gov. Jon S. Corzine's administration traded barbs with a key Democratic lawmaker yesterday over plans to leverage a state asset, such the New Jersey Turnpike, into an immediate cash infusion.
\
Assemblyman John Wisniewski, D-Middlesex, chairman of the Assembly transportation committee, said it was an ""affront to the Legislature"" that Treasurer Bradley Abelow and Transportation Commissioner Kris Kolluri de-clined an invitation to testify yesterday on the administration's plans.
\
The two Cabinet officers quickly responded that it was ""irresponsible"" for the committee to hold hearings attacking plans that are still being crafted.
\
""We view it as being people trying to be, folks trying to be pre-emptive and create an environment where it's impossible to talk about this issue. Frankly, I'm surprised by that and I view it as irresponsible,"" Abelow said.
\
Abelow later added, ""We just don't understand people getting stuck in cement in opposition to something they haven't seen.""
\
Wisniewski, an outspoken opponent of a Turnpike sale or lease, said lawmakers have ""an obligation"" to understand plans that he believes will forfeit years of revenue for a lump sum now.
\
""Everything that I've seen and have been told by the treasurer and the commissioner of transportation and the administration is about taking tomorrow's dollars and spending them today. If they want to show me how that's not true, they could have come here today and told us that,"" Wisniewski said. His committee discussed, but did not vote on, bills barring a sale or lease of the New Jersey Turnpike.
\
The sharp exchange illustrated the divide between Corzine, who made a fervent push for ""asset monetization"" Thursday during his budget address, and lawmakers, who are wary of the idea.
\
Wisniewski's committee already held one hearing in which members of the panel spent an afternoon beating up an idea to sell or lease the Turnpike. Corzine believes the state needs to creatively use its assets, such as tolls roads or the state lottery, to get an up front sum of money that would reduce debt and free up funding for priorities such as schools, open space and transit investment.
\
Abelow said he hopes to make a formal proposal within four to six weeks, although it could take more time if Corzine has additional questions. Abelow expects to have ""months"" of hearings for the public and lawmakers once the administration lays out a plan, leaving time to understand about the issue.
\
""We're not going to spring anything on people,"" Abelow said.
\
While much of the focus remains on a potential windfall from the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway or state lottery, Abelow said the administration is also considering its options on the Atlantic City Expressway.
\
One option for the toll roads could be securitizing toll revenue. Peter Humphreys, a partner in New York law firm McDremott Will & Emery, said the state could receive $1.2 billion now by raising tolls 15 percent and dedicating the new revenue to investors for 15 years. Under that scenario, the state would maintain all control over the road.
\
During debate on the bills barring a toll road sale, Steven Gardner, a representative for construction workers and contractors, argued that without a new funding plan, the state would have to hike the gas tax by 30 cents to meet its current road construction needs. Wisniewski said a gas tax is a ""component"" of funding for transportation projects but did not say he supported a levy increase.

302,"""Middle class, working poor -- trying to get to work, (they) have no other way to get to their jobs. That gas tax hike is going to be big.""\State Sen. Jennifer Beck, R-MONMOUTH\TRENTON - As the political warfare continues over how to fund the Transportation Trust Fund, Gov. Chris Christie issued the latest salvo, ordering the state halt work on all but ""absolutely essential"" transportation projects.\Christie's executive order, signed after 11 p.m. Thursday, requires the Department of Transportation and NJ Transit to come up with a list of projects funded through the state's Transportation Trust Fund by 11:59 p.m. today. The executive order does not require that work on such projects stop at that midnight deadline. Instead, the list will be used to determine which projects can cease in a safe and orderly fashion, said Steve Schapiro, communications director for the DOT.\""Safety is the top priority, and NJ DOT and NJ Transit are in the process of identifying projects and developing plans to safely cease work on TTF-funded projects,"" Schapiro said. ""Any emergency work that may arise that affects public safety, such as emergency bridge or track work or repairing a downed traffic signal, will be done as necessary.""\He said the executive order impacts any Transportation Trust Fund-supported projects at any stage of development, which includes design, construction and procurement. However, funding for DOT and NJ TRANSIT projects comes from not just the Transportation Trust Fund, but from federal and other sources as well, and the state will continue to receive those federal dollars. Work will continue on non-Transportation Trust Fund projects.\In his executive order, Christie did not hesitate to place blame on the state Senate, which declined Thursday to take any action on either of the proposed bills designed to resuscitate the Transportation Trust Fund, which ran out of money Thursday night to pay for any projects. While both proposed bills would raise the state's gasoline tax by 23 cents overnight, Christie championed a bill introduced by Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, D-Hudson, that would couple the tax hike with a sales tax cut from 7 percent to 6 percent, and provide retirement tax cuts as well.\The bill preferred by the Senate is a bipartisan bill from Sens. Paul Sarlo, D-Bergen, and Steve Oroho, R-Sussex, which traded the 23-cent gas tax hike for an estate tax phaseout and increased earned income tax credit.\""Senate Democrats are clearly conflicted over how to appease their public and private-sector union masters, because their union masters also are divided over the bipartisan tax fairness solution that passed the Assembly,"" Christie wrote in his executive order.\As a result of the ""Senate inaction,"" Christie ordered all work paid for by the state's Transportation Trust Fund -- the beneficiary of gasoline taxes -- to be brought to a halt.\""In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this state, it is necessary that the remaining amounts held by the TTF (Transportation Trust Fund) not be spent on any transportation project that is not absolutely essential,"" Christie said.\The fund accounts for about 42 percent of the state Department of Transportation's fiscal year 2017 budget.\The Senate bill had seemed destined for passage until Monday, when -- after negotiations with Christie -- the Assembly on early Tuesday morning passed a bill that would raise the state's gasoline tax to 37.5 cents per gallon, seventh-highest in the United States, and cut the sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent over an 18-month period.\If legislators passed and Christie signed a gasoline tax bill on Thursday, gasoline that costs $2.06 per gallon would have cost $2.29 per gallon on Friday morning, about $3 more for an average fuel tank.\Christie's proposed sales tax cut would result in a 20-cent savings on a $19.99 purchase. A proposed cut in the estate tax would only apply to people with assets worth over $675,000.\State Sen. Jennifer Beck, R-Monmouth, said Friday that the reason neither of the bills advanced in the Legislature was due to the volume of calls in opposition to the measures from the people of New Jersey to the office of Senate President Stephen M. Sweeney, D-Gloucester.\""It shut down his phone line,"" Beck said. ""At a grassroots level, people are furious that the Legislature is considering raising taxes by $1.3 billion. No one buys the half-cent sales tax reduction. People are skeptical about how many people will actually get to take advantage of the estate tax. Despite the fact it's a good public policy, you're talking seven million people, 6.54 million licensed drivers in the state of New Jersey, and it's a big deal. I mean -- middle class, working poor -- trying to get to work, (they) have no other way to get to their jobs. That gas tax hike is going to be big.""\Sweeney issued a statement Friday in which he said was disappointed that Christie had decided to act so quickly to freeze so many important transportation projects.\""Most painful will be the workers laid off because of this immediate stoppage,"" Sweeney said.\Nevertheless, the Office of Legislative Services has informed Sweeney's office that the trust fund has enough funding to get it through early August.\Ocean County Administrator Carl W. Block said Friday that the county government sought clarification on Friday as to what it needed to do immediately to be in legal compliance with the governor's executive order.\""We're still awaiting clarification of the details, although the initial outlook at this point is that it will not have a major impact on Ocean County,"" Block said on Friday evening. ""That could change on Tuesday.""\There are few road and bridge projects -- including the new East Bay Avenue bridge in Barnegat that opened last month -- that the county is owed an outstanding $100,000 from the trust fund, that the county may not receive until this crisis is resolved, Block said.\Additionally, there are some projects that are about to be started that could be delayed, Block said. However, the county government has not been able to get a straight answer from Trenton about the extent of the impact to local government.\Oroho, who sits on the Budget and Appropriations Committee, warned that New Jersey residents and property taxpayers will soon start to see the effects as transportation projects statewide grind to a halt, and local road and bridge repair, and maintenance, begin to fall on municipal and county governments.\""The governor's executive order shows that the possibility of work on roads and bridges stopping without a new TTF plan is not merely hypothetical,"" Oroho said. ""It's happening now.""\Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said in a statement Friday that New Jersey said a gas tax is needed to fund more public transit, not new roads that will harm the environment. Having more dissatisfied transit riders means more people will drive, adding to traffic, pollution, and sprawl. Compared to motorists, many transit commuters feel an unfair burden of increased costs, while the gas tax has not been increased.\Nevertheless, Tittel criticized the governor's tactics.\""The governor's actions are unconscionable,"" he said. ""We had until August to make a decision yet he felt the need to issue this executive order out of spite. Both bills proposed in the Legislature would have hurt the people of New Jersey. The governor has only done this because he didn't get what he wanted. The best deal for the TTF was no deal but the governor doesn't care about doing what's best for the people of New Jersey.""\Erik Larsen: 732-682-9359; elarsen@gannettnj.com or Mike Davis: 732-643-4223; mdavis@gannettnj.com\""Middle class, working poor -- trying to get to work, (they) have no other way to get to their jobs.

Every problem - large or small, genuine or perceived - will arrive on your doorstep. It will be your task to separate them and concentrate on those that weigh most heavily on the state and its people.\ You will occupy what is arguably the most powerful governor's office in the nation, but it is not your responsibility to repair everyone's leaky faucet. You have a staff for that.\ Take the paperwork home with you at the end of the day, but don't take the job home, too.\ In reaching decisions, listen to your Cabinet, your staff and the people you trust, but never forget it's your call.\ Oh, one more thing - if you want to know what's really going on, call your press secretary two or three times a day.\ Frank Lautenberg\ U.S. senator, D-N.J.\ Hard to give anyone as experienced as you advice, Governor Codey, but being a politician permits me to abandon any such restraint, so here are a couple of ideas on how to endear yourself in New Jersey.\ Drive to Exit 16-18E on the Turnpike on a Friday night at 6 p.m. and don't lose your temper or your mind. Hurry up and solve that problem!\ Remember: ""What New Jersey makes, New York takes."" Don't let them steal the Giants, Jets or the Nets without providing a commitment to build a toll-free tunnel under the Hudson River.\ Last: Promise to keep billboards off New Jersey's beaches. Instead promise our beachgoers better health by selling New Jersey berries or peaches on our beaches. Diet-conscious swimmers will salute the absence of hot dogs and pizza.\ From one Jersey boy to another - Good luck and best wishes.\ Michele Byers\ Executive director, New Jersey Conservation Foundation\ Protecting our state's environment has strong bipartisan citizen support. New Jersey has led the nation in protecting its environment, but much work remains. Here are three things Governor Codey could do to make sure that New Jersey's environmental protection record continues.\ * Establish a task force to develop deliberative and thoughtful recommendations that will yield replacement legislation for the current ""fast track"" law. The current law, intended to expedite ""smart growth,"" is unworkable and ineffective.\ * Begin the reauthorization and expansion of the Garden State Preservation Trust program for continued funding of open space and farmland. This should include dedicated funding for stewardship of our parks, forests, wildlife management areas and greenways, and policies that ensure lands are protected in line with public expectations.\ * Fully fund the Department of Environmental Protection and expand its ability to protect threatened and endangered species and upland forests, and to safeguard our water supplies.\ Steve Lonegan\ Mayor, R-Bogota, and candidate for governor\ Acting Governor Codey must recognize that New Jersey's state government is bankrupt. Spending must be reduced immediately. A 2006 budget substantially less than this year's massive spending plan must be submitted. He must immediately end state bonding without public approval.\ The governor must be willing not only to stand up to powerful labor unions and liberal special interests, but also to members of his own party. He must repeal unfunded mandates such as the McGreevey executive orders requiring the use of expensive union workers on all taxpayer-funded construction projects, which cause much higher costs and higher property taxes.\ He must reduce taxes and regulations to promote small business growth, and he must pass tort and medical malpractice reform.\ Last year's tax increases, including the new real estate transfer fees, must be repealed.\ Conservative judges need to be appointed to bring back balance to the courts and to uphold the state constitution.\ Bill Pascrell Jr.\ U.S. congressman, D-8th District\ As governor, Dick Codey's first priority must be to restore the public's trust in our state government, and he must do it quickly and decisively. Promises and rhetoric won't cut it.\ What is needed is an established tone of integrity - a fresh start that makes it clear that we are serious about cleaning up how government works.\ In order for a chief executive to be effective in New Jersey, the people must believe that our government is not run by political contributors. He cannot do this on his own, it must be done in a bipartisan manner.\ I have the utmost confidence in Dick Codey. He is a well- respected, honest legislator who will reach across the aisle and get things done.\ Bob Menendez\ U.S. congressman, D-District 13\ I've served with Senator Codey, and I've seen his expertise, integrity and commitment. I know that the last thing he needs is a lesson on the nuts and bolts of New Jersey government.\ My advice is simple. Trust yourself. And trust the people of this great state.\ After experiencing the bitter atmosphere in Washington, I know Senator Codey and our state will be well served by his skills at building bipartisan consensus.\ From the suburban streets of Bergen County to the city blocks of Camden to the sand dunes at the shore, we New Jerseyans share the same hopes for a state where we can afford to live and grow old, where our schools are launching pads for every child, where we are safe, where good jobs and good housing are available and where those who have stand with those who need.\ I wish Dick Codey the best of luck as he begins his new post.\ Jon Orcutt\ Executive director, Tri-State Transportation Campaign\ New Jersey's gas tax has been borrowed against so heavily that the state's Transportation Trust Fund is now paying nearly all of its proceeds to debt service. Without new funding sources, road and bridge repair and new mass transit projects will simply not happen.\ At the same time, New Jersey Transit's operating budget cannot cover the costs of new lines and the higher service frequencies the agency has introduced on existing train and bus routes. NJT is neglecting infrastructure upkeep just to meet day-to-day expenses.\ Topping it all off, truck traffic volumes on our highways are skyrocketing, with no signs of the trend abating over the next two decades. The case for significant public investment in rail freight is growing every year.\ Raising enough money to address all of these problems will be a very heavy lift, but the state really has no choice.\ Scott Garrett\ U.S. congressman, R-District 5\ Under McGreevey's management, New Jerseyans lost confidence in their governor's abilities to lead and felt as though the actions of their state leader did not represent the will of the people of New Jersey.\ Acting Governor Codey now has the unique opportunity to not only restore this confidence but also integrity to the governor's office in Trenton.\ Codey should use this time not to play political games but to foster an environment of trust and bipartisanship with the GOP and take the steps needed to rein in government spending, lower taxes and restore high ethical standards to our political system.\ However, the greatest accomplishment Codey can achieve would be to put partisan politics aside and rebuild the trust between the people of our great state and their elected leaders.\ I look forward to working with Dick Codey at the federal level to achieve what is in the best interest of the people of New Jersey.\ Steve Rothman\ U.S. congressman, D-District 9\ My advice for acting Governor Codey is to use his vast experience, intelligence, integrity and well-known determination to balance New Jersey's budget without resorting to fiscal gimmicks, so that our state can continue to attract and grow small and large businesses, providing our residents with good-paying jobs.\ Our state's economic future depends on restoring solvency and regular funding to New Jersey's Transportation Trust Fund - the major source of dollars for our state's road, rail and mass transit initiatives. These vital transportation improvements will help New Jersey's businesses and allow the rest of us to spend less time in traffic and more time with our families and friends.\ Acting Governor Codey should continue our state's aggressive efforts to purchase, at fair market value, as many significant parcels of open space that remain in our overcrowded Garden State.\ I very much look forward to helping him with these efforts.\ Paul DiGaetano\ Assemblyman, R-Rutherford, and candidate for governor\ I'm running for governor because the Democrats in Trenton have spent, borrowed and taxed us into a hole.\ As Ronald Reagan said, ""We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough, we have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.""\ The same is true in New Jersey.\ I suggest that you, Governor Codey, join me in making real structural changes to state government to hold down the cost of government for generations to come.\ I have introduced the New Jersey Taxpayer Bill of Rights to cap state spending at a rate limited to population growth plus the rate of inflation. Excess tax revenue will be returned to taxpayers annually. Had the Democrats supported a plan like mine three years ago, the state would have already returned $3 billion to taxpayers.\ Governor, my advice is that we work on a bipartisan basis to make my spending cap the law.\ Ronald Rice\ State senator, D-District 28\ I'm glad Senator Codey's finally getting into the governor's office after this very long transition.\ I've had a very good relationship with Codey over the 20-plus years we've known each other. As chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, I am confident that he will make sure blacks, women, Hispanics and other minorities are well represented in his administration.\ His getting elected and reelected in the type of diverse district he has had over the years proves he knows how to work with blacks and other minorities.\ I've worked very closely with him in the Legislature over the years. From my perspective, the state will be in very good hands for at least the next 14 months.\ Thomas Gilbert\ Executive director, Highlands Coalition\ As governor, Richard Codey should continue the commitment that both he and Governor McGreevey have made to protecting the Highlands. Protecting the water supply for more than half the state will likely be their greatest legacy.\ The job is not yet finished, though.\ The Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council will need his full support and adequate funding, both to develop a strong regional master plan and to purchase priority lands in the preservation and planning areas.\ He must also ensure that inappropriate development does not occur in the preservation area through exemptions to the enhanced DEP regulations.\ Codey should also work to repeal or at least amend the fast- track permitting law, which threatens one-third of the Highlands planning area. McGreevey's recent executive order is a good start, but this poorly crafted legislation should ultimately be replaced with true smart-growth legislation to cement the environmental legacy of this administration.\ George Zilbergeld\ Chairman, Department of Political Science at Montclair State University\ Create a legacy in education:\ 1. Treat teachers like professionals. Create a statewide starting salary for K-12 teachers high enough so that parents, upon hearing that their child is planning to marry a teacher, will leap for joy.\ 2. Commission a study on the ratio of administrators to teachers in New Jersey schools and the relationship between the salaries of teachers and administrators. Check before a new contract is signed.\ 3. Guided by a professor of long experience, do an audit of any university that wants to increase tuition by more than a base percent.\ 4. Create a new college on the state-owned land of the former Marlboro State Hospital.\ Do any or all of the above and enjoy the feeling when you hear citizens say, ""Governor Codey not only talked about education - he did something about it.""\ Joseph Kyrillos Jr.\ State senator, R-District 13, GOP State Committee chairman\ While simultaneously serving as Senate president and acting governor, you will have the ability to wield immense power. With great power, however, comes great responsibility. You are assuming an executive office that has been battered by scandal and scolded for its fiscal policies.\ It is my sincere hope that you will begin a new chapter in Trenton, one marked by the implementation of serious institutional reforms that put this embarrassing era behind us.\ For some time now, Republicans have been expressing alarm regarding Trenton's declining ethical standards and reckless fiscal policies. Last spring, we proposed a 10-point reform plan - ""Building a New Foundation."" I am not suggesting that our plan is sacrosanct, but it is the only comprehensive proposal for repairing the public's fractured confidence in government.\ I am confident that by virtue of your experience and character, you will rise to the occasion and help restore the public's confidence.\ David Pringle\ Campaign director, NJ Environmental Federation, Garden State Chapter of Clean Water Action\ A tremendous responsibility is before you: to restore the public trust in government. From the dramatic, bipartisan, ethics-related convictions, resignations and defeats of several prominent state politicians to the everyday deteriorating effect of pay to play, pension boosts, insider trading, nepotism, backroom deals and other ways, too many have unfairly rewarded themselves and their allies. The public's faith has eroded steadily and dramatically over the past few years.\ And you have the means to fix it. You are independent, yet a consensus builder. You enter office at a time when the problems have a high profile, when the chances of effectively addressing them are at their highest. And you do not owe anybody anything for the position you now fill.\ Too often, elected officials reject their responsibility to govern, to do what they believe is right because they are overly concerned about the next election.\ Don't fall for it - you will be rewarded in your own heart, in the hearts of New Jerseyans and in the polls. And if you get to spend more time coaching basketball and enjoying your wife's company, is that so bad? Most would count their blessings with such.\ There is no magic bullet, but how about massive ethics and campaign finance reform and replacing the anti-democratic fast- track law with real smart-growth legislation?\ Thomas Kean Jr.\ State senator, R-District 21\ Three years ago, New Jersey elected a governor who pledged to change the way things were done in Trenton, but instead left behind a legacy of unfinished business. I am hopeful that Senate President Codey will first recognize that the need - and the state's desire - for change still exists and that he will reach across the aisle to find willing partners for reform.\ Codey can leverage his solid reputation as a consensus-builder to effectuate action rather than rhetoric. He truly has the opportunity right now to put into law in a bipartisan fashion so many of the reforms for which New Jersey voters have waited in vain to materialize, including comprehensive ethics reform that bans, once and for all, wheeling and ""pay-to-play,"" medical malpractice reform that focuses on solving the crisis - not saving special interests - and a fiscally responsible state budget that spends only what the state and its taxpayers can afford.\ David Rebovich\ Managing director, Rider University Institute for New Jersey Politics\ Good-bye, ""blarney and brimstone."" Hello, ""candor, competence, and congeniality."" By temperament and experience, Governor, you bring desirable personal characteristics and, yes, virtues that will serve you and the state well in your new post. Keep them! Tough decisions will be necessary over the next 14 months.\ Explain our challenges and our options. Tell us what can be achieved now and what will have to wait. Give us a vision and direction. And while the nation seems divided, show us that New Jerseyans - urban and suburban, well-off and struggling, white and black, from the north and the south, and Democrat and Republican - can unite to achieve common goals.\ And preserve your wry sense of humor. Consider beginning your budget address next February with the following:\ ""I have been left by my fiscally irresponsible predecessor with a multi-billion deficit, but working together we can overcome it.""\ Everyone will get the joke. And perhaps a lot of people on both sides of the aisle will realize that it really is time to get to work.\ * * *"
304,"The sign on the Trenton Bridge needs to be changed to ""Whatever a New Jersey Worker Makes, Trenton Takes."" It certainly was not the New Jersey taxpayer who created our state government's financial mess. The voter's responsibility ends with the fact that they have foolishly elected, and reelected the same group of politicians while expecting different results. Just as a point of reference, a Google search on ""New Jersey Corruption"" returns 523,000 findings.\I am disappointed that Gov. Jon Corzine hasn't publicly considered one of the major underlying causes of New Jersey's economic problems. For any local economy, be it a town, county, state, or country, money must come in from an outside source. Think about it. Isn't that true within your own household?\As for the state's economy, the source can be from taxpayers working for a company located outside of New Jersey (we have many who work in New York and Philadelphia), tourism (we have relatively little), road tolls and gas taxes (from trucks and cars passing through New Jersey -- Trenton obviously knows about this one) and most importantly, New Jersey businesses who sell goods and services to customers located outside of the state (At one time we had many of these).\During the past number of years our politicians have, either by intention or incompetence, driven much of the business base out of New Jersey. Over-regulation, exorbitant fees, burdensome high taxes, anti-business zoning laws, overly complex construction permit and inspection processes, and the good old ""not in my neighborhood"" attitude of New Jersey residents have all contributed to our downfall.\Ask any business owner about doing business in New Jersey. I'm not suggesting that businesses be given free run, nor a free ride; however, New Jersey must be competitive to keep the businesses that we still have to remain and to get others to relocate here. Protecting the environment is obviously important; however, who will be left living in New Jersey if we fail to also care for our economy? It is extremely difficult for most working people to stay in New Jersey and impossible for most retirees to stay here with their family and friends.\The real answer does not include closing down parks, raising tolls, selling our highways, raising the gas tax, increasing the sales tax percentage, expanding sales tax to everything you can think of, giving homeowner rebates, levying fees or increasing fees on everything imaginable, laying-off government workers or any of the other schemes we have heard from Trenton.\The answer is simple. Business is good for New Jersey. Businesses create jobs, pay taxes and bring money into the New Jersey economy from around the world. Our nation and this state were built by workers employed by business. We must become business-friendly!\BILL LOSEY\Somerset"
305,"VOTERS GUIDE\ECONOMY\Job creation\Corzine:\* Signed a law giving businesses $3,000 for each job created.\* Created a $50 million fund to be used by commercial banks to give loans and loan guarantees to small and midsized business, and non-profits.\* Signed a law giving tax breaks to developers who invest more than $75 million in projects that relocate or create jobs in or near a transit hub (later amended to reduce the threshold to $50 million).\Christie:\* Would ""implement aggressive economic growth strategies"" through public-private partnerships and would consolidate the state's economic development programs in a new government agency, Partnership for Action.\* Would encourage urban economic growth by consolidating all development and economic incentive programs aimed at cities under Garden State Growth Zones.\Daggett:\* Would create a more business-friendly environment by reducing taxes, including cutting the corporate business tax by 25 percent.\Business taxes\Corzine:\* Signed a law that increased the time that a net-operating loss can remain on the books and be used as a tax deduction.\* Ended the ""throw out"" rule that allowed the state to tax business income from out of state.\* Removed the alternative minimum tax, which taxed business on gross receipts instead of profits.\* Backs a law to end the state's current calculation of corporate tax on sales, payroll and property in New Jersey, which favors companies with sales but no presence here. Would calculate the tax on sales only.\Christie:\* Backs the calculation of corporate business tax on sales only.\* Wants to reduce the corporate business tax.\* Would eliminate the ""double taxation"" of S corporations.\* Would offer tax break for small businesses that file their taxes as individuals.\Daggett:\* Would cut the corporate business tax by 25 percent.\* Would raise $3.9 billion by expanding the sales tax to cover a range of personal and household services, such as lawyers, accountants, architects and hair salons, but not business-tobusiness services.\Red tape/regulatory\Corzine:\* Created a permit efficiency task force and signed a law that allows private ""licensed site professionals"" to sign off on development cleanups.\* Centralized economic decision making in the Office of Economic Growth and restructured state development efforts, putting them mainly under the Economic Development Authority.\Christie:\* Would create a ""Red Tape Review Group"" to perform a ""top-to-bottom overhaul"" of the state's administrative code. This would seek ways to alleviate the state's ""overbearing regulations.""\* Would eliminate the chief of the Office of Economic Growth position, and make the lieutenant governor the state's top economic development officer.\Daggett:\* Would make it a priority to reduce the ""crushing burden of regulation"" in the transportation, community affairs, environmental protection and other departments.\EDUCATION\Preschool\Corzine:\Says every at-risk child in New Jersey should attend preschool, which he says is helping close the achievement gap. Pushed for the new school funding law that includes preschool for every low-income child in the state. Cut funding for new classes from the current budget. Said preschool expansion would be a top priority after the recession lifts.\Christie:\Has said that New Jersey cannot afford to expand preschool. Says school districts should not be required to offer it.\Daggett:\Says publicly financed preschool for low-income students has been a success. Says he would continue preschool depending on the state's financial situation.\College funding\Corzine:\Has expanded tuition aid for low- and moderate-income students, including a $75 million increase this year. Capped tuition increases at state schools at 3 percent this year. In the past, has said that corruption at UMDNJ inspired funding cuts.\Christie:\Has criticized funding cuts. Says he would meet regularly with college presidents, reinstate some funds as a matching program for donations over $1 million and, within the first four years, provide funding for state schools to help them attract elite students.\Daggett:\Has criticized the cuts. He says that his first job is to put the state's fiscal house in order; restoring higher education funding will follow as a priority.\School choice\Corzine:\Supports charter schools but not vouchers, which he calls ""a false hope"" and divisive. Recently created a streamlined application process for new charter schools.\Christie:\Says giving poor parents educational choice is a ""civil rights issue"" and would expand publicly funded, independently run charter schools. Also would support vouchers for families to cover tuition at any private, public or parochial school.\Daggett:\Supports expanding charter schools. Has a planned voucher pilot program for 15,000 students in 10 cities.\Teachers\Corzine:\Does not support merit pay for teachers. Says tenure is not the problem, but that teachers may need more resources and training.\Christie:\Has said he may be open to tenure reform but has not provided specifics.\Daggett:\Would end tenure and replace it with five-year contracts for teachers who do not already have it.\ETHICS\Corruption\Corzine:\Would broaden legislators' financial-disclosure requirements to identify more sources of income. Wants to amend criminal statutes.\Christie:\Wants legislators to recuse themselves from activity that would benefit their private interests. Would ban dual public employment. Would reform commissions and boards to eliminate appointees with conflicts of interest. Wants an elected, not appointed, comptroller.\Daggett:\Wants to require public notice for all legal and professional contracts. Proposes that former elected officials refrain from lobbying or signing government contracts for three years. Wants to abolish pensions and lifetime health care for part-time legislators, aides and appointees.\Campaign finance\Corzine:\Wants to tighten contribution limits on employees of professional firms, ban county and municipal contractors from involvement in certain races and make pay-to-play law uniform at the local government level. Proposes donor limits to each party's county, state and legislative leadership committees.\Christie:\Wants pay-to-play laws to apply to unions. Would ban wheeling. Would require greater detail on candidates' financial disclosure statements, and would make them viewable online.\Daggett:\Would require candidates and political action committees to list contributions on the Web within 24 hours of receipt. Wants to limit contributions from party committees overseen by legislative leadership and state and county party officials. Proposes a 33 percent ""luxury tax"" on campaigns that spend above a certain level, with receipts directed to opponents -- an incentive, he says, to keep costs down and allow more equal competition.\Dual-office holding\Corzine:\Remains against the concept but says the law he signed in 2007 will resolve the issue. ""Would you like to have perfection? Sure you would like to have perfection,"" he told The Record's editorial board Oct. 12. But the action he took, he said, means New Jersey is ""moving toward zero"" legislators with another elective job.\Christie:\""I will fully eliminate dual-office holding by our state elected officials by proposing immediate changes to the law,"" his Web site says.\Daggett:\Would end dual-office holding and revoke grandfathering. Would require lawmakers with other public jobs to forfeit part of their pay for time spent at the State House. ""Corruption on the cover of law exists in the dual officeholders who shortchange both public entities that employ them,"" he said at a news conference in August.\ENVIRONMENT\Green jobs\Corzine:\Has set ambitious goals for solar and wind power that he estimates will generate 20,000 green jobs by 2020.\Christie:\Would offer generous tax credits to any wind turbine and manufacturing facility that locates in New Jersey. He wants to create a new office called ""Renew NJ,"" which would market the state and offer loans to energy companies.\Daggett:\Wants to build a green workforce by increasing training in renewable energy technology at the state's public colleges.\Clean air\Corzine:\Joined 13 other states in a battle against the Bush administration to set tailpipe emissions standards that are more stringent than the federal government's. The federal Environmental Protection Agency granted Corzine's request this year.\Christie:\His air platform includes development of renewable energy and blocking the expansion of coal plants.\Daggett:\Said he would make it a point to negotiate with other governors from Midwest states where air pollution from coal plants travels to New Jersey.\Outsourcing toxic site cleanups\Corzine, Christie and Daggett all support the recently passed Licensed Site Professional program to have private contractors sign off on most site cleanups except the largest and most complicated in New Jersey. Critics say it will be rife with bribery. Supporters say it will expedite a backlog of cleanups.\DEP staffing\No candidate believes he will be able to restore even a portion of the 1,000 Department of Environmental Protection jobs eliminated in the last 20 years, given the state's fiscal woes.\Corzine:\Believes the Licensed Site Professional program will help make up for lost staff. He also established a task force to streamline the way DEP issues permits.\Christie:\Has said the DEP is already too big and is anti-business.\Daggett:\Recommends spending $25 million over five years to upgrade technology to make the DEP more efficient.\HEALTH CARE\Insuring\the uninsured\Corzine:\Would continue efforts to enroll every New Jersey child in health insurance. By expanding the income eligibility for NJ FamilyCare, a state-sponsored, publicly subsidized program, his administration enrolled 600,000 children and 250,000 adults. He would consider increasing the income guidelines even more and hopes to add a program, using federal matching funds, to insure low-income women of childbearing age.\Christie:\Would make health insurance more affordable by allowing the sale of mandate-free policies to those who are uninsured, and permitting out-of-state companies, trade associations and membership groups to sell plans to small businesses and individuals. He would allow the sale of a variety of plans other than the standardized benefit plans currently permitted. Increased competition would lower premiums, he says, and this would attract younger, healthier people to buy insurance.\Daggett:\Says he would require those who are ""truly uninsured"" -- about 400,000 people, he estimates -- to buy health insurance, perhaps with some form of state assistance. The rest of New Jersey's uninsured either are eligible for existing programs and should be signed up, or are illegal immigrants, whose basic health care needs should be addressed without forcing them to depend on hospital emergency rooms, he said.\Mammograms and mandates\Corzine:\Says Christie's proposals would hurt women, because insurers would no longer be required to pay for mammograms. Corzine cites research to say that all of New Jersey's mandates add only 5 percent to premiums.\Christie:\Says people should be able to choose mandate-free policies. Mandates drive up premiums, he says. People could still buy policies that cover mandated services; the mandate-free policy would be one choice among many.\Daggett:\Says he generally favors mandate-free policies so people can have a variety of options, but customers will pay one way or another, in higher out-of-pocket costs.\Cutting insurance costs for public employees\Corzine:\Says he's done a lot already, with 8,400 fewer state employees since his term began and higher copayments for current employees.\Christie:\Would eliminate health benefits for all part-time state employees and political appointees and require new state employees and state retirees to contribute to their health insurance costs.\Daggett:\Says public employees must contribute more to the cost of their benefits, to be ""more in line with private industry. ... We can't afford the government we have.""\TAXES\Property taxes\Corzine:\Keep enforcing spending caps on local governments, maintain property tax relief programs and try to restore rebates for households earning as much as $150,000 annually.\Christie:\Cut state spending dramatically, restore rebates, and encourage consolidation and shared services at the local level.\Daggett:\Cut property tax bills by 25 percent up to $2,500 by generating more revenue out of the state sales tax by expanding it to items that aren't currently subject to the tax. Eliminate rebate programs altogether.\$8 billion structural budget deficit\Corzine:\Keep pushing economic policies designed to stimulate business growth and job creation and work to secure possible federal aid. May have to maintain income tax hikes and cut pension payments and some education aid.\Christie:\Cut spending in areas such as employee overtime and health benefits costs through better management. Eliminate two-thirds of all political appointees from the payroll. Seek union givebacks during collective bargaining scheduled for 2010.\Daggett:\Raise $3.9 billion by extending sales taxes on items and services not subject to the tax and save $1.6 million by eliminating the property tax rebate programs. Freeze state spending, freeze or reduce employee salaries.\Pension system's unfunded liability\Corzine:\Work with state employee unions to find ways to save money, such as the retirement-age concessions won earlier in his first term. If possible, make the hefty payments into the system his administration made before the economy soured.\Christie:\Put all new state employees in a 401(k) investment plan. Ban all politicians and part-time government workers from the system moving forward.\Daggett:\Seek a wage freeze and other givebacks from the state employee unions and use those lower salary expenses to recalculate the cost of the future obligations.\MUNICIPAL FINANCES\Binding arbitration\Corzine and Christie both say they would not eliminate or significantly alter the current binding arbitration system, which allows police and fire unions to have a state arbitrator settle their contract negotiations.\Corzine:\Says the proliferation of governments and bargaining units makes it more difficult for arbitrators to keep costs in check and that he would continue to push for regionalization.\Christie:\Says he would push unions for bigger concessions than Corzine has.\Daggett:\Calls the system ""horrible"" and says he would fix it, if not eliminate it. He says arbitrators should be required to take the economy into account when deciding on awards.\Pension and health care costs\Corzine:\Says he saved $6.5 billion over the next 15 years with revamped pension rules and concessions from unions, including contributions to health care costs. He also touts a hiring freeze that has cut state worker payrolls by more than 8,400 positions through attrition.\Christie:\Proposes a new pension system for newly hired workers -- except teachers, police and firefighters -- that operates like a 401(k)-type plan. He would also eliminate pensions for part-time employees and more than 300 members of boards and commissions.\Daggett:\Would consider a 401(k)-type plan or a hybrid to replace the current system and would apply changes to all new hires, including police, firefighters and teachers. He would also seek to eliminate tenure for teachers in favor of five-year renewable contracts and would tie pensions to average salary over 10 years or more, rather than the last three years when salaries are highest.\Shared services and consolidation\Corzine:\Says his administration has promoted the SHARE program, which offers grant money for study and implementation. He also signed a law creating the Local Unit Alignment, Reorganization and Consolidation Commission, which is reviewing issues surrounding regionalization.\Christie:\Believes the governor's approach -- which last year included threats of cutting aid to small towns that did not pursue consolidation -- is too aggressive. He says he would encourage towns to share services whenever it would save money and improve efficiency.\Daggett:\Says shared services do not provide enough savings to make a dent in the state's looming deficit. He argues that pushing through consolidation of school districts or towns costs too much in political capital to make it worth the modest reward and that the governor should focus on other methods of cutting taxes and spending.\TRANSPORTATION\Transportation Trust Fund\Corzine:\Borrowed more than $6 billion to extend the trust fund for five years in 2006; would now consider raising the gas tax or diverting money from other programs to pay for the fund.\Christie:\Opposes borrowing money to extend the fund; favors a ""pay-as-you-go"" system that would force the state to spend money it has, then ""reassess"" its funding resources later.\Daggett:\Opposes borrowing money to extend the fund.\Gas tax and tolls\Corzine:\Endorsed raising tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway in 2008; would consider raising the gas tax but is cool to the idea of raising additional tolls.\Christie:\Opposes raising the gas tax, saying New Jersey residents are already saddled with the nation's highest property taxes.\Daggett:\Would consider raising the gas tax and tolls and establishing additional toll roads so out-of-state residents share the cost of fixing the state's transportation infrastructure.\Mass transit\Corzine:\Supports $8.7 billion commuter rail tunnel, which would double mass transit capacity between New York and New Jersey.\Christie:\Supports light-rail expansion and adding lines that would serve industrial growth in northwestern New Jersey; would reevaluate projects, such as Exit 15X on the turnpike, that appear to serve very few people.\Daggett:\Supports tunnel project and reactivating commuter lines that were discontinued in the 1970s and 1980s, when suburban sprawl took hold.\MEADOWLANDS\Gambling\Corzine:\Has dismissed the idea of bringing video lottery terminals to the tracks. Would prefer a world-class casino to a ""racino"" format, if it ever came to that.\Christie:\Like Corzine, calls Atlantic City's struggles the main priority -- but won't talk about any further Meadowlands gambling at all until Atlantic City rebounds fully.\Daggett:\Does not rule out VLTs in the Meadowlands -- but has not yet backed the idea, either.\Xanadu\Corzine:\Is confident Xanadu will soon get new investment dollars needed to get the project moving again.\Christie:\Calls the entertainment and retail project's exterior design ""the darn ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life."" Has serious doubts if it will ever open.\Daggett:\Agrees with Christie's aesthetic commentary, and that the Xanadu concept was a bad one.\Arenas\Corzine:\Says Izod Center (Meadowlands) and Prudential Center (Newark) officials are getting close to a truce. Has not been talking about the idea of closing Izod Center.\Christie: Says any long-term decision on Izod Center would have to come in context of Xanadu's fate.\Daggett:\Stresses the importance of ""taking the emotion out"" of the rivalry between arena executives. Says the issue has not been sufficiently studied yet.\MAMMOGRAM ADS\Health care politics\Governor Corzine has been attacking Republican Chris Christie on health care mandates and mammograms since Labor Day. The attacks have coincided with Christie's declining appeal among women voters and an overall dip in the polls.\At issue: New Jersey mandates that 45 medical procedures or services be covered by the insurance companies it regulates. The mammogram mandate, passed in 1991, includes a baseline mammogram for women 35 to 40 years old and annual screening X-rays after that. A 2004 amendment says women under 40 at high risk for breast cancer must receive coverage for mammograms as often as their health provider recommends.\The facts:\* Christie's claim that mandate-free policies would lower premiums and attract uninsured customers is debatable. The evidence on costs is mixed, says a health care economist, and most people think cancer screenings should be covered and are willing to pay for the benefit.\* Corzine claims Christie's plan to allow out-of-state insurers to compete in New Jersey would ""lower standards"" and lead insurers to ""drop"" mammograms. But Christie is correct when he points out that nearly every other state mandates mammograms, so insurers that follow their home-state regulations would still offer the benefit -- as long as the home states don't back off their mandates.\Corzine is right when he says the specifics of the other states' mammography mandates could well be different than New Jersey's. But more than 30 states require coverage of a mammogram for women under 40.\According to the non-partisan Web site FactCheck.org, the Corzine ads are misleading because ""Christie didn't propose cutting health care or mammograms directly.""\The site, however, also notes that some experts believe that coverage of many procedures, such as mammograms for women under 40, ""would become a function of the private markets"" if mandate-free policies are allowed in New Jersey.\Ad strategy\While Corzine's references to mammograms started in June, they picked up as an attack strategy in September, when Corzine was trailing Christie by 10 points, 47 percent to 37 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.\In early September, the same poll found 41 percent of women in New Jersey had a favorable view of Christie and 30 percent had an unfavorable opinion; 34 percent viewed Corzine favorably and 57 percent had a negative opinion. By mid-October -- after the mammogram ads began airing -- Christie's standing among women dropped to 35 percent favorable and 42 unfavorable and Corzine's improved to 42 percent favorable and 51 unfavorable.\The overall poll tightened to a virtual tie of 41 percent for Christie to 40 percent for Corzine.\Deja vu: The shift in this year's gubernatorial race follows a similar change in the 2008 presidential election. Democrat Barack Obama trailed Republican John McCain going into October and started airing attack ads on health care that also featured talk of cutting mammograms. Polls at the time showed Obama with a single-digit edge on the health care issue, but by late October Obama surged to 40 percent better than McCain on health care, and he also built an overall lead of nearly 10 percentage points.\***"

When you use the Garden State Parkway you pay twice: a gas tax and a toll.\It costs lots of money to collect tolls. There are 80 different toll-collection areas. As a result, it costs 13 cents to collect each 35-cent toll. Additional costs resulting from toll collection involve wasted gas while idling, wear and tear on brakes, accidents and pollution. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that we must replace tolls with a gas tax that carries no collection expenses.\It clearly follows that without tolls, we do not need a half-billion-dollar E-ZPass system, which had no sound funding method. It is essential that work on E-ZPass be stopped immediately before any additional taxpayer funds go down the drain.\Let's quickly replace tolls with a gas tax before we have a toll-payers' rebellion. It will be as if a magic wand removed all of the traffic congestion, and the horrors and expense of toll collection.\Raymond G. Neveil\BRIELLE\HD: Saxton votes for children\Each year, Father's Day provides an opportunity to show Dad how much we appreciate him -- both for the big things and the little things he does every day.\Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., is one Dad who deserved special attention for voting to protect the health and safety of not only his own children, but all the children of New Jersey's 3rd District.\Every year, members of Congress make decisions that affect the quality of the water we drink, the air our families breathe and the safety of the neighborhoods in which we live and our children play. Their decisions in Washington have real consequences for families back home.\Fortunately, Saxton consistently votes to support health and environmental safeguards that protect our families from the ill-effects of pollution, preserve our parks and promise to leave the legacy of a clean and healthy planet to our children. For these votes, he earned a 66 percent pro-environment voting record on the League of Conservation Voters' 1998 National Environmental Scorecard.\This year, Saxton voted in favor of Rep. Henry Waxman's Defense of the Environment Act amendment, and we hope Saxton will work to advance legislation by the same name. HR-525 will protect the public from back-room political deals over ""riders"" that could compromise environmental protections. These actions demonstrated Saxton's support for environmental decisions being made in public view, not cloaked behind legislative maneuvering.\Public opinion polls consistently show that nearly 80 percent of Americans favor strong environmental and public health protections. It only makes sense. There is no better gift Saxton can give New Jersey families than a healthy environment in which to raise their children.\Deb Callahan\PRESIDENT\LEAGUE OF\CONSERVATION VOTERS\WASHINGTON\HD: Hospital hosts test of drugs\We at CentraState Healthcare System appreciate that the Press informed the public of the ""STAK"" trial in the June 8 article ""Women sought to test cancer drug.""

307," TRENTON - Everyone wants to know what the next governor will do for them, and the state's business community is no exception.\ A coalition of business leaders on Tuesday launched a grass- roots effort and Web site designed to ensure that business-related issues get their due come Election Day and beyond.\ The impetus for the new group, called Platform for Progress, are signs that New Jersey's reputation in the corporate community is slipping because of high taxes, cumbersome laws and other factors.\ One benchmark ranking, the Beacon Hill Institute's annual competitiveness index, shows the bottom dropped out of the state's ability to attract and retain business.\ ""We've managed to slip from 26th to 44th in just one year,"" said Joan Verplanck, president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, a leader in the new coalition.\ ""We're ahead of Alabama, Mississippi, what we would consider the Third World of the United States, and we're just above them. That's not where New Jersey should be in this whole thing.""\ So business leaders from more than 40 entities have come together to harness their influence. Rather than endorse candidates for governor or the Legislature, the group developed a list of issues that matter to the business community and an action plan to improve conditions in key areas statewide.\ ""The thing that's political is the timing,"" said Thomas A. Bracken, president of Sun Bancorp and chairman of the state chamber of commerce.\ ""We are soon to elect a new governor, and the Assembly is up for grabs. It's an appropriate time to weigh on these issues.""\ The group devised initiatives on issues affecting the business climate: health care, transportation, the environment, government reform, education and economic development.\ Their plan is to make their voices heard and to start devising solutions to the state's most pressing anti-business regulations.\ Verplanck said some issues will take decades to solve, but Bracken said immediate gains can be made in other areas. New Jersey can enact a comprehensive ban on pay-to-play, which would go a long way toward reforming government, he said, and it can find a long- term source of funding for the Transportation Trust Fund, such as a gasoline tax.\ Both candidates for governor - Sen. Jon Corzine and businessman Doug Forrester - have been reluctant to embrace a gas tax, though Corzine has not ruled it out.\ ""The group will go a long way toward creating a positive dialogue,"" said Jeffrey C. Scheininger, president of Flexline/U.S. Brass and Copper Corp., a Linden-based hose manufacturer.\ ""The outcome of this process will be that the candidates will at least look at these issues and address them, and have a plan.""\ Visitors to the Web site (platformfor progress.com) can compare New Jersey's business climate with that of any other state on a host of criteria, including taxes, income and education levels, earning and the cost of obtaining health care.\ Also on the site are the gubernatorial candidates' views on a range of topics, including raising taxes to balance the state budget, funding business incentive programs and consolidating some local and county operations."
308,"Former Gov. Thomas Kean says he would consider voting for a Democrat in the presidential race.\But he also likes a few things Republican front-runner Donald Trump has to say, namely his view that Planned Parenthood should stop offering abortions but continue to offer other health services.\Protecting the environment should be a Republican mission, Kean adds. Raising the gas tax and abolishing the estate tax could spark sorely needed job growth in New Jersey, he prescribes. The state could humanely scale back public workers' health care benefits, he submits. And Trump's hard-line stance on immigration is too extreme, Kean suggests.\In short, Kean, a two-term Republican governor chosen by President George W. Bush to lead an independent commission on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, does not fit in a political box -- and he says the next president should not fit in a box, either.\""Presidents can do it -- throughout history, there have been a number of presidents who have changed the whole direction of the country and in the process the direction of their party,"" Kean said in an interview Friday with ""The Backgrounder,"" a podcast hosted by Paul Brubaker, a former spokesman for Sen. Bob Menendez.\""I think we need that kind of person,"" Kean said. ""I'm old enough now that I care less whether it's a Republican or Democrat than I do that it's the best possible human being for the job.""\The man who gave Governor Christie his start in politics at age 14 said he supports the sitting governor but is not sold on his presidential candidacy. He said Christie might not be able to run for president and fix two of the biggest problems facing New Jersey, a deeply troubled pension system and a depleted Transportation Trust Fund.\""I told the governor and I told other people that I just want to take time,"" he told Brubaker. ""There's a lot of candidates out there this time. I know a number of them personally, on both sides, and I know some of them very well.""\The pension funds for public workers, which have more than 773,000 beneficiaries, are projected to run out of money within a decade or slightly longer. Christie and a series of former governors and lawmakers have cut or skipped payments required by law nearly every year since the late 1990s, what financial experts call a gimmick to balance the budget.\Court battles, downgrades of the state's credit rating and increasingly dire warnings have ensued. New Jersey labor unions are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a case over billions of dollars Christie committed in pension-reform laws in 2010 and 2011, before reneging in 2014.\The Transportation Trust Fund's ability to borrow money runs out in less than a year. Revenue from New Jersey's gas tax, the second-lowest in the country after Alaska, usually goes toward that fund but has been too low in recent years to cover the interest payments on the fund's debt.\""This is why this governor, Governor Christie, becomes so important, because I think we've got about a year and a half on both these problems, and if we don't solve them, it's hard to see how the state is going to survive in a meaningful way as a state that people want to live and work in,"" Kean said.\Raise the gas tax, Kean suggested. Nearly 600 bridges are ""structurally deficient"" and in need of repairs, according to Christie's transportation commissioner and the state Chamber of Commerce. ""I think the gasoline tax is the most logical solution, because it's one of the lowest taxes in the country,"" Kean said. ""One-third of it is paid for by people from other states who are driving across New Jersey or coming to join us for the summer.""\Republicans and Democrats have floated a plan to raise the gas tax and at the same time abolishing the estate tax, one of two inheritance taxes in New Jersey. ""That's sort of an easy solution, I think,"" Kean said. The plan has gained attention but no traction. Last month, Christie signed a pledge from the Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform, vowing never to raise any tax.\""One thing I learned: We attracted more jobs when I was governor than any other time in the history of the state,"" said Kean, who was governor from 1982 to 1990 and signed the law creating the Transportation Trust Fund. ""I'll tell you, they all wanted to know ... what I could do for them on transportation. I was able to make commitments and help.""\On the pension problem, Kean reiterated his support for a plan by a commission Christie appointed last year to study possible pension reforms. The key proposal from that group was to reduce the level of health care coverage for public workers and use the savings on the pension system. Union officials and Democratic leaders say it would be difficult to implement and unfair for workers to grant more concessions when they have already seen their retirement age rise along with their pension and health care payments under Christie, while the governor has backtracked on a pledge to shore up their pension funds with payments from the state budget.\""If it's not solved in the next two years, it's going to be insoluble except by seriously cutting people's pensions in ways that you don't want to do, that I wouldn't want to do,"" Kean said.\""I think you can do things on the medical end, treat people fairly and give them among the best health care coverage in the state,"" he said. ""You can make bargains with the new pensioners, which are going to give them some of the best pensions in the state -- maybe not quite what some of their predecessors had, which is better than anybody in business has right now -- but good pensions. You can make those agreements and hold everybody harmless.""\He added that time was running out: ""That's not going to be possible in two years because the thing will be gone too far out of control at that point. Then, I don't know how you solve it -- there's going to be a lot of blood on the floor if they try to do it.""\Brubaker mentioned that Christie in 2013 tried to oust Kean's son, Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., R-Union, from his leadership post.\""He's always had my support,"" Kean said. ""I continue to support him. I told him a long time ago that I was going to make up my own mind very slowly in this presidential race.""\Credit: Email: rizzo@northjersey.com"
309," SOMEHOW, someday, we're going to have to find a leader with the guts and the credibility to tell Americans the truth about energy: that our national dedication to cheap gasoline is leading us into a dead end.\ Economists are rightly calling this the silly season. And, indeed, both parties' panicked reactions to the temporary rise in gas prices are non-solutions to a non-problem. Clinton opted to sell a tiny amount of oil from the strategic reserve at a nearly $90 million loss (administration slogan: Buy high, sell low). The Republicans leaped at the opportunity to raise both the budget and trade deficits by lowering the gas tax and thereby, with prices already up, to raise demand.\ The truth is, it is always the silly season in this country when it comes to the price of oil and gasoline. Think about the past 15 years. The Reagan administration, following budget director David Stockman's dictum that an energy policy only requires ""strategic reserves and strategic forces,"" relied on a free market that did not exist. The second term produced a spectacular 65 percent rise in oil imports.\ The Bush administration labored for two years to produce an energy policy. Before sending it to Congress, the White House disemboweled it, removing all offending taxes and regulations, leaving a policy based on the fancy that we could drastically increase domestic production with low prices by showering tax breaks on the oil industry. One had to delve deep into the fine print to discover that by ""low"" the administration meant $30 per barrel. It wouldn't have worked anyway because White House ideologues ignored the geological fact that domestic oil was largely used up.\ Congress spent another 20 months debating this mass of internal contradictions, eventually producing an 800-page bill. It, too, ignored the central issue of the relationship of price to demand and to energy productivity (another name for efficiency) in favor of dozens of peripheral issues. Unable to reach agreement on updating the single most important energy measure the country had taken - namely the auto mileage standard known as CAFE, which was by then saving 2 million barrels per day - Congress dropped it so it could pass the rest of the bill.\ Neither the 1990 budget crisis nor the run up in price triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait could break the deadlock. For a while it seemed as though the country would swallow a significant tax in the name of deficit reduction, but no. All that the Persian Gulf crisis did was to reveal the depth of the president's antipathy to energy efficiency, the legacy of his years as an independent oil producer. After racing around in a gas-guzzling speedboat, Bush sneered at a suggestion that energy use should be addressed. With that leadership, progress was impossible.\ Enter the Clinton administration, which needed revenues and ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A significant gas tax was ruled out because of a campaign commitment, and a lower BTU tax was proposed instead. Environmentalists gave it only lukewarm support, and after furious lobbying, with every fossil fuel for itself, the Senate defeated what was left. Finally, to make up the remaining budget shortfall, an environmentally meaningless 4.3 cents-a-gallon gas tax was adopted, which is now on the chopping block.\ On the path to a more sensible response, the first step is to remember that commodity prices naturally fluctuate. Six months ago, gasoline costs were at a nearly 50-year low. The reasons for this spike include the long, cold winter and low inventories caused by buyers waiting for Iraq to re-enter the market. No collusion or price-gouging will be found. Crude prices are already on their way down. The lesson is to ignore short-term fluctuations, and let the market work.\ Beyond that, our country has only two options. We can continue to have cheap gasoline - in which case we must accept high levels of use; rising oil imports and a persistent trade deficit; and growing difficulty in achieving cleaner air, a workable transportation system, and greenhouse gas limits. The other option is to use price - that is, energy taxes - to induce technological advances and reduce demand.\ We can attempt to avoid the ills of the low-price choice through strict fuel efficiency standards, but when the price and regulatory signals clash (cheap gasoline says mileage doesn't matter, CAFE says it does), the standards will be economically inefficient, hence unpopular and progressively weakened.\ That's just what's happened. Automakers used a CAFE loophole to push growing numbers of light trucks - minivans, pickups, and so-called sport utility vehicles - on which they make a larger profit. Marketed as the perfect solution for heading vertically up muddy mountainsides or outrunning rhinoceroses, sports utility vans now account for 40 percent of new vehicle sales for a nation of commuters, delivering Seventies-era fuel mileage.\ Don't be falsely comforted by the length of time since the last energy crisis. We can't have everything - cheap energy, ample supply, a safe environment and no intrusive regulation. With 3 percent of world oil reserves, our underlying vulnerabilities have not changed. Nor, through more than 20 years, has our ability to think clearly about the price of gas. Cutting the gas tax would be just plain dumb.\ Jessica Mathews is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations."
310,"THE RECORD: The state's bond rating has been lowered by Standard & Poor's. The governor is saying this is a call for Democrats to act on his tool kit. Democrats are saying the governor needs to be making payments into the underfunded pension system. What's happening?\FOX: The rating houses are looking more closely at the debt states are carrying and have been carrying for a number of years. New Jersey and other states have been carrying a lot of pension debt and other debt for decades. Since the recession and the downturn of the economy, they are taking a much more conservative approach.\DuHAIME: As Governor Christie has said, the day of reckoning is arriving for state governments and the days of unfunded obligations, or underfunded obligations, have to end and that's why there need to be changes. It is a call to action for the Legislature to act on the pension benefit reforms that have been proposed. The actions that we've taken over the last 20 years have consequences. The public just can't afford to fund it anymore.\FOX: Let's be honest. There have to be contributions to the pension system in the upcoming budget and it wasn't done last year. It needs to be done this year. As Mike said, for 20 years we've been putting off making these contributions. Both parties have done it. It's time people stop blaming each other -- let's solve the problem.\DuHAIME: But it's also systemic. Even if governors of both parties had made all the maximum contributions over the years the pension fund would still be underfunded by tens of billions of dollars. This is a systemic problem where it's less about the pension payments that elected officials have made or haven't made over the years and more about the promises that have just been too large that are unsustainable.\Some real changes have to be made. It is more than just the funding side.\FOX: Whether it's transportation debt, pension debt, general carrying of debt by the state for any category, which has been going on for too long, both parties should take some responsibility here. It's more important to figure out how we're going to resolve it, rather than point fingers at each other.\DuHAIME: One thing that we have to look at here is this is not just a kind of numerical game. There are real people who are counting on their pensions. And those pensions will not be there unless we fix this problem.\FOX: I also think elected officials need to be honest because we cannot just cut our way to solve this problem. That is certainly part of what we need to do. We need to control spending. We all agree on that. But we also have to find a way to get some additional revenue because we cannot cut our way out of this debt.\The governor has indicated that we may see a return of some property tax rebates. Is that a responsible thing to do?\DuHAIME: I think property tax rebates are something that a lot of middle-class families count on and if there's any way to restore any portion of them, I think it would be a good thing to do in this type of environment, where people are making every dollar count. With unemployment as high as it is, underemployment as high as it is, if that's possible in this budget I think it would be a laudable thing.\FOX: I'm all for making sure that people, particularly at the lower end of the income scale and senior citizens, receive some type of government assistance, whether it's in rebates or in some other form. But we need to find additional revenue in order to do that.\The governor has been adamant about no new taxes. Where is that money going to come from?\FOX: It is not a politically popular thing to say that we need to raise a gas tax to fund our transportation. It is not politically popular to say that we need to raise the millionaire's tax because we need to get additional revenue to pay off some of our debt and to fund senior citizen rebates or other rebates that we may have in mind. Let's have an honest discussion. We do need to have cuts in government, but we also need to raise additional revenue if we're going to invest and pay off some debt that we've had.\DuHAIME: There's a reason those things are unpopular. It's because we're overtaxed. We've hemorrhaged jobs for the last decade because we have continued to say we need more revenue. At some point people stand up and say enough is enough, you're taking enough of our money. We have to cut and we have to cut as much as we can before we start taxing anybody anymore."
311,"TRAFFIC WOULD MOVE BETTER WITHOUT TOLLS\To the Editor:\It was a coincidence that one day after riding on the Garden State Parkway with my family, you ran an article about the expenses of toll roads. I was saying to my wife while sitting in a traffic jam, waiting to pay a toll, that if the state eliminated tolls and raised the gas tax by 5 cents per gallon, (I use about 20 gallons per week) I would pay about $1 a week. A short trip on the parkway, from Route 80 to Park Ridge costs me $1.40 round trip. I would have saved 40 cents.\Without toll plazas, I would have saved at least 20 minutes and the wear on my brakes, from the stop-and-go traffic.

312," Blood and gore, and plenty more\ I'm 18 years old and I'm going to college in the fall. I volunteer twice a week and I play a lot of computer games.\ I hold in my hands a copy of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which I received as a present before the pornographic content debacle. As one who plays a lot of computer games, I'd like to share my thoughts on the matter of content and the rating system.\ A woman is suing Rockstar Games (the publisher of San Andreas) for misleading her into thinking that the game was an appropriate present for her 14-year-old grandson.\ I have the game right here; let's see how she was deceived. On the front there is a big black ""M"" and it says ""Mature 17+."" On the back, next to another big black ""M"" there is a more detailed explanation which reads, ""Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Use of Drugs."" That seems pretty unambiguous to me.\ According to an article in Computer Gaming World, the Entertainment Software Review Board (ESRB) does not actually play the games it rates. ESRB is given videos of a game's most extreme content and bases its rating on that.\ ESRB needs to start playing games. Until it does, things will slip through. It needs to release detailed reports on the content of every game it rates.\ I think rating games is a good idea, even if the current system is flawed. If you think your child is too young to handle a game's content, don't let him play it. Get involved, teach your kids what's right and what's wrong, what's educational and what's just entertainment. That's what my parents did, and while I play games that turn the stomachs of Joe Lieberman, Jack Thompson and Hillary Clinton, I've never gotten so much as a parking ticket.\ People are outraged, absolutely. But we don't need congressional hearings over whether games are corrupting our youth. We need parents to teach their kids values and the difference between reality and entertainment.\ Even without following instructions posted on the Internet to access the pornographic content, San Andreas still has graphic violence, gangs, drug use, corrupt cops and crime galore. We knew about that, it's right there on the box.

I would support the fiscal responsibility that raising the gas tax by at least 5 cents a gallon would achieve.\ Republicans used to pride themselves on fiscal responsibility, and when the state's Transportation Trust Fund is $6.1 billion in debt, then it is time for politicians to own up to that.\ I would like to know how Russo proposes paying off this debt.\ Josh Saladino\ Ridgewood, Aug. 1\ * * *\ Ramsey parking decision blasted\ The decision by the Ramsey Borough Council to prohibit non- Ramsey residents from using the commuter lot on Central Avenue (""Ramsey tells out-of-town commuters to keep away,"" Page L-3, July 31) is unfair and may result in a backlash as non-residents decide not to patronize Ramsey merchants.\ For the past five years, I have been a resident of Mahwah and have taken NJ Transit into Manhattan to work. I have taken the train from the Ramsey Main Street Station, parking in a lot off Central Avenue. I was told that since the land in question was originally owned by the federal government but was developed through state funds, it has always been available for parking to everyone, at no charge.\ About a week ago, Ramsey announced that the parking lot would only be open to Ramsey residents. The real but unannounced reason for this is the fact that the new train station has proven to be a major disappointment in terms of how many people have chosen to park their vehicles there.\ The decision expelling me and other non-Ramsey residents from the parking lot on Central Avenue was made to force us to park at the new Ramsey station on Route 17 at a substantial cost per month.\ I urge the council to revisit this issue and reverse its decision.\ Laurence T.

I would like to know what happened to ""innocent until proven guilty."" I guess it suddenly changed to ""innocent until beaten into submission and false confession.""\ I think the Italian goverment did a smart thing ordering the arrest of the six CIA agents.

I don't understand why molestation seems to be increasing, and so little is being done.\ It isn't fair that a little girl's innocence was taken, especially by a principal.\ There are many sick individuals in this world. If we don't take control of our society, many innocent children will continue to be on the line.\ Shate' Jones\ Teaneck, July 27\ * * *\ Children need to feel secure\ Regarding ""Man charged with sex assault of girl, 12"" (Page L-3, July 27):\ Today, sexual assault on minors is one of the United States' biggest problems. Sexual abuse harms a child physically and emotionally.\ We can stop this problem.\ First, the government should increase jail sentences for offenders.\ Second, parents should be aware of where their kids are and what they are doing. They also have to inform their children about what is sexual abuse. Many American parents don't talk about sex with their children.\ The more information we give to our children, the safer they will be.\ Gabriela Mendez\ West New York, Aug. 2\ * * *\ Lawbreaker as lawmaker\ Two members of the Prospect Park Municipal Council were removed from their seats while they are overseas fighting for our freedom (""Guardsmen replaced on council,"" Page L-6, Aug. 2). Paterson Councilman Jerry Rosado keeps his seat while fighting for his own freedom (""Councilman to work off jail sentence,"" Page L-1, Aug. 4).\ Why is it that the Prospect Park councilmen, Herb Perez and Thomas Jefferson, get punished for serving our country while Jerry Rosado gets away free when he should be serving time?\ How can a lawbreaker be a lawmaker? Only in Paterson can this happen.\ I am not sure when Rosado's term expires (his license already did about 20 years ago), but he should save face and step down. He is setting a disgraceful example for the people he supposedly serves.\ I understand he has been assigned to a program known as S.L.A.P. For him it's a slap on the wrist. For us it's a slap in the face.\ Matthew Rivers\ Prospect Park, Aug. 3\ * * *\ Lawbreaker as lawmaker\ Imagine if the average citizen were to have his driver's license suspended 37 times, get involved in a hit-and-run and have illegal sirens and lights? That individual would be sitting in jail, not on the Paterson City Council.\ Jerry Luis Rosado should do the right thing: Resign.\ Santino Certo\ Watchung, Aug. 3\ * * *\ Beaches should be accessible to all\ Regarding ""N.J. eases access to private beaches"" (Page A-1, July 27):\ Last week I went to Seaside Park with my son to visit residents of that town. When we went to the beach to buy a beach tag, we were told we had to go to the police station to buy the tag.\ We then took our gear and walked to the police station. I approached the beach-badge seller and asked, ""Why don't you sell badges on the beach like all the other towns we have gone to?""\ She then told me, ""Why don't you go to the other towns, because we really don't want you day-trippers down at our beach.""\ I was a guest of a resident of Seaside Park. It is really a sad day when you are told this. I hope all private beach owners lose this battle, because the beaches should be accessible to everyone.\ Gigi Burns\ New Milford, July 29\ * * *\ A bad legislative smoking ban\ A well-deserved round of applause for your editorial ""Next up, DWS?"" (July 26). The fact that Assemblyman John McKeon can espouse this with anything approaching a straight face is worthy of a Marx Brothers script.\ This is sadly nothing more than a memorial to his late father that he intends to force upon the rest of us. It is interesting to note that he failed to respond to your recent poll of the state Legislature when you asked them how they would pay for the replenishment of the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund.\ It would seem that we have a legislator who has the political gall to tell you what you can or can't do in your own automobile, but who lacks the political guts to tell us how he intends to pay for building and maintaining the roads to get you to your destination.\ Gerard F. Keogh Jr.\ West Milford, July 27\ * * *\ A bad legislative smoking ban\ If there is so much concern about traffic safety, perhaps the laws on the books should be more strictly enforced, particularly those for speeding, tailgating and careless, reckless and aggressive driving.\ Deborah Greene\ Fort Lee, July 25\ * * *\ Nuclear anniversary\ This month some of us will commemorate the 60th anniversaries of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in which an estimated 210,000 (mostly civilians) were killed. Long-term effects of radiation are to this day still claiming the lives of surviving victims and their offspring.\ I find it ironic that, in this anniversary year, the Bush administration has not only sought funding for development of a new nuclear weapon - the nuclear earth penetrator - but also has provided little support for the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review.\ Have we become numb to the very real possibility that current nuclear stockpiles have the capacity for global annihilation? The Cold War ended many years ago, yet little progress has been made toward genuine disarmament in either the United States or Russia.\ Let's make this anniversary a turning point, and urge all countries - especially our own - to disarm and abolish nuclear weapons globally. May we soon celebrate a world free of nuclear weapons!\ Jo Sippie-Gora\ Kinnelon, Aug. 2\ * * *\ Stop glorifying a murderer\ Why does Thomas Trantino continue to be glorified by the New Jersey press (""Trantino's public profile irks victims' kin,"" Page A- 1, July 12)? In 1963, Trantino killed two police officers, Gary Tedesco and Peter Voto, in a Lodi bar while celebrating an armed robbery.\ Trantino was sentenced to death, but New Jersey abolished the death penalty and commuted his sentence to life in prison. Ironically, the law that would have prevented his parole, currently known as the ""Trantino Law,"" was not yet in effect.\ I was Gary Tedesco's long-term girlfriend at the time of the murders. I have maintained a close relationship with the Tedesco family through the years. I watched the Tedescos suffer through the trial and Trantino's appeals.\ After a number of years, he was front-page news again as he fought to be released from prison. The Tedescos continued to suffer the pain of having the worst episode of their lives spread across the headlines.\ When Trantino was released, I thought the families would be free of having to see his face plastered across pages of newspapers and magazines. The latest articles published by The Record and New Jersey Monthly serve no purpose other than to publicize the opinions and so-called ""art"" and ""writings"" of a cold-blooded murderer.\ What news value do such pieces have? It's painful enough to know that this murderer walks the streets; why give him a forum for his ideas?\ Adrienne Carchia\ Whitehouse Station, Aug. 1\ * * *\ Quit bashing the NYS&W\ As an employee of the New York Susquehanna and Western Railway and a taxpaying resident of New Jersey, I am sick and tired of hearing local and state officials harass my employer's efforts to assist the safe transportation of construction debris out of state.\ To counter the biased hype contained in previous articles about the trash transfer facilities located along the NYS&W, I offer the following facts:\ * The articles have confused the storage of pentasulfide with the storage and transfer of construction debris from licensed recycling facilities from trucks to railcars. These are entirely separate operations and issues.\ * This trash used to go directly into the Meadowlands. Now the debris gets shipped out of state. Is this not a good thing for New Jersey? Would we rather go back to the ""bad old days""?\ * Each railcar carries the equivalent of 2.5 truckloads of debris. Each day, these sites, combined, originate about 50 carloads. These carloads are the equivalent of 125 truckloads of debris per day which do not grind down our highways, imperil the driving public or waste increasingly precious fuel.\ * The construction debris is already in our state, and it originates in recycling facilities that are already regulated. All the NYS&W does is provide the space needed to transfer the debris from trucks to railcars. This is done in an already industrial area located next to warehouses, sewage treatment facilities and other industrial sites. The average dwell time for a given load of debris is one day.\ I suggest that these officials stop grandstanding by harassing the NYS&W and its partners and instead offer more constructive solutions to assist them in making these transfer facilities more efficient than they already are.\ As a New Jersey resident who grew up watching and smelling the ""mountains in the Meadowlands"" grow each year, I applaud this effort, as it offers the safest, most energy-efficient way of getting rid of these debris. I think our press and elected officials should do the same.\ Stephen Weiss\ Paramus, Aug. 2\ * * *\ Oradell's unfair railroad position\ Rail advocates respectfully ask Oradell Mayor Frederick LaMonica, ""Where's the freight?"" (""Mayor defends railroad stance,"" Your Views, Aug. 3).\ Oradell's anti-rail posturing is crimping plans for better rail passenger service throughout the Pascack Valley and in Rockland County. The Pascack Valley Line is not a through route, handles minimal freight, and is unlikely to see freight traffic - hazardous or otherwise - increase in the foreseeable future.\ LaMonica suggests ""rail fans"" target railroads that are nowhere near the Pascack Valley Line over environmental and legal infractions.\ We rail advocates will ponder his advice, but in return, we wonder when LaMonica will apply the same lofty standards to the roads and automobiles that assault Oradell's environment each day.\ Douglas John Bowen\ Chatham, Aug. 3\ The writer is president of the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers."
313,"REPUBLICAN and Democratic candidates for the 30th District Assembly seats agree that intense land development pressure, with its consequences for the environment, traffic and property taxes, is the biggest threat facing central New Jersey communities.\They differ sharply on how to bring commuter rail service to the region, something they all agree should be done, but is being stymied by the objections of Middlesex County political leaders.\""The obstructionism of a couple of towns in Middlesex County is causing a deterioration of the quality of life in this area,"" said state Assemblyman Joseph R. Malone III, who with fellow Republican Assemblyman Melvin Cottrell, is seeking election to another two-year term.\Malone said he does not see that dispute being resolved until Gov. Whitman and the state Department of Transportation make an executive decision to go forward with a light-rail route through the Jamesburg area.\But in a meeting yesterday with the Asbury Park Press editorial board, Democratic Assembly candidate Edward G. Werner said local legislators must mobilize residents in favor of rail service.\""Let's make it so politically sensitive for people in Jackson and Lakewood that the governor feels something has to be done,"" said Werner, who is running with fellow Democrat Edward J. Choquette.\Also in the running are Fred Rasiewicz and Kalman F. Madgyesy, both of Jackson, running under the Independent Conservative banner. They did not attend the editorial board meeting.\In a nearly two-hour discussion, the Democratic and Republican candidates covered many of the same positions that leaders of their parties have staked out, vying for voters' feelings on development and open space, property taxes, gun control and health care.\On gun control, Cottrell and Malone said they support the position of other GOP legislators that it will take time and research grants to get commercially feasible technology to build so-called ""smart guns"" that can only be used by their owners.\Werner called that ""a ruse"" to delay future legislative action on handguns. Although even Assembly Democrat Neil Cohen has questioned the constitutionality of states unilaterally demanding firearms technology, Werner noted other consumer products are individually regulated by states.\Whatever route the Legislature goes, Malone predicted gun control will remain a top priority into the next legislative session. ""When the hysteria of the election dies down . . . I don't know anyone who doesn't want to keep guns out of kids' hands,"" Malone said. ""It has enough momentum to stay one of the cornerstone issues.""\Both Democrats and Republicans agreed that stricter state oversight of health maintenance organizations is needed. Choquette and Werner said they will support Democratic proposals for a statewide fund to back up HMO claims. There should be state-appointed ombudsmen to hear appeals of HMO decisions and guarantees that ""doctors make medical decisions, not clerks and administrators,"" Choquette said.\""We've seen an almost cataclysmic decline in the HMO system,"" said Malone, who foresees renewed legislative efforts to crack down on HMO rulings. ""I don't have a day go by without a (constituent) complaint about an HMO problem.""\Cottrell said he'll keep pushing to mandate insurance coverage for hearing assistance ""because it's not just for the elderly, but for young people too.""\Werner said that if elected, he will sponsor a ""family bill of rights,"" an outgrowth of his earlier discussions with state lawmakers following the murder of his 11-year-old son, Eddie, by 15-year-old neighbor Sam Manzie.\Manzie himself had been sexually assaulted, authorities said, and Werner said he would propose a mandatory life sentence for anyone who commits aggravated sexual assault against a child. ""They have the highest recidivism rate of any criminals,"" he added.\Werner said he also would call for increasing the degrees of severity for robberies and assaults committed against children, the elderly and disabled, thus raising potential penalties for such crimes. And Werner is a staunch proponent of smart-gun legislation, which he refers to as ""child-proof guns.""\All the candidates agreed that development and open-space issues, and their resulting property tax and environmental problems, have the greatest impact on 30th District communities.\""We have a problem: 18,000 approved (home building) permits in Jackson Township alone,"" Cottrell said.\""We've had four-lane highways backed up six miles going into two-lane roads, and it's been like that for 10 years,"" Choquette said.\The candidates all say the district needs rail and more transportation funding from the state. But they will not support a gas tax increase for the state Transportation Trust Fund, saying it would hit harder in the 30th District with its longer commuting distances.\?ce?

314,"Qualified people ready to serve\William G. Dressel, Jr., executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, recently suggested that the proposed bills prohibiting dual officeholding in the state are a great disservice to its citizens and an infringement on their rights. The citizens would be arbitrarily denied the right to have the best officials representing them.\I was involved in local politics for about 28 years and was able to observe a thing or two about how the political selection process works. As a result of my involvement, I got to know many fine people who were elected or appointed to office and performed ably and honorably.\What disturbs me greatly about Dressel's claim is the implication that there is a great shortage of qualified and capable citizens willing to serve in New Jersey. Let me assure everyone that many qualified citizens who toil quietly in the political parties never come under consideration for any position. In a state with more than 8.5 million citizens, it seems reasonable that it should be easy to locate the 200 or so additional officials statewide to eliminate dual officeholding positions.\Dressel's claims are blatant and lame. Give the citizens a break and have the League of Municipalities work for good government and not the perpetuation of privilege for the currently elected and appointed officials.\Herbert L. Kukasch\HOLMDEL\Rein developers, not bears\The McGreevey administration recommended a hunt to reduce the alleged overpopulation of New Jersey's black bears, so that the developers can then come in and replace the alleged overpopulation of a few hundred or, as the case may be, a few thousand bears over an expansive home range with wall-to-wall people everywhere.\Apparently the New Jersey black bears need freedom, and people don't. The bears would be happy to be left alone - by us. I say, ""Laissez-faire."" Now, the developers are another story. They need to be reined in, in the public interest.\Louis A. Novellino\MIDDLETOWN\Animal shelters not the same\I read with interest a recent letter that praised Associated Humane Societies' efforts in animal rescue. It is apparent that the author is basing her opinion on one favorable incident and possesses little knowledge of the rest of their operation.\Associated Humane Societies performs a needed service for the community. Unfortunately, they do not perform it well. The Monmouth County SPCA, a no-kill shelter in close proximity to Associated Humane Societies, was not cited for any violations in the State Commission of Investigation's report on county SPCAs in 2001. Associated Humane Societies was the subject of a scathing report by the SCI earlier this year.\The Monmouth County SPCA maintains a spay/neuter clinic, holds off-site adoption events and has dedicated volunteers. On the contrary, Associated Humane Societies does not hold outreach events and prohibits volunteers.\One might wonder why Associated Humane Societies has failed to accomplish what the Monmouth County SPCA has. Could it be because the Monmouth County SPCA has more money? Absolutely not. Neither shelter receives any funding from the government other than town contracts and both rely on public donations.\As a former volunteer at Associated Humane Societies, I am saddened that animals are being killed at the shelter. No volunteers are allowed in to promote the animals for adoption or to make their last days happy ones.\Tell public officials and legislators that you demand positive change at Associated Humane Societies. Spay and neuter your pets and do not allow them to roam free. If you are looking to add a pet to your family, adopt from a shelter and save a life.\Shari Wexler\FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP\Amendment would pass\Next year, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether or not words such as ""one nation under God"" or ""in God we trust"" violate the anti-establishment clause of the Constitution, which prohibits the establishment of religion.\We already have the concept of keeping church and state separate, with which I am in agreement, but is it necessary to prohibit the public acknowledgment of God? The Supreme Court will probably rule against this belief and current practice to allow the continuation of these statements to be said publicly.\It appears that the only solution to this church-state dilemma is to pass a constitutional amendment that will resolve this issue. According to a recent poll, 85 percent of all Americans believe in God or a supreme being. If this is correct, there should not be any problem in having this amendment passed.\Bernard P. Lauber\WALL\Job market encouraging\Everyone's saying the economy is bad and graduates are going to have to settle for jobs and not expect too much. I'm 16 years into this school thing now, soon to graduate with a bachelor of science degree and supposedly I'm out of luck.\I find this untrue. Although I've yet to graduate college and am not at the top of my class, I've already been offered three well-paying jobs, along with the possibility of being part of management in retail sales. I could be the exception to the norm. However, co-workers and friends have also affirmed that there wasn't a problem in finding a career.\So there's a bad job market? I beg to differ. No longer can graduating Americans look for careers in the common sense of the word. We are now left with finding the micro-career, a new type of employment in America's new service economy.\The lifelong employment days are over. The economy has responded to the younger generation's desire of a career that will provide certain benefits for a shorter period of time and allow the new work force to use these jobs as stepping stones to higher paying positions.\Sure, the job market is not the best. However, the obsolete skills of the unemployed partially account for this. But that really isn't that bad when you look at whose assuming these jobs. It's their children in restructured environments and re-engineered positions and roles.\Perhaps we're not starting off making as much pay for your jobs, but it's not too bad for a generation of underachieving slackers who watch too much TV.\Matt Hlavacek\MIDDLETOWN\RICHARD STOCKTON COLLEGE\GALLOWAY\No raiding of gas tax\The original gas tax imposed 14 years ago, on top of original state gas tax, was to be used for that very reason: repair bridges and roads.

315,"EChristie should visit Paterson\Regarding ""Christie in Bergen"" (Editorials, July 8):\Governor Christie's fairness funding formula for public schools and his executive order to freeze transitional aid would adversely affect Paterson. However, he is hosting town hall meetings almost everywhere else but there. He needs to come to Paterson.\To his credit, Christie included our city on his town hall tour in 2013. The state of our public schools was the dominant topic. In fact, one member of the audience repeated the refrain ""fix the public schools.""\Three years later, our schools are not fixed, nor are they fully funded. Further-more, our district stands to lose aid from the state under his new proposal. Christie must put Paterson on his schedule so we can have a constructive conversation about ensuring student success in New Jersey's third-largest city.\Although our city and other urban centers eventually will have to reduce our reliance on transitional aid and move toward more self-sufficiency, Paterson cannot afford to lose any aid at this juncture. Our taxpayers are tapped out, and there are very few new revenue streams to appropriately address any budgetary shortfall.\With the alarmingly high loss of ratables in the city and very little relief in sight, we must double down on our efforts to ignite our city's economic engine. Therefore, we need to hear from our state's chief executive about how he can help.\His next town hall meeting is set for Fair Lawn.

That's common sense enough for everyone to agree to.\David Judovin\Ringwood, July 8\State raids funds for clean energy\Governor Christie has continued to raid the Clean Energy Fund.\The Democrats in the Legislature have raised concerns but have gone along with it. Out of the $145 million diverted from the fund, the Democrats took $20 million to pay for salaries in the Department of Environmental Protection.\Land trusts and environmental groups went along with the deal even though it cuts programs that improve the environment and help combat climate change. This money is now being used to pay for state utility bills and energy programs in public buildings as well as subsidizing NJ Transit.\The Clean Energy Fund is funded by a surcharge on customers' gas and electric bills to help purchase energy efficient appliances and weatherize people's homes. It also supports about 2,000 jobs per year.\Taking this money amounts to a hidden tax on businesses and energy consumers. Now we likely will see higher energy bills and more pollution.\All together our governor has actually taken $1.4 billion out of the Clean Energy Fund while he has been in office. This is unconscionable, because the money is supposed to help reduce greenhouse gases. This money must be put in the right place, or we should just get rid of it\Maybe we should raise the tax on the Clean Energy Fund instead of the gas tax.\Jeff Tittel\Trenton, July 7\The writer is director of the New Jersey Sierra Club."
316,"ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER\With a foggy ocean view as a backdrop, politicians and others on Monday condemned proposals to lift a 26-year moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling.\Drilling off the Jersey Shore or even off Virginia could jeopardize the tourism economy and the environment here if a spill happens, elected officials and environmental activists said at a news conference outside the Taylor Pavilion on Ocean Avenue.\Drilling also would yield little oil, take at least a decade to bear fruit and do nothing to bring down gasoline prices, said U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.\""It makes little or no sense to most of us to be drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf anywhere, but particularly in the Atlantic and the mid-Atlantic . . . in specific,"" Gov. Corzine said.\""I think it's a nonstarter strategy,"" he said.\""What we need to do is be moving to alternative energies and most importantly conservation,"" he said.\Corzine, a Democrat, was joined by U.S. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., Menendez, Rep. Frank J. Pallone Jr., D-N.J., and others at the news conference.\The federal officials want Congress to pass their legislation to make the moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Jersey Shore and other states from Maine to North Carolina permanent, according to a statement.\While the New Jersey officials and activists criticized the prospect of offshore drilling, numerous other proposals for energy projects off the Jersey Shore could pose risks to the environment and economy, critics have said.\And these liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects and offshore wind turbine projects could be up and running long before any drilling for oil occurs.\Both President Bush, a Republican, and GOP Sen. John McCain, who is seeking to succeed him, have proposed lifting the drilling ban to provide more domestic oil.\Bush wants legislation that would give states the option of opening up resources off their shores and ensure environmental protection, according to a June fact sheet on the White House's Web site.\Bush will lift an executive order banning drilling after Congress lifts the legislative moratorium, the fact sheet says.\McCain, R-Ariz., wants the moratorium lifted and ""proposes to cooperate with the states and the Department of Defense in the decisions to develop these resources,"" according to his Web site.\McCain spokesman Peter Feldman emphasized that McCain's plan doesn't mandate drilling, but would allow states to decide whether to allow it off their shores.\""New Jersey Democrats continue to distort Sen. McCain's plan for cheap, clean and secure energy for America,"" Feldman said.\Assembly Minority Leader Alex DeCroce, R-Morris, said Corzine should spend less energy on presidential politics and more resolving the state's own problems.\He noted Corzine has refused to rule out a gas tax increase to pay for transportation projects and just signed a budget that extended a public utility tax that was supposed to be phased out.\""Instead of criticizing candidates for federal office who are at least offering plausible, scientifically sound solutions to satisfy America's energy needs, Corzine should start leveling with the people of New Jersey about what he intends to do - or not do - about rising fuel costs,"" DeCroce said.\Meanwhile, three companies have proposed building liquefied natural gas facilities miles off the Jersey Shore.\Excalibur Energy (USA) Inc. wants to construct a deep-water pipeline system for natural gas about 15 miles off Asbury Park.\Atlantic Sea Island Group wants to build an island for an LNG facility 19 miles from Sea Bright, while ExxonMobil has plans for a floating LNG terminal about 20 miles from Manasquan.\In addition, five companies are competing for up to $19 million in state funding to build a potential wind turbine project in an area from Seaside Park to Stone Harbor that is up to 23 miles offshore.\State officials are evaluating whether offshore LNG facilities and wind turbines will be part of New Jersey's overall energy plan, Corzine said.\""We are more aggressive on the offshore . . . wind farms, which we are . . . trying to get the environmental permiting . . . to move on off Atlantic City,"" he said.\""LNG, we are looking at both land . . . and other options and we haven't come to a conclusion on that . . .,"" he said.\This fall, the federal government could award leases to several companies that want to put meteorological towers off the Jersey Shore to collect information before possibly building offshore wind projects, federal officials said in April.\Lautenberg said he doesn't consider wind ""an industrialization problem because it takes a force of nature . . . that is unused and doesn't diminish anything"" and has great potential like solar panels.\Regarding LNG, ""I think . . . the governor said it correctly,"" he said. ""He's looking at it and that's what they've got to do . . . and see what the risks are and see what the benefits are and I don't think that's appropriately been done,"" Lautenberg said.\Pallone said he opposes LNG facilities off the Jersey Shore, as well as current proposals for an offshore wind farm. But he would not rule out supporting an offshore wind project in the future.\Jeff Tittel, who directs the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter, said ""I think oil drilling is the big threat to the coast right now.""\If bottom leases for drilling are handed out, ""that's it,"" Tittel said.\""I really think that wind . . . has the best potential for renewable energy,"" he said.\""We'd rather see windmills than oil derricks,"" he said.\LNG, which has some positives, is ""something we need to study,"" he said.\""Unless we're willing to look at some alternatives, we're going to perpetuate what's causing the problems now,"" he said.\But when it comes to offshore wind, ""the cart is put well before the horse"" because environmental studies have not been done and federal rules have yet to be approved, said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action.\Shaun McGrath, 25, of Wall, said people need to be educated about renewable sources of energy.\""People need to start embracing it,"" McGrath said.\This story includes material from Asbury Park Press archives and the Associated Press.\Click here for a permanent chat on this topic at Hot Topics in our Forums.\BAN ON OFFSHORE DRILLING\Here's some information on the 26-year moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Jersey Shore:\The moratorium, in effect since 1982, is included annually in U.S. Department of the Interior appropriations bills.\Former President Bill Clinton extended the moratorium through 2012.\The federal Minerals Management Service has estimated that the recoverable oil in the mid-Atlantic planning area would last between 17 and 41 days and the recoverable gas for an additional three months.\SOURCE: Statement from Rep.

317,"Apply new tax income to debt reduction\Regarding ""Daggett offers plan to reduce taxes"" (Page A-6, Oct. 2):\Independent gubernatorial candidate Chris Daggett is onto something by suggesting expansion of the sales tax. It's not as regressive as portrayed and has the added impact of reducing unreported income. Clothing no longer requires a broad tax exclusion.\The error is in promising to apply the revenues to property tax reform. Proceeds should simply go to debt reduction and capital projects. Any money sent to municipalities and school districts just ratchets up local spending, so property taxes will never decline. Sending the money to homeowners has been shown time and again to be a shell game, and an unreliable one at that.\Reluctant as we may be and as politically charged as an issue can be, the only control on property taxes is to limit the taxes themselves so that spending follows the taxes raised instead of the other way around. California's solution was too rigid, but they at least got the direction right.\A start for discussion might be along the lines of a long-term cap of 1.5 percent of equalized property valuation with reductions for senior citizens and low-income residents. To ease the local burden further, Trenton needs to look harder at mandates and costs of compliance.\David Sandler\Oakland, Oct. 3\***\Give Paterson children a haven\I am offended by ""Residents demand a safer city"" (Your Views, Oct. 7). How could the letter writer generalize that everyone living in Paterson blames law enforcement and resists education, religion and achievement?\I was born in Paterson and my mother and father could not be a soccer mom or a Little League father. Why? Mainly because my mom worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. as a kitchen aide, and she had to be at the bus stop at 6 a.m. When she got home she was usually dog tired. My dad worked the second shift from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. in a factory. When he got home he was also tired, and the truth is his time was spent working and doing repairs on our home or car.\They worked hard so that we could be educated. They put my three siblings and me through St. Mary's School, a beautiful gem on Sherman Avenue in Paterson. Most mornings, we would go to Mass before school. They instilled in us the importance of education and of doing the right thing.\The reason I bring this up is because most of the people I know who lived and still live in Paterson are just that: hard-working, good people. Have readers seen a church in Paterson on a Sunday? Packed. Some of the nicest, most kind-hearted people I know live and raise their families in Paterson.\The people of Paterson want exactly what you and I have: safety, being able to walk outside and not get shot. They want better lives for their children. The love they have for their children is as great a love as we have for ours. Is this a feeling of an entitlement to the taxpayer's pocketbook? Paterson citizens are also taxpayers.\One thing we did have when I was growing up was Catholic Youth Organization, an after-school program that required us to do our homework first. It fed us dinner, taught us arts and crafts, sewing, dance -- even how to play pool. This was our haven from the streets. We would be bused home at 8 or 9 p.m., exhausted from so much fun. This program ended when I was 15 due to lack of funding.\Paterson children need a safe place to go. The culture of chaos and drugs has always been in the city and will always be there -- when I was 16, my father was murdered in Paterson on New Year's Eve. We need to protect our children: Give them a haven.\Bernadette Lindsay\Wayne, Oct. 7\***\Double jeopardy at toll barriers\I read ""E-ZTrash"" (Editorial, Oct. 2) and had to write.\I was recently mailed a $55 fine for a toll violation.

(Page A-1, Sept. 28) Washington Correspondent Herb Jackson overlooked a major point in discussing how federal gas tax revenues are used in improving the infrastructure of the national transportation system: arguing for significantly increasing the federal gas tax.\Over the past decades, we've seen repeated examples of how our driving habits are influenced by gasoline prices. We also know that the bulk of our oil imports support gasoline production. We should follow the European model: Put gasoline prices in excess of $5 per gallon. There is still a lot of car traffic in Europe. But there's also much greater use of mass transit.\How would we do that without causing personal economic disaster in the United States? Rebate the tax to the consumer. Disposable income wouldn't change, but driving habits would, and every aspect of our economy -- balance of payments, national security and the environment -- would be better off for it.\Jim Groelinger\Mahwah, Oct. 5"
318,"Garry Winkler: Well, let's see, he wants to make marijuana legal, raise taxes on an already overtaxed state, raise the minimum wage to $15 so we lose even more jobs, make NJ a sanctuary state to protect illegal aliens, which will increase crime, and pass every gun control law handed to him in the hopes of disarming law-abiding NJ citizens. Yep, he'll do NJ good in all these areas.\Kevin McGivney: One step closer to the final swirl around the toilet before going down the drain. NJ won't be happy until it chases the last of its middle class out of the state. When people retire most can't afford NJ. I am running into more and more of them here in S.C. Unfortunately they bring their Jersey attitudes with them.\Scott Therrienn: I fear for my life. That's why I carry my legal firearm on me without a concealed carry law.

Those who falsely benefit from social programs will be happy. Law-abiding citizens not so much.\Greg Brady: I'm hoping when they legalize marijuana and everyone sees how this industry has run illegally with astronomical profits for 60 years it will spark a small business boom and start to turn the tide away from corporations back to small businesses. Grandiose? Yes, but crippling corporations is the biggest step to getting government back to the people, not profit.\Patricia Murphy: Specifically, Murphy wants to raise taxes on the wealthy. His critics always leave that part out. Remember, Republican Christie on Day 1 of his administration decided in the middle of a serious recession that the wealthy in the state needed an immediate tax cut and quickly canceled the millionaires tax.\Jack Walling: These bond issues are a laugh. They're spending $325 million on the Statehouse renovation and now another $125 million on libraries. Don't people realize that's almost a half a billion dollars New Jersey doesn't have?

I mean, I hardly have any money left after the government takes most of what I make and now that I'm paying for Chris Christie's gas tax (which Murphy also supported) and the increase in the cost of basic necessities that came with it. Now I can't wait to pay new tolls, a higher gas tax, higher income tax and everything else going through the roof to pay for the bold vision of our amazing, wonderful new governor! I can live on a shoestring, get rid of things that I need to live and so on. The state government knows how to spend my money better than I do! I feel really good that what I make will likely go to line the pockets of one of Murphy's already wealthy friends!

And hopefully the extremist left-wing crap will stay on the back burner.\Isabelle Potter: Christie stood by the side of those who committed fraud and gave them a choice to get PTI, which means he gave them amnesty if they apply for PTI. He lied to the unions to get them to endorse him for re-election. He enjoyed his Fourth of July.\Carol A Woodward-De Pinto: He won in the inner cities where those people have no stake in the game. They don't own property, most work at low-income jobs or are here illegally. And please spare me that illegals and dead people can't vote!

Why can't we just be a state that cares about its citizens and provides an economic environment in which all citizens can live within their means and not be forced to work multiple jobs just to have the basics of life? Moving out of state is usually an economic decision. It is going to be a long four years under Corzine II, but the other candidate would have been worse.\Edward Herbert: New Jersey is being run like Gov. Jerry Brown is running California.

Native plants provide a greater benefit to wildlife, allowing it to thrive, while reducing ecosystem risks and economic impact posed by non-native vegetation.\While not all non-native plant species become invasive, at best they do not provide critical food resources for New Jersey wildlife and pollinators, offer little habitat value and may compete with native plants. Meanwhile, native plants provide berries, seeds and nectar to wildlife throughout many seasons, ensuring a healthier environment along our highways and throughout New Jersey.\The bill would regulate the work of the state Department of Transportation, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the South Jersey Transportation Authority.\We urge the Assembly to pass this bill and move it to the governor's desk.\Kelly Mooij\Trenton, Oct. 25\The writer is vice president, government relations, New Jersey Audubon.\Gas tax increase excites Democrats\Regarding ""Dems tout gas tax increase as Bergen light rail answer"" (Page L-2, Oct. 26):\Local Democrats are already excited that the new gas tax increase could fund light rail service into Bergen County.

320,"Lawmakers and transit advocates are worried that Governor Christie's proposed $33 million cut in aid to NJ Transit will bring riders less service and higher fares.\Christie's plan will reduce services for people ""who have no other choice but to use public transit day-in and day-out to get to work,"" said state Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who is chairman of the Transportation Committee.\Those affected, he said, include not just commuters but people who are handicapped.\""Governor Christie's plan is essentially a tax on our commuters,"" said Wisniewski, D-Middlesex. ""I plan to have the Assembly transportation panel take a very close look at it.""\Others said Christie should raise the state's 14.5-cent-per-gallon gas tax, the fourth-lowest in the nation, instead of taking steps that could steer people away from mass transit and back toward New Jersey's congested roadways.\""Governor Christie is sending the wrong message,"" said Kate Slevin, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a watchdog group. ""Transit fare increases are tax increases.""\Christie, speaking during his budget address Thursday, said cutting NJ Transit's subsidy will force the agency to improve the efficiency of its operations.\He also said NJ Transit will have to ""revisit its rich union contracts, end the patronage hiring that has typified its past, and may also have to consider service reductions or fare increases.""\Responding to Christie, Penny Bassett Hackett, an NJ Transit spokesman, would only say: ""We are looking at everything -- service and fare options, efficiencies -- everything.""\The $32.7 million reduction -- the largest of Christie's proposed transportation funding cuts -- would be a small fraction of NJ Transit's $1.79 billion operating budget for 2010. The agency hasn't raised fares since 2007.\But lawmakers, riders and advocates say the cut will be significant enough to affect an agency that relies heavily on state and federal money to pay for capital projects and balance its budget.\NJ Transit right now is pushing the federal government to contribute up to $3 billion toward its $8.7 billion mass transit tunnel project connecting New Jersey and Manhattan.\Carlos Rodrigues, vice president and state director of the Regional Plan Association, said the agency is already operating at ""bare bones"" and that NJ Transit has already made drastic cuts in recent years that have impacted services.\""This is a nasty snowball from Governor Christie to transit riders,"" said Doug O'Malley, field director for Environment New Jersey. ""NJ Transit is already cutting back service, and additional cuts will mean more stranded riders and fare hikes.""\Riders such as Al Gregory of Fort Lee, whose leg problems compel him to occasionally use an electronic wheelchair, said he relies on either the trains or the buses to get to his doctors in Newark.\He's worried that he'll struggle to find mass transit that he can pay for, noting that he can't afford to buy a car.\""It's really tough out here -- it's really not fair to the people,"" Gregory said.

It is good to see that The Record's thinking has evolved on this issue. After all, it was only this past May in an editorial entitled ""Liberty preserved"" (May 15) that The Record strongly opposed even the consideration of new amenities in Liberty State Park, even though the need for new sources of funds to maintain our parks is readily apparent.\The passage of the 2014 corporate business tax referendum cut millions of dollars annually from our park maintenance budget. This has required the state to seek new revenue to keep our parks in shape. Adding new amenities to our state parks - in much the same way the National Park Service and other state park systems do around the country - not only would help fund park maintenance, it would enhance the visitor experience.\Introducing amenities, is not, as some have suggested, a threat to our parks. It would, instead, provide a real benefit. It would enable us to better maintain our state parks to the advantage of the millions of people who enjoy them every year and who will do so in the future.\Mark Texel\Trenton, Oct. 4\The writer is director of the state Division of Parks and Forestry.\*\Regarding ""Park maintenance"" (Editorials, Sept. 28):\Thank you for drawing attention to New Jersey's underfunded state park system. As you so accurately pointed out, people all over New Jersey consistently support efforts to buy and preserve land because we understand the value in conserving beautiful open space for future generations to enjoy.\Sadly, threats to beautiful natural icons are not limited to New Jersey's borders. In fact, they can even affect the most iconic American landmarks. Right now, mining companies are currently working to open more than 8,000 uranium mines in the areas surrounding the Grand Canyon. These mines would tear up beautiful landscapes, destroy more than 1,000 Native American cultural sites, and possibly contaminate the drinking water supplies for more than 25 million people.\Fortunately, President Obama can permanently protect 1.7 million acres around the Grand Canyon from this dirty and dangerous mining by establishing the Greater Grand Canyon Heritage National Monument. This will not only preserve the Grand Canyon and surrounding areas for generations to come, but encouraging the president to take the lead on such a visible conservation issue will also send a strong signal to New Jersey policymakers that they need to get their act together and start protecting the beautiful open spaces in the Garden State.\People from New Jersey to California need to come together and tell Obama that we do not want extractive industries or simple wear and tear to destroy our beautiful landscapes.\Jake McNichol\New Brunswick, Oct. 4\The writer is a campaign organizer with Environment New Jersey.\Trump's business acumen a plus\Regarding ""Show us the taxes"" (Editorials, Oct. 4):\""Release your taxes"" is an old gambit to try to embarrass the Republican candidate. Yes, releasing Donald Trump's taxes may show that he has paid little, but this is because he is still writing off the massive losses incurred by the real estate bubble in the 1990s, a legal tax strategy.\Intelligent use of the tax code illustrates smart business acumen, something sorely missing in Washington these day. The question that should be raised is, did he break the law?\The media never presses Hillary Clinton to release her speeches to Wall Street officials. She said once that she and her husband were dead broke and in debt when they left the White House. Today, they are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, partly from all those speeches.\What can be said in 25 minutes that could be worth that much? We'd like to know and the mainstream media should ask her to make those speeches public. That would be an interesting trade-off for a Trump tax release.\Trump has been ridiculed by Democrats because some of his companies have gone bankrupt. Trump made use of bankruptcy law and recovered; again, a smart businessman, talent the Oval Office needs but doesn't have.\There is no shame in bankruptcy. Indeed, Harry Truman, once a bankrupt haberdasher, became president of the United States.\Kenneth Stevens\Bogota, Oct. 5\Gas tax hike has politicians salivating\New Jersey's politicians are already salivating at the prospect of money coming in from a higher gas tax. They are lining up, just waiting for their special interests to be funded.\One such project is light rail for Bergen County. What the tax should be used for first and foremost is repairs to bridge, roads and transit, not new construction. Considering the terrible roads we drive and bridges we cross, that should be our top priority. Additionally, NJ Transit is behind in safety corrections.\The sales tax reduction to 6.625 percent is laughable. On a $100 purchase, the tax savings would be 37.5 cents. Really?\If we must pay the gas tax increase, leave the sale tax at 7 percent and make the estate tax exemption $500,000. Anything above that amount should be taxed.\Alexandra L. Bogert\Paterson, Oct. 6"
322,"Don't raise the gas tax\Regarding ""Transit panel chief maintains bold stands"" (Page A-3, Nov. 19):\I read with much chagrin that Assemblyman John Wisniewski, D-Middlesex, proposes to sharply increase the state gasoline tax and also provide some opaque constitutional amendment to safeguard its use for road improvement. Wisniewski's efforts should be directed at probing the reasons for misappropriation and then to develop a safeguard to ""lock-box"" the tax. He must also explain why he is unwilling to utilize toll revenues from the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway.\New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation. Our residents are already overburdened with unfair taxation and the imposition of toll fees. We need elected officials with ""big boy"" pants who can find out how gasoline taxes were siphoned off and employ common-sense ways to fill the gap with state-imposed levies. It is clear to me that the assemblyman chooses to let this problem manage him instead of managing the problem.\Rich Chorbajian\Rutherford, Nov. 20\*\Regarding ""Think big on transit"" (Editorials, Nov. 20):\You lament the poor condition of New Jersey's infrastructure, and justifiably so.\The Transportation Trust Fund is bankrupt. The reason is ""that the money was not wisely spent"" and some expenses were purposely mislabeled to further compromise the fund. And now the fund has only enough money on hand to pay the interest on past fiascos. Forget paving a road or two.\For example, you tell us that we wasted money on the River Line in southern New Jersey. You say this project was ""driven by politics, not by potential ridership or economic opportunities for all."" And you go on to say that ""the state cannot fund every powerful legislator's pet project.""\So now it's time to burden the taxpayer once again through a gas tax that's ""easier to sell politically while gas prices are low."" The same taxpayer who, if lucky enough to even have a job, will get up early each day, trudge to that job and return home exhausted only to repeat it again the next morning.\Well I, for one, am fed up. We deserve the names of those responsible for depleting the fund. Drag them out for all to see. Who are these ""powerful legislators""? What political party do they represent? Who were the real beneficiaries of this waste?\Most likely these same people will have access to the new fund generated by the inevitable rise in our gas tax. The beat will go on.\We can't just shrug our shoulders and succumb to this extortion. We need names. And we wonder why we are the highest taxed state in the country.\Charles Harper\Wyckoff, Nov. 20\Turf field bad for Edgewater\A decision was made Nov. 10 by the Edgewater Council to use artificial turf as covering for the Little League field. This was done to have baseball in Edgewater next season.\Numerous residents from both sides of the aisle had asked the council to support a grass field. Plans are for the turf to replace a grass field and for a sprinkler system already in place to be removed. The polyethylene plastic blades will look grass-like, but the blades will be supported by a various list of artificial products that may contain ground tire rubber with toxic metals and chemicals, depending on the manufacturer. The New Jersey Work Environment Council has produced a fact sheet on artificial turf hazards and some physicians caution about heat stroke, turf burns and infections because of a turf field's higher temperatures.\We are starting again to pollute ourselves and at great cost. One ventured estimate at the meeting was $1 million to artificially turf the Little League field, yearly maintenance of $7,500, and replacement in 10 years for another $1 million. That is much more than the cost of sod or hydro-seeding for grass.\The council is going out to bid for artificial turf and expects to have a decision at a special December meeting. Residents should contact council members with their considerations.\Peter De Paul\Edgewater, Nov. 19\Where is the 'common good'?\When I was young, mom always had extra bubble wands, so I could share. When I was older, my parents explained that just like we shared the bubbles, we pay taxes for the common good and to support programs that benefit our fellow citizens.\What's happened to the common good? It's been replaced by the selfish notion of ""rugged individualism,"" which in my view also means, ""I've got mine, I'm not sharing.""\Many corporations and wealthy individuals prefer to pay lawyers and accountants to avoid paying taxes. Is it because they're struggling economically? According to a September study from the Harvard Business School, about 38 percent of America's private wealth is held by the top 1 percent of people.\The study also found the bottom 80 percent of Americans own 73 percent of all debt, and concluded that such huge wealth disparities are unsustainable. How sad that America, which a few decades ago was a sharing, inclusive nation providing opportunities for all, has become a self-serving, extractive country, where the haves can take all and leave crumbs for the rest of us.\This Thanksgiving, here's something to ponder.

It needs to be revived.\Thank goodness there are those agencies and generous hearts giving to those in need of just the basics to feed themselves and their families. The Center for Food Action has done a superb job in giving a lifeline to that effort. We also need relief from exorbitant rents and taxes.\But The Record's editorials need to take the gloves off in asking for help from those with more than enough, and even demand assistance from those who have exploited the rest.\Our corporate commercialism is so thick it can be cut with a knife, as it all goes to the benefit of the few. Our president during his initial campaign had the right idea to spread the wealth around, but that never did materialize.\So, help the poor, but do it now. Or the next round of social disruptions will be close to home due to the imprisonment of Americans to this economic system.\Richard Cerbo\Hackensack, Nov. 20\Clearing up Affordable Care Act 'confusion'\Regarding ""Don't let emotion decide policy"" (Your Views, Nov. 20):\The House of Representatives and Senate approved legislation to establish a Department of Foreign Affairs on July 21, 1789, and President George Washington signed it into law on July 27, making the department the first federal agency to be created under the new Constitution. In September 1789, additional legislation changed the name of the agency to the Department of State.\The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not say ""through exchanges established by the states,"" but rather ""through an exchange established by the state.""\To me, that is the same ""state"" that is represented by the Department of State (the federal government), and that means one exchange, which was created via federal law, not legislation of each individual state. Each state can choose a method of implementation that best serves them, including opting to have the federal government set it up and run it.\Jack Siegel\Wayne, Nov. 20"
323,"I SPONSORED a number of tough bills during my time in the legislature. Some required a lot of debate and some were so controversial they never passed at all. But the easiest bills I ever sponsored were the Green Acre Bond issues.\These were measures for the ballot that asked the voters whether they would authorize the state to borrow money in order to purchase open space. In good times and in bad, under Republicans and Democrats, people voted overwhelmingly in favor.\New Jerseyans are thrifty. They don't like taxes, and they are wary of increased government spending. Yet, when it comes to the environment, we've always said ""yes.""\Most of us live in cities or suburbs. We enjoy the conveniences, but we want our parks and take pride in our agriculture. We love the shore and like taking our children to the Delaware Water Gap or the Pine Barrens to enjoy their unsullied beauty.\Now comes a bipartisan report from the Governor's Council on New Jersey Outdoors. Chaired by former Assemblywoman Maureen Ogden, the council includes many people who over the years have been leaders in the effort to preserve our environment.\Their findings are troubling. By the end of this year, the funds for open space acquisition, farmland preservation, and the New Jersey Historic Trust will run out. Unless something is done, the shortfall for this year alone will be $170 million. If that happens, thousands of acres of open space and farmland will be gone forever. In the future the council suggests that in order to keep New Jersey green the state needs to allocate about $200 million a year.\That doesn't seem like much for a state whose annual budget now exceeds $16 billion, but we must recognize that the $16 billion is used for schools, roads, prisons, and so many other needs. It is doubtful that legislators will take funds from other priorities. And if they don't and no new sources are found, open space will disappear, historic sites will be bulldozed, and those wonderful fresh fruits and vegetables from New Jersey farms will be less and less available.\And remember the economic benefits of wise land preservation. I spent a good deal of my time as governor trying to attract new jobs to New Jersey. And I was successful.\During my eight years, three quarters of a million new jobs came to our state. Time and again company executives would tell me why they decided to come to New Jersey. Yes, they wanted an educated work force and a reasonable tax climate, but they wanted something more. They wanted a good living environment for themselves and for their employees. They wanted good schools and usually they wanted to locate near a park or open space. They didn't particularly like urban sprawl. I sold New Jersey as a state that cared about its environment and was willing to work to preserve it.\I learned a lesson. The investment we make in New Jersey to protect open space is returned many times in tourism and the continual enjoyment of our citizens. We spend $2 billion every year on roads and highways. The council's suggestion that we spend one tenth of this to preserve our quality of life is not unreasonable.\The governor has endorsed the report's findings. Conservationists are hoping for a dedicated fund so that planning can be done and the money assured year after year in the vagaries of the budget process. Some legislators have stepped forward. Senate President Don DiFrancesco has part of the answer. He is promoting a state match for money, appropriated by cities and towns. This should provide around $50 million in state and local funds. It's a good start.\Some have suggested raising the gas tax by a few pennies. Others are ready to recommend that a small portion of sales funds be dedicated, and still others call for a hotel-motel tax. Whatever the source, the money must be found. We have here in New Jersey more people per square mile than any other state. If we want our children to stay and enjoy a quality life, we must stop paving over their heritage.\In Ecclesiastes, Solomon writes, ""One generation passeth away and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever.""\Never has the need for the continued protection of our environment been written more poetically or more powerfully."
324," Many care about hockey season\ In ""NHL season goes kaput"" (Editorial, Feb. 17), you ask, ""Who cares?""\ Well, guess what: I care. And there are a lot of other people who do as well. Just because it doesn't have the popularity of the NBA, NFL or Major League Baseball, it doesn't mean hockey is a worthless sport that no one cares about.\ Just turn to The Record's Sports section, and you'll see that just about every high school in Bergen County now has a team. In fact, high school and youth hockey has been one of the fastest growing sports in New Jersey in the last 10 years, with many teams forming, and many new ice rinks opening for service.\ So while The Record might not care, the cancellation of the NHL season is extremely heartbreaking for me and many other hockey fans. All I can hope for is the eventual end of the lockout, and a new season to look forward to.\ Mike Morrissey\ Oakland, Feb. 17\ * * *\ Many care about hockey season\ I consider your decision to editorialize on the cancellation of the NHL season by filling two inches of space with the comment ""Who cares?"" misguided and in poor judgment.\ On the same day that you labored to come up with such an insightful comment, many of your staff writers managed to fill the Sports section with positive comments about hockey and the horrible effect cancellation of the season will have on the many people who work at the arenas, parking lots and concession stands around the country.\ Columnist Adrian Wojnarowski notes with great insight (""Hockey loses its right to call itself big time,"" Sports, Page S-1, Feb. 17) that ""the little guys always take the biggest hits"" in these types of situations. There are plenty of little people in New Jersey and around the country who do care. To waste two inches of editorial space in this manner is disgraceful.\ Lyle Press\ Ridgewood, Feb. 17\ * * *\ China, Russia must step up on N. Korea\ I agree America should hesitate before attacking North Korea, but we should not reward or lend credibility, via direct negotiations, to a Stalinist dictatorship that has illicitly acquired nuclear weapons (""A failed policy,"" Editorial, Feb. 13).\ America is quite bogged down in Iraq. I applaud taking out Saddam Hussein, but wish to see us declare ""mission accomplished."" If it is becoming American policy to excise the disease but then stay on for years of quagmire and nation building at massive fiscal and human cost, then getting further involved in Korea seems unwise.\ Other nations should be stepping up to the plate. Russia and China are U.N. Security Council members. Dealing with a rogue nation in their back yards is one of those responsibilities. Both nations have provided vital aid to North Korea and have grumbled about American global muscle-flexing. Now is the opportunity to fill the power vacuum they seek.\ Steve Goldstein\ Fort Lee, Feb. 14\ * * *\ Idle CSX trains divide Teaneck\ The CSX trains that use Teaneck's unobstructed railroad tracks as a parking lot are an eyesore and dramatically impact the quality of life in our town. Our property values are diminished because of the noise and air pollution as well as the unsightliness of many graffiti-covered boxcars. (""Teaneck appeals for help against 'stinkin' trains,'-"" Page L-1,Feb. 11).\ As a multiethnic community with significant Jewish and Muslim populations, Teaneck faces unique security threats. The unguarded CSX trains, idling with cargo unknown to the general public, present serious homeland security issues; they can easily become targets for those who would do harm in our community.\ In New Jersey, far too many communities are literally divided - racially, economically, religiously - by railroads. In too many towns we refer to those who live on the ""other side of the tracks."" But not in Teaneck. We made wise decisions to avoid those kinds of divisions. Teaneck built bridges to avoid those divisions. We should not be punished by CSX for such good planning.\ Ben Dworkin\ Teaneck, Feb. 15\ * * *\ Higher gas tax as terrorist defense\ I agree that we need a higher gas tax, and I would even recommend making it for at least 75 cents to $1 (""Time to raise the gas tax,"" Editorial, Feb. 15).\ Not only do we need this to help fund new highway projects, but we also need to discourage people from buying gas-guzzling SUVs. These inefficient and impractical trucks are not only bad for the environment, but their weight causes more destruction to the roads, requiring constant improvement of those roads.\ It should also be pointed out that the more gasoline Americans consume, the more money terrorist organizations in the Middle East might receive. Maybe New Jersey politicians might be able to convince a majority of the people if the tax is introduced as an anti-terrorist measure.\ Nick Flattery\ Ridgefield Park, Feb. 15\ * * *\ Clarifying flawed source\ This letter is to clarify ""N.J. investigates company over alleged terrorist ties"" (Page A-1, Dec. 30, 2004).\ The Record's reporter relied almost solely on a deeply flawed and discredited source - a book the British courts recently judged libelous - to support an utterly preposterous notion that Investcorp could have ""terrorist ties.""\ The most casual research would have revealed that this book is mostly a rambling diatribe against the U.S. government, former President Bush, and his son, the current president. Its authors made similar sensationally scandalous and untrue conspiracy claims against Goldman Sachs, AIG, Carlyle Group, Merrill Lynch, and the esteemed majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Dr. William Frist.\ The reporter repeated the book's claim that a ""quarter of Investcorp's stock"" was controlled by Khalid bin Mahfouz. Again, not true at all. Another basic fact check would have revealed that Bin Mahfouz does not now, nor has he ever, owned stock in Investcorp.\ Good journalism usually requires correct facts to be unearthed before a story is published.\ It is with cold comfort that afterward, as a leader of a private equity firm known for its sterling corporate reputation within the industry, I am obliged to correct the factual basis that ""supported"" this ""story"" and justified its placement on your front page.\ Christopher J. Stadler\ New York, N.Y., Feb. 14\ Editor's note:\ Before publication of ""N.J. investigates company over alleged terror ties"" on Dec. 30., 2004, Staff Writer Alex Nussbaum repeatedly contacted Investcorp representatives by telephone and e- mail with questions about their directors and the allegations made in the book ""Forbidden Truth."" He asked specifically about Bin Mahfouz's relationship to Investcorp. Company representatives spoke generally about the book but refused to discuss this or other specific allegations.\ Mr. Stadler calls the book ""deeply flawed and discredited""; The Record's article acknowledged it was controversial and noted that Bin Mahfouz had won a libel suit against the author in England. The article did not conclude whether the book's allegations were true or false but simply reported that state officials had deemed them worthy of deeper investigation. The Record stands by its report.\ * * *\ Playing to political mob\ Regarding ""Political correctness gone wild"" (Your Views, Feb. 7)\ The letter writer seems to feel that SUVs are being unfairly stigmatized. What does the reporting of facts regarding a deadly train wreck last month have to do with political correctness? If a Volkswagen Beetle or a Toyota Prius had been involved in the incident, it would still have been reporting the facts to have named the type of vehicle.\ Further, in light of the derailment it caused, the first question of any reasonable person would have been what the vehicle was. A train could have hit some vehicles and presumably carried them along or tossed them aside like fleas. I don't think anyone is holding SUVs in disfavor. Have Ford Broncos suffered because one was involved in eluding police in a low-speed chase?\ The larger story concerns the motive behind the letter. Bashing political correctness is a particularly fashionable code word when one wants to rant on liberals (another dirty word) and their annoying existence in the press in general.\ James Miles\ Teaneck, Feb. 7\ * * *\ Excess is in eye of beholder\ Such excitement over the ""art"" of miles of fluttering silks erected throughout Central Park (""Festive crowd greets Central Park 'Gates,'-"" Page A-1, Feb. 13):\ Although the effect may be lovely, I am surprised that no one is crying out that the $21 million could have been better spent in, for example, sending aid to the tsunami survivors. Apparently that concern is expressed only in regard to President Bush's Inauguration Day festivities - not for such expenditures as the Grammys, the Oscars or ""The Gates.""\ Nancy Otterby\ Allendale, Feb. 14"
325," Richard J. Codey isn't sleeping much these days.\ That's because ideas for fixing New Jersey keep jolting him out of bed.\ ""I'm up and down all night,"" says the man scheduled to become the state's acting governor at 12:01 Tuesday morning. ""I've got a pad next to my bed - I'm writing a lot in it.""\ Codey, a 57-year-old insurance salesman and self-professed sports freak from West Orange, is a 31-year veteran of the state Legislature who admits he is not thrilled about being default governor for the resigning James E. McGreevey.\ He also admits that his midnight scribblings do not really amount to a vision for governing New Jersey.\ But no one should make the mistake of thinking that Codey, the man who became Senate president by thumping the Democratic Party warlords who despise him, will be a reluctant warrior.\ In a far-reaching interview with The Record last week, Codey made it clear that he intends to be an activist governor who will leave big footprints everywhere - including on the backsides of special interests that stand in the way of ethics reform and tough budget decisions.\ ""We have a game plan and it's pretty well packed,"" Codey said during a 90-minute meeting in his State House office. ""I'm going to be picking some fights with people - which I think is good.""\ Although Codey did not reveal details, he gave a good idea about the areas where he'll likely start scrapping:\ * Government ethics: He promised to enact new laws to curtail excessive sharing of campaign money among local party leaders. The practice, known as ""wheeling,"" allows party bosses to become all- powerful bankers for candidates in neighboring counties. Codey also promised to create a state inspector general with broad powers to ferret out fraud on the state and local level.\ * The state budget: Codey says he does not want to lay off workers or raise income or sales taxes to fill the state's $4 billion budget shortfall. But he admits that ""everything is on the table"" - except a gas tax hike - and does not rule out freezes in local aid and cuts in property tax rebates. He says he has been studying possible spending cuts since September.\ * Homeland security: Codey says he has been working on a ""serious plan"" to make New Jersey's seaports and airports safer. He says he has asked federal security officials to honestly assess the state's needs as well as its past performance in the war on terror.\ * The environment: Codey will make ""major changes"" to a McGreevey plan that would provide ""fast track"" approval to building projects across the state. The fast track plan as advanced by McGreevey, he said, was a deeply flawed compromise. ""A bill of that magnitude, done so quickly and under the cloak of such secrecy, has to be revisited,"" he said.\ Codey will become New Jersey's second unelected governor since 2001, when then Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco became acting chief executive following the departure of Republican Christie Whitman. The state constitution requires Codey, as Senate leader, to hold his legislative seat and the governor's office at the same time.\ As he fills out McGreevey's unexpired term for 14 months, Codey will have enormous power to create laws and advance - or block - changes in public policy.\ Although Codey seems eager to forge substantive change in Trenton, his biggest contribution may be as a healer to a state capital worn thin by the scandals and political wars of the McGreevey era. Whereas the outgoing governor was secretive and circular in speech, Codey has a self-deprecating style and a direct manner that inspires affection from leaders in both parties.\ He is not afraid to point out his own errors, and his bursts of plain-spoken candor come as something of a shock to State House regulars who rued the endless denials and spin doctoring that came from McGreevey's office.\ Here he is, for example, on his decision last year to vote for $2 billion in borrowing to balance the state budget, a move later deemed illegal by the courts: ""Given hindsight, that was a mistake, no question about it. We probably shouldn't have spent as much and we wouldn't be in the fix we're in now. We've certainly made some mistakes, and I'm part of that. And I know that how I deal with the budget this year is very well how I will be judged in turn.""\ On increasing the gas tax to pay for badly needed road and bridge maintenance: ""I don't see doing anything on that for at least a year. Let's be candid: As we get closer to an election do you think someone's going to vote to raise the gas tax? HELLO?""\ On installing slot machines in the Meadowlands: ""For us to bury our heads in the sand on this issue is absurd. Everyone else is going to have slot machines. New York. Pennsylvania. Let's just get on with it and make sure the state gets a fair share of revenue out of it.""\ On the Legislature's role in property tax reform (bristling): ""Why is it our job to control property taxes? The Legislature isn't the bad guy here, it's the local school boards who can't control their spending. If people want to control property taxes in their town they should think twice about approving school referenda in their towns. I don't control the town budget. I don't control the county budget. No sir. Property tax reform starts on the local level.""\ Codey has already moved to codify a sweeping executive order recently signed by McGreevey that would limit the ability of elected officials to reward their political contributors with state contracts.\ That practice, known as ""pay-to-play,"" has dominated debate in Trenton for two years and has come to be viewed as the signal sin of a corrupt state government.\ Even though Codey says ethics reform will be a big part of his agenda, he is reluctant to call himself a ""reformer"" and refuses to buy into the notion that the public is deeply concerned about a supposed ethical crisis in government.\ ""Do we have to do a lot more in ethics reform? Yes,"" he said. ""But I'm telling you, for the average guy on the street, it just doesn't register.\ ""Poll after poll finds that. I can't tell you how many times I've been approached on the street by people who wonder why this story or that was written. 'What's the big deal?' they say.""\ Asked if he would support a total ban on pay-to-play in county courthouses and city halls - a move supported by Republicans - Codey shrugged and said, ""I think we've already gone about as far we can go."" He said current law already prohibits vendors from making contributions over $500 to local politicians who can award them government contracts.\ Codey points out that most of his fellow lawmakers, in both parties, believe that the press has made too much of an issue about ethics reform. ""Absolutely positively,"" he says.\ But as he eases into his new role, Codey is eager to show that he understands that ethics reform carries symbolic significance even though it may not be a burning issue for the average Jerseyan. Even before taking office, he advanced a measure limiting campaign contributions and promised that he would not take contributions from state vendors while governor.\ On other ethical issues, for example, he said he would support a ban on dual office-holding - a state legislator having a simultaneous job as county freeholder or a mayor, for example. He said he would support public financing of elections if wealthy candidates also agreed not to use their own money on elections.\ He said the idea of a full-time Legislature was ""something to think about"" because it would increase lawmakers' independence. Currently, New Jersey lawmakers serve in a part-time capacity and most have full-time jobs in the private sector.\ Codey said he would not support full disclosure of lawmakers' private business clients because it would violate the privacy of the clients. He declined to identify the clients of his own insurance business, which he recently placed into a blind trust - a move that was not required by law.\ ""No matter what you do, you're going to have what somebody perceives as a conflict,"" Codey said. ""I'm going to do what I think is right, I don't care if it hurts my pocketbook or not.""\ Codey's ascension to the governor's office comes after a series of personal and political trials. In recent years, he faced challenges from Democrats sponsored by party bosses who opposed his leadership in the state Senate.\ In 2003, Codey's wife, long haunted by mental illness, was diagnosed with breast cancer. Shortly thereafter, both of his parents died within a span of five months.\ On Aug. 12, when McGreevey stood before the public and announced he was resigning after a homosexual affair with an aide, Codey reached a low point.\ ""On that day, I'm sitting there realizing that I've got to be the governor, all this is now on my shoulders, and I'm thinking, 'Can things really get any worse for me?'-"" Codey said. ""This is not what I wanted to do. I wanted to enjoy my life and not always be under personal and political pressure. But I'm growing into this job, and I think I'm coming to understand that I can really leave my footprint in a lot of places as governor that I couldn't as senator.""\ Codey has not yet ruled out the possibility that he might even run for the office next year.\ ""Whether I do or don't, it's not going to change the person I am. It certainly won't affect the work I do over the next 14 months."" he said. ""There's one thing I can promise. I will never mix up governing this state with running for office. Never.""\ ***\ E-mail: pillets@northjersey.com"
326,"GOVERNOR CHRISTIE had a great election night, leading a nationwide campaign that saw Republicans win a majority of gubernatorial races and take take control of statehouses in three normally Democratic bastions, Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts. Now that his work as chairman of the Republican Governors Association is done, it's time for the governor to renew his focus on such state issues as transportation, tax reform and ethics.\The national environment will get in the way. We saw that on Wednesday's morning news shows when Christie was asked -- yet again -- about running for president in 2016. His stock answer is that he's not ready to make a decision. That could be, but the questions and speculation will continue until the governor decides what he's going to do.\If Christie does run for president, as a majority of political watchers expect, that announcement likely will come early next spring at the latest. A governor who is an announced candidate for president is a governor who is bound to be distracted, not to mention one who will be out of state quite frequently.\So the opportunity for meaningful accomplishment in Trenton must be seized now. Such major initiatives as overhauling the state's property tax system and a second round of health and pension benefit reform are probably unlikely because of entrenched political opposition.\But there are many other important issues that can be addressed now, and the governor should lead the way.\With the state Transportation Trust Fund essentially without money to finance new projects, replenishing it is a must. The governor has opened the door to a solution that could include an increase in the state's gas tax by declaring that ""everything is on the table"" and by naming Jamie Fox, a Democrat, as commissioner of transportation. With that bipartisan approach, there is a chance for meaningful compromise.\There also is support from both sides of the aisle to make the state's so-called ""death taxes"" -- the inheritance tax and the estate tax -- less onerous. That should be a priority as well.\The governor's most recent YouTube moment involved a heckler who was complaining about the slow distribution of Sandy relief aid. Christie's ""Sit down and shut up"" put-down got the bulk of media attention, but the protester had a valid point. While the governor vetoed Sandy ""bill of rights"" legislation, getting aid to Sandy victims more quickly and completing the relief effort are imperative.\The governor arrived in Trenton with an impressive list of proposals to make New Jersey government more ethical. Many that have fallen by the wayside need to be looked at again. That includes capping how much unused compensatory time public employees can collect upon retirement and ending the practice of politically connected individuals boosting their pensions by securing high-paying jobs at the end of their careers.\With all the talk about Christie running for president, it's easy to forget that the governor is still in the first year of his second term.\The governor may not stay until the end of his term in 2018, but as long as he has the job, he must display a renewed focus on New Jersey, starting now."
327,"Chris Christie becomes New Jersey's newest governor Tuesday, promising to lead the state forward with a firm hand. He'll immediately face many of the same problems that vexed his predecessors. Here is a rundown of some of the major issues Christie will confront and what he has said about them.\State finances\Christie is inheriting a state fiscal situation that will be challenging to manage on several fronts.\The state budget will have a structural deficit of at least $8 billion during Christie's first year in office thanks to revenue losses tied to the bad economy and spending decisions made by prior administrations. Christie's own budget team estimates the deficit could be closer to $10 billion. As governor, Christie will also have to come up with the steep spending cuts he called for on the campaign trail. That could force tough decisions on state aid such as school funding, and he'll also have to decide what to do with property tax rebates.\Christie also inherits a record $34 billion debt, an amount that equates to $3,600 for every man, woman and child living in New Jersey. He is promising to take a hard look at any new borrowing that was planned by the Corzine administration, which means school construction and transportation issues will face new scrutiny. The heavy debt burden also puts a stress on Christie's first budget because he cannot avoid paying that bill even though he didn't run it up.\The state pension system is also a major problem thanks to an unfunded liability of at least $30 billion. Christie has to find $2.5 billion to pay what actuaries say is needed for him to begin restoring the pension system.\Property taxes\The issue that many believe put Christie in office may also be his biggest challenge: property taxes. Average property tax bills have risen to a record $7,045. And the burden in North Jersey is $8,500 on average.\Municipal governments and school boards will face new pressure from Christie to reduce spending. He has pledged to enact hard spending caps that would not include the waivers towns and school boards were able to use under Corzine.\Christie is promising to aggressively audit school districts to find savings that could lower property taxes.\The governor-elect is also calling for different levels of government to seriously consider sharing redundant services as an opportunity for property tax relief.\Transportation\New Jersey is running out of funds for transportation projects, and Christie has vowed not to borrow money that would add to the state's $34 billion debt. But he may have few options available as he deals with a transportation infrastructure that's aging and deteriorating. Indeed, Christie already has reversed course, agreeing last month to support new transportation bonds that will add $3.2 billion in debt service through 2041.\* The Transportation Trust Fund, which supports large-scale projects, is expected to run out of money by mid-2011. Tolls and the state's 14.5-cents-per-gallon gas tax fund the trust, but Christie has vowed not to replenish it by raising either. Since he's also promised not to borrow additional money, he may find it hard to avoid raising the fourth-lowest gas tax in the nation as a way to ensure the long-term survival of bridge reconstruction and mass transit expansion. The fund also pays for nearly $70 million in routine maintenance every year.\* Christie supports the $8.7 billion mass transit tunnel that will link North Jersey with Manhattan. The tunnel will double rail capacity along the NJ Transit and Amtrak route. But Congress has not agreed to the state's continuing request for $3 billion in funding, and the government is wrestling with how to deal with its own budget woes. Congress is even considering raising the federal gas tax to pay for much-needed transportation projects. With the help of its congressional delegation, the state has acknowledged that it will need to be vigilant to secure the federal money that's needed to complete the project.\* Christie will make appointments to the Port Authority that could impact the management of Newark Liberty International Airport. The bi-state agency, which operates the airport, has been struggling to erase Newark's reputation as the most-delayed airfield in the nation. The authority has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration to ease air traffic congestion in the New York and New Jersey region.\Health care\While the budget crisis will force the new governor to look for ways to cut state spending, he may want to avoid drastic action with Medicaid and hospital charity-care. That's because any cuts he makes will be magnified: New Jersey's spending is matched by the federal government's. So trimming New Jersey's spending means losing federal dollars as well.\* Hospitals are hoping for more state reimbursement for care of the uninsured and additional money for the Hospital Stabilization Fund. But they'll be lucky if resources stay at current levels. That means more hospital failures may be on the horizon, especially those dependent on government revenues.\* During his campaign, Christie pledged support for the reopening of Pascack Valley Hospital, saying residents ""deserve and need"" a hospital in Westwood. At the moment, the future of the hospital rests with the courts. The state health commissioner ruled that the hospital license at the site expired Dec. 28. Hackensack University Medical Center must mount a successful legal challenge to the commissioner's decision before its application to reopen the hospital can be considered.\* Christie's need to focus immediately on the budget crisis will allow time for the details of federal health-care reform to emerge. He probably won't have time to modify the state health-insurance market so out-of-state insurers can compete, as he proposed during his campaign. But the federal reform package could supersede whatever he had in mind.\Economic development\Christie has placed top priority on reversing New Jersey's reputation as a difficult and expensive place to do business, and he hopes to create jobs and improve the state economy with a variety of reforms.\That's sparked excitement in the business community, which is weary after years of pro-labor Democrats in the governor's office and convinced that New Jersey lost ground in the competition with other states for jobs. But Christie's pledges will be hard to fulfill given the state's entrenched interests and lack of cash for tax cuts and development incentives.\* Taxes: During the election, Christie promised to cut the state's corporate business tax and other business taxes, but any cut would further reduce the state's already weak revenue stream.\* Economic team: Christie appointed Lt. Gov.-elect Kim Guadagno his top economic development officer and has said he will improve state economic development programs by putting them under a public-private partnership. Guadagno has little business experience, however, and Christie has yet to detail how the partnership would work.\* Red tape: Christie has pledged to reduce the bureaucracy that business leaders say stifles entrepreneurial efforts and deters companies from expanding in, or moving into, the state. He heartened the business community by announcing a 90-day moratorium on new regulations, during which a review panel will study permanent reforms.\Environment\How Christie will tackle the mountain of environmental problems affecting New Jersey is all but unknown since he offered scant details during his campaign and rarely had to deal with the issues as U.S. attorney or Morris County freeholder. On one hand, he has called the Department of Environmental Protection a hindrance to business growth, but he also made several green promises to one of the state's most influential environmental groups to get its endorsement. Among his plans and issues he will likely deal with:\* Christie has said he would offer generous tax credits to attract renewable energy manufacturers to the state through a new office called ""Renew NJ.""\* He wants to install solar panels on every landfill that can hold them -- a plan the state is already attempting in the Meadowlands.\* Christie said in August that the DEP would be the first place he would trim the state payroll, saying the agency often harms the economy with permit delays and fines.\* The way 20,000 contaminated sites are cleaned up will change dramatically during Christie's first term, with the DEP slowly implementing a program in which private contractors rather than the government will oversee remediation.\* He promised the New Jersey Environmental Federation that he would strengthen protection of sensitive waterways, oppose a Linden coal plant, require state contractors to retrofit their diesel engines and find funding for the state's open-space program. The advocacy group endorsed Christie.\Ethics\Christie is taking on New Jersey government's pension hogs and double dippers. The onetime prosecutor in August introduced a 10-point plan to strengthen the state's ethics rules -- a major step, he said, to rid New Jersey of the ""serious financial and emotional burden inflicted by corruption.""\Here are the highlights:\* Auditor: He would do away with the appointed auditor and allow New Jerseyans to elect one. Until then, he would name a special prosecutor to audit government programs and name a ""taxpayer advocate"" to examine all purchasing orders.\* Pay-to-play: He wants to limit the amounts that labor unions can contribute to political campaigns.\* Disclosure: He will advocate for more detailed financial-disclosure information from lawmakers. Also, Christie wants lawmakers to recuse themselves from voting on issues from which they could benefit financially.\* Dual offices: He says he would rework a state law that grandfathered dual-office holders, and disallow lawmakers from serving in other political offices at the same time.\* Boards and commissions: He would remove about 300 political appointees from the pension system and would dismiss appointees who have conflicts of interest.\***\Staff Writers John Reitmeyer, Tom Davis, Lindy Washburn, Hugh R.

328,"There were small requests - $1.4 million for domestic violence programs and $11 million for housing for the developmentally disabled - and larger-ticket items like restoring $148 million in aid to hospitals and much more to extend the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail into Bergen County.\For three hours Tuesday, members of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee heard from more than 30 residents, organizations, unions and elected officials about the implications of Governor Christie's proposed $33.8 billion spending plan for the coming fiscal year. It was the first of five public hearings being held by Senate and Assembly committees as they consider the governor's proposal.\Almost everyone who testified at the hearing at Bergen Community College in Paramus came seeking additional state funding. One resident, George Rath of Tenafly, came to advocate for increasing the state's gas tax to fund needed transportation infrastructure projects. Several people, including representatives of the New Jersey Education Association, asked senators to look into the financial implications of new state standardized tests on state and local school budgets.\Most of the testimony focused on helping some of the state's most fragile residents - the developmentally disabled, people battling addiction and the poor.\""We urge you to remember the state budget is more than a fiscal plan,"" said Sister Patricia Codey, president of Catholic Health Care Partnerships of New Jersey. ""It reflects our values as a society, and we urge you not to neglect the needs of the least among us.""\Codey was one of a few health care representatives who urged the committee to reconsider Christie's plan to cut $148 million in charity care aid for hospitals that treat the uninsured. The Christie administration has said less aid is needed because more New Jerseyans have enrolled in insurance, and it points out that the budget includes a $45 million increase in doctor reimbursements through the state's Medicaid program, New Jersey FamilyCare.\Earl Lipphardt, senior director of Integrity Inc., was surrounded by 30 clients undergoing treatment for substance abuse.\Lipphardt, whose program is based in Newark, urged the state to consider funding transitional housing for people who just completed treatment programs. He said Integrity got a grant after Superstorm Sandy that has funded 48 recovery housing slots, but that money is about to run out. Lipphardt said the slots have served as an ""experiment"" proving people are more able to become productive members of society with the proper support.\""The clients who are with me today are not going to have those opportunities, and they're going to go back to being couch homeless,"" he said. ""Their cycle of addiction is going to be infinitely harder to break.""\Several lawmakers on the panel said they would try to help, pointing out that Christie has made combating addiction a priority.\""The faces that we're looking at really are the faces of the budget,"" said Sen. Paul Sarlo, D-Wood-Ridge, chairman of the committee. ""Government has an obligation to look after some of our most vulnerable folks in society.""\There was also testimony from several providers of services for the developmentally disabled as well as relatives of people with intellectual and physical disabilities.\Robert Hage, board president of The Arc of New Jersey, said the state isn't doing enough to address the rising number of people - like his daughter - who have developmental disabilities and are waiting for housing. More than 7,000 people are on that list, and 3,600 of them are considered priorities because they're facing imminent peril or at risk of becoming homeless, he said.

329,"Readers sound off on gasoline tax hike\Proposed tax hike is unconscionable\It isn't so much the proposed gasoline tax increase, but the amount that is absolutely unconscionable - as much as 32 cents per gallon.\However, in the spirit of good will, I would suggest that the state increase the tax by one-tenth of a cent and round off the price of gasoline to full cents and get rid of the stupid nine-tenths of a cent that has been in effect for more years than I or anyone I know can recall.\Stephen F. Orban DOVER TOWNSHIP\Audit the books in Trenton offices\I hate to see Trenton raising the tax on gasoline. New Jersey is about as heavily taxed as anywhere in the country and the lone exception has always been gasoline. Makes sense, too, since the entire middle of the state was opened up by automobiles and depends on cars exclusively to get around, not like the eastern and western sides of the state and the older cities that had train and bus service in place before auto ownership became so widespread. Cars are a necessity in most places. This is going to hurt a lot.\But, they say, we need it for our roads. The tens of billions they already get from us are not enough to fix the roads? Not if they need to hire family members, award no-bid contracts, pay themselves inflated salaries with generous perks and medical coverage, expand the size of government, protect the environment by buying up undevelopable properties owned by their relatives and contributors, building train systems that carry no passengers, auto emission inspection systems that duplicate the information on your dashboard, toll collection systems that require repeated infusions of cash for upgrades that still don't work as well as in other states, and on and on.\Arnold Schwarzenegger may be a cartoon of a governor, but he has ordered a full audit of California's books. Can you imagine what such an audit would reveal in New Jersey? Probably that the state could operate as well or better on a small fraction of the money it consumes now. Think it will happen? Forget about it. Ethics law reform, we'll think about it. More tax money, it's urgent.\I would guess that 80 percent of the citizens of the state feel the same about this. Nevertheless, Trenton is going to do it. We can't stop them. What I'd like for Christmas is a way to harness the outrage most of us feel for the sleazy mess in Trenton and fix it. Anybody got any ideas?\Vince Latchford BRICK\First, let's stop wasteful spending\The state could raise more money by stopping the waste and irresponsible spending that occurs in every department, bar none.\Example: Why do we need private street sweepers going up and down highways (10 trucks at a time) to sweep the state highways during the fall season, when weeks later sand will be used for icing conditions. The only one getting rich is the contractor.\This is just one little example of the huge waste. There are thousands more. Stop the crying on our shoulders to pay for the state's incompetence. Everyone should say ""no"" to the gas tax. If the department heads can't do it, replace them. Enough is enough.\The Press highlighted the political payoffs. Now let's highlight the incompetence at every level of state government.\Werner Fuerbacher MONMOUTH BEACH\Act to avoid federal penalty\State transportation officials will soon be increasing the gasoline tax to continue road and rail projects. They acknowledge there are no alternatives.\Wait just one minute, Mr. Tax Man. Here's a novel idea for the political foot-draggers in Trenton. The federal government put New Jersey on notice in May advising that if New Jersey did not adopt the .08 percent blood alcohol standard by the end of September, the state would lose 2 percent of its federal highway construction money, a penalty that will increase to 8 percent by 2008. New Jersey stands to lose $7.2 million next year, and $28.7 million annually by 2008 if it does not adopt the new .08 standard. All this information was reported in the Press May 6.\Do our lawmakers thumb their noses at the federal government? Do they even read the newspaper? How ironic that it is almost six months after the article ran, and almost two months beyond the federal mandate, and our friends in Trenton once again have their hands in our pockets, and continue to give us lame excuses and no alternatives.\Tim Baranyay MANCHESTER\Tax hike to show how we can suffer\It is about time that New Jersey stopped being a laggard in auto gasoline prices. We already have the highest cost for property taxes and auto insurance and probably a few other things, why not gasoline?\Let's raise the tax and show the rest of the country we can suffer more than they can. Go to it, politicians.\Charles R. Rumpler LAVALLETTE"

331,"WASHINGTON - New Jersey's congressional delegation is seeking hundreds of millions in federal aid for dozens of transportation projects, but some delegation members say they won't support an across-the-board increase in the gas tax to pay for them.\Several lawmakers from the Garden State say now is not the time to raise fuel prices in the midst of a sluggish economy.\""There are many (transportation) needs ... especially in New Jersey. However, an increased gas tax in this economic environment is a nonstarter,"" said Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-11th Dist. ""We will continue to make choices and set priorities within existing resources.""\At the same time, members are submitting requests for funding a number of priorities, including a new Hudson River tunnel that could cost $1 billion, multimillion-dollar improvements up and down the Garden State Parkway, and a new $40 million interchange in Marlton.\The requests are being submitted as part of Congress' reauthorization of highway and mass-transit funding that will steer billions to road and rail projects through the end of the decade. House members from all 50 states are requesting money to pay for some 5,300 road and transit projects nationwide that collectively would cost about $500 billion, according to a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\The following is how much is being requesting for specific projects:\* Mae Brook Bridge (Route 130) in North Brunswick: replacement of bridge over Lawrence Brook - $2.25 million\* Route 18/Route 1 improvements in New Brunswick: includes roadway repairs, new collector road and reconstruction of interchanges - $155 million\* Lake Avenue bridge replacement in Metuchen: new four-lane span for Route 27 over the South Plainfield Branch - $3.31 million\* Old Bridge intermodal station and commuter parking lot: construction of a new regional bus/rail facility off the Garden State Parkway - $22 million"

335,"WASHINGTON - Congress is poised to approve an emergency infusion of $8 billion into a federal highway fund, a move that would prevent states from delaying or canceling hundreds of road projects.\The money is meant to plug a shortfall in the federal highway trust fund, an account states have counted on for more than 50 years to help pay for transportation projects large and small. If the problem isn't corrected, New Jersey stands to lose $300 million next year, according to Kris Kolluri, the state's transportation commissioner. The 2009 fiscal year begins Oct. 1. The Senate approved the House-passed bill last night by unanimous consent, meaning no roll call was taken. That action came after Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., removed his ""hold"" on the bill. A hold is a procedure that allows senators to block any legislation for any reason. The House has to pass it again because the Senate made minor changes to the original legislation, passed in July by a vote of 387-37. The House is expected to re-approve the legislation today and send it to the White House. Though he threatened to veto the original bill, President Bush plans to sign it. Last week, Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said the trust fund could run out of money by the end of this month. She blamed the shortfall primarily on Congress' penchant to siphon money from the trust fund for transportation ""earmarks,"" or pet projects in lawmakers' districts. Transportation officials outside the administration say the biggest problem is dwindling gas-tax revenue. Though fuel-efficient vehicles, which Americans are driving in greater numbers, are good for the environment they don't need to be filled up as often. That means there's less money flowing into the highway account, which is funded by a federal tax of 18.4 cents for each gallon of gas motorists purchase. People are also driving less, period, because of high gas prices. Many experts say the federal tax - which has remained unchanged for some 15 years - needs to be increased. But that's unlikely to happen because lawmakers know such a move carries great political risk. States levy their own gas taxes to pay for road projects, often at higher rates than Washington. However, New Jersey's gas tax is among the lowest in the country - 14.5 cents per gallon."

337,"We see lawn signs and newspaper articles thanking health care workers and first responders for all they do. This show of appreciation is well deserved by those individuals and is a great morale booster for them during these times.\It can be hard to remember all of those we rely on for help. Unfortunately, sometimes the ones we depend on the most are those we unintentionally take for granted. The few times retail workers have been thanked comes across as an afterthought. Not to prioritize the importance of our county's diverse retail employees, but unequivocally, without supermarket employees providing the essential foods needed daily by health care workers and first responders, hospitals would be shuttered and sirens wouldn't blare.\These workers deal with hundreds of customers daily, putting themselves at a much higher risk than most essential workers of catching and transmitting the virus — an emotional drain in itself. It also has caused them to make personal sacrifices. One such supermarket employee, whom I'll call ""TK,"" has always been armed with an infectious ear-to-ear smile when greeting customers, followed by a cheerful ""hi,"" guaranteeing to brighten their day. Should a conversation develop, you soon realize you're talking to the world's proudest grandma.\Since the pandemic started, her biggest sacrifice is to stop the daily hugs and kisses her young grandchildren wait for all day, fearing she could infect them. This sacrifice, along with the emotional drain of being in a high-risk work environment, has dimmed that great smile.\Maybe in the near future, health care workers, first responders and shoppers can reciprocate by showing their gratitude and help boost the morale of supermarket employees by doing a drive-by with a big ""thank you"" sign.\Tris Tristram\Hampton\Yes, there are bad apples in the police, as in any profession. Overall, considering the very difficult and dangerous job that many policemen have to perform, they perform well, and deal with the public in a courteous way.\Yes, the unfortunate death of George Floyd is making the headlines, but it is masking the thousands of courteous interchanges that police have with the public.\Being a policeman, especially in a bad neighborhood, is a tough and dangerous job.\Overreaction, and cries of police brutality, are not warranted.\Ralph Pincus\Paramus\While we are all complaining about the backroom change to the turnpike and parkway tolls, there is another even more onerous tax coming. With the economy shut down and much less traffic, the gas tax collections are way down. The provision that this tax needed to generate a stated amount cannot be met. The result will be another gas tax increase that will probably be 10 cents per gallon or higher, affecting every driver in the state.\George Tomko\Westwood"
338,"It doesn't matter that Governor Whitman has a record as a tax-cutter, most voters wonder what she's done for them lately, according to a poll released Monday.\Perhaps voters are smarting over Whitman's failed attempt to raise the gasoline tax to fund land preservation, or it's a normal voter response to questions about taxes _ the perennial political thorn, said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute.\More than half of those polled said they were unhappy with Whitman's handling of taxes _ an amount equal to a March poll.\""The low rating seems ironic for a woman who was elected after promising to cut taxes and then she cut them,"" Carroll said. ""People just don't like to pay taxes.""\Carroll said Whitman was ""probably on the wrong side"" of a bill, killed by state lawmakers last month, to increase the gas tax 4 cents a gallon.\But overall most voters approve of Whitman's performance.\Fifty-six percent of those surveyed like what Whitman is doing, while 38 percent said they were dissatisfied. The poll mirrors one conducted in April when 58 percent said they approved and 37 percent expressed disapproval.\In the poll, 38 percent of voters said they strongly opposed the gas tax increase while 23 percent said they ardently supported it. The rest said they were lukewarm about the proposed tax. Whitman was undaunted by the results.\""She's someone who has cut taxes 17 times during her administration,"" said Whitman spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor. ""She realizes that property tax reform is needed in the state. That's why she created a property tax commission, which will report back to her at the end of this month.""\Voters were split on Whitman's management of the budget, with 49 percent saying she does a good job handling it and 42 percent expressing dissatisfaction. Whitman signed an $18.1 billion state budget in June.\Whitman got high marks _ 63 percent _ for her approach to the economy and jobs and even higher marks for her position on the environment.\About 66 percent said they like what she's doing to keep the Garden State green while 23 percent did not. The favorable rating comes just after state lawmakers embraced Whitman's plan to dedicate $98 million a year from the budget toward preserving open space.\The poll also indicated New Jersey voters don't think Whitman would make a viable candidate for vice president. Only 20 percent of state voters said they would be more likely to vote Republican if Whitman were on the ballot for the national slot in 2000. About 29 percent said they would be less likely to vote Republican and 46 percent said it would make no difference.\""She doesn't look so hot,"" Carroll said. ""The poll shows she can't deliver her own state. . . . {Republicans} should take a long look at her and decide whether she's a plus or a minus.""\O'Connor repeated Whitman's mantra that she isn't interested in a job in Washington: ""Her focus is on New Jersey.""\Half of the state's voters said Sen. Frank Lautenberg is doing a good job on behalf of New Jersey and 42 percent said they were pleased with Sen. Robert Torricelli's performance. Both are Democrats.\The poll was conducted from July 29 to Aug. 4. It surveyed 613 New Jersey residents who said they were registered voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent."

The temperature's getting hot, and so is the energy-policy debate. Gas prices are reaching new heights as anyone with a car knows. What are we going to do about it? Apparently, nothing serious.
\
Republican presidential candidate John McCain has taken out ads on the National Review Online site pushing his silly gas-tax holiday. A gas-tax holiday may be a fun, cheap marketing gimmick, but it's not a solution.
\
McCain, like the Democrat he will run against, opposes a real solution: Drilling here.
\
Unfortunately, it's largely those on the outside looking in who are most passionately advocating that we review our domestic resources. Drilling alone won't do it, but it's a practical start.
\
Thus far, the debate about accessing those resources closest to home has focused on Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR). Congress ridiculously refuses to green-light the project. I say ""ridiculous"" because concerns about preserving the vast swaths of nature and the caribou there are not serious: Congress would be giving a go-ahead to oil exploration on 2,000 -- or 0.01 percent -- of ANWR's 19 million acres, which can supply 5 percent of America's oil per year for 12 years, according to the U.S. Energy Department.
\
""Drill here"" has become a mantra on conservative talk radio. As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich puts it: ""Drill Here. Drill Now. Pay Less."" Gingrich is collecting signatures on a petition that reads, ""We, therefore, the undersigned citizens of the United States, petition the U.S. Congress to act immediately to lower gasoline prices by authorizing the exploration of proven energy reserves to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources from unstable countries.""
\
Meanwhile, we hear sad high-gas-price stories such as that of Nevada's Clark County School District: With a 62 percent budget expenditure increase due largely to the price of gas, the school district has cut its bus route and stops to reduce costs. According to the Department of Transportation, Americans are driving less.
\
It's no wonder that Gallup reports that a majority of Americans support ""drilling in U.S. coastal and wilderness areas now off limits."" Unlike Congress, where Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters wants to ""socialize"" the oil industry, Americans don't blame oil companies for the high prices. According to Gallup, ""The number of Americans who blame oil companies for the high price of gasoline has decreased from 34 percent to 20 percent.""
\
But don't expect Congress to pull out its power tools any time soon. Right now, the momentum is with America's Climate Security Act of 2007, a bill sponsored by Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia. According to the Heritage Foundation, the bill ""would likely be -- by far -- the most expensive environmental undertaking in history."" As Heritage describes it, the Warner-Lieberman Bill ""extracts trillions of dollars from the millions of American energy consumers and delivers this wealth to permanently identified classes of recipients, such as tribal groups and preferred technology sectors, while largely circumventing the normal congressional appropriations process.""
\
The legislation is a perilous road with high costs -- costs Americans tell pollsters they don't want to pay. But Congress is poised to go its own way, skipping over simpler, more promising steps that cost less, such as unleashing America's reserves. Instead, we go on with the absurd scene of President Bush going to Saudi Arabia with his hands out. America is an entrepreneurial nation with resources. We should not be punishing energy users and embracing regulation over ingenuity and incentives.
\
McCain, Lieberman, Warner and everyone else should take a deep breath and listen to Bjorn Lomborg, author of ""Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming"" (Knopf, 2007), who says the legislation before Congress ""looks set to be a massive subsidy-fest that would achieve very little for the environment, at great cost.""
\
Lomborg says that instead of frenzied regulations and expenditures, ""We need the technological solutions that will allow our societies to transition cost-effectively to low-carbon energy by mid-century. McCain could recognize that this is a century-long problem which needs century-long, smart solutions.""
\
In other words -- cool it. Drop the gimmicks. Stop getting freaked out by Al Gore. Let's be smart and think creatively rather than as a conventional pack of frenzied followers.

340,"The prices of all goods will rise after toll hikes kick in, because higher costs to truck goods will mean higher prices in stores.\New Jersey then will collect more sales tax on the taxable nonessential goods.\JOE HERIG\Wall Township\Toll hikes hard sell at shore\I recently read an article stating that 59 percent of New Jerseyans oppose the governor's toll hike plan, and I was completely shocked because I can't believe that there are actually people in this state supporting this idea.\Have these supporters lost their minds or have they just given up? The only people who would understandingly support this toll tax - and let's be honest, it is just another tax - are people who never drive on toll roads, people who are exempt from paying tolls or people who are being rewarded for their support.\I can honestly say that I am not a frequent driver of toll roads but, as a middle-income taxpayer, I am taxed out and fed up. Unlike the state government, I cannot increase my earnings; worse yet, I cannot cut my spending any more than I have. There is just nowhere else for me to cut back.\The only option that I now have is to pack up my family and leave New Jersey. Why should I have to do that because the governor that I voted for is unable to fulfill his campaign promises to cut spending?\I agree that Gov. Corzine inherited a massive debt that needed to be paid off but, as the saying goes, you can't draw blood from a stone. New Jersey's middle- and low-income families simply cannot afford another tax or expense of any kind.\If this toll hike plan does not pass, the governor has mentioned raising the gas tax. Is New Jersey not allowed to have any sort of tax that is cheaper than the national average or do we have to be the highest in every category?\If this toll hike does pass, then congratulations to the governor. This will have supposedly managed to cut the New Jersey debt by half. But Corzine should not pat himself on the back too hard. It seems that during his tenure, he completely failed in making this state one bit more affordable to live in.\MICHAEL ROTHENBERG\Belmar\Other taxes less burdensome\Gov. Corzine's plan to reduce state debt by increasing tolls is foolhardy and places the burden of debt reduction on a relatively small population.\In addition, tolls are the most expensive and least efficient tax to collect because of the cost of salaries, collecting facilities, maintenance of toll and related buildings.\A fairer solution is to raise three existing taxes: sales, income and gasoline. These increases should be temporary, with automatic ""sunsets"" built into them. This solution balances the responsibility of reducing state debt on all New Jerseyans and out-of-staters a well. It also avoids the costly process of fees to law firms, bonding houses and interest that is in the governor's proposal to restructure debt by creating a public benefit corporation to issue new bonds.\The combination of cutting costs of state government and instituting appropriate and temporary increases in existing taxes would generate necessary funds to reduce state debt and interest charges over a finite period of time and would not place a 75-year yoke of debt on already burdened taxpayers.\RAYMOND G. NEVEIL\President\Citizens Against Tolls\Tinton Falls\Dimilin presents hazards to health\Recently residents of Jackson turned out in force to urge their Township Council to join in the state gypsy moth spray program using the safer pesticide Bt, not Dimilin. Other towns expressing similar support for the Bt program are Evesham, Medford, Brick and Toms River. When applied at the right time, Bt should give adequate protection from tree defoliation, while posing the least threat to human and ecological health.\The New Jersey Environmental Federation has been joined with 36 New Jersey environmental groups, including the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, the New Jersey Sierra Club, and the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, in opposing the state Department of Agriculture's proposed use of the chemical pesticide Dimilin, classified as a probable human carcinogen, in the state's Gypsy Moth Suppression Program. Dimilin is a broad spectrum synthetic chemical pesticide that is inappropriate for use in sensitive ecological environments such as the Pine Barrens of Burlington, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May counties. Even Bt, the biological pesticide currently used for gypsy moths, has nontarget effects on beneficial Lepodoptera that are active at the same time as gypsy moth caterpillars. Broad scale pesticide spraying is not the answer to pest problems. It only adds toxins to our state's environment that already suffers from chemical overexposure.\Who knows what the synergistic effects are on the ecosystem from all the chemicals in use today? Without adequate monitoring of the environment for how these chemicals affect nontarget organisms, we cannot support the use of broad spectrum chemicals in state- or municipal-funded programs. Citizens of New Jersey suffer high rates of cancer, birth defects and autism from chemicals in our environment. Please do not add to that burden by exposing us to yet another endocrine disruptor.\JANE NOGAKI\Pesticide Program\Coordinator\New Jersey\Environmental Federation\Marlton\Psychiatric care best in the home\We praise the Asbury Park Press for focusing on the troubling conditions at Ancora Psychiatric Institution and the state for making changes at the facility. Patients at psychiatric institutions deserve high-quality, effective and compassionate care.\As the article noted, overcrowding - prompted by the lack of affordable housing with appropriate services in the community - is at the core of the problem. Throughout New Jersey, hundreds of consumers have been waiting for more than a year, and some as long as five years, in psychiatric institutions for a life in the community. There are thousands more with mental illnesses living on the streets, in substandard housing or with elderly parents and may be only weeks away from a crisis and hospitalization because of insufficient community treatment.\Providing effective community services that can lead to a life of hope, wellness and recovery costs a fraction of institutional care and would save New Jersey millions annually.\It is time to end the wait for those seeking a life outside institutional walls.\DEBRA L.

341,"Days after Governor Christie introduced his budget goals for next year, questions remain about how to fund repairs and maintenance of New Jersey's roads, bridges, trains and buses.\The biggest unknowns include how the state will keep money flowing to the Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for construction projects and part of NJ Transit's operating budget, and whether NJ Transit will receive enough money to cover rising expenses without a second fare increase in as many years.\The governor's budget proposal calls for $2.485 billion for the transportation fund, with $1.3 billion of that money coming from the federal government, according to documents released by the administration. To qualify for such federal aid, New Jersey must provide funds of its own.\Neither officials in Christie's administration nor the Legislature know yet where that money will come from. ""The budget doesn't contemplate that at all at this point,"" acting state Treasurer Ford Scudder said Thursday. ""There's nothing in there for a 2017 program.""\But they must figure it out by June 30, when the fund runs out of money for new projects and a balanced state budget is due. Amid conversations about changes in tax policy to offset an increase in the motor fuels tax, which helps support the transportation fund, administration officials said they are now waiting for the Legislature to put forward its own plan.\""We continue to await a proposal from the Legislature on this, and certainly welcome a conversation that involves tax fairness for the people of New Jersey,"" said Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for Christie.\For their part, leading Democrats say they're trying to read between the lines of Christie's proposal to see what kind of funding mechanism he would support.\The budget summary released Tuesday does spell out some details. The governor proposes expanding the Transportation Trust Fund by $337 million. That includes $350 million in additional money from the federal government, while the amount contributed by the state would decrease by $22.4 million. (The fact that these two numbers do not equal a net increase of $337 million is not explained in the document.)\New Jersey is on track to receive more money from the surface transportation bill passed by Congress in December. But the state's estimated apportionment is scheduled to increase by just $70 million, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, shy of Christie's $350 million goal.\In addition to the federal money, New Jersey must fund its share - at least $1.17 billion - from scratch. The fund receives $516 million a year from a tax on motor fuels, plus revenue from other sources including a fee on vehicle sales.\All of that money is already spent, however, and by June 30 there will be nothing left for transportation projects because every cent will be dedicated to repaying the fund's $30 billion debt, officials and lawmakers have said.\Christie, a Republican, together with state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, both Democrats, have spoken in recent months of a grand tax compromise, in which a gas tax increase for the Transportation Trust Fund would be offset by a reduction or elimination of the estate tax. New revenue from a higher gas tax could be supplemented by additional borrowing to raise the $1.17 billion that Christie said is necessary next year.\Summary 'confusing'\""The budget summary is always very confusing,"" said Janna Chernetz, New Jersey policy director for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group for transportation in the region.\The governor's budget summary does not mention a total proposed budget for NJ Transit. Transportation experts did find the document encouraging, however. Many had predicted a difficult year for the agency, with a large budget deficit and a correspondingly large fare hike.\Instead, Christie proposes increasing the subsidy from the state general fund to NJ Transit from $33 million this year to $127.7 million in 2017. That's still less than half the subsidy of $309.4 million that NJ Transit received as recently as 2012. In recent years, Christie has tapped different sources to fill the gap, including $295 million in toll revenue from the Turnpike Authority meant originally for a rail tunnel under the Hudson River, which Christie canceled in 2010.\For next year, Christie proposes reducing the turnpike's subsidy to $208 million. And he hopes to continue last year's practice of transferring $62 million from the Clean Energy Fund to NJ Transit, which many environmentalists oppose. The fund was created in 1999 using a fee tacked onto utility bills to pay for solar panels and energy efficiency projects in homes and businesses.\""You're stealing from ratepayers to keep the trains and buses running,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey. ""We need a long-term funding source, not another raid.""\Even after those funds are tapped, Chernetz wonders whether it will be enough. NJ Transit faces rising costs in 2017, including higher maintenance payments for the Northeast Corridor, a $20 million pay raise for its unionized bus workers and another potential raise for its train employees, who have worked without a new contract for five years. Altogether that could leave a budget gap of $60 million, Chernetz said, on par with the deficit last year that forced NJ Transit to increase fares 9 percent.\""It's encouraging,"" Chernetz said of increased state subsidies for the mass transit agency, ""but it's still not meeting NJ Transit's operating needs.""\Email: maag@northjersey.com\Sidebar: \Transportation budget in brief\Governor Christie's transportation budget proposal for 2017 shows an anticipated increase in funding from the federal government.\Transportation Trust Fund\Spending by Transportation Trust Fund : FY 2016 : Proposed FY 2017\Provided by New Jersey : $1.19B : $1.17B\Provided by federal government : $960M : $1.31B\Total: $2.15B : $2.48B\NJ Transit\Direct state subsidy for NJ Transit : $33M : $127.7M\Transfers from Turnpike Authority to NJ Transit : $295M : $208M\Transfers from Clean Energy Fund to NJ Transit : $62.1M : $62.1M\Credit: Email: maag@northjersey.com"
342,"New Jersey has far too many bears\Regarding ""Targeting the bears of October"" (Page L-1, March 4):\As the owner of a second home in Highland Lakes, I can only say that the bears have learned, and will continue to learn, to stay out of shooting areas during the hunt. They are smart and will do anything to survive.\What a hunt will do, especially in October, will be to force the bears into rural community areas that are off limits to hunting. This will only increase the likelihood of human-bear encounters. In my opinion, the bear population needs to be reduced by professionally trapping them during the summer. They then should be humanely euthanized or sterilized and released. Having a modest bear population is a good thing; overpopulation is a bad thing.\Nick Albano\Union City, March 4\Exxon deal bad for New Jersey\Regarding ""Lawmakers question Exxon deal"" (Page A-3, March 5):\It looks like Governor Christie is letting his ambition get in the way of common sense. I was a happy supporter of Christie, but no more. He has proven over and over again that his agendas are much more important than good government.\I guess New Jersey wasn't enough of a challenge for him, because somewhere along the line he felt comfortable taking on the responsibilities of chairman of the Republican Governors Association, a position that over-inflated an already over-the-top ego. Add to that his likely run for president, and he immediately transformed into a candidate rather than a governor.\Most egregious to New Jersey is this ridiculous proposed settlement with Exxon Mobil. Can anyone read between the lines? Exxon is liable for a maximum penalty of $8.9 billion, but the state seems willing to settle for a mere $225 million. Do you think Exxon is celebrating?\When will we, the public, see real justice against outlandish, under-the-table agreements that benefit no one except those who aspire to political office?\Paul Ferrantino\Wanaque, March 5\Preserve history in Bloomingdale\One of the important issues in Bloomingdale is a proposal to rezone a large part of extraordinarily environmentally sensitive and historically significant land on Federal Hill to allow a company to quarry and destroy it.\When I was chairman of the Bloomingdale Environmental Commission, state taxpayers preserved more than 104 acres of Federal Hill by purchasing 35 acres for $650,000 in 2002 and 69 acres for $1.1 million in 2004. In addition to containing four types of wetlands, threatened and endangered species, and ruggedly steep slopes, Federal Hill was the site of the Pompton Mutiny in the winter of 1781. The mutiny was put down by troops sent by George Washington and two of its leaders were executed and buried on the site. Archaeological research also shows that Federal Hill was the site of extensive occupation by Native Americans.\It's inconceivable that Bloomingdale would sacrifice this significant Revolutionary War historic site and risk incalculable environmental damage in a ratable chase. Equally inconceivable is the idea of building affordable housing on this remote site adjacent to a quarry where health, respiratory and seismographic damage never has been measured. According to the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, this unwise use of land is unprecedented.\Residents can help stop the destruction of our natural resources by contacting Bloomingdale's mayor and council to insist that our history, environment, open spaces and, most importantly, our clean water is always protected.\John Capozucca\Bloomingdale, March 2\Gas-tax increase may be inevitable\For a few fleeting moments it appeared that the beleaguered New Jersey taxpayer would get a break.\The price of oil plunged, gas prices dropped, and alas, we have more disposable income in our pockets. But entering the picture is the bankrupt Transportation Trust Fund and the inevitability of a gas-tax increase at just the right time to take back that windfall.\In case anyone hasn't noticed, gas prices already have climbed more than 27 percent since their lows of a month ago. So when the smoke clears, the New Jersey consumer may be back from where he started, if not worse.\That is yet another reason why New Jersey ranks No. 1 in people leaving the state.\Patrick Romano\Hasbrouck Heights, March 2\Racial equality remains elusive\Regarding ""Defining hate crimes"" (Editorials, Feb. 26):\Once again, justice was not served, at least through the eyes of the African-American community. As tiresome as we have grown from the Trayvon Martin case, the U.S. Justice Department announced this week that it is giving up the pursuit of federal charges against George Zimmerman for committing a ""hate crime.""\The department had no chance in winning this case and I believe it was aware of it the entire time. This was simply an attempt to gain some satisfaction from the black community by making it seem as if it was going to find something to hold Zimmerman accountable for.\Considering that I am a young black male it is hard not to look at this case in a biased manner. In the end, I do not view this as a hate crime but rather a situation where inequality was obviously evident throughout the entire process.\This is becoming a pattern for young African-American males as we witnessed in the cases of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. This has nothing to do with being racist, but it has everything to do with being treated equally.\Joshua Gray\Erial, March 3\Liberals out to get Gov. Scott Walker\Regarding ""Failing to speak up against incivility"" (Other Views, Feb. 24):\Washington Post Columnist Dana Milbank and other liberals ripping Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker see him as the front-runner for the GOP nomination; therefore he has to be destroyed.

343,"The race in the 5th District\As a resident of the 5th Congressional District, I find my mailbox filled with communications from the two campaigns.\Generally it gets a glance and goes right to the recycling bin.\But a recent one from the state Democratic Committee was different, featuring three pictures on the front; a black-and-white of a Ku Klux Klan march from who knows how long ago, a picture of David Duke with a Confederate flag, and a picture of Rep. Scott Garrett, R-Wantage, in a congressional hearing.\Like Garrett or not, this ad is totally repugnant and demonstrates exactly why ordinary citizens hold our political class in such low regard. Then I heard a Garrett commercial bringing up a past harassment issue with opponent Josh Gottheimer. Both ads were put out by party operations and not PACs. Clearly this contest, like our presidential contest, is another ""dumpster fire.""\Do the people who put out this trash ever think about what this does to the electorate?

Muti leaves out the most important reason Christie's presidential campaign imploded: He does not have core domestic and foreign policy principles that he deeply believes in.\Throughout his political career, Christie has been on both sides of key issues, including gun ownership restrictions, taxes and school spending. But more troubling was his belligerent foreign policy views during the campaign, namely that the U.S. government should continue intervening in the Middle East. In other words, the governor has been a consummate politician, holding up his fingers to see where the wind is blowing and crafting his message to the public.\As a former mayor, Muti should realize that governing is about horse trading -- giving up something to get something. The 23-cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax is one of the few things the state government gets right, that is, charge a fee for the use of a service.\The gas tax is really a user fee, similar to cellphone, cable and scores of other fees we pay to obtain services in the marketplace.\The increase could have been avoided if previous governors had increased it by a penny a year for the last 30 years, which would have eliminated the need to borrow to pay for transportation projects.\Murray Sabrin\Fort Lee, Oct. 17\The writer is a professor of finance at Ramapo College.\The problem with Cuban cigars\Regarding ""Cuban smokes"" (Editorials, Oct. 17):\Cigars cause cancer; a 10-year-old knows that.

Everyone generally understands that the media tend to favor Democratic candidates; however, there is something quite different going on this time around.\Up until this year, I never felt that the media coverage was not fair or principled. Now, on a daily basis, I am presented with news stories that read like op-ed pieces, with opinions presented as news. The bashing of Donald Trump has been unrelenting and unfair, including repeated calls for him to drop out of the race and also calls for Mike Pence to drop off the ticket in order to stop Trump.\Trump has renewed his complaints of a ""rigged"" election, and while I am not sure the word ""rigged"" is appropriate, I understand what he means as related to the media. In my view, the print media are having a field day reporting the recent unsubstantiated allegations against Trump while at the same time lambasting him for his allegations against Hillary Clinton.\You are turning Trump into a sympathetic character, a David up against a Goliath. How about stopping all this nonsense, reporting the news factually and fairly, and relegating the opinions to the op-ed pages, where they belong?\Alan Molin\Totowa, Oct. 17\Why does Obama back Clinton?\With all of the past divisiveness between them, I finally figured out President Obama's motive for his strong backing of Hillary Clinton's presidential run.

At the same time, all six of them supported increased spending on every initiative mentioned, with no mention of how to pay for them or what the impact on taxes would be. They were more than happy to pander to the voters' fantasy of having more services and lower taxes.\Only Libertarian Party candidate Pete Rohrman was willing to talk specifics about cutting spending, including selling Bergen Regional Medical Center, phasing out taxpayer funding for Bergen Community College and opposing any increases in non-mandatory spending.\Erol Sirimoglu\Lodi, Oct. 17\Hoping for bear hunt to end soon\Regarding ""Bear hunt foes riled"" (Page L-1, Oct. 16):\I am happy about the high turnout at last Saturday's protest of the black bear hunt, and relieved the hunt is over, at least for now. Sadly, until black bears are cut off from unnatural food sources such as trash and birdseed, they will continue to be fat and happy and breed like mad.\I believe that's what the state wants, as more bears mean more targets for hunters each fall. If this were not the case, it would pay more than just lip service to trash management and feeding bans.\A protester is quoted as ""getting tired of doing this,"" in reference to yearly bear hunt protests. I am still hoping a change for the better is in the offing for our black bears sooner rather than later, because I am also very tired of bear hunts and the grief that goes with them.\Philip Yturbe\West Milford, Oct. 16"
344," Time to end culture of hazing\ I am outraged that Judge Robert J. Conway is charging the Mepham, Long Island, teenagers accused of brutal acts of violence as children and not adults.\ We must end this prevalent culture that makes it OK to engage in such hazings and OK to abuse other students, even when this abuse is verbal.\ Conway should have realized the severity of this incident.\ If the boys are found guilty, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Americans must show that they will not tolerate rape, assault, and abuse.\ Josh Isralowitz\ Rutherford, Nov. 21\ ***\ Don Bosco's dream denied\ Sports columnist Adrian Wojnarowski had it right when he proclaimed that small minds combined to prevent Don Bosco's football team from playing a dream High School National Championship game (""Small minds combine to sink Don Bosco's big game dream,"" S-1, Nov. 27).\ What a crying shame that it not only prevented Bergen County but New Jersey football to be showcased across the country.\ Was it jealousy? Was it fear that the ones who voted against this game were upset that their recruiting programs would be in jeopardy? This team is recognized as being one of the best to ever come out of New Jersey.\ Coach Greg Toal has created a powerhouse in a very short time and is to be congratulated, not despised, for his success.\ John D'Angelo\ Mahwah, Nov. 27\ ***\ Banana republic mentality\ Latin American countries' reliance on banana crops for economic aid teaches us the consequences of a sector held hostage by a one- crop economy: Competition is absent, innovation is stifled, and workers find themselves victims of their employer's whims. But when that one-crop economy is putting food on your table, it can be tempting to forget the hard lessons of the past.\ Here in New Jersey, organized labor faces a challenge reminiscent of the banana republics: Will we quietly support the monopoly Verizon, or will we fight for a competitive marketplace?\ Unions with a strong tradition of working with Verizon say we should support our longtime employer; others see a history of broken promises and a bleak future for our workers if we continue to defend the monopolies.\ With the state Board of Public Utilities enforcing federal competition rules through reasonable interim wholesale rates, New Jersey consumers could realize nearly $382 million in savings this year.\ Competition is also creating jobs in the telecom industry. But Verizon is trying to put pressure on the BPU to change sound policy decisions that ignite competition in the local telephone market, crying that it cannot fairly compete in this environment.\ The real story is that Verizon is pulling out all the stops to hang on to its dominant position. This includes outsourcing jobs outside of New Jersey and coming up with schemes to automate work.\ For workers, our choice is to embrace the future. By giving an honest assessment of Verizon to the BPU, we can help to bring about a truly competitive marketplace that will end our banana republic dependency on one abusive employer.\ Keith Misciagna\ Paramus, Nov. 26\ The writer is a business agent for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 164.\ ***\ Gas-tax promises\ Governor McGreevey will no doubt endorse the increase in our gas tax. The last time it was increased, I remember the promises to improve our roads. Let McGreevey drive westbound on Route 4 from Hackensack Avenue in Hackensack to Route 17 in Paramus, especially the right lane. It could be used as a movie set for the Ho Chi Minh trail.\ Alfred Noto\ Upper Saddle River, Nov. 21\ ***\ Legal religious expression\ As December arrives, perhaps it would help to clarify the forms of religious expression that are legal under the Constitution under today's sometimes confusing case law:\ Students are free to express their religious beliefs in school. So long as it's not materially disruptive, students may express their beliefs verbally with phrases like ""Merry Christmas,"" through clothing that conveys religious messages, or through written materials like school assignments, religious cards, gifts, or tracts given to teachers and classmates.\ At school, students can sing Christmas carols at concerts, teach the biblical origins of Christmas, and perform the story of the Nativity. The Constitution does not require the exclusion of religion from public institutions.\ Christmas is ingrained in our culture; therefore, expression of it through art, music, and teaching of it as history serves both a religious and secular purpose.\ These activities can be conducted in public schools without creating an Establishment Clause problem, provided they promote the advancement of the students' knowledge of our cultural and religious heritage, as well as give students a chance to perform a full range of music, poetry, and drama.\ Nativity displays can be placed in schools, parks, and government buildings. No Supreme Court decision has ever forbidden a private citizen from setting up a Nativity display in a public park. Nor can private citizens be forced to include non-religious objects such as snowmen in their faith-based displays.\ Even under current decisions, city governments may include a Nativity in a seasonal display provided there is a sufficient number of secular objects along with the religious ones; the secular objects are in close proximity to the religious ones, and overall, the display is sufficiently secular.\ The Constitution, laws, and court decisions are all constructed to protect and permit religious expression in both public schools and government buildings. So, attempts to remove Christ from Christmas do not stem from the Constitution, but from those who simply seek to silence the Christian message. And that is a violation of the Constitution.\ Anthony Cerbo\ Fairview, Nov. 7\ ***\ A need for change in Mideast policy\ I would like to respond to those reacting to ""On Changing Mideast Policy"" (Your Views, Nov. 9):\ There is a need for fundamental change in U.S. Mideast policy, though most American Jews and neo-conservatives believe it should remain the same: biased toward Israel and thus unable to seriously get the Palestinians to the table or to get support from the region's Arab neighbors.\ There has been a lack of evenhandedness when dealing with the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Israelis do whatever they want in the occupied territories and receive virtually no criticism from the United States. Any official criticism in the United Nations is vetoed by the United States.\ Israel is not undertaking the financial burden of constructing its security wall; the United Sates is paying the $2 million-a-mile for the 370-mile-long wall and fence, despite its condemnation by the international community.\ If one is to cite Yasser Arafat for being responsible for bloodshed and misery, then one must include Ariel Sharon, who has as much Palestinian blood on his hands as Arafat has Israeli blood on his.\ While there is no justification for killing innocent people on either side, the terrorist attacks on the part of Palestinian groups is indeed a reaction against social, political, economic, and military oppression.\ The new neo-conservative policy of pre-emptive attacks (on Muslim nations) means that Israel can simply sit back while the United States attacks and topples one Muslim regime after another. Even criticism of Israel has become in American politics tantamount to terrorism; even innocent donations to Palestinian charities may be grounds for investigation into ""terrorist"" activities.\ Bradford Furman\ Fort Lee, Nov. 13\ ***\ 'Typical Arab propaganda'\ In ""Heartening comments by Bush?"" (Your Views, Nov. 24), the writer presents the typical Arab propaganda. He states that the root of the Arab-Israel conflict is the Israeli settlements on the West Bank and Gaza.\ The root of the conflict is the refusal of the Arab world to accept the right of Israel to exist.\ Israel, like the United States, has every right to defend itself against the vicious terrorists who target Israeli women and children.\ Between 1948 and 1967 there were no Israelis in the West Bank or Gaza, yet the Arab terrorists carried out numerous raids, killing 1,000 Israelis and injuring over 10,000 during that period.\ American support for Israel is one of the noblest things we do. Arab terror is a cancer that all free people must continue to fight.\ Robert B. Yudin\ Wyckoff, Nov. 25"
345,"Wary about raising state gas tax\Regarding ""Bridges need fixing, but how will state pay?"" (Page A-1, Feb. 4):\John Cichowski's Road Warrior column seemed to indicate that raising the gasoline tax was required in order to fix much of New Jersey's crumbling transportation infrastructure, and that may well be the case. However, before any tax is increased, there must be sufficient due diligence by our elected officials and newspapers to determine why and how the fund this tax feeds came to be in such dire straits.\Surely, nobody would be expected to contribute more to a flawed program, would they? How do we know our hard-earned dollars are not being misdirected to a politician's pet project or lining the pocket of a dishonest contractor or official somewhere?\Mom always counseled not to ""throw good money after bad,"" so I would like to know what went wrong and make sure it is fixed so it won't happen again.\We all deserve to see the results of an audit that accounts for where the funds went, who determined what projects to spend them on and what companies and organizations benefited from them.\From the articles lately, one would be hard-pressed to believe that the Routes 3 and 4 bridges over the Hackensack River were in better shape just a short time ago than they are now. That naturally leads one to question whether there has been malfeasance at play.\Henry Pfeiffer\Glen Rock, Feb. 4\*\Regarding ""Bridges need fixing, but how will state pay?"" (Page A-1, Feb. 4):\There seems to be much talk of late about raising the state's gas tax, but, of course, we need to sell that to the public.\Consequently, I find it most interesting that many bridges are suddenly being found with so many problems. It seems they have all of a sudden developed cracks in their structural steel all over the place, plus who knows what else.\Aren't these bridges inspected on a regular basis and maintained? Or is this just a ploy or a scare tactic to dupe the public into compliance?\What is the state doing with the millions currently collected at the pumps? The state needs many things. Increased taxes most certainly isn't one of them.\Nicholas Lindemulder\Wayne, Feb. 4\*\Regarding raising the state's gasoline tax, I think most people would conclude that a user's tax is probably the fairest and most logical way to go. It spreads the burden of supporting the roadway infrastructure to all of those who use New Jersey roads. I would have no problem supporting a doubling of the tax to 28 cents per gallon provided a few common-sense things occur.\First, our legislative leaders must guarantee that all money raised would go exclusively toward highway projects and not be siphoned off to other pet projects or diverted to other areas of the state budget.\Second, stop borrowing money to finance the Transportation Trust Fund. Once the current $18.2 billion debt is paid down, borrow only if an emergency leaves no other recourse.\If it means putting the brakes on new construction for a while, so be it. Continue to triage and monitor current deterioration conditions. The engineers will know how to prioritize the repair list in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.\Also under no circumstances use public funds to pay for roadway projects in support of privately funded commercial projects such as what is about to unfold in the Meadowlands area regarding the American Dream project. Let large developers incur the expense of building the roads they need to support their businesses, and not the public.\Joseph Cofone\Paramus, Feb. 5\Demarest schools need renovation\After assessing district needs, fiscal impact, forming an ad-hoc committee of community members and engaging in lengthy public discussion, the Demarest Board of Education determined that a ballot measure addressing long-term district needs was in the best interests of the community.\Demarest has earned a reputation as one of the highest-performing districts in New Jersey. In order to continue to serve our children well, now and into the future, and recognizing the impact that school quality has on the community, the following improvements are needed at our district schools:\County Road School needs significant repair and renovation to the infrastructure, which has not been done since 1970. Maintenance and Band-Aid repairs are creating a drain on district resources. The ballot measure will effectively alleviate this issue.\At Luther Lee Elementary School, four new classrooms and the repurposing of four existing classrooms would provide adequate instructional space for all levels of learners for necessary educational programs.\Our Demarest Middle School does not have a regulation-size gym, creating limited participation in physical education classes on a daily basis. Some 20 percent of physical education opportunities are missed due to scheduling conflicts involving plays, assemblies and the like.\Technological advances occur almost daily. What was once the work of science fiction has now become reality. Wi-Fi technology, interactive SmartBoards, 3-D printers, and the easy exchange of information in a collaborative learning environment has revolutionized learning.\Our responsibility as educators is to prepare our students for lifelong academic success, physical and emotional wellness and career success for the 21st century. We must invest in the future of our children now.\The referendum is Tuesday, and I remind residents to please vote.\Michael Fox\Demarest, Feb. 3\The writer is Demarest superintendent of schools.\Stop hysteria about offshore drilling\Figures I have seen show that there are 3,649 drilling rigs for oil and natural gas in the United States and Canada, of which 1,677 are offshore. Our society depends upon them for heating our homes, fueling our cars and manufacturing products.\We need to stop the environmental hysteria regarding offshore drilling and look at our needs. All businesses have problems and growing pains, and they learn from them.\Considering all the years these oil rigs have been operating and the few problems they have had, I would say that their safety record is excellent. Perhaps those opposing oil drilling should look back to the oil embargo in 1973, which caused long gas lines and disrupted our economy because we were at the mercy of OPEC.\If we become energy-independent, that will never happen again. In life, there are risks. About 36,000 people are killed on the road every year. Do we stop driving? Let's put this in perspective and stop the hysteria.\Richard Pedersen\Bergenfield, Feb. 1\Schools all need parental support\Regarding ""A failing grade for the notion of more testing"" (Other Views, Feb. 3):\Thank you to Christopher de Vinck for his column. The public school system is not designed to become the ""be all, end all"" in developing children into becoming productive members of society. As was stated, that third rail of education is the family.\It is a very tough societal issue that must be addressed. We all know that over time, funding in education has increased and, overall, the test results are relatively unchanged. The increased funding probably offset the increase in the staggering statistics cited by de Vinck.\I don't wish to throw up my arms and surrender to the issue, but until some very basic conversations are had and values instilled, no amount of testing, nor funding, are going to move the needle.\Bob Hutton\Ridgewood, Feb. 5\The president's misguided policies\According to President Obama, the overwhelming majority of Muslims reject radical Islam and ""the medieval interpretation of Islam is rejected by 99.9 percent of Muslims.""\So now that the president has beaten that platitude to death, where exactly are we on all of this?\Recently, we saw demonstrations attended by millions of people rallying from Paris to Tokyo, calling for an end to radical Islam. Over the course of the last 14 years, many Muslim rallies and demonstrations have been directed at the destruction of the Western world in general, and the Christian and Jewish populations in particular.\Keep in mind that even if a very small number of the 99.9 percent of Muslims who allegedly reject radical Islamic terrorism took a stand for humanity, you would have millions of voices denouncing what is supposedly believed by only a tiny fraction of Muslims, making the Paris and Tokyo demonstrations pale in comparison.\It seems as if Obama's immediate concern is more about burnishing the image of the Muslim world, and not in combating radical Islamic terrorism.\Mark Gregorek\Mahwah, Feb. 5\Artists, musicians merit more accolades\In the Sally Forth comic strip of Feb. 5, Hillary's father tries to explain to his daughter why musicians, artists and actors do what they do.

346,"Biggest issue at end of life\""End-of-life care: Can we afford it?"" (Opinion, Page O-1, Feb, 28) was very interesting.\It raises a question: If you are not going to get medical help because of your age and there is no chance for your survival or medical intervention would prolong your life only for a year or two, are you just going to sit there in discomfort or pain looking out a window until you die? Why don't they give you or your legal guardian, with prior written permission by the patient, the opportunity to request that legal euthanasia be performed?\Yes, I know that religious issues regarding suicide come up. But it should be up to me to make the decision. I do not want to sit in a nursing home waiting to die or as a vegetable like my father did for five years. End it.\Bruce G. Paulson\Allendale, March 3\*\Murray Sabrin's ""End-of-life-care: Can we afford it?"" (Opinion, Page O-1, Feb. 28) defines an area of health care in which nothing is being done to address out-of-control costs.\Although President Obama's health care reform will solve one of the major deficiencies in the system, namely the lack of coverage for everyone, it does little to address skyrocketing health care costs. In fact, the expansion of the system to include everyone will most likely exacerbate this problem.\As a physician for 35 years, I have witnessed too many instances of patients encouraged to accept end-of-life care, which only resulted in prolonging pain and suffering. There comes a time when both the doctor and the patient must accept the fact that the best course of action is to limit care to supportive measures and let nature take its course. Spending vast sums of money, $150 billion per year by Sabrin's estimate, doesn't change the final outcome.\Neither the government nor the medical profession can solve the problem of these escalating costs. The only solution is a national discussion to assist patients and families in making the best possible decisions within the constraints of fiscal responsibility.\Philip Affuso\Ridgewood, March 5\***\No new road tolls; raise gasoline tax\Regarding ""The road tolls for you"" (Editorial, March 4):\Gas tax or Route 80 tolls?\Generating more money to support the demands of the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund is a legitimate need. But what's the best way to fund it?\Obviously no one likes to be taxed, but in the case of producing more revenue for the state Transportation Trust Fund, it seems logical that the most fair and efficient method should be centered on New Jersey's gasoline tax. It was created specifically to support and develop transportation in the state. With greater impending need for rebuilding and repairing aging bridges and roadways, one would expect gasoline tax increases to meet those demands.\The state's gas tax is one of the lowest in the nation; a few pennies added to it would provide immediate revenue for crucial, time-sensitive projects. When considering the wide fluctuations in gasoline prices, an increase of a few pennies would hardly be noticed.\On the contrary, the ambitious and burdensome idea of creating tolls on major highways like Route 80 is starkly excessive, costly and completely unnecessary.\A gasoline tax is fairer than tolls. It depends on miles traveled, so a driver has some degree of control upon the amount of tax paid.\One way or another, the new ""tax money"" will come from some place. And we all know where that is.\Phil Fallacaro\Fair Lawn, March 4\***\Rise of China, decline of U.S. \ A Washington Post-ABC news poll shows that Americans see China as becoming the dominant player on the world's political and economic stages this century, replacing the United States as the world's most significant nation.\Recently, I attended a meeting on China's economy held at the New York Stock Exchange. Four economists from China and others announced to a crowd of proud Chinese and other attendees that China would surpass the U.S. economy in 10 years. I recalled with sadness the kitchen debate between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev a half-century ago, when we were at the top of our game.\Foreign Policy magazine this month features an article on China achieving an economy of $123 trillion, which would indeed dwarf United States gross domestic product.\We need to change our habits, or we will indeed decline. China's nationalist inclinations at some point may see a rapid translation of economic power into military power. We need to move away from ""wars of choice and necessity"" to address and engage China's moves peacefully.

(Other Views, Feb. 25):\Soliman argues that a bias exists in labeling Muslim acts of violence as terrorism.\Soliman cites horrible acts, but perhaps only the killing of Dr. George Tiller could be considered an act of terrorism as defined by Webster's: ""calculated use of violence or the threat of violence against civilians in order to attain goals that are political or religious or ideological in nature.""\However, the history of attacks by Muslim fanatics, driven either directly or indirectly by international terrorist organizations, unfortunately fits this description.\Muslims and Arabs, like any other groups, share a common desire to improve their lives and provide for their children in diverse communities. In the same Gallup Poll relied upon by Soliman, statistics show that Muslims in America enjoy a higher standard of living and more economic opportunities than those in Europe.\However, in Middle Eastern countries, poll after poll show that an alarmingly large number of Muslims favor suicide bombings and other acts of violence (they don't call it terrorism) to achieve political ends - those goals often being the destruction of Israel or America.\Soliman's suggestion that the media start labeling all violent acts as terrorism is either naive or deception of a different kind. In addition, it does not address the widespread encouragement (more precisely incitement) that prominent Muslim scholars and clerics give to such acts of violence. Changing the label will do nothing to change the underlying message these fanatics spread.\Loli Varsano\Bergenfield, March 2\***\There is life after cable\Regarding ""Consumers get burned in another Disney, Cablevision war"" (Business, Page B-1, March 4):\I've got good news for all Cablevision viewers: There are alternatives out there.

It is not a free ride. Many of them receive no unused sick or vacation days paid and no health benefits upon retirement.\As for Assemblyman Joseph Malone's idea of freezing the salaries of all public workers for up to three years, perhaps he could also freeze the rising costs of housing, auto insurance and college tuition.\State and local employees are ordinary people trying to make a living.

347,"Reacting to Christie rejection of ARC\As I read The Record columnists Charles Saydah (""The ARC rail tunnel project: What's really in it for us?"" Opinion, Page O-1, Oct. 24) and Alfred P. Doblin (""We don't need ARC, we have Lautenberg,"" Other Views, Oct. 25), I can't help but wonder why they fail to address the main reason for ARC: the existing setup constitutes an incredible single point of failure for the North Jersey economy.\Here's the scenario: An accident, terrorist activity, or just plain old age closes down the existing rail tunnel for a day, a week, a month or a year. Already overloaded roads and car tunnels grind to a complete halt. North Jersey businessmen see their enterprises cut off from their most important market, New York City, and begin scurrying for the exit doors, while North Jersey becomes a black hole strictly to be avoided in expansion planning for businesses not already stuck here.\I don't doubt that ARC is not perfect and that there will be cost overruns. But when (not if) the scenario cited above comes to pass, the fix will be much more expensive, much less effective, and much too late to save the North Jersey economy than the ARC plan now on the table.\Ron Greenberg\Glen Rock, Oct. 25\*\Regarding ""The ARC rail tunnel project: What's really in it for us?""

It was a 19th century solution for a 21st century world with costs disproportionately shouldered by the Garden State.\Admittedly, New Jersey's intrastate mass transit system needs help. But if the region is to arrive at a healthier economic future, leaders must ask better questions: How do we best organize ourselves for productive capacity? What solutions would best stimulate permanent jobs for the new economy? Can we improve our environment and save costs at the same time?\In Carl Sagan's book, Contact, an astronaut travels to an impossibly distant galaxy, seemingly without leaving the launching pad. Could we not apply current technology so millions of commuters could ""traverse"" the Hudson (or the Garden State) without leaving their homes? Many of our region's jobs -- in finance, technology, communications, law and other areas -- are already knowledge-based.

How much fuel could that save? What would be the positive ""green"" impact on health and quality of life?\The transition has already begun. Greater ""stimulus"" in this direction could accelerate the change and create sustainable growth and high-quality jobs.\Charles Bins\Washington Township, Oct. 27\*\I don't wish to poke a hole in ""Overlooked detail in ARC project?"" (Your Views, Oct. 24) on an additional surprise to the cost of Access to the Region's Core tunnel -- electrification of rail lines serving northern New Jersey.\But NJ Transit has ordered dual-mode diesel/electric engines for the new ""one-seat, one-ride"" commute to Manhattan under the ARC proposal. NJ Transit has 26 units on order, with an option for 63 more.\Metro North uses dual-mode engines on service north of Croton-Harmon, as well as Amtrak.\I'm afraid this point will become moot if the governor sticks to his decision to scrap the ARC project.\Jeffrey Anderson\Ramsey, Oct. 25\*\I see our two esteemed U.S. senators, Bob Menendez and Frank Lautenberg -- both Democrats -- rallied with construction workers and union officials about the construction halt and loss of jobs at the Access to the Region's Core tunnel site. (""Workers protest loss of tunnel jobs,"" Page A-3, Oct. 20).\Menendez railed about Governor Christie, and Lautenberg ""projected"" 6,000 new jobs. Nice speeches, nice photo-op.\Perhaps someone should have asked the senators the following:\The ARC is the largest public works project in the country and the Bush administration awarded $3 billion for its construction. The senators had just approved billions for ""shovel-ready"" jobs and infrastructure. Why is it that the ARC got only $200 million from the stimulus? Would this not have been a shining example of the proper use of the people's money?\Exactly where did our money go?\Joe Alloy\Wayne, Oct. 22\*\I take considerable comfort in a number of The Record's staff positions regarding the ARC debacle.\Perhaps a fitting analogy of the ARC fiscal conundrum could possibly be the notorious ""Big Dig"" in Boston.\The ever-beneficent U.S. Congress, in an effort to bestow proper recognition and gratitude to former House Speaker Thomas ""Tip"" O'Neill, funded an enormous ""endowment"" bill of about $9 billion to completely restructure Boston's inner city in the mid-'80s and early-'90s.\Two decades later, cost estimates are $15 billion. The project was supposed to have been completed in about 10 years. The actual time expended: two decades and counting.\Needless to say the project was an utter catastrophe, fiscally and practically.\The project will take three times longer to complete than projected. Delays have been massive, workmanship questionable and construction material suspect.\A concrete slab in one tunnel came loose and killed a driver. The legal profession has been awarded a virtual bonanza that will fulfill the revenue needs of its members well into their retirement.\The Boston citizenry was furious at the delays and shenanigans. But in this instance, it was primarily American taxpayers who were saddled with the cost overlays; they continue to fork over to this day.\Should we have expected anything different with the ARC in a virtually insolvent New Jersey?\Bill Geraghty\River Edge, Oct. 25\*\For more than 30 years I traveled to Manhattan on a daily basis. Overwhelmingly, commuters rely on their cars as the preferred mode of transportation. It will take massive behavioral change to convert to rail ridership.\Did the Secaucus Junction ease traffic congestion? Did it increase real estate prices? What about affordability? Will pricing for ARC service be offered at a deep discount to encourage ridership? More important, have there been any studies to measure the loss of both public and private sector jobs with each additional billion dollars added to an already existing budget gap of $11 billion?\I do not believe the Access to the Region's Core rail tunnel project is as simple as, ""Build it and they will come.""\Governor Christie did his due diligence. Even after the numbers were reworked, it is clear there that the $3 billion from the Federal Transit Administration is not enough. Proponents asked Christie to take a giant leap of faith. They assumed the ARC was the silver bullet to our transportation woes.\Just maybe, the taxpayers are tired of being on the hook.\Rich Chorbajian\Rutherford, Oct. 25\*\Since I am a Manhattan commuter, it may be surprising that I agree with ""The ARC tunnel project: What's really in it for us?"" (Opinion, Page O-1, Oct. 24).\A while back, I was part of a 25-person panel asked to watch a video about the Access to the Region's Core project and give our opinions. When I signed on, I was not aware that the organizers were interested only in views on ARC and not the rest of the NJ Transit system.\What surprised me most was that only one or two panel members saw a personal benefit to their commutes. Many stories were similar to my case: A bus picks me up two blocks from my residence every morning. Yes, the trip can be long when traffic acts up (more often than not). But I have a book, The Record and a Blackberry with hours of music that lets me communicate with home and office.\We should improve our roads and intrastate public transportation. I cannot fathom why a 2-cent or 3-cent gas tax is such political poison. I read that a penny increase in the gas tax would raise just under $40 million. The average motorist who drives 1,000 miles per month in a vehicle that gets 20 mpg would pay an extra $60 per year if gasoline taxes were raised 10 cents per gallon. I would pay that just to have a decent ride from Bogota to Manchester to visit my mother once a month and get to the mall easily on a weekend.\Matt Morrone\Bogota, Oct. 24\*\By calling for an end to the ARC tunnel, Governor Christie deserves a great deal of praise for stopping this incredible waste of taxpayer money (""Tunnel dead on arrival,"" Page A-1, Oct. 27). As much as I personally favor all forms of rail transportation, this project was both poorly designed and ill-conceived. Would we really have gotten our money's worth?\In 1910, when the mighty Pennsylvania Railroad completed Penn Station in New York City, the total price tag was $114 million, or about $2.5 billion in 2007 dollars. But this price tag included four East River tunnels, two Hudson River tunnels, electrification and Penn Station itself, which occupies all the land between 31st and 33rd streets, from Seventh Avenue to the Hudson for approach tracks. The Pennsylvania Railroad funded this project with no help from the government.\Today, $7 billion to $10 billion would only buy two dead-end tunnels that end about six stories beneath Macy's with no track connection to the existing Penn Station. That means every train going in there would have to be taken back to New Jersey for storage.\When I first saw the plans for this project, I could not believe that the new tunnels started on the south side of the existing rail tunnels, then crossed under them beneath the river and ended up on the north side. The new tunnels could never reach the existing Penn Station because the grades would be too steep. This is because NJ Transit management's concept of a train is a locomotive pulling coaches, which cannot climb grades as well as a train in which every car has traction motors. So here we have a poorly designed tunnel that must accommodate NJ Transit's mode of rail transportation.\Where is the money from New York State to help with this project? For $7 billion, perhaps we should extend the No. 7 subway line -- currently connecting to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center -- across the river to New Jersey. But that would be unthinkable.\Bob Savino\Bergenfield, Oct. 27\*\In the debate on the Access to the Region's Core project, Passaic County residents could relate very well to explosive cost overruns on a public project. The Preakness Healthcare Center, for example, started out as a $30 million project when it was proposed. It has already cost $90 million, and contractors and consultants are still billing Passaic taxpayers for overruns.\Considering all the broken promises of the Preakness job, imagine the cost overruns of a 9-mile tunnel. Governor Christie told the truth, and special interest-groups did not like the truth. Christie has been explicitly clear to federal officials: Give New Jersey funds for overruns and the project will proceed. In plain English, New Jersey cannot afford the extra debt and money.\Christie is taking the most laudable, sensible and common-sense approach to ARC.\Michael G. Mecca Jr.\Clifton, Oct. 23\The writer, a former Passaic freeholder, is Republican municipal chairman of Clifton.\*\Considering that I am one of the people who supposedly would have benefited from the Access to the Region's Core project, one might assume that I am disappointed that it was canceled (""Tunnel dead on arrival,"" Page A-1, Oct. 27). I'm not.\Before the Frank R. Lautenberg Secaucus Junction Station was built, we were told that it would save us time and make our commutes better. It didn't. Because service on the Main Line is so infrequent, I was stuck taking the same train home, whether I go through Secaucus or Hoboken. And in some ways, going through Secaucus made my commute worse, so I still go through Hoboken.\With this in mind, I don't believe the claims that NJ Transit or mass transit advocates made about the benefits of the ARC project. Millions of dollars were wasted to build the Secaucus boondoggle, and it would have been a shame if billions of dollars were wasted on the ARC project.\Paul Debbas\Hawthorne, Oct. 27\*\I applaud Governor Christie's decision to cancel the tunnel from North Bergen to Macy's in New York.\I have used the Frank R. Lautenberg Secaucus Junction Station on the weekends. The atmosphere of the station is dungeon-like. The inside of the station is confusing and inconvenient to use. There are few places to sit. I can never find information attendants. There appears to be no exit to the outside. I feel really trapped. I wondered what would happen to me in an emergency.\Trains change tracks abruptly, and I have found myself running upstairs and downstairs after a change of track has been announced -- with no waiting time. The next train departed within seconds.\My solution: I take the bus into New York, then walk to Penn Station and relax in comfort as I wait for my train back home.\If billions are going to be spent on a new tunnel, it has to be done right. The plan Christie rejected: Building a tunnel nearly 150 feet under Macy's. How would it feel being in a tunnel that deep underground in an emergency? What were the pathways to getting out, and how long would it have taken to get to ground level?\I, a taxpayer and potential user, demand to see the architectural plans before signing off on any project like that.\Never should a tunnel be built without first consulting the people who are going to use it.\Diane Palacios\Ridgewood, Oct. 28\*\Governor Christie put the brakes on the ARC tunnel when New Jersey's unemployment is at its highest since 1977 and its economy is sluggish. When 450,000 people are out of work, why put the biggest public works project in the United States on hold? Because he has a difference of opinion on potential cost overruns, not actual costs.\If economics didn't spur action, why couldn't pride? I thought the Swiss completion of the world's longest tunnel might have prodded Christie into action to improve our ancient infrastructure -- but no. The Swiss create a 35.4 mile tunnel, and New Jersey won't build a 9-mile tunnel. Isn't it time?\Our first rail tunnel opened in 1907, and today's PATH train was born. The Holland Tunnel, completed in 1927, and the George Washington Bridge, opened in 1931, were public works projects. FDR's New Deal built the Lincoln Tunnel.\It has been nearly 50 years since our last increase in commuter capacity. Ridership, as reported by NJ Transit, has quadrupled since 1984. So could necessity get this tunnel done? Instead, Christie digs in his heels and says he's now working with Amtrak, which just started planning on a tunnel. But has Christie gotten on a PATH train lately?\I'm not sure who coined the saying, ""Republicans - the party of no,"" but whoever it was sure got it right. It's easy to say no, but a good leader would figure out how to say yes when $8.3 billion is on the table.\Deborah Bouchard\Bergenfield, Oct. 27\*\Regarding ""One tunnel closes, another may open"" (Page A-1, Oct. 28):\Governor Christie's decision to cancel the ARC project is a necessary decision after years and years of promises that are now coming due. Design flaws were reason enough to cancel the project.\But the bigger issue is that an inability to prioritize has created a situation whereby New Jersey, New York and the federal government, in spite of annual budgets in the hundreds of billions of dollars, cannot afford to replace a 100-year-old portion of the busiest passenger rail line in the United States.\Public works such as the ARC project are the types of activities I expect from my government, and the inability to complete such a mission is a failure on the part of our elected officials.\John A. Tardio\Fair Lawn, Oct. 28"
348,"Washington Bureau\If more New Jerseyans take trains, subways, buses and public transportation, the state's summertime sky would be less smoggy and the Corzine administration would find it easier to comply with tougher federal standards limiting ground-level ozone, advocates say.\The New Jersey Department of Environment Protection said Friday it's beginning the lengthy process of figuring out how the state as a whole could meet the lower standards.\According to the EPA, 13 New Jersey counties have ozone levels higher than 75 parts per billion: Atlantic, Bergen, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean and Passaic.\The EPA said the new standards, issued Wednesday, would reduce smog and thereby prevent thousands of premature deaths, cut asthma and bronchitis, and save between $12 billion and $19 billion in health care costs.\DEP Commissioner Lisa Jackson said one-third of New Jersey's pollution comes from outside the states, especially coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.\Jackson and other environmentalists, along with public health groups, sought an even stricter ozone standard -- 60 parts per billion. However, Jackson acknowledged, vehicular exhaust is a major contributor, and cars are a difficult pollution source to address.\""New Jerseyans love their cars, so I am not going to say that we don't have problems there,"" she said in a telephone interview.\State Sen. Bob Smith, the Piscataway Democrat who chairs the Senate Environment Committee in Trenton, was more blunt.\""What the people of New Jersey have to understand is that their absolute enemy . . . is the automobile,"" Smith said. ""We have to make it so (that) . . . trains and buses really become the way in which New Jerseyans get to work each day.""\Under a Smith-sponsored bill, Garden State companies that employ at least 100 workers must require at least 20 percent of their employees to either carpool or vanpool to work or work from home. Similar legislation almost made it into law in the early 1990s, Smith said.\New Jersey is considered a national leader in mass transit, with a denser network of rails and buses than most anywhere else. However, fast-growing Ocean, Monmouth and Middlesex counties -- which are fighting for a new rail line -- lack an adequate network.\Chronically underfunded NJ Transit, which is seeing record ridership, remains the nation's only major statewide mass-transit agency that lacks a dedicated source of revenue, said Zoe Baldwin of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit group that lobbies for increased mass transit in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.\Lawmakers should raise the state gas tax -- which at 14.5 cents per gallon is among the nation's lowest -- to generate more money for NJ Transit, she said.\New Jersey has three years to develop a plan to meet the new ozone standards, according to Chris Salmi, an air quality official at the DEP. The state will look at ways to boost mass transit, cut industrial and power-plant emissions, and reduce greenhouse gases overall as part of its approach, he said.\Reach Raju Chebium at rchebium@gns.gannett.com"
349,"CORRECTION: A letter to the editor in the Feb. 20 edition (""Bergen Dems: No party of the people"") misidentified Ridgefield Park as a Democratic-controlled town that had recently rezoned for office space. The letter writer meant Ridgefield. (Published Wednesday, March 23, 2005, page A02)\ Think metro area in Olympics bid\ New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg sounds like Richie Rich, the spoiled little rich boy not getting his way (""Jets' stadium plan faces competition,"" Page A-3, Feb. 17). It appears he is more concerned about being the mayor who brought the Olympics to New York than the mayor who did the right thing for the people of the city.\ If we stop thinking New York City and look at the Olympic proposal as a metro New York event, the solution becomes simple: Build the mega-sports complex for the Olympics in the Meadowlands. We give New York what it wants and needs. We gain thousands of jobs both in New York and New Jersey. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority gets more money for the land by opening bids to all potential developers, bringing more funds to improve New York transit. We keep both the Giants and Jets in their current home environment. The Olympic stadium will now be less than 10 minutes from the Lincoln Tunnel, a shorter drive from most areas in New York City than the far West Side of Manhattan, with ample parking.\ If I am not mistaken, don't most New Yorkers refer to both the Jets and Giants as ""NY"" teams?\ - Stephen Bromberg, Mahwah, Feb. 17\ * * *\ Bergen Dems: No party of the people\ Kudos to The Record for its coverage of the Bergen County Democrats. From ""pay-to-play"" to ""wheeling"" to ""Party animals"" (Editorial, Feb. 3) and every other ethically challenged practice and scheme in between, the articles that at first made me raise an eyebrow now disgust me.\ As for Democratic insider Bob Nesoff's recent criticism of The Record, this should not be surprising (""Level playing field in Record's editorials,"" Your Views, Feb. 8). Nesoff has been well- cared for by Bergen Democrats for a long time. As Sheriff's Department spokesman, he was inconspicuously mum as his boss, former Bergen County Sheriff Joseph Ciccone, was forced from office on charges of official misconduct. Then after a stint as head of the Teterboro Animal Shelter, Nesoff was given a soft landing with his current job at the Bergen County Law and Public Safety Institute. Must be nice to know you'll always have a job.\ However, the common denominator in this political cesspool always seems to be the same: Democratic County Chairman Joseph Ferriero. As I struggle with rising property taxes to make ends meet and provide for my family, it is comforting to know that the chairman of the ""party of the people"" is throwing $54,000 open-bar bashes for party insiders in Atlantic City (""A party with skill for lavish partying,"" Page A-1, Feb. 2).\ Ferriero is one of the main cogs in the wheel that perpetuates New Jersey's reputation as the nation's political laughingstock.\ - Keith Jenke, Midland Park, Feb. 10\ *\ ""Making over North Jersey"" (North Jersey Business Forecast '05, Business, Page X-1, Feb. 7) talks about near-term developments of thousands of residential units and, more interestingly, millions of square feet of office space as if they will be occupied. ""Slow and steady for office space"" (Page X-21, Feb. 7) presents a more cautious tone and talks about a 19 percent office vacancy rate and a modest improvement in the need for more office space in 2005.\ Is this buildup of office space real or phantom? The answer will have a dramatic impact on taxes in municipalities like Englewood. I subscribe to the cautious outlook. First, a look at the employment picture over the past year shows the largest increase in the service and retail sectors, neither of which require major office space. Second, the outsourcing of information technology, research and financial backroom jobs overseas is reducing the need for office space. The consolidation of industries will also reduce the need for office space.\ Also look at the towns that have rezoned for office complexes, Englewood, Wood-Ridge, Ridgefield Park and Fort Lee among them. These are towns controlled politically by cronies of Bergen County Democratic Chairman Joseph Ferriero. I believe this is worth a further investigation by The Record.\ - Eugene Skurnick, Englewood, Feb. 7\ * * *\ Terrible misuse of political power\ I read with great concern ""Redevelopment project would displace 60 firms"" (Page L-1, Feb. 8), on condemnation of land and prosperous businesses in Ridgefield.\ It seems that local politicians have one overriding goal: more money. Are we to assume that we live in a free country but only as long as we surrender our productive land when asked? How much freedom will be taken away from us so as to provide more money for the political machines and government treasuries?\ Is your neighborhood safe from condemnation? Is the block you live on safe from condemnation? Is your house safe from condemnation?\ It seems it is not for you to decide. If you play by the rules, the rules can change anytime. This present attempt at land-grabbing of productive property and buildings may not be your immediate concern now. But can you be sure your house or your neighborhood will not be within a politician's sights when you least expect it?\ - Walter Boudreaux, Dumont, Feb. 13\ * * *\ Reduce taxes, employ more\ President Bush could lessen the unemployment problem and our balance-of-trade deficit by allowing U.S. manufacturing operations to deduct 125 percent (or more) of their payroll costs as a business expense. This could be implemented immediately, without a new bureaucracy, with a quick, positive effect.\ - William Pauwels Sr., Franklin Lakes, Feb. 16\ * * *\ Diplomacy as another means of war\ Regarding ""Rice seeks 'hard decisions' from Israel"" (Page A-1, Feb. 7):\ Diplomacy is just another means of waging war, indeed. This twist on the observation of German strategist Carl von Clausewitz still applies to the Arab world's 50-year war to destroy Israel.\ Ever since their armies failed to thwart Israel's independence (1948), in war after war Arab governments turned to the Soviets, the United Nations, the United States and other powers to prod Israel into risky ""concessions"" - using oil for blackmail and weapons orders.\ Their latest four-year terrorist jihad now follows a similar pattern - exploiting the United States to pressure Israel into submission. A few years ago, former President Clinton (with good intentions) was humiliated in his efforts to end an earlier jihad. The late Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat arrogantly reneged on all his ""peace"" pledges.\ Now, President Bush strives valiantly for freedom and peace throughout the Mideast. He has (so far) offered $370 million to Arafat's colleagues, and he asks Israel (a tiny democratic land) for risky ""sacrifices.""\ And why do we, as taxpayers, hear little of the estimated billions left over by Mr. Arafat? Shouldn't some of that go to the Palestinian poor (at long last), or to Israel's victims of terror, or back to Washington?\ In the good cause of ""peace,"" let us learn from the past.\ - Joseph Brandes, Fair Lawn, Feb. 9\ * * *\ High health costs for the uninsured\ Hackensack University Medical Center has been running television and print ads lately. In those ads HUMC is depicted as a warm and fuzzy place, full of compassionate people who truly care about you and your problems.\ I'd like to suggest that the ads carry the following disclaimer: ""We'll take good care of you and yours, but if you're not insured you may want to consider going to another hospital.""\ My story: Due to temporarily tight finances, I am one of the 44 million unfortunate souls in this country with no health insurance. I injured my arm, necessitating a visit to the HUMC emergency room.\ The Blue Cross/Blue Shield case rate on something like this (seven stitches) is about $300. I figured they'd soak me a little for not having insurance, and send me a bill for around $400. The final bills totaled $1,617. I spoke to several HUMC people, who said the amount was outrageous but added, ""That's the way it is.""\ It takes a particularly despicable person or institution to prey on someone who's already in an unfortunate situation (injured and financially challenged). But when the predator is your neighborhood hospital, supposedly a place of comfort and healing, the abuse is enhanced by an element of betrayal. You're being victimized by someone you trusted to care for you.\ We have legislation against price gouging in the retail market.\ - Rob Harper, Rutherford, Feb. 15\ * * *\ Teachers differ from politicians\ Regarding ""Taxpayers not 'free' of Florio after all"" (Page A-1, Feb. 13):\ I am in my 38th year as a mathematics teacher and have made more than 35,000 classroom presentations. I taught for 35 years in a Bergen County high school and currently serve as a part-time mathematics instructor at a state university.\ I do not hold the salary Jim Florio commands or his class schedule against him. I have been a Florio supporter throughout his political career. My concern is his comment: ""I think of politicians as educators with big classrooms."" He should rethink this definition.\ Educators are an entirely different entity from politicians. Few professional politicians would be willing to meet the demands of a professional educator, make the sacrifices and have the courage to stand in front of a class and say, ""I am your teacher.""\ Florio should refrain from comparing the two; it does not reflect positively on his position as an educator.\ - Harry McLaughlin, Hawthorne, Feb. 13\ * * *\ Abortion link to breast cancer\ A recent poll has given Dr. Joel Brind, professor of endocrinology and biology at City University of New York, much credit for his analysis on the linkage of breast cancer to abortion. He is not saying that women who contract this horrible disease are necessarily victims of an abortion. But he is saying those who had abortions are at a much higher risk of getting this deadly disease in their lifetime\ Take his professional advice: If abortion was a part of your life at some time, be aware of the danger.\ - Bernard Kiernan, Fort Lee, Feb. 14\ * * *\ Misguided support for Giambi\ ""Teammates back Giambi"" (Sports, Page S-5, Feb. 15) is a headline that provides a wakeup call for anyone who still takes baseball seriously. The surreal and absurd statements from professional ballplayers leave little doubt about their stunted perspective.\ My favorite was this quote from Derek Jeter: ""I've been on teams in the past with players who have made mistakes. We've always supported teammates. We're here to support Jason.""\ Someone please inform Giambi that filling in the wrong answer on a math test is a mistake. Injecting yourself with illegal steroids for years and cheating the entire game of baseball is a lifestyle that mocks the very players who command his support. Ironic how they accuse Jose Canseco of just looking to make money off his book when Giambi, by refusing to mention the word steroid in his ""apology"" to fans, is looking to keep the cash coming in, lest his contract be voided.\ How far away are we from this: A player kills his wife and children but will get undying support from teammates saying that he made only a mistake?\ In the final analysis, Jeter says that, ""Obviously, you want to weed out the bad apples,"" in reference to baseball's new drug policy. I would like to ask him, why? The bad apples on his team would only get his complete support.\ - Peter W. Kruimer, Harrington Park, Feb. 15\ * * *\ 9/11 warnings repeatedly ignored\ Thank you for Columnist Mike Kelly's ""Holes in the safety net"" (Opinion, Page O-1, Feb. 13) and syndicated columnist Robert Scheer's ""President Bush, tear down this wall of secrecy"" (Other Views, Feb. 17). They discussed previously restricted information from the 9/11 commission on this administration's inaction before Sept. 11, 2001.\ This secretive administration has more black lines running through the truth than Alcatraz has bars. We finally know that within the government agencies multiple alerts were being raised with warnings of imminent terrorist attacks and that planes could be used. Yet no steps were taken to improve security. Instead, administration spokesmen claim no one could foresee these events and that those warnings were only ""historical documents,"" and people of faith maintain their belief and hopeful trust.\ One can be sure that if untrustworthy Clinton, verbose Gore or flip-flopping Kerry had been president then, this new information would have had 24-hour coverage on Fox TV.\ - Bill McCauley, Wyckoff, Feb. 17\ *\ Syndicated columnist Robert Scheer nicely distills the issues surrounding the newly declassified sections of the 9/11 commission report revealing no less than 52 warnings specifically mentioning Al- Qaida, Osama bin Laden and airplane hijackings in the months prior to Sept. 11, 2001 (""President Bush, tear down this wall of secrecy,"" Other Views, Feb. 17).\ This information, withheld by the Bush administration until after the election, is perhaps the most damning indictment of a sitting president in my lifetime.\ What does it say about this administration that we have to hope its refusal to act on these warnings was negligence or incompetence because the alternative is just too terrible to even contemplate?\ - Jill Cozzi, Washington Township, Feb. 16\ * * *\ Foot soldiers don't regret bombings\ Regarding one of the letters in ""Selective memory of war's losers"" (Your Views, Feb. 17):\ None of the American military officers cited by the writer was ""put in harm's way"" except Adm. William F. ""Bull"" Halsey. Gen. (eventually President) Dwight Eisenhower never saw a day of combat.\ It is theoretical to say the bombing of Dresden or the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were morally repugnant or militarily unnecessary, especially when you are not the ones going into harm's way. Why not ask all the World War II veterans who were about to be shipped from Europe to the Far East for the invasion of Japan's main islands? They all cheered when told of the bomb being dropped; it meant they would be spared more brutal combat. I think the Marines who sustained 26,000 casualties on Iwo Jima would have cheered if the bomb had been dropped on Iwo before the invasion.\ The letter writer seems to have forgotten who started World War II - it wasn't us.\ - Joseph J. Kroth, Wyckoff, Feb. 17\ * * *\ Sheriff is not a social worker\ Regarding ""Jail doesn't have to be a round trip"" (Page L-3, Feb. 9):\ If Bergen County Sheriff Leo McGuire wants to become a social worker, he should turn in his badge and gun and become one.\ The only thing a criminal understands is the authority that will deter him from committing crimes against society. In this age of violence and drugs, we should demand more mandatory sentences to protect our families and neighborhoods against the criminal element. We would hope and pray that our legislators pass laws and back them up to let law-abiding citizens go on with their lives.\ Why not offer the inmate programs and benefits to the hard- working citizens who have lost their jobs? Let the social workers do what they do, and let the judges and police do their jobs and protect us all.\ With the election over, McGuire should stop playing politics.\ - Ellen Anderson, Fair Lawn, Feb. 10\ * * *\ Face facts on gas tax, keep N.J. moving\ While I share The Road Warrior's concern over our elected officials' stewardship of transportation resources, the situation is more dire than the ""Chicken Little"" analogy suggests (""Bush transportation cuts have politicians clucking,"" Page A-3, Feb. 13).\ John Cichowski is right on the mark that gas taxes should not be increased unless there are safeguards against the irresponsible misuse of the Transportation Trust Fund. Just such an approach was recommended in the blue ribbon transportation commission report that former Gov. James McGreevey spurned nearly 18 months ago. The governor's abandonment of his commission was aided by the bipartisan shirking of responsibility of the Legislature.\ Rather than political posturing, our legislators should support the leadership of Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman John Wisniewski, who has faced up to our transportation needs and called for adoption of the commission's report, including an increased gas tax.\ Transportation is the key to a healthy New Jersey economy, and it comes with a very large price tag. While tax increases must never be taken lightly, the time has come for a dedicated increase in motor fuels taxes, together with accompanying protections against irresponsible spending and borrowing.\ While the ""sky is falling"" bombast of some officials may seem like hype, citizens and officials must face the facts and invest to keep New Jersey moving.\ - Chip Hallock, Newark, Feb. 14\ The writer is president and CEO of the Regional Business Partnership in Newark.\ * * *\ Newark arena a waste of money\ Excellent editorial regarding the hockey season (""NHL season goes kaput,"" Feb. 17).\ Maybe this will open the eyes of New Jersey residents about the arena that the Devils and Newark want to build in Newark. This will be funded by the taxpayers no matter how it is presented. This is not tax relief. If the pro teams want to move, let them go.\ - Allen Drozdowski, Wayne, Feb. 17"

I am reasonably optimistic we will get it done, but let me tell you from a funding and infrastructure perspective within Atlantic City, this is a very difficult environment,"" said DeSanctis, former president and COO of Penn Gaming, a successful owner of gambling operations in 11 states and Canada.\For 14 months, he said, he has been negotiating terms with a Chinese bank, but so far has not closed the deal. His deadline for determining the future of the project is July. If he secures financing, he said, it will take an additional 20 months before opening.\Revel is the first new casino hotel to be constructed in Atlantic City since the Borgata in 2003.\DeSanctis' plight set a dismal tone Friday that lingered throughout the morning, three days after Gov. Chris Christie proposed a lean budget.\Ted Zangari, a Princeton lawyer, who is building a coalition of pro-business groups, said incentives for businesses to stay, expand and relocate to New Jersey must be maintained.\""These incentives can't go away because 49 other states are chasing after the same businesses. We have a lot of work to do, especially when some groups repeatedly set up a false choice saying if it's good for business, then it's bad for the environment,"" said Zangari.\Panelists and members of the audience singled out teachers for their generous package of benefits and slow-moving bureaucrats within the Department of Environmental Protection as two groups that have added to the state's budget crisis.\Senate Majority Leader Stephen M. Sweeney, who also is Gloucester County freeholder director, spoke candidly about teachers.\""They need to stop the (expletive). This is not about the kids,"" said Sweeney, who tried, but failed to lead the state in regionalizing public schools to reduce New Jersey's property taxes, the highest in the nation.\Sweeney described his own dealings with the DEP over construction of a courthouse in Woodbury as frustrating and costly.\""I'm the Senate majority leader and freeholder-director and they doing this to me? I can only imagine what the DEP does to the public,"" said Sweeney.\Despite Christie's pledge not to raise taxes, Sweeney said he may have to when it comes to replenishing the state's transportation fund, a key resource for the construction industry and commerce in general.\""We have to fund the transportation fund. That means a gas tax has to be talked about. While I'm not proposing it, I'll hold the governor's hand and I'll jump off the bridge with him,"" said Sweeney, suggesting he would support an increase if proposed.\Reach Eileen Stilwell at (856) 486-2464 or estilwell@courierpostonline.com"
351,"TEN YEARS HAVE PASSED since the Exxon Valdez ran aground and leaked 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's pristine Prince William Sound.\Since that disaster on March 24, 1989, we haven't done enough to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\Sure, requiring double-hulled tankers is great, and establishing a $1 billion oil spill trust fund, which came out of Exxon's settlement with the federal government, is a help. But these actions don't address the underlying source of oil-spill risk: our dependence on automobiles and their dependence on gasoline.\After all, when something went wrong, the Valdez was retrieving oil from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline so we could all have tigers in our tanks, as the old Exxon marketing slogan went.\When the tanker ran aground, it bled at least 10.8 million gallons of crude into the sound, spoiling 1,500 miles of coastline.\According to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, the spill's death toll included 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, and as many as 22 killer whales.\That's dramatic. The slow environmental degradation caused by vehicle emissions isn't.\At the International Oil Spill Conference in Seattle earlier this month, scientists argued about how thoroughly and quickly ecosystems recover from the Exxon Valdez and other massive oil spills. There's no debating, however, that Prince William Sound looks a whole lot better now than it did that spring day 10 years ago.\But what if we could see the pounds of carbon dioxide that spew from our tailpipes? Even as Prince William Sound has been cleaned up, we've continued to pollute our environment with fossil-fuel-guzzling motor vehicles, which are getting bigger and greedier than ever.\No wonder the Sierra Club awarded the new Ford sport utility vehicle the ""Exxon Valdez Environmental Achievement Award."" The Excursion, with its 44-gallon gas tank, weighs more than four tons and gets as little as 10 miles per gallon.\Such sport utility vehicles, minivans, and pickups account for half of new-vehicle sales. Environmental groups attribute the 10 percent rise in transportation carbon dioxide emissions between 1990 and 1997 to increased driving and these vehicles, which take America's love affair with the car to new heights.\At current rates, the United States won't meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012, as agreed upon at the Kyoto conference on global warming in 1997. And car companies probably won't stop making hungry behemoths any time soon.\We can't see the effects of carbon dioxide as easily as the oil slick in Prince William Sound, so we just chug along.\Only a dreamer would say we could all do without cars. That doesn't mean, though, that there's nothing to be done. Better public transportation and city planning would make getting around easier. The federal government should boost research into alternative fuels and energy efficiency. Companies that encourage telecommuting should be rewarded. A hike in the gas tax to fund public transportation, fuel research, and reduce demand is warranted.\If we don't wean ourselves from gas-guzzling cars, we will continue to befoul the environment, and we invite another Exxon Valdez disaster.\Erin Middlewood of Longview, Wash., is former editor of the Progressive Media Project.

Now Iran can make weapons of mass destruction. Saddam didn't even have a nuclear plant.\ Iran is a different, more dangerous situation. They supply ammo and bombs to the resistance fighters in Iraq. Saddam never threatened the United States. Iran has. And Iran knows the United States can't do a thing, since Bush has committed so much to its efforts in Iraq.\ Now Bush and Europe are going to go to the United Nations. The same track was used with Saddam. Does Bush think he and the United Nations can do any better with sanctions against Iran than they did with Saddam? Russia and China will deliver to Iran. Iran has oil and money.\ It looks to me like the Iranians have more brains and have learned more from history than Bush and his cohorts.\ Bernhard Klein\ Midland Park, Aug. 9\ * * *\ 'Disgusted with energy bill'\ I'm disgusted with the ""pork-laden"" energy bill that was recently signed by President Bush, and I have a suggestion.\ I urge everyone to pick a day of the week and refuse to buy gasoline. Since the energy bill did nothing to address the immediate problem of skyrocketing gas prices, let's fight back with the only weapon they fear - the loss of our hard-earned dollars.\ Harold John Comppen\ Fair Lawn, Aug. 10\ * * *\ 'Disgusted with energy bill'\ Regarding ""Bush: Energy law not a cure-all"" (Page B-4, Aug. 9):\ The signing of the energy bill by President Bush brought to mind that neither in all the months proceeding the signing, nor at the signing itself, has Bush made any mention whatsoever of the reason why the energy bill did not mandate an increase in the fuel economy of cars and SUVs to achieve substantial energy conservation.\ Evidence suggests that millions of Americans support an increase in fuel economy for three reasons:\ * It can accomplish substantial energy conservation.\ * It can significantly reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\ * It can reduce the cost of fuel per mile of driving.\ Two-thirds of the oil we consume goes into automobile gas tanks.\ Mr. President, I believe that the nation is entitled to an explanation.\ David Quentzel\ Englewood, Aug. 11\ * * *\ 'Double standard in terrorism reporting'\ I'd like to respond to ""Call a terrorist a terrorist"" (Your Views, Aug. 11).\ Indeed, Eden Natan-Zada committed a terrorist attack. For that reason, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon condemned it as a ""vile act by a bloodthirsty Jewish terrorist."" IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz denounced it as a ""heinous murder."" The mayor of Natan- Zada's hometown of Rishon Letzion refused to have the soldier buried in his cemetery so as not to disrespect or taint a burial ground with that of a murderer. Israel was disgusted by this act.\ Now let's compare this to the Palestinian reaction when a Palestinian terrorist blows up a bus, guns down unarmed women and children, or shoots up a passing Israeli car. The terrorist is hailed as a martyr, his picture is plastered on the walls of town as a hero, and the ""moderate"" Palestinian leaders condemn him in English but revere him in Arabic.\ Yes, there is certainly a double standard in reporting on terrorism. After reading that letter to the editor, I glanced at The Record's editorial on the Gaza disengagement (""Leaving Gaza,"" Editorial, Aug. 11) and I noticed that double standard at work.\ The Record, along with many other news agencies, regards Palestinians who commit acts of terror as ""Palestinian militants,"" but when Muslims terrorize London, Spain, Egypt, or basically any other country besides Israel, they are deemed ""Islamic terrorists,"" which is exactly what they are.\ Matthew Kislak\ Maywood, Aug. 11\ * * *\ A teacher's work goes beyond class\ Regarding ""True or false: Teachers' salaries are too high"" (Page A-1, July 29):\ One hundred and eighty days: That is the state requirement for New Jersey schoolchildren.\ Do I, as a teacher, work only 180 days per year? This year my 185 days per contract was supplemented by 135 professional hours (graduate and technology coursework), at least 185 planning hours (paperwork, plan book, research, ordering, required forms), and at least 50 hours of meetings (articulation, curriculum, building, conferences), all of which are held after hours, unlike corporations that hold meetings during business hours.\ I believe that adds 370 hours, or about 46 days, to the 185 days, which totals 231 days. With 260 working days available, excluding holidays, I think we put in the same amount of time as a corporate worker who may get six weeks' vacation after 30 years on the job.\ The glitch is that teachers really don't get paid for their summer ""vacation."" They get no monetary bonus and don't even get a dinner or luncheon on occasion.\ True, there are 30 to 40 minutes in the day set aside for some of the aforementioned tasks, but this is often eaten up by contacting parents, organizing trips, assembling bulletin boards, selecting books and media, copying for lessons, filing students' work, making written responses to parents, filling in forms for special needs, writing letters of recommendation, and many other ""little things"" that cannot be done with a room full of learners.\ Some of the median salaries mentioned in the article are equal to or less than what college students with a bachelor's degree in accounting or finance are being recruited for right out of college. In addition, I spend money on my students and my classroom out of pocket. There are no expense accounts.\ Does corporate America work in offices without air conditioning?

In his resignation speech he clearly stated, ""I am a gay American."" This created the ""poor me I'm being persecuted because I'm gay"" syndrome.\ It has nothing to do with being gay. Be he homosexual or heterosexual, he betrayed the trust of the people of New Jersey and endangered their lives and the lives of many other Americans by placing Golan Cipel, who knew nothing about homeland security, in charge of homeland security for the state.\ McGreevey should not be connected in any way to public office, including behind the scenes. But I fear he will be lurking in the shadows of New Jersey politics.\ Joseph Wilson\ East Rutherford, Aug. 9\ * * *\ U.N. seeking to govern world?\ Regarding ""U.N. needs a reformer"" (Your views, Aug. 4): While I agree that the United Nations is in desperate need of reform, I don't believe we should even belong to it. It is closer than ever to controlling all aspects of human endeavor. With its involvement in monetary systems, global taxation, microeconomic management, military matters and the environment, there seems to be no remaining area in which it has not taken a regulatory interest.\ The establishment of world government under the United Nations would inevitably mean the loss of our freedoms and American way of life.\ I urge Congress to pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act.

Jim McGreevey, but we've outdone ourselves with Corzine, who doesn't even know the meaning of the phrase ""conflict of interest.""\ Our other distinguished senator, Frank Lautenberg, recently commented that Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Forrester is ""too extreme"" for New Jersey.

Living in harmony with geese is possible but requires a respect for them, something that is missing at the NJMC.\ Common sense dictates that when vast amounts of money are being spent on plantings, protection must be given to the investment. For a fraction of the cost of lost plants and contract ""killing fees,"" using a border collie would have saved not only their plantings but the lives of 155 healthy geese as well.\ In 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service held a public comment period on its proposed Resident Goose Management plan and the results were positive for non-lethal methods.\ New Jersey's management plan, thanks to the Fish and Wildlife Service, was to reduce the numbers of geese from a reported 85,000 in 1999 to 41,000 this year.\ It was not Canada geese who turned a former white cedar forest, once abundant with wildlife, into a chemical-laden garbage dump. Yet they receive a death sentence for being able to survive in it.\ Jeri Kratina\ Garfield, Aug. 8\ * * *\ Of geese and goslings\ Regarding, ""Gassing of geese is shameful"" (Your Views, Aug. 8): The problem of geese is getting to an alarming state. When a goose has a litter - usually three or more goslings - they grow up and return to where they were born. This is causing parks, golf courses, reservoirs, lakes and rivers to be places where we walk through feces, which may have bacteria in it, and then trek it through our homes.\ Do you want to have your children playing sports sliding into the bases through this? Do you think county parks should be inundated with geese? If you aren't in the areas that are infested, you will never understand the problem. My back yard looks like a toilet for them, and so does our beautiful lake.\ Joe Salleroli\ Franklin Lakes, Aug. 9\ * * *\ Let Iraq have a civil war\ What is so wrong if there is a civil war in Iraq? If you look back in history, you haven't really existed unless your country at some time had a civil war. England in 1642, Spain in 1936, Bosnia, the United States - plus over 150 countries in Africa just between 1960 and 1999.\ There is no ""end game"" plan by the Bush administration and to talk about pulling out, to the administration, is heresy. But why not just pull out? In fact, if they have a civil war in Iraq, they will eventually establish a government with centralized power, rather than a bunch of lunatics on the fringe blowing themselves up in a lost cause for Americans and Iraqis.\ This is not a perfect world, and we must not forget that a civil war is sometimes needed in order to right a wrong. We were wrong. We invaded Iraq on false pretenses, and it is time to bail out.\ Mel Freedenberg\ Ridgewood, Aug. 8\ * * *\ No compromising human life\ In his ""Voice of reason against far-right ideology"" (Other Views, Aug. 2), Carl Golden launches a vitriolic attack against ""the rigidity of those who tolerate no deviation from the narrow ideological path they have laid down.""\ This was in reference to conservatives' recent criticism of Sen. Bill Frist's support of embryonic stem-cell research.\ Golden goes on to say the ""far right allows no room for debate or compromise."" There are many issues on which there can be give-and- take, such as highways, trade, and even Social Security. But in the matter of human life, a firm line must be drawn. And although very tiny, human embryos are human life; what is so ""far right"" about defending life?\ A basic omission of Golden's is his failure to distinguish between embryonic stem cells and adult ones - those from bone marrow, umbilical-cord blood, etc. Adult stem cells have no ethical baggage and are the only ones that have, after two decades, produced results.\ We all would like to see suffering relieved through research, but not by destroying some life to benefit other life, especially when there are more promising alternatives available.\ Elsie P. Palmer\ Wayne, Aug. 3\ * * *\ Generals had the right idea\ In ""Four arrested in botched bomb attacks"" (Page A-1, July 30), at least three of the four were of East African origin.\ Also, ""Suicide attack kills up to 25 Iraqi recruits"" (Page A-14, July 30) said, ""The Marines reported killing nine insurgents, five of them believed to be Syrians.""\ Where are the Iraqi terrorists? Is it possible that they are guarding the weapons of mass destruction, since we cannot find them?\ The Bush administration has created an army of terrorists that has spread throughout the world, including America.\ I believe we cannot leave Iraq until we are victorious.\ In fact, if we are really serious, belatedly, we should listen to the advice of some of our four-star generals who have said we needed more troops for the United States and its allies to be successful.\ We are not defeating world terrorism by having our troops bogged down in Iraq, which, by the way, is trying to include Islam as the state religion in its new constitution.\ This is a new version of President Bush's freedom and democracy!\ Irving Gall\ Paramus, Aug. 8\ * * *\ Mileage tax vs. added sales tax\ Regarding ""There you go - a tax on mileage"" (Page A-1, Aug. 5):\ The North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority's 25-year plan suggests a mileage tax to replace the per gallon tax on gasoline. Oregon will begin experimenting next year with a system to tax the miles a person drives rather than the fuel that person buys.\ The trucking industry already reports the miles its vehicles travel, the states in which they travel, and the purchase cost of the fuel. This is tedious, time-consuming and paper-driven.\ It would seem if New Jersey wants more gas tax revenue per gallon, it should encourage the purchase of bigger vehicles. The car- buying public already has voted for SUVs; as a consequence, New Jersey is swimming in gas tax revenues. Unfortunately, the law does not restrict these revenues for use only in road building.\ However, if you want more revenue from fuel taxes, you can adopt the New York City mode of financing: Charge a sales tax in addition to the current per-gallon tax. A benefit to such additional taxation is that the legislators voting for it will most assuredly be removed from office in the November elections (as was James Florio when he jumped taxes $2.6 billion). This is a good thing.\ Frank X. Landrigan\ East Rutherford, Aug. 5\ * * *\ A costly plum for town officials\ I attended Oakland's mayor and council meeting on Aug. 10 and was shocked to hear that Oakland's elected officials are being rewarded with taxpayer funds for primary insurance coverage from Oakland's self-insured plan. The plan provides primary hospitalization, medical, dental, optical and prescription coverage for all the elected officials and their families.\ I commended Councilman John Biale for requesting that a referendum be added to November's ballot to let citizens decide whether or not this practice should be continued. It appeared to me that the mayor and other members do not want a referendum.\ The mayor said the elected officials' insurance represented about $50,000 of this year's increase for insurance costs. It appears to me that these officials have decided that using their own employers' plans is not as beneficial to them as is Oakland's self-insured plan.\ Did these representatives of the people run for office to serve our community, or for a lucrative insurance plan? My local government tax increased 16 1/2 percent this quarter. Not having to contribute to that $50,000 would have eased the pain and anger I experienced as I paid the highest tax increase in all my 44 years as a resident of Oakland.\ Charles E. Page\ Oakland, Aug. 11\ * * *\ If we're killed,the Terrorists win\ Regarding ""Searches show terrorists winning"" (Your Views, Aug. 10):\ The writer concludes that ""if we submit to searches because we are afraid, the terrorists have already won."" Not true.\ If the terrorists kill us because we don't adopt common-sense precautions, then they've won. They definitely lose when they can't kill us, particularly if some end up captured.\ I am not trying to minimize the writer's concern about the loss of personal liberties and the need to hold our government in check, but there must be some acceptance that 9/11 has changed things.\ Consider that we are just finding out that a government terrorist task force knew about the Brooklyn Al Qaida cell that included hijack leader Mohammed Atta a year in advance of 9/11, but was not allowed to pass its information to the FBI because of unrealistic policies supposedly protecting personal liberties.\ Almost 3,000 Americans paid the price for a bad decision that had good intentions.\ I won't accept that this was a necessary cost of protecting liberty.\ Ken Fleishaker\ Ramsey, Aug. 11"
353,"WASHINGTON -- If more New Jerseyans take trains, subways, buses and other forms of public transportation, the state's summertime sky would be less smoggy and the Corzine administration would find it easier to comply with tougher federal standards limiting ground-level ozone, advocates say.\The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued the new standards for ground-level ozone, the biggest component of smog. The previous limit, set 11 years ago, was 80 parts per billion. The new standard reduces the limit to 75 parts per billion.\The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said Friday it's beginning the lengthy process of figuring out how the state as a whole could meet the lower standards.\According to the EPA, 13 New Jersey counties have ozone levels higher than 75 parts per billion: Atlantic, Bergen, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean and Passaic.\Smog, the nation's most widespread air pollutant, causes or exacerbates lung damage, especially among children and elderly people who have asthma. Ground-level ozone forms when nitrogen oxides and other substances emitted by power plants, automobiles, factories and chemical solvents bake in the ultraviolet rays of the hot sun.\The EPA said the new standards, issued Wednesday, would reduce smog and thereby prevent thousands of premature deaths, cut asthma and bronchitis, and save between $12 billion and $19 billion in health care costs.\DEP Commissioner Lisa Jackson said one-third of New Jersey's pollution comes from outside the states, especially coal-burning power plants in the Midwest. She criticized the Bush administration for doing little to limit smokestack emissions and raise fuel-economy standards nationwide, adding that ozone reduction is a national problem that requires a national solution.\Jackson and other environmentalists, along with public health groups, sought an even stricter ozone standard -- 60 parts per billion. However, Jackson acknowledged, vehicular exhaust is a major contributor, and cars are a difficult pollution source to address.\""New Jerseyans love their cars, so I am not going to say that we don't have problems there,"" she said in a telephone interview.\State Sen. Bob Smith, the Piscataway Democrat who chairs the Senate Environment Committee in Trenton, was more blunt.\""What the people of New Jersey have to understand is that their absolute enemy ... is the automobile,"" Smith said. ""We have to make it so (that) ... trains and buses really become the way in which New Jerseyans get to work each day.""\Under a Smith-sponsored bill, Garden State companies that employ at least 100 workers would have to require at least 20 percent of their employees to either carpool or vanpool to work or work from home. Similar legislation almost made it into law in the early 1990s, Smith said.\New Jersey is considered a national leader in mass transit, with a denser network of rails and buses than most anywhere else. However, fast-growing regions like Ocean, Monmouth and Middlesex counties -- which are fighting for a new rail line -- lack an adequate network.\Chronically under-funded NJ Transit, which is seeing record ridership, remains the nation's only major statewide mass transit agency that lacks a dedicated source of revenue, said Zoe Baldwin of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit group that lobbies for increased mass transit in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.\Lawmakers should raise the state gas tax -- which at 14.5 cents per gallon is among the nation's lowest -- to generate more money for NJ Transit, she said.\""We've been yelling about it for years,"" Baldwin said. ""We need to make sure that NJ Transit is funded properly so that ticket prices can stay down.""\New Jersey has three years to develop a plan to meet the new ozone standards, according to Chris Salmi, an air quality official at the DEP. The state will look at ways to boost mass transit, cut industrial and power-plant emissions, and reduce greenhouse gases overall as part of its approach, he said.\Not everyone is happy about the new standards.\The National Association of Manufacturers warned that they would hurt the ailing economy. Companies have already spent a lot to comply with the previous standards, and now will be forced to increase those expenditures, the group said, adding that the new standards wouldn't improve public health by that much.\Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who sits on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, raised objections on a different front. He said he's troubled by published reports that President Bush intervened to block the EPA from passing even tougher ozone standards.\""The president should not be ignoring science and interfering with laws meant to protect the health of our residents. ... We need major investments in mass transit to get cars off the road and new technologies for cleaner fuels and energy,"" he said."
354,"WASHINGTON -- Will Congress do something to cut gas prices before you drive off to the beach this summer?\Not a chance, energy experts say.\The truth is that despite the flurry of bills being debated on Capitol Hill, Congress cannot control the global price of oil nor offer real help for beleaguered American drivers now or in the near future, analysts say. Many of the solutions lawmakers are proposing -- from drilling in the Alaskan wilderness to boosting the use of renewable energy -- would take years or even decades to have an impact.\""I wish I could say there was relief around the corner, but there isn't,"" said Robert Ebel, senior energy adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Congress members don't want to tell you that, but that's the reality.""\It's not that the politicians don't want to help. With their constituents screaming from pain at the pump, members of Congress facing re-election in November would like nothing better than to fix the problem and take credit for doing so, Ebel said.\But Congress has no power over the worldwide demand for oil, which is being fueled in large part by developing nations such as India and China with an insatiable hunger for energy, said Bob O'Brien, the online stocks editor at Barrons.com.\""China is undergoing this economic boom and is effectively willing to pay any price,"" O'Brien said. ""Just by the nature of the market, the product is going to seek out the end user that is willing to pay the most. And that dynamic is not going to change anytime soon.""\That hasn't stopped Congress from trying to find a quick fix.\In May, President Bush reluctantly signed bipartisan legislation that stops him from stockpiling oil in the nation's emergency reserve through the end of this year. Supporters of the bill said it would reduce gas prices by 5 cents to 25 cents a gallon by keeping 70,000 more barrels of oil a day on the market beginning July 1.\But energy analysts are skeptical.\""Increasing supply by 70,000 barrels a day when we consume 21 million barrels a day isn't going to have much effect,"" Ebel said. ""I think it's largely a public relations effort.""\Proposals by presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain to give Americans an immediate holiday from having to pay the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax would slash prices initially. But analysts say it also would lead to increased demand, which would drive up prices again.\Attempts to impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies and invest the money in renewable energy -- which the Senate tried unsuccessfully this month -- also could end up hurting consumers because the oil companies would just pass on their increased costs, analysts say. Efforts to go after market speculators who bid up the price of oil also failed in the Senate, although Congress members have vowed to try again.\Before the Fourth of July holiday, the House will take up a bill aimed at closing the so-called ""Enron loophole,"" which exempts energy speculators who trade electronically from U.S. regulation. Supporters say closing the loophole could cut oil prices by as much as a third. There also are calls for congressional investigations into possible abuses by speculators who may be trading on inside information or colluding to drive up prices.\""At this point, we just don't know the nature and extent of abuses that might be taking place in the market,"" O'Brien said. ""A congressional investigation into the forces that are affecting this market could be a step in the right direction.""\But with immediate solutions in short supply, the debate has shifted to calls by the Bush administration and Republican congressional leaders to lift the 27-year federal ban on offshore oil drilling along most of the U.S. coast and open up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration.\""In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil,"" Bush said Wednesday. ""And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home.""\Bush acknowledged his plans would ""take years to have their full impact.""\The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently estimated that drilling in the Arctic refuge would reduce the global price of oil between 41 cents and $1.44 per barrel and take 20 years to have much effect on the domestic oil supply. It would take about the same amount of time for offshore oil drilling to make any real difference, according to the EIA.\Democratic congressional leaders and conservationists say the plan will damage the environment and boost oil companies' already large profits without significantly decreasing Americans' dependence on foreign oil.\They also say more drilling permits should not be issued when oil companies aren't drilling on about 68 million acres of land they already lease.\""Instead of opening every last corner of our country to oil drilling, we need to produce cars that go farther on a gallon of gasoline, invest in mass transit and other alternatives to driving, and develop clean renewable energy,"" said Anna Aurilio of Environment America.\But developing alternative energy also takes time. The most ambitious proposal would require the nation to get 25 percent of its energy from renewable sources within 25 years.\In the meantime, consumers are taking steps on their own to reduce their demand for oil, O'Brien said.\""If you look at the statistics over Memorial Day weekend, you'll see there was 4 percent less gas demand than in 2007,"" O'Brien said.

355,"WASHINGTON -- Will Congress do something to cut gas prices before you drive off to the beach this summer?\Not a chance, energy experts say. The truth is that despite the flurry of bills being debated on Capitol Hill, Congress cannot control the global price of oil nor offer real help for beleaguered American drivers now or in the near future, analysts say. Many of the solutions lawmakers are proposing -- from drilling in the Alaskan wilderness to boosting the use of renewable energy -- would take years or even decades to have an impact. ""I wish I could say there was relief around the corner, but there isn't,"" said Robert Ebel, senior energy adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Congress members don't want to tell you that, but that's the reality."" It's not that the politicians don't want to help. With their constituents screaming from pain at the pump, members of Congress facing re-election in November would like nothing better than to fix the problem and take credit for doing so, Ebel said. But Congress has no power over the worldwide demand for oil, which is being fueled in large part by developing nations such as India and China with an insatiable hunger for energy, said Bob O'Brien, the online stocks editor at Barrons.com. ""China is undergoing this economic boom and is effectively willing to pay any price,"" O'Brien said. ""Just by the nature of the market, the product is going to seek out the end user that is willing to pay the most. And that dynamic is not going to change anytime soon."" That hasn't stopped Congress from trying to find a quick fix. In May, President Bush reluctantly signed bipartisan legislation that stops him from stockpiling oil in the nation's emergency reserve through the end of this year. Supporters of the bill said it would reduce gas prices by 5 cents to 25 cents a gallon by keeping 70,000 more barrels of oil a day on the market beginning July 1. But energy analysts are skeptical. ""Increasing supply by 70,000 barrels a day when we consume 21 million barrels a day isn't going to have much effect,"" Ebel said. ""I think it's largely a public relations effort."" Proposals by presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain to give Americans an immediate holiday from having to pay the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax would slash prices initially. But analysts say it also would lead to increased demand, which would drive up prices again. Attempts to impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies and invest the money in renewable energy -- which the Senate tried unsuccessfully this month -- also could end up hurting consumers because the oil companies would just pass on their increased costs, analysts say. Efforts to go after market speculators who bid up the price of oil also failed in the Senate, although Congress members have vowed to try again. Before the Fourth of July holiday, the House will take up a bill aimed at closing the so-called ""Enron loophole,"" which exempts energy speculators who trade electronically from U.S. regulation. Supporters say closing the loophole could cut oil prices by as much as a third. There also are calls for congressional investigations into possible abuses by speculators who may be trading on inside information or colluding to drive up prices. ""At this point, we just don't know the nature and extent of abuses that might be taking place in the market,"" O'Brien said. ""A congressional investigation into the forces that are affecting this market could be a step in the right direction."" But with immediate solutions in short supply, the debate has shifted to calls by the Bush administration and Republican congressional leaders to lift the 27-year federal ban on offshore oil drilling along most of the U.S. coast and open up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration. ""In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil,"" Bush said Wednesday. ""And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home."" Bush acknowledged his plans would ""take years to have their full impact."" The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently estimated that drilling in the Arctic refuge would reduce the global price of oil between 41 cents and $1.44 per barrel and take 20 years to have much effect on the domestic oil supply. It would take about the same amount of time for offshore oil drilling to make any real difference, according to the EIA. Democratic congressional leaders and conservationists say the plan will damage the environment and boost oil companies' already large profits without significantly decreasing Americans' dependence on foreign oil. They also say more drilling permits should not be issued when oil companies aren't drilling on about 68 million acres of land they already lease. ""Instead of opening every last corner of our country to oil drilling, we need to produce cars that go farther on a gallon of gasoline, invest in mass transit and other alternatives to driving, and develop clean renewable energy,"" said Anna Aurilio of Environment America. But developing alternative energy also takes time. The most ambitious proposal would require the nation to get 25 percent of its energy from renewable sources within 25 years. In the meantime, consumers are taking steps on their own to reduce their demand for oil, O'Brien said. ""If you look at the statistics over Memorial Day weekend, you'll see there was 4 percent less gas demand than in 2007,"" O'Brien said. ""Either folks are leaving the car in the garage and spending their time off in the back yard, or they're leaving the big car in the garage and taking the smaller one."" That trend is also reflected in the kind of cars Americans are buying. ""All of a sudden, America's best-selling vehicle is no longer the Ford F-150 pickup; it's the Toyota Camry,"" O'Brien said. ""People are changing their behaviors."" The best thing Congress could do, he said, is to give people tax incentives to change even quicker.

356," New Jersey business leaders look at Governor-elect Jon Corzine and wonder who will take office Jan. 17.\ Will it be Liberal Jon, the union friend with ""progressive politics"" and close ties to the same Democrats that critics say turned Trenton into an anti-business cesspool?\ Or will it be Wall Street Jon, the former bond trader who became the multi-millionaire chairman of Goldman Sachs and intimately understands the needs of business?\ This is no parlor game. At stake, according to many business leaders, is the state's future as a vibrant, competitive and welcoming business hub.\ In recent years, critics say, state government has done its best - through a corporate business tax hike, excessive environmental regulation and other measures - to scare away entrepreneurs.\ Corzine touts both sides of his split personality. Addressing 300 members of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association trade group recently in Iselin, Corzine played up his Wall Street background but pulled few punches about his politics.\ ""I am a capitalist by profession,"" he said. ""I think most of you know I am progressive politically. It doesn't mean that I am foolishly liberal.""\ At Goldman Sachs, he recalled, ""I was more than willing to put my neck on the line."" He said he believes in ""bottom line results"" and harked back to his bond trading days, saying, ""I am a risk taker. I think there are some problems you never know all of the answers to.""\ Corzine has offered only a broad outline of his intentions. But he clearly sees private industry as a key to solving state government's biggest problem: a budget gap that Corzine puts at about $6 billion.\ He argues, for example that the creation of 55,000 new jobs a year would generate $300 million in revenue for the state. To help create jobs and boost economic growth, he proposes moving the Commerce Department inside the governor's office - instead of leaving it as a separate department.\ Corzine also proposes to boost foreign trade by creating a state foreign trade representative; consolidate 16 business growth programs under the state Economic Development Authority; and invest public money in research to boost biotech, nanotechnology, homeland security and other industries.\ Yet the paucity of details has left some business leaders skeptical.\ Jon F. Hanson, a Republican and a real estate manager and developer, said that any pro-business sentiment Corzine held from his Wall Street days was most likely worn away during the five years he spent in the pragmatism of the U.S. Senate.\ For that, and other reasons, Hanson wonders about the depth of Corzine's belief that jobs and economic growth are crucial to the state's future.\ talks about it,"" said Hanson, the head of Morristown-based Hampshire Cos. ""The jury is still out that he understands it.""\ The Record asked Hanson and four other business leaders to identify the challenges facing Corzine and how he should deal with them.\ Joan Verplanck\ President, New Jersey Chamber of Commerce\ Verplanck's main concern can be summed up in a single word: restraint.\ The state has for years balanced the state budget with quick fixes, Verplanck said. A favorite target has been business, which has suffered fee and tax hikes, such as former Gov. James E. McGreevey's ratcheting up of the corporate business tax that more than doubled the revenue reaped from businesses, from $800 million to $1.8 billion.\ Verplanck called on Corzine to deliberate carefully, so that he can solve the annual budget crisis once and for all - preferably by cutting or curbing spending rather than raising taxes.\ ""You know the old adage: if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging,"" she said. ""He really needs to get through his transition, sit back and look at what all the options are and make some difficult choices.""\ In October, Verplanck helped form the Platform for Progress to promote business issues related to state government. The organization's goals include a ban on so-called pay-to-play and finding a permanent funding source for the Transportation Trust Fund, such as a gas tax.\ Verplanck also wants the governor's office to wage a more aggressive effort to attract new businesses, and retain existing ones, similar to the Virginia state government.\ Joe Longo Jr.\ President/CEO,\ Longo Electrical Mechanical Inc., Linden and Wharton\ When Longo Electrical was looking for a site for a new plant, New Jersey's business climate indirectly led him to Philadelphia.There's more demand in Pennsylvania for his company's services - it makes and maintains equipment for industrial plants - because so many heavy industry companies have fled New Jersey, said Longo, who opened the Philly plant in November.\ ""New Jersey is losing manufacturing jobs at an alarming rate, and it impacts my business,"" he said. Noting that Pfizer just announced the closure of a plant in Parsipanny, he worried that pharmaceutical jobs, too, may flee the state.\ To tackle the problem, Corzine must bring down the cost of doing business, Longo said. That includes cutting property taxes, and corruption, which ultimately pushes up the cost of government, he said.\ One quick fix, Longo said, would be to re-write a state law that requires employers to pay a prevailing wage on public jobs. While similar federal laws are two-tiered - one for services and manufacturing and one for construction, which is 30 percent higher - New Jersey has just the higher level, forcing local governments to pay more, he said.\ Longo also urged Corzine to repeal McGreevey's executive order that requires public jobs to be completed with union labor.\ Both policies push up the project cost, which local governments then pass on to residents and businesses through higher taxes, he said. That, in turn, chases businesses away.\ ""It's a matter of making New Jersey competitive,"" he said.\ Jon F. Hanson\ Chairman, Hampshire Cos., Morristown\ Hanson's experience trying to expand a warehouse in Roxbury epitomizes the problems he wants Corzine to confront.\ Though the project was in line with area zoning laws, it took three years to secure permits - from the state departments of environment and transportation, and Township Hall - before completion last summer.\ ""We almost lost the business to Pennsylvania,"" Hanson said. A real estate manager and developer, Hanson also sits on the boards of Prudential Financial Inc., CD&L Inc. and HealthSouth Corp.\ One solution, Hanson said, is to create a ""lead agency"" - a sort of ombudsman - that could take on a project and deal with all the governmental bodies involved, cutting through the red tape.\ He also called on Corzine to create more enterprise zones where companies can get tax breaks and grants. These would prove particularly helpful to converting old industrial areas - such as those found in Teterboro and South Hackensack - into places attractive to more modern industries, such as biotech, Hanson said.\ Gerald H. Lipkin\ Chairman, president and CEO, Valley National Bancorp, Wayne\ Lipkin wants to send a millionaire-to-millionaire message to the incoming governor: cut out the taxes.\ Both Corzine and Lipkin - 2004 compensation about $12 million and $1.9 million, respectively - are impacted by the state's millionaire's tax, which actually kicks in when someone earns $500,000.\ Lipkin, a staunch opponent of the tax, says his position is nothing personal, however. He says it and other personal and business taxes frighten businessmen away from New Jersey and into neighboring states.\ ""We tax our executives, the owners of the companies, higher,"" he said. For an executive looking to relocate his company and himself into a state, ""it's not that attractive if you tell them he or she is going to be taxed at 10 percent in this state and nothing in another state.""\ Lipkin sees no burning issues confronting the banking sector that Corzine should address. Rather, he says the incoming governor should focus on controlling state spending so that taxes can come down.\ ""We have lost many of our good customers over the last decade because they have simply moved out of this state,"" he said. ""That hurts us. It hurts our growth. And it hurts the employment within the state of New Jersey.""\ Ralph Izzo\ President and COO\ Public Service Electric and Gas Company\ Izzo figures no governor can do much about the energy sector's primary problem: rising natural gas prices.\ But Corzine nevertheless makes a few decisions that shape the industry environment, such as who heads the Board of Public Utilities and serves as directors.\ The PSE&G executive is optimistic that Corzine's varied public and private sector experience will help him make decisions that strike a good balance between the needs of energy customers, companies and their shareholders.\ ""What will serve him well is his sense of evaluating programs and proposals on their benefits and balancing costs and benefits,"" the COO said. ""Doing the right thing sometimes costs money. I think he understands that.""\ Key to the state's success will be the creation of solid infrastructure, including good schools and effective transportation links, Izzo said. The governor also needs to restore a sense of integrity to New Jersey's government, an issue that provides critical insight to business executives wondering whether their business can thrive in New Jersey.\ ""If people don't think you can govern with integrity,"" Izzo said, they will wonder about the quality of your decision making, how it will affect how businesses are taxed and regulated.\ ***\ E-mail: morley@northjersey.com\ (SIDEBAR, page B01)\ A new agenda\ Highlights of Governor-elect Jon Corzine's proposals to help business and boost the economy:\ * Create a Governor's Office of Economic Growth.\ * Consolidate 16 business growth programs under the state Economic Development Authority.\ * Create position of New Jersey trade representative to promote state overseas.\ * Start public/private fund for investment in research, business and development in nano- technology, renewable energy, biotech and other technology sectors.\ * Repeal fast-track law that requires the state to rapidly make decisions on environmental and building permits.\ * Create an urban investment bank."
357,"WASHINGTON - Congress will miss its Sept. 30 deadline to enact a massive highway and transit funding bill, a delay that states say could cost 90,000 people their jobs and billions of dollars in extra construction costs due to delays.\Lawmakers are moving to extend the current funding program several months while they wrangle over whether to raise the 18.4-cents per gallon gas tax to pay for a significant increase in highway aid.\""This is not our proudest moment,"" said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee that unanimously endorsed a five-month extension yesterday.\Capitol Hill's inability to reach consensus on a road bill is not new. Disagreement over details delayed approval of the current six-year program by nearly nine months. This year's extension would provide states with roughly $17 billion for road and transit projects over the next six months, slightly more than they got during the same period a year ago.\But cautious state officials already have begun to put long-term projects on hold. New Jersey Transportation Commissioner Jack Lettiere said his state is bracing for the effects of Congress' failure to meet the Sept. 30 deadline. Contracts normally awarded this fall won't be let until the spring, forcing delays of up to a year."

There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government.

360,"A state Senate committee has approved a proposed water tax for New Jersey to raise money for watershed preservation efforts. The average cost to homeowners would be $3.20 a year.\The idea of any new tax is anathema to most New Jerseyans, but much like the possibility of a gas tax hike to replenish the state's Transportation Trust Fund, this sort of modest, specifically targeted tax has some merit. It would create a pool of money for an important cause that typically gets short shrift in the state's overall spending. Funds would go toward land purchases in preservation areas and environmentally sensitive properties and creating supply connections to mitigate drought conditions.\There is, however, one big problem: As approved by the Senate Environment Committee, this supposedly targeted tax wouldn't be constitutionally dedicated to water protection. It could ultimately be used for anything. Advocates say Senate Budget Committee members balked at any limitations.\That approach would inevitably lead to one thing: Lawmakers would tap that money for other spending.\How anyone, even the most ardent supporters of the tax, can justify such an open-ended fund with a straight face is baffling. The only valid reason for the new tax is to address the state's water supply. Keeping it available for other uses all but ensures that it will be diverted, as has money from so many other supposedly dedicated funds -- such as the transportation fund and the state's evaporating unemployment fund.\We should all know by now that New Jersey legislators cannot be trusted to use tax revenue for its intended purpose. A provision in the water-tax plan calls for the Legislature to annually approve all spending out of the fund, which is being pitched as a mechanism to protect against diversion of the money. But it's hard to see how that would work. Lawmakers have never been bashful about moving money from one pot to another. That added layer of scrutiny will be irrelevant.\Constitutional dedication of the water-tax money is a must, just as formal restrictions will be needed to govern new transportation money. Without it, those funds are guaranteed to go down the drain. And without it, the tax should be rejected."
361,"A coalition of advocacy groups demanding more taxpayer funding for NJ Transit blamed Democrats and Republicans for ignoring a laundry list of transportation needs in the state budget.\Unless Governor Christie and the Democratic-controlled Legislature add $60 million to $70 million to NJ Transit's funding this week, the agency is likely to approve a fare increase of 9 percent on average at its board meeting scheduled for mid-July, according to the New Jersey for Transit coalition.\At an event Wednesday outside the State House, members of the group said Christie and the Legislature's Democratic leaders have cut taxpayer funding for the state's lead public transit agency by 90 percent over five years -- from $348 million to $33 million -- putting a strain on the agency that has helped force its hand on raising fares.\As lawmakers prepare to pass a budget today, and with days to go before Christie's deadline to sign a spending plan for the incoming fiscal year, the chance to stop the fare increase is now, said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey.\""There won't be a second chance to stop this fare hike and service cuts for riders,"" O'Malley said, singling out Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, both Democrats. ""It's a case study in robbing and raiding.""\Christie's $33.8 billion budget proposal and the alternative spending plan put forward by Democratic leaders -- a $35.3 billion proposal -- include only $33 million for NJ Transit.\Other members of the group said the fare increases would have a ripple effect, leading to more congestion on the roads as people avoid costlier train and bus fares, and preventing more low-income residents from being able to afford their commute to work.\""Any increase in fares would jeopardize their budgets, which are already stretched to the max,"" said Serena Rice, executive director of the New Jersey Anti-Poverty Network.\""They should be directing their criticism at the administration and at NJ Transit,"" a Sweeney spokesman, Richard McGrath, responded. ""Senate President Sweeney and his Democratic colleagues are not only opposed to the fare increase, they have been strong and consistent in their support of the state's transportation priorities, including a renewed Transportation Trust Fund and mass transit services that are efficient and affordable.""\A spokesman for Prieto, Tom Hester Jr., said Democrats have urged NJ Transit -- which runs railways and buses across the state -- to control its costs.\He added that Prieto was the only leader openly talking about an increase in the gas tax last year as a way to replenish the state's Transportation Trust Fund, which is struggling under a high debt load and which will run out of funding options within a year."
362," Federal highway officials agreed Tuesday to release $150 million for six New Jersey projects while talks continue about the way the state is financing its share of the costs, the state's two U.S. senators announced.\ The money had been promised but was withdrawn.\ Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg said the agreement showed that their threat to block the Bush administration's nominee to head the Federal Highway Administration was effective.\ ""The Bush administration has blinked,"" Lautenberg said.\ The Senate Environment and Public Works committee is scheduled to hold a confirmation hearing today on J. Richard Capka's nomination to be administrator of the highway agency, known in federal parlance as the FHWA. Capka serves as acting administrator.\ Lautenberg and Menendez said last week they would use an informal Senate procedure, known as a ""hold,"" to prevent a confirmation vote until the highway money was released. They said Tuesday that they would release their hold.\ The dispute centers on how New Jersey comes up with its share of the money for multiyear projects funded by the state and federal governments. The FHWA had objected that New Jersey's Transportation Trust Fund was nearing insolvency and the federal agency held up funding because the state could not demonstrate it would be able to meet its obligations.\ Officials want to avoid beginning a project that cannot be completed because financing runs out.\ Last month, Governor Corzine signed a bill to replenish the trust fund through refinancing old bonds and issuing new debt. He did not seek an increase in the gas tax dedicated to transporta-tion, as highway construction compa- nies and labor unions had urged him to do.\ The FHWA initially rejected the state's new funding plan. Specifically, it objected to the state's plan to raise money for multiyear projects a year at a time, rather than all at once. The state's entire congressional delegation complained in a letter that such multiyear funding was allowed in the past.\ According to the two senators, the FHWA's deputy administrator told officials from the state Department of Transportation on Tuesday that the six delayed projects would be funded and the FHWA recognized that multiyear funding was used in the past.\ The FHWA did not return a call seeking comment.\ ***\ (SIDEBAR)\ Back on track\ The six highway projects that had been affected by the funding dispute:\ * Work on the Route 280/Garden State Parkway interchange in East Orange.\ * Route 78 in Union, Hillside, Irvington and Newark.\ * The Delilah Road bridges in Absecon and Pleasantville.\ * The Route 440-High Street connector in Perth Amboy.\ * Widening Route 1 in Edison and Woodbridge.\ * Work on Route 295 in Greenwich, East Greenwich and West Deptford.\ ***\ E-mail: jackson@northjersey.com"
363,"UNLESS you take a helicopter everywhere, it's impossible to miss the poor state of the roads. Potholes, bumps and cracks make the simplest trips seem like an amusement park ride. Then you look up, and all the trash on the medians and embankments reminds you of exactly where you are: the Garden State, land of the flat tire, dented rim and soda-can school of landscape design.\It will not come as any surprise that a report by the state Department of Transportation bears out the bumpy road theory.\Half of the state's highways are rated ""deficient,"" Staff Writer Karen Rouse reports. Unfortunately, that's status quo. The percentage has stayed about the same since 2004. To count as deficient, roads may be rough, with ""large potholes and deep cracks,"" and the underlying foundation may be quite worn.\Thirty percent of the highways are considered in ""fair"" condition, and a mere 20 percent make it to ""good."" Not pretty. The data for the new report are from 2009. We can only imagine how the ratings break down these days, after a terrible winter and a couple of floods.\The Christie administration's proposed five-year transportation spending plan would include putting $284 million toward road repair projects in the new fiscal year that starts July 1. It's a higher amount than in the past, but we don't know if it's enough. Overall, Governor Christie's plan would borrow about $4 billion and fold it in with contributions from the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the Port Authority and the state's general fund for an $8 billion budget. The state would borrow less money than in previous administrations, but it can afford to since it snagged the money dedicated to the Hudson River rail tunnel project that Christie axed in the fall.\A temporary increase in the state gas tax would help bulk up the overall capital plan and allow for less borrowing. Seven other states, including Maryland, are considering raising their gas taxes to fix their roads.\However it's done, the roads must be repaired. Cars suffer from the constant wear and tear, which means drivers suffer from mechanics' bills. That's an added financial strain during an already tough period. But there is something easy motorists can do to help fix the highways and clean up the environment: Stop throwing trash out the car window.\The DOT is working under a tight budget, so it cannot afford to spend as much time picking up litter as before. For companies wanting to step in and ""adopt"" a stretch of road to keep clean, at least 50 signs on highways tell them to call a now-defunct 800 number, The Record's Road Warrior reports. Not helpful. In the meantime, the view from the windshield is dispiriting, with water bottles, plastic bags, paper and other trash strewn over the sides of the roads. It makes the pocked roads seem worse.\Keep the garbage in the car. If only the solution to fixing the roads were that simple."
364,"GANNETT STATE BUREAU\Top officials in Gov. Corzine's administration traded barbs with a key Democratic lawmaker Monday over plans to sell or lease a state asset, such as the New Jersey Turnpike, for an immediate cash infusion.\Assemblyman John Wisniewski, D-Middlesex, chairman of the Assembly transportation committee, said it was an ""affront to the Legislature"" that Treasurer Bradley Abelow and Transportation Commissioner Kris Kolluri declined an invitation to testify Monday on the administration's plans.\The two Cabinet officers quickly responded that it was ""irresponsible"" for the committee to hold hearings attacking plans that are still being crafted.\""We view it as being people trying to be . . . pre-emptive and create an environment where it's impossible to talk about this issue. Frankly, I'm surprised by that and I view it as irresponsible,"" Abelow said.\Abelow later added, ""We just don't understand people getting stuck in cement in opposition to something they haven't seen.""\Wisniewski, an outspoken opponent of any toll highway sale or lease, said lawmakers have ""an obligation"" to understand plans that he believes will forfeit years of revenue for a lump sum now.\""Everything that I've seen and have been told by the treasurer and the commissioner of transportation and the administration is about taking tomorrow's dollars and spending them today. If they want to show me how that's not true, they could have come here today and told us that,"" Wisniewski said. His committee discussed, but did not vote on, bills barring a sale or lease of the New Jersey Turnpike.\The sharp exchange illustrated the divide between Corzine, who made a fervent push for ""asset monetization"" Thursday during his budget address, and lawmakers, who are wary of the idea.\Wisniewski's committee already held one hearing in which members spent an afternoon beating up the idea. Corzine believes the state needs to creatively use its assets, such as toll roads or the state lottery, to raise revenue that could be applied to reduce debt and free up funding for priorities such as schools, open space and transit investment.\Upcoming presentation\Abelow said he hopes to make a formal proposal within four to six weeks, although it could take more time if Corzine has additional questions. Abelow expects to have ""months"" of hearings for the public and lawmakers once the administration lays out a plan, leaving time to understand about the issue.\""We're not going to spring anything on people,"" Abelow said.\While much of the focus remains on a potential windfall from the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway or state lottery, Abelow said the administration is also considering its options on the Atlantic City Expressway.\One option for the toll roads could involve borrowing against future toll revenue. Peter Humphreys, a partner in New York law firm McDremott Will & Emery, said the state could receive $1.2 billion now by raising tolls 15 percent and dedicating the new revenue to investors for 15 years. Under that scenario, the state would maintain all control over the roads.\During debate on the bills barring a toll road sale, Steven Gardner, a representative for construction workers and contractors, argued that without a new funding plan, the state would have to hike the gasoline tax by 30 cents to meet its current road construction needs. Wisniewski said a gas tax is a ""component"" of funding for transportation projects but did not say he supported a levy increase.\Jonathan Tamari: jtamari@gannett.com"

366,"GANNETT STATE BUREAU\Top officials in Gov. Corzine's administration traded barbs with a key Democratic lawmaker Monday over plans to sell or lease a state asset, such as the New Jersey Turnpike, for an immediate cash infusion.\Assemblyman John Wisniewski, D-Middlesex, chairman of the Assembly transportation committee, said it was an ""affront to the Legislature"" that Treasurer Bradley Abelow and Transportation Commissioner Kris Kolluri declined an invitation to testify Monday on the administration's plans.\The two Cabinet officers quickly responded that it was ""irresponsible"" for the committee to hold hearings attacking plans that are still being crafted.\""We view it as being people trying to be . . . pre-emptive and create an environment where it's impossible to talk about this issue. Frankly, I'm surprised by that and I view it as irresponsible,"" Abelow said.\Abelow later added, ""We just don't understand people getting stuck in cement in opposition to something they haven't seen.""\Wisniewski, an outspoken opponent of any toll highway sale or lease, said lawmakers have ""an obligation"" to understand plans that he believes will forfeit years of revenue for a lump sum now.\""Everything that I've seen and have been told by the treasurer and the commissioner of transportation and the administration is about taking tomorrow's dollars and spending them today. If they want to show me how that's not true, they could have come here today and told us that,"" Wisniewski said. His committee discussed, but did not vote on, bills barring a sale or lease of the New Jersey Turnpike.\The sharp exchange illustrated the divide between Corzine, who made a fervent push for ""asset monetization"" Thursday during his budget address, and lawmakers, who are wary of the idea.\Wisniewski's committee already held one hearing in which members spent an afternoon beating up the idea. Corzine believes the state needs to creatively use its assets, such as toll roads or the state lottery, to raise revenue that could be applied to reduce debt and free up funding for priorities such as schools, open space and transit investment.\Upcoming presentation\Abelow said he hopes to make a formal proposal within four to six weeks, although it could take more time if Corzine has additional questions. Abelow expects to have ""months"" of hearings for the public and lawmakers once the administration lays out a plan, leaving time to understand about the issue.\""We're not going to spring anything on people,"" Abelow said.\While much of the focus remains on a potential windfall from the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway or state lottery, Abelow said the administration is also considering its options on the Atlantic City Expressway.\One option for the toll roads could involve borrowing against future toll revenue. Peter Humphreys, a partner in New York law firm McDremott Will & Emery, said the state could receive $1.2 billion now by raising tolls 15 percent and dedicating the new revenue to investors for 15 years. Under that scenario, the state would maintain all control over the roads.\During debate on the bills barring a toll road sale, Steven Gardner, a representative for construction workers and contractors, argued that without a new funding plan, the state would have to hike the gasoline tax by 30 cents to meet its current road construction needs. Wisniewski said a gas tax is a ""component"" of funding for transportation projects but did not say he supported a levy increase.\Jonathan Tamari: jtamari@gannett.com"
367,"New Jersey's key location and vast transportation assets—including seaports, airports and highways—make it indispensable for the movement of goods and a key driver of regional economic growth. It also means that heavy traffic and road conditions are a constant battle. In the aftermath of necessary increases in the state's gas tax since 2016, efforts to improve the quality of our roads and bridges should continue to accelerate.\Fortunately for us, roads aren't the only corridors that move people and goods in our state. New Jersey's freight rail network, including major railroads like CSX and Norfolk Southern as well as 16 short line and regional railroads, is particularly well-suited to meet tomorrow's transportation demands.\That's the positive story I shared with Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey's 7th District earlier this month alongside fellow NJ rail advocates during a district meeting with the congressman. Where our roads have not kept pace, freight railroads are leading — whether its infrastructure investment, efficiency and cost, safety or sustainability.\Trucks are a necessary and vital component of our logistics system but not always the most efficient way to move large volumes of freight over long distances. Just a single train, for instance, can take hundreds of trucks off our roads and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions by 75% over trucks. And that train may serve dozens or more local businesses, sending New Jersey goods to destinations across the country, and in some cases, across the world.\One of New Jersey's rail-served businesses is Kuiken Brothers, a residential and commercial building materials supply company with eight locations across New Jersey – four of which have rail access. Its recent expansion to Newark includes over a quarter mile of rail siding to the waterfront, allowing them to receive direct shipments from manufacturing facilities across North America via the nationwide freight rail network.\Though trains move one-third of both U.S. exports and intercity freight, freight railroads aren't well understood. The biggest misconception is around how they're run: freight railroads are private businesses that pay their own way with little help from taxpayers. The $25 billion they pour into the U.S. rail network annually has made it the best in the world in terms of productivity, cost and safety.\This success story is especially important now, as the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), which is charged with the economic regulation of railroads, is facing pressure to reimpose failed regulations on railroads, including rate caps and draconian service mandates that would undermine railroads' ability to invest what it takes to keep infrastructure healthy.\Government officials need to understand that a return to over-regulation would undercut not just the railroads, but also companies like Kuiken Brothers that provide supplies that are literally building communities and helping grow New Jersey's economy.\Rail's competitive environment is as tight as ever, especially as a softening economy and trade tensions have weakened all freight traffic. And the future of transportation, from automation to just-in-time delivery, is quickly changing the landscape across modes. STB regulators, as well as our federal policymakers, should recognize that a return to overregulation would undercut rail's ability to adapt and meet the demands of tomorrow's economy.\Chip Hallock is the President and CEO of the Newark Regional Business Partnership.\CREDIT: Chip Hallock"
368,"When Plainfield officials considered a resolution to support gay marriage in 2004, opponents were out in force objecting to the plan. The City Council eventually let the proposal drop.\But the idea had plenty of supporters as well, and city officials did not forget them. On Monday, the City Council is expected to approve the extension of health and pension benefits to registered domestic partners of public employees.\What's different this time around? The absence of the emotional marriage element. And it mirrors the sensible approach New Jersey has taken as a whole in tackling a volatile debate.\By providing most of the legal benefits of marriage to domestic partners, the state has solved many -- although not all -- of the practical concerns of same-sex partners without wading into the more turbulent waters of legalizing gay marriage. And it has opened the doors for local governing bodies to do the same.\We applaud Plainfield city officials for their persistence in finding a plan that works. Now they just need to seal the deal next week. A hit for Plainfield.\Other recent hits and misses:\<b>MISS: The door stays open\Gov. Jon Corzine's plan to keep the Transportation Trust Fund solvent by refinancing debt -- and thus increasing the debt long-term -- is a troubling approach to an urgent problem. There is perhaps an argument to be made that no better alternatives are available given the state's current budget crisis. But what <i>is indefensible is the failure of lawmakers to constitutionally dedicate the fund's new revenue from the refinancing to transportation projects alone. The need for that particular reform was touted by legislators on both sides of the aisle throughout last year's campaigning. But now they're not bothering, instead settling for an irrelevant statement in the plan that all 10.5 cents of the state's per-gallon gas tax will go to the trust fund. As if that could be remotely trusted.\<b>HIT: Survival of the loudest\When Rutgers University was considering a major reorganization of four of its colleges into one School of Arts and Sciences, most of the opposition came from one of the affected schools, the all-women's Douglass College. Faculty and alumnae of the college protested that they did not want to see the school lose its distinct, nurturing environment for women. Officials listened, and when the school's Board of Governors recently adopted the reorganization plan, Douglass College's all-female campus and women's-oriented programs were preserved. Some Douglass supporters still complained about an accompanying name change to Douglass Residential College, but that strikes us a fairly minor concession.\<b>HIT: They try to serve\If nothing else, the Motor Vehicle Commission does <i>try to be a more customer-friendly place than its Division of Motor Vehicles predecessor. Officials have adopted numerous reforms in hopes of making the oft-dreaded agency experience a kinder -- and faster -- process for everyone, and reviews for the most part have been positive. But how far will they go? The state is now planning to issue driver's licenses for six years -- rather than the usual four -- to hundreds of thousands of randomly selected drivers renewing their licenses this year and next. The goal is to spread renewals out more evenly year to year as officials worry about longer agency waits in 2006 and 2007 because of a spike in the number of expiring licenses.\<i> Agree? Disagree?

369,"TRENTON (GNJ) -- Transition advisory groups to Gov. Jon S. Corzine laid out an expansive series of recommendations for the newly elected Democrat to consider.\Some of the ideas won't happen, Corzine said. Others will take a long time. But others demand immediate attention, such as the military group's call for a law this month that enables the creation of a Local Redevelopment Authority for Fort Monmouth, which is slated to be closed by the Pentagon in 2011. That deadline can't be met.\The transportation advisers also called for prompt action, saying Corzine and lawmakers have until late March to adopt a plan for the near-broke Transportation Trust Fund.\They don't use the phrase ""gas tax"" anywhere in their report, though they call for financial reforms and unspecified ""new revenue."" They also suggest tying NJ Transit fare increases to growth in the agency's costs.\""His (Corzine's) response to this crisis will set the stage: He will either be credited with saving the system and creating a legacy of sizable, important transportation improvements, or he will be held responsible for the demise of New Jersey's highways, bridges and transit systems,"" the report says.\Among other ideas transition advisers say Corzine should consider:\A* Don't allow discussion about government spending at a proposed constitutional convention on property taxes, says the property tax panel.\A* Bar the ""wheeling"" of campaign funds, already banned in the first six months of the year, all year long, end political donations from corporation, require increased disclosure from lobbyists and have stronger anti-corruption laws, says the ethics group.\A* Sign an executive order that limits growth in special education tuition, create a panel that would design a new funding formula and begin an internship or ""fifth year"" in state universities' education programs, says the education group.\A* Video lottery terminals or slot machines -- operated by casinos -- at racetracks to increase purses for horse racing, says the agriculture group.\A* Larger buffer zones and reduced pesticides to protect water supplies, an immediate repeal of the fast-track development law and a fee on drinking water that would cost the average family about $2.40 a year, says the environment group.\A* Incentives for renewable energy and banning off-shore oil drilling, says the energy group.\A* Loan forgiveness to entice people into nursing careers, says the health and seniors group.\A* Making prisons safer from gangs through a new division on gang intelligence, more training for guards and restoring overlapping shifts so guards have time to communicate with their relief, says the corrections group.\A* On the rehabilitation side, the corrections group says Corzine should contemplate whether to scrap mandatory minimum sentences, at least as they relate to drug-free school zones.\A* Stop using the unemployment fund to pay hospitals for ""charity care"" provided to uninsured patients, as has been done since 1993, leaving the fund with a balance so small a tax hike on business looms in 2007, says the labor group. Appoint a commission recommend a new funding plan by April.\A* Double funding for rental assistance, expand eligibility for housing aid to any households earning less than 2.5 times the poverty level and reorganize state housing programs into a single entity focused on housing, community development and urban revitalization, says the housing group.\A* Create ""Priority Enterprise Zones""-- or PEZs -- in existing urban enterprise zones, places with unique impediments to job, commerce and housing creation that would get first priority for aid and where small business could get bigger tax credits, says the community revitalization group."

376,"TRENTON -- The idea of taxing owners of certain cars by the mile to pay for road maintenance has more skeptics than supporters, based on reactions Monday to a state lawmaker's first public airing of his plan.\So state Sen. Jim Whelan changed course at the Senate Transportation Committee hearing, saying owners of alternative-fueled and electric vehicles should pay a flat fee of $50 to cover their share of funding for road maintenance and repairs.\Whelan said arguments over the pay-by-mile plan will take place another day, predicting it could become the preferred way to pay for road maintenance and repairs. Not all of his colleagues concurred.\Sen. Joe Pennacchio, a Republican from Morris County, said a per-mile fee would be similar to letting ""the proverbial camel's nose in the tent. Once you start charging people by the mile, once you get that implemented, it would be a lot easier to just keep rising up those costs.""\Currently the owners of plug-in electric vehicles, since they don't have to visit the gas station, don't pay the 14-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, as owners of conventional vehicles do. The tax is a major source of funding for road infrastructure.\Originally Whelan, a Democrat who represents most of Atlantic County, wanted to charge electric and alternative-fueled vehicles a fee of 0.00839 cents per mile traveled but the idea was widely panned.\""This bill has the dubious distinction of having been labeled by the Asbury Park Press as the worst idea out there,"" said Whelan, referring to a recent editorial urging him to ""take his bill to the legislative equivalent of a junkyard.""\""While it may be the worst idea, I would also argue it's the best idea because quite frankly it's the only idea,"" Whelan said. ""Our transportation trust fund doesn't have the dollars it needs going forward.""\The committee did not vote on his flat-fee plan. Another hearing on the bill (S-2531) will take place in the future.\Whelan said of the per-mile charge: ""In discussion with some of our colleagues, including leadership, there is really some (unwillingness) on that.""\Instead, Whelan said a $50 user fee annually would help cover the infrastructure tab for electric vehicles. He said gas taxes paid by the owner of a car that gets 30 miles per gallon, traveling 12,000 miles in a year, comes to $57.\""Fifty dollars, frankly, is a bargain,"" he said.\Jeff Tittel, New Jersey director of the Sierra Club, said the fee could turn consumers away from purchasing alternate-fueled vehicles.\""We need to look at other funding sources for transportation. We think this becomes an unfair tax on those vehicles. The whole reason that we're promoting these types of vehicles is to get people out of gas-guzzlers like SUVs and to get people to become more efficient,"" Tittel said.\In the first draft of his bill, Whelan wanted to apply per-mile fees for all vehicles.\""The amended bill has a focus solely on alternate-fuel vehicles. The problem with the gas tax is really two fold. Cars are more efficient. That's a good thing for the environment and a good thing for the consumer, but when you go from 20 miles per gallon to 30 miles per gallon, you've lost one third of the revenue for the transportation trust fund. Second, alternate-fuel vehicles, including the electric car, pay zero. They literally get a free ride,"" he said.\Bob Jordan 609-984-4343, bjordan@\njpressmedia.com"
377,"TRENTON - After first dodging a question about whether he improperly accepted a $3,600 clock from a campaign contributor who is now in prison, U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, more pugnacious than usual, denied accepting the gift during a debate yesterday with Republican Douglas Forrester.\The two men, in a heated race for a U.S. Senate seat, faced off in their second televised debate last night night.\In his opening statement, Forrester hit hard on the ethics issues dogging Torricelli, while the senator, known as the Torch, tried to keep the focus on issues, saying Forrester is out of step ideologically with New Jersey residents.\Forrester, introducing himself as the man running against Torricelli, declared, ""Bob Torricelli has failed us. He has not been telling us the truth for years.""\Torricelli declared that the race is not between himself and Forrester. ""It's between Doug Forrester and just about everybody else.""\Torricelli said he is the candidate who will protect a woman's right to choose, an issue he said hangs by a single vote in the nation's high court.\Forrester, who described himself as favoring abortion rights, said he would not use abortion as a test for Supreme Court nominees.\But Torricelli charged that Forrester is not ""pro-choice"" because the Republican does not favor taxpayer funding of abortions or partial-birth abortions and supports parental notification.\Forrester faced challenging questions from Torricelli and a reporter about the issue of whether or not he favored an increase in the the gas tax to pay for environmental clean-ups. The Republican failed to acknowledge he misspoke during a newspaper interview this week.\""The issue is not to blame anyone here,"" Forrester contended.\While Forrester charged that Torricelli has failed to clean up Superfund sites in New Jersey, Torricelli challenged Forrester's proposal to use general funds to clean up the sites because the Democrat said it would raise taxes.\Each candidate accused the other during the debate of not giving consistent and honest answers.\""I don't know that I needed to be here,"" Torricelli said. ""You could have debated with yourself.""\Forrester shot back later, ""Arguing with Torricelli is like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.""\Under fire over ethics, Torricelli said he will fight for abortion rights, gun control and the environment.\Forrester said he would fight for New Jersey without giving it a black eye and making it the butt of jokes nationwide.\The debate came on the heels of a Quinnipiac University survey showing the race near a statistical dead heat. The poll has Forrester leading, 48-44 percent, among likely voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\Aired live on New Jersey Network public television and radio, the second TV debate of the campaign was sponsored by NJN, the Gannett New Jersey Newspaper Group and others. It will be rebroadcast at noon Sunday.\The Senate race has pitted a veteran Democratic lawmaker, mired in ethics questions, against a former West Windsor mayor and little-known Republican in his first statewide race.\Torricelli, 51, of Hunterdon County, plummeted in the polls after the Senate Ethics Committee severely admonished him for taking gifts from a campaign contributor, David Chang, at a time when the senator was using his office to help Chang with the U.S. and foreign governments.\The ethics issue has been kept alive by Forrester, who has made it the focus of his campaign.\Torricelli, for his part, has been striving since the start of the campaign to raise questions about Forrester's company, BeneCard Services Inc. Forrester, 49, a West Windsor millionaire and former Treasury official under Republican Gov. Tom Kean, is president of the Lawrence-based prescription benefit management company.\Torricelli's campaign has accused BeneCard of cutting deals with pharmaceutical companies and then not passing the savings on to clients. Forrester has denied the charge, saying he could not stay in business if he did not deliver a good service to his corporate and government clients.\Outside NJN studios at Front and Stockton streets in Trenton, Torricelli and Forrester supporters had their own loud face-off before the debate with signs and chants supporting their respective candidates. While Torricelli supporters chanted, ""Six more years,"" Forrester supporters responded, ""In jail."""
378,"BUSINESS WRITER\New Jersey's economy, once envied for its highly skilled work force and its cutting-edge research, has veered off course, business leaders said Monday.\What will put it back on track?\New Jersey Chamber of Commerce officials, in a meeting with the Asbury Park Press editorial board, discussed the chamber's ""Platform for Progress,"" a plan that examined six issues they said need to be addressed to improve the business climate and create high-paying jobs again.\""We're trying to make this state competitive again,"" said Thomas Bracken, president and chief executive officer of Vineland-based Sun Bancorp and chairman of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce.\Business officials have been confronted in recent months with statistics that they say are cause for concern. For example, the state's labor market isn't growing as fast as the rest of the country, and the jobs it is creating often pay less.\To reverse the trend, chamber officials said the state needs to focus on six areas. They are:\Government reform. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, New Jersey state and local officials have the third highest average salary nationwide, putting a strain on taxpayers. The chamber called for the state to adopt wide-ranging ethical reforms and look at eliminating layers of government.\Economic development. New Jersey has the third-highest cost of doing business nationwide, according to Economy.com. The chamber called for the state to create incentive programs for existing businesses, particularly small businesses.\Education. New Jersey has the highest cost per pupil from kindergarten to 12th grade nationwide, according to the Census Bureau. The chamber called for the state to better analyze schools' performance and publicize the results through a state Web site. And it wants the state to recruit science and math teachers, even if it means paying them more.\Environment. New Jersey has among the most stringent environmental regulations nationwide, some of which change often, chamber officials said. The chamber wants the state to base new environmental laws on widely accepted scientific findings and apply federal standards where it can.\Health care. New Jersey has the nation's fifth highest cost of family health insurance coverage for workers covered by their employer $10,168, according to a 2003 study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Chamber officials said the state should reform the insurance market so insurers can provide more options for small employers.\Transportation. New Jersey workers' average commute of 29.4 minutes is the third longest in the nation, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Chamber officials encouraged Gov. Corzine to increase the gasoline tax to pay for transportation projects. Corzine instead wants to refinance bonds, which chamber officials said only will add to the state's debt.\""If you raise the gas tax, it has to be dedicated only to transportation projects,"" said Hazel Gluck, a Trenton lobbyist who is leading the chamber's transportation committee. ""In the absence of it being dedicated, (lawmakers) will take it into the general fund and use it for something else."""
379,"RIDGEFIELD PARK -- A group of about 40 activists braved below-freezing temperatures Sunday to urge Governor Christie and the CSX Transportation Co. to rehabilitate two bridges crossing Overpeck Creek, near the Hackensack River, which they say could cause a huge oil spill or explosion if not repaired soon.\The rally was coordinated by Paula Rogovin of the Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains, a Bergen County-based advocacy group. She and other activists contend that the two bridges serve rail lines that transport a volatile form of oil, Bakken crude, with each train carrying up to hundreds of thousands of gallons at a time from Albany to Philadelphia.\""What Bakken crude oil does, it explodes at a very low temperature,"" Rogovin said in a speech to other demonstrators. ""It's dangerous stuff, and we have two dangerous bridges.""\Rob Doolittle, a spokesman for CSX, which owns one of the two bridges, said Thursday that the spans were last inspected in August and were found to be in ""suitable condition for railroad operations,"" but did not elaborate.\""When you get your car inspected, the thickness of a penny can pass inspection,"" said Rob Gillies, vice president of Hackensack Riverkeeper's board of trustees. ""So, what do you want? Do you want something that can just pass inspection?""\Rogovin was hardly relieved by a promise from CSX that it would fix the bridge. ""It means nothing,"" Rogovin said. ""They don't tell us when."" The rail industry has successfully lobbied to keep inspection reports private, she said, adding, ""These accidents happen regularly, and we can't wait.""\Many of the speeches and signs at Sunday's rally cited a 2013 train derailment in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, which caused an explosion that destroyed much of the downtown, according to news reports.\""What happened in Quebec three years ago could happen here,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. ""Transportation policy shouldn't be hoping that an accident doesn't happen.""\The area near the Overpeck Bridge boasts a population far denser than those of other rail crashes, and could prove more deadly than the one in Lac-Megantic, Tittel said.\""If it happened here, thousands of lives would be at risk,"" said Assemblyman Tim Eustace, D-Paramus, who serves as chairman of the Assembly Environment Committee.\Eustace said that repairing the bridges would require rerouting trains over an alternate bridge, but that repairs like the one he is advocating should be paid for by the recently approved gas tax.\Money had been allocated to fix at least one of the bridges, but it was diverted shortly before several road and bridge projects were halted by the governor last summer, Eustace and Tittel said.\""Where's the money? Have any of you seen it?"" Eustace asked the crowd.\""The Christie administration likes closing bridges so much, here's one they should close,"" Tittel quipped.\Another rally will take place in Newark on Monday, with participants gathering in Military Park at noon, then marching to 1 Gateway Plaza, outside the offices of Sens. Cory Booker and Bob Menendez. The march is part of efforts to encourage Democratic lawmakers to resist President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet appointments, like Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon-Mobil, nominated to become secretary of state, and to oppose federal and state officials who deny the existence of climate change.\""Right now, we need Senate Democrats to do everything in their power"" to block Trump's nominations,"" said Matt Smith, a local representative of the Food & Water Watch advocacy group.\""What is going to move them to do that is the massive outcry from people like us."""
380," After months of weighing the impact on the state's finances and environment, Republican state legislators said Thursday they are set to approve a plan to spend $3.75 billion over the next four years on highway, rail, and other transportation projects.\ Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem announced they had reached an agreement on key differences in the Transportation Trust Fund. They said a vote on the proposal is expected in the next few weeks.\ The compromise plan provides for the expenditure of $900 million in the first year and $950 million during the next three years, with bonds capped at $650 million a year.\ The plan requires the passage of two bills: one to authorize the expenditures and the other to dedicate revenues from the wholesale gas tax and a portion of the sales tax on new cars to the trust fund.\ Calling it ""the state's largest road and infrastructure construction program ever,"" DiFrancesco said the compromise plan would keep a ""tight ceiling"" on debt. At the same time, he said, the plan ensures that transportation expenditures are made on a ""pay as you go"" basis.\ It is slightly less than DiFrancesco has advocated in the past, but includes issuing more bonds than his previous proposal. The compromise plan calls for spending slightly more than another measure proposed by Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Alex DeCroce, R-Parsippany-Troy Hills.\ Whether Governor Whitman will back the plan, however, was unclear Thursday. Spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor, said the governor is still reviewing the proposal. O'Connor said Whitman has not yet taken a position on the constitutional amendment.\ In the past, Whitman appeared reluctant to support a measure that would tie her hands and those of her successors. She has argued that balancing the budget could become more difficult if a portion of the state budget was set aside for one purpose in a constitutional amendment.\ Senator Shirley K. Turner, D-Mercer, a member of the senate transportation committee, criticized the GOP leaders plan because it failed to restrict construction of new highways in undeveloped areas of the state.\ ""Trust fund spending must be guided by a vision for a safer and less congested state,"" Turner said. ""The agreement announced today is devoid of any integrated strategy that New Jersey needs to improve mobility.""\ But Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, D-Mercer, who is on DeCroce's committee, said committee members including Democrats were ""generally all on the same page,"" although he was concerned about whether the fund would encourage suburban sprawl.\ DeCroce's committee hearing was attended by a dozen or so environmentalists wearing Day-Glo yellow stickers with the word ""sprawl"" in the middle of a no-entry sign.\ During testimony on the various trust fund proposals, several environmental groups expressed concern that the trust fund would encourage development in environmentally sensitive areas of the state.\ Several speakers urged the committee to specifically focus the proposals on repairing and maintaining infrastructure the so-called ""Fix It First"" principle as well as improving pedestrian safety and easing congestion.\ They called for the legislation to include a priority list of projects.\ ""Preserving the infrastructure investment that we have already made is just basic common sense,"" said Marie A. Curtis, executive director of the New Jersey Environmental Lobby.\ In response, DeCroce said that whatever bill is passed would not allow the construction of new highways. And Collins later said that his bill would require legislative approval before any new highways could be built.\ But Kristen Fountain, spokeswoman for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said that Collins provision would do nothing to halt new highways and the sprawl that often follows. She said the Legislature has previously approved plans for at least 50 proposed highways, which means they could be built under the trust fund compromise reached Thursday.\ ""As it stands, it's a pro-sprawl provision,"" she said. ""The claim that this is an anti-sprawl provision is made extremely moot by the fact that it exempts highways that have been authorized by previous New Jersey laws."" Staff Writer Hugh R.

381,"Some of the immediate, critical response to Gov. Chris Christie's call Thursday for using his executive powers to close a $2.2 billion budget gap by withholding education money and by cutting funding for public transportation among hundreds of other programs.\Barbara Keshishian, president of the New Jersey Education Association: ""NJEA understands this crisis is real, and that the budget must be balanced. The governor's proposal to cut state education aid would not be advisable under normal circumstances. ""These are not normal circumstances, but like many of the Band-Aids and gimmicks of prior years that he justifiably condemns, his order could have serious unintended consequences for the future of our public schools. ""Many school districts use the excess surplus funds from one budget year as revenue to support programs or property tax reductions the following year. ""With this order, the burden is on the governor to ensure that he has adequate funding in his FY2011 budget to fund the public schools of New Jersey. ""With this order, he has assumed full responsibility for maintaining the future quality of ""the state's public schools, which are among the very best in the nation. ""We are also distressed that the governor has announced his intention to continue the destructive practice of not funding the state's pension funds. It is precisely that failure by prior governors and prior legislatures that has led to the underfunding of the pension system. Teachers and school employees have contributed billions of dollars to that system in the past 15 years while the state has consistently failed to contribute its fair share. ""It is outrageous that our new governor would openly encourage the legislature to continue the fiscally irresponsible practices that have brought us to this point. ""NJEA's goal is to protect the best public education system in America, and we will never abandon that goal. It is the responsibility of the governor and the Legislature to ensure that today's public schools -- and those of tomorrow -- have the resources they need to educate the next generation of children at the highest levels. ""Cutting their budgets is not the path to that goal. It is the path to educational ruin."" Kate Slevin, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a regional policy watchdog organization: ""Gov. Christie is sending the wrong message for the state's transportation priorities by penalizing transit riders while refusing to consider an increase in the gas tax or other driver fees. ... ""Transit fare increases are tax increases."" Peter Kasabach, executive director of NJ Future: ""Raising fees for transit use, instead of raising fees for road use, will dampen the years of progress that the state has made increasing transit ridership, focusing growth and redevelopment near transit stations and working to get more cars off the road."" Doug O'Malley, field director for Environment New Jersey: ""This is a nasty snowball from Gov. Christie to transit riders. NJ Transit is already cutting back service, and additional cuts will mean more stranded riders and fare hikes -- and less people riding our trains and buses."" Rebecca Alper, New Jersey Public Interest Group Program Associate: ""If Gov. Christie wants to cut waste in New Jersey, cutting public transit and forcing people onto our already congested roadways is the wrong way to go. According to a 2007 Texas Transportation Institute report, in the metro New York area alone, our transit system saves us over 216 million hours in delays each year."" Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club: ""This will lead to higher fares and cuts in services at a time when people are using public transportation more than ever before. We'll still be subsidizing highways in the middle of nowhere as funding for mass transit goes down, leading to more traffic and air pollution."" Carlos Rodrigues, vice president and New Jersey director of the Regional Plan Association: ""NJTransit is already operating at bare bones. The agency was cut $62 million in the last budget."""

For the second time in four years, Atlantic City, a showcase for some of the best boxing matches, featured Gov. Chris Christie and its sitting mayor, Don Guardian. During Hurricane Sandy, the national spotlight was on Christie and then Mayor Lorenzo Langford over the evacuation issue. As a result, the city's image was tarnished. This time, the nation witnessed the governor and Guardian going toe-to-toe, to the point where each was shifting blame from one to the other, and the governor calling the mayor a liar. This time, the city's image as well as its residents suffered a setback.
\
However, once the dust settles and as much as Christie enjoys going toe-to-toe and shouting, one thing is for sure. The governor will never burn any bridges, but he may shut down a few of the lanes from time to time.

Bottle deposit plan
\
is still another tax
\
You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You can put a different name (deposit) on a new revenue stream, but it's still a tax. Here's why:
\
Of course you can reclaim your deposit. If so inclined, you'll save all the containers which were taxed. You'll cart them off to wherever the return stations are located. And then you'll painstakingly deposit them one at a time. And it's probably the last time you bother. Which your state legislators fervently hope.
\
But, you say, the money is being directed to benefit the environment and health of New Jersey citizens. Think about other directed revenue streams. For instance the gas tax and the transportation fund. And the construction unions are certainly more powerful than the environmental industry.
\
So a bottle deposit is still a tax.

End state income tax
\
on retirees to keep them
\
Gov. Chris Christie once said the public employees work in New Jersey and move to Florida upon retirement to avoid paying state tax. Here's an idea. Why not eliminate state income tax for retired people? This would keep New Jersey seniors from moving out. Seniors elsewhere would be seduced to move here.
\
New Jersey just lost a billionaire because of its outrageous state income tax. How many more will move out because of the outlandishly high state income tax?
\
Seniors bring money to spend and no children to attend schools, eliminating the need to expand the already overly expensive school system. They go out to restaurants, shopping malls and casinos, just to mention a small portion of their spending activity. Let's start thinking with some logic and not with animosity.

383," Governor Corzine approved an ambitious new attack on global warming Wednesday that could mean countless changes large and small in everyday life from the types of bulbs and appliances we buy to where we live and how we commute.\ The Democrat signed an executive order requiring the state to cut heat-trapping greenhouse gases 20 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by mid-century the levels many scientists say will be necessary to stave off potentially catastrophic shifts in the climate.\ ""We need to find better ways to protect our environment and make sure that the Jersey Shore doesn't get swamped under a rising tide of oceans that come with global warming,"" Corzine told an assembly of middle school students in West Orange.\ Citing dangers to the coastline from rising sea levels, he called on the state Legislature to pass a law making the goals permanent. His plan would put New Jersey ahead of all but California among states tackling global warming.\ Experts in New Jersey said much of the cuts for the 2020 goal could be achieved by relatively inexpensive efforts to cut energy use. Much of the responsibility will fall on individuals to take small if unglamorous steps such as turning down the thermostat or replacing traditional light bulbs with more efficient fluorescent bulbs.\ The state will once again try to encourage the public to drive less and use more mass transit or car-pool, environmentalists said. Among their many recommendations are policies to reduce sprawl in the Garden State so people don't have to drive long distances between work and home.\ The state will rely more on solar, wind and other renewable energies to produce its power and on electricity, biodiesel and other alternative fuels to run vehicles.\ ""People will still be living in single-family homes and driving cars,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the state Sierra Club. ""The difference is those cars and homes will be much more efficient and won't produce greenhouse gases.""\ Environmental groups welcomed the order. Most importantly, activists said, the move will put pressure on the federal government to adopt nationwide caps on greenhouse gases.\ One of the state's leading business groups reacted more cautiously, however, noting New Jersey already has some of the highest electricity rates in the country and that more regulation would likely drive costs even higher.\ ""Right now, we're at a competitive disadvantage with other states,"" said Sara Bluhm, an assistant vice president with the state's Business and Industry Association. ""We're trying to keep our jobs here.""\ Electricity prices may rise in the short run, Corzine acknowledged, but they'll be balanced by decreased energy use.\ ""If we don't do this,"" he warned, ""the scientists tell us we are going to face real challenges as a society.""\ Carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse culprit, is produced by the burning of coal, oil and gas.\ The Corzine administration said many of the reductions could be achieved by promoting energy conservation that could end up saving money in the end. As a start, the state will likely change building codes and require manufacturers to sell more efficient appliances in New Jersey.\ The order comes less than two weeks after an international panel of scientists and world governments issued its grimmest assessment yet of global warming. The International Panel on Climate Change said the earth was ""very likely"" heating up due to human activity and that the atmospheric changes were already contributing to stronger hurricanes and killer heat waves.\ Locally, researchers say, rising seas caused by melting polar ice caps could eventually increase flooding in the Meadowlands and other low-lying areas. Extended droughts and sudden storms could strain state water supplies, one Princeton University team predicted last year.\ The executive order, modeled after a plan adopted by California last year, gives state agencies six months to come up with a slate of recommendations to reduce emissions. The plan is likely to include a slew of new state regulations aimed at various carbon sources, as well as emission caps that leave it to the private sector to figure out how to meet the new limits.\ Much depends on whether the national government follows suit. If it does, any financial pain will be absorbed over the entire economy; if it doesn't, New Jersey may lose jobs and residents to neighboring states that don't cap emissions, said Frank Felder, director of Rutgers' Center for Energy, Economic and Environmental Policy.\ It's hard to predict decades out, but hitting the 2050 goal could be harder, Felder and other economists added.\ Once the ""low-hanging fruit"" of energy efficiency is plucked, the state could have to consider a tax on energy use or carbon emissions. One environmental group in Trenton has suggested a vehicle tax based on fuel economy the more gas you guzzle, the more you would pay.\ ""Will it grind the economy to a halt? No,"" Felder said. ""Will people see the price impacts? Yes. If they don't see the price impacts, then we'll just have a policy on the books that's not doing anything.""\ **\ Fast facts\ Governor Corzine's plan would likely include:\ * Encouraging use of hybrid vehicles\ * Beefing up mass transit\ * Investing in wind, solar and other renewable energies\ * ""Changing consumer habits"" by encouraging energy conservation\ * Discussion of a gas tax hike to fund mass transit (though Corzine said he wasn't ready to endorse the idea)"
384,"Until last week, the next oil...the critical resource growing ever scarcer and prompting desperate behavior to ensure supplies...was water. Turns out, it's rice.\That's at least what some Asian leaders think. Hence a plan in Southeast Asia to create an OPEC-like cartel to manage rice supplies amid record prices. Thailand and Vietnam account for almost half of global rice exports. Add in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and Asia's cartel would wield even more power over food prices than OPEC does with oil.\It's a terrible idea. For one thing, an Organization of Rice Exporting Countries, or OREC, would presumably favor high\prices. That may benefit producers, but hurt consumers everywhere. For another, the timing is awful with commodity prices reaching unprecedented levels.\Haruhiko Kuroda, president of the Asian Development Bank in Manila, says ""the agriculture market should be market-driven"" and that ""any kind of cartel isn't good for the exporters and the importers."" Philippines Senator Edgardo Angara says it would ""create an oligopoly and it's against humanity.""\It's hard to see how a rice cartel would even work. With oil, you have reserves...actual stockpiles of the commodity. Rice needs to be harvested. Its production is dependent on weather, the cost of fertilizer and the availability of arable land and water. And how exactly can you control farmers growing rice or not growing it?\Asia's disparate economies also aren't renowned for cooperation. Among Mekong Delta nations you have a constitutional monarchy, an immature multiparty democracy, two communist states and a military regime...all at very different levels of development. Seriously, folks, good luck making that work.\The real story here is this: The very idea of a rice cartel speaks to the desperation with which Asia is treating food-price trends.\Food security hijacked recent meetings of the ADB and Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean. At the ADB event in Madrid, there was vague, yet worrisome talk of 1997- like crises in certain Asian nations. Not a regional\meltdown that sends contagion across the globe, but scattered ones.\One sign of the anxiety coursing through Asia is talk in India of suspending trading in more food futures as political pressure grows. India has already halted trading in wheat, rice and lentils. Now there's pressure to ban dealing in cooking oil, sugar and other commodities.\The idea of banning commodities trading sounds farfetched. Markets play an important role in valuing goods and redistributing them. Yet speculation in everything from oil to gold to food is causing froth in prices. There's a speculative bubble in speculation.\It says something about the crazy market environment we're living in when George Soros leaps out of retirement to get in on it. Good timing, too: Soros earned an estimated $2.9 billion last year, according to Institutional Investor's Alpha Magazine.\""If rightly or wrongly people perceive that commodities-futures trading is contributing to a speculation-driven rise in prices, then in a democracy you will have to heed that voice,"" Indian Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told Bloomberg on May 4.\It makes you wonder why exchanges don't start demanding that buyers take delivery of the commodities they trade. The bottom line is that Wall Street doesn't realize the effect that food prices are having on the developing world.\Talk of trading bans is enough to send chills down the spines of disciples of Milton Friedman. Then again, one could argue that those who believe oil prices are set by the market are delusional. OPEC ultimately controls the value of oil...not traders.\Asia is especially vulnerable to rising food costs. It's home to the bulk of the world's population and families living in poverty. Many of the most promising markets are also there.\Global food prices surged 57 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the United Nations. ADB officials estimate food expenditure accounts for 60 percent of household outlays for poor families...75 percent when fuel costs are added.\It isn't hard to see why Asia is considering drastic measures. To many in the region, creating a rice cartel seems no more irrational than the Federal Reserve saving Bear Stearns Cos. from collapse. Yet OPEC's influence is a cautionary tale.\U.S. President George W. Bush in January traveled through the Persian Gulf begging for an increase in oil production to\give U.S. consumers a break. Bush's pleas fell on deaf ears.\On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has ratcheted up the rhetoric on OPEC. While the summertime gas-tax holiday proposed by U.S. presidential candidates Clinton and John McCain is just plain stupid, she's right to question the world's most-watched cartel.\""They can no longer be a cartel, a monopoly that get together once every couple of months in some conference room in some plush place in the world and decide how much oil they're going to produce and what price they're going to put it at,"" she said in Indiana this week.\Given how global markets are held hostage by OPEC, a rice cartel hardly seems like a wise move.\William Pesek is a Bloomberg News columnist."
385,"That braying you hear is from the sacred cows reacting to the first move of an impending fight over spending, public priorities and the role of government -- a moment that was purposely pushed beyond the elections, but now is upon us.\Democrat Erskine Bowles and Republican Alan Simpson, co-chairs of President Barack Obama's bipartisan deficit-reduction commission, engaged in a classic pre-emptive political maneuver by putting virtually everything, including Social Security and Medicare, on the cutting table. They did it in a press conference three weeks before the official release deadline of their much-anticipated report.\Among their proposals, which drew criticism even from other members of the panel, were cuts in Medicare payments to doctors, lawyers and drug companies, necessitating higher co-payments. Social Security would be means-tested, meaning richer recipients could get less; and cost-of-living increases would be held down.\Other slashes are proposed, including cuts in the federal workforce and in federal contracts, and elimination of pork-barrel ""earmarks,"" although the latter would be more symbolic than substantive, given the relatively small amount of dollars involved.\It is called framing the debate, a classic move by political actors who know the audience is not predisposed to like much of anything they will do.\The recoil was predictable. The liberal Democracy for America called it ""war on Social Security.""\Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the proposals ""extremely disappointing and something that should be vigorously opposed by the American people.""\""Frankly,"" he said in a press release issued hours after Bowles and Simpson spoke, ""there will not be too much demand within the construction industry for 69-year-old bricklayers.""\Reality check: Simpson and Bowles proposed raising the retirement age to 69 by the year 2075. That is 65 years away. By then, who knows if houses will still even be made of brick?\Republicans reacted more favorably to the rough draft, in part because while it proposed to slaughter sacred cows, like deductions for children and mortgage interest, and while it raised the income level subject to Social Security taxes, it also proposed lower income tax rates overall. A 15 cents-a-gallon gas tax increase might make tax-averse Republicans blanch, but it's difficult to pencil out serious deficit reduction without tax increases of some sort.\Franklin Delano Roosevelt's ""only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" 1932 inaugural line has been quoted a lot lately. But a more relevant FDR speech came in 1937, and it may provide a leadership cue for Obama.\FDR had cut government spending, stalling recovery from the Depression. He conducted one of his iconic fireside chats on Oct. 12, 1937, to call for a special session of Congress to address lingering economic problems. But he did it only after he had traveled the country for much of the year, in a non-election environment, to assess how people were coming out of the Depression. In essence, he led a national discussion on what Americans wanted their government to do.\A president, Roosevelt said, ""must think not only of this year but of future years when someone else will be president."" He had long railed against the ""money changers"" he said had taken down the economy, but in this fireside chat he said Americans had balanced expectations about what government could, and should, do.\Americans ""want the financial budget balanced,"" FDR said, but they ""want the human budget balanced as well. They want to set up a national economy which balances itself with as little government subsidy as possible, for they realize that persistent subsidies ultimately bankrupt their government.""\This fall, as he fought to stave off ballot-box repudiation of his policies and the country's direction, Obama became as polarizing as his predecessor, George W. Bush. In the heat of the campaign, Obama used language like ""evil empire"" and ""enemies"" to describe political foes, which he later regretted.\Right now, an FDR-style listening tour, which puts everything on the table and pushes debate beyond the institutionalized interests in Washington, could help both Obama and the country move toward the ""we're in this together"" moment that Roosevelt was so good at beckoning.\If the United States is going to solve this budget problem, two things are certain: One, pain will be unavoidable for almost everyone. And two, it will be done in spite of sacred cows that have set up permanent residence here.\Contact Chuck Raasch at craasch@gannett.com, follow him on Twitter or join in the Facebook conversation."
386,"Staff Writer\The battle by state officials to get a fair share of federal funds for New Jersey's highway and mass transit projects began with a toy bus.\That plastic bus was sent to U.S. Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, by NJ Transit Director Jeff Warsh earlier this year.\It reminded Dorgan that federal money sent to New Jersey to buy 1,400 new cruiser buses kept people working in a bus factory in his state. And NJ Transit has a lot more old buses to replace.\""He doesn't look at it as New Jersey money, but as North Dakota money,"" Warsh said.\That's one of many pitches to be made by New Jersey lawmakers, business leaders and government officials.\The federal Transportation Equity Act is to be renewed next year. And the drive to see that New Jersey gets its fair share of that money starts now.\Of the $2.7 billion spent annually by the state Department of Transportation on major highway and mass transit projects, about half comes from the federal government, said Phillip K. Beachem, president of the New Jersey Alliance for Action.\""If we get a loss there, we're in bad shape,"" he said.\The battle will not pit Republicans against Democrats, but different regions of the country against each other, said U.S. Sen. Jon Corzine, D-Summit.\""This is the early stage,"" Corzine said. ""It's from August to October when the bill will be written for presentation in January. I'll be in the thick of it.""\Corzine is well positioned as a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will help write the bill.\One of the biggest challenges is to bring more highway funds to the state, Corzine said.\""Now, we are a donor state, we get the lowest percentage of the (highway) funds,"" he said. ""There is enormous pressure from the western states to bump their funding up.""\Another part of the battle will be to hold onto the current level of mass transit funding, said Martin Robins, executive director of the Voorhees Transportation Institute at Rutgers University.\""Other (transit) agencies are expanding and occupying a larger share of the pie,"" Robins said. ""That is something to worry about.""\Expanding transit\More states have built or expanded their mass transit in the past 10 to 15 years, which could make an agreement for the federal government to provide more mass transit funding, Robins said.\Alliances with other northeastern states and transportation associations on regional issues is one key for New Jersey to keep its transportation funding level, he said.\""It amounts to a regional battle,"" said Rep. Mike Ferguson, R-Warren. ""We have to work together. We send a lot of money to Washington through the gas tax. Our effort is to get a fair share that's commensurate with our problems.""\The state has to find allies, not just in the Northeast, but in different parts of the transportation world, Ferguson said.\Alliances aren't lost on Corzine, who has worked with other senators on issues important to them, such as recent amendments to the farm bill.\""That might be leverage to remind people about,"" he said.\Coalition formed\Business, labor government and environmental leaders formed a coalition to work on the Transportation Equity Act reauthorization through the Alliance for Action.\""We've been planning for this for some time. We've been waiting for the new governor to settle in and for a new transportation commissioner,"" said Phil Beachem, alliance executive director.\They'll bring key federal leaders to New Jersey, such as Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta to tour projects being built with Transportation Equity Act money, Beachem said.\""We have to make the case that we spent the money wisely and that the projects are getting done,"" he said.\One success story is in Somerset County, where a $17 million earmark of Transportation Equity Act money will build a badly needed overpass over Route 22, connecting Chimney Rock Road in Bridgewater, which is split by the highway.\""What Congress has done is pick a specific thing like the Route 22 overpass, set aside a specific amount for the project and it's assigned to that project,"" said Jack Basso, director of management and business for the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Organizations."
387,"
Taxpayers frantically filing their 1040s - as well as anyone following the spending and deficit debate in Washington - may be asking where exactly their tax dollars are going.
\
Some believe most spending goes to welfare and foreign aid. Others believe defense and corporate welfare dominate the budget. In reality, Social Security and Medicare are the largest programs, and they are set to nearly double over the next decade.
\
Overall, Washington will spend $32,137 per household in 2011 - the highest level in American history (adjusted for inflation). It will collect $18,295 per household in taxes. The remaining $13,841 represents this year's staggering budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Government spending has increased by $5,000 per household since 2008, and nearly $10,000 per household over the past decade. Yet there is no free lunch: If spending is not reined in, then eventually taxes must also rise by $10,000 per household.
\
Washington will spend this $32,137 per household as follows (all numbers adjusted for inflation).
\
Social Security and Medicare: $10,458. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of Social Security's and some of Medicare's costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. Unless these programs are reformed, paying all promised benefits would eventually require doubling all income tax rates.
\
Defense: $6,465. The defense budget covers everything from military paychecks, to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment. Lawmakers drastically reduced defense spending following the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the $2,800 per household increase since 2000 has returned defense spending closer to its historical levels (but still lower than during previous wars).
\
Anti-poverty programs: $5,374. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. President George W. Bush increased anti-poverty spending to record levels, and it has grown an additional 29 percent since the end of 2008 under President Barack Obama.
\
Interest on the federal debt: $1,739. The federal government is $14 trillion in debt. It owes $10 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raided annually before the program fell into permanent deficit last year). Record-low interest rates have recently held down these costs. However, the national debt is set to double by 2020, which will combine with higher interest rates to raise annual interest costs to nearly $6,000 per household.
\
Veterans' benefits: $1,190. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending has leaped 147 percent over the past decade.
\
Unemployment benefits: $1,135. Unemployment costs have nearly tripled since the recession began.
\
Education: $698. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. The federal education budget has jumped 83 percent since 2000. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
Health research/regulation: $552. This spending is up 56 percent over the decade, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
Highways/mass transit: $522. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached.
\
Justice administration: $510. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law-enforcement grant programs. New homeland security costs have added $100 per household to justice spending.
\
The programs listed above cover $28,643 per household. The remaining $3,494 is allocated to all other federal programs, including international affairs, natural resources, the environment, regional development, farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers - and the next generation that will be paying nearly half of the bill - must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.

388,"WATCHING GOVERNOR Corzine's budget address this week was like watching a scene in the original film version of ""The Producers."" In the film, a first-night audience sits in silent horror as it watches ""Springtime for Hitler."" The musical number ends in silence, until one person applauds and then is quickly booed down.\Downtown Trenton is a far cry from Broadway. On Tuesday, Corzine was greeted with applause at the beginning and conclusion of his address. But in between there was nothing. Silence. You could have heard a pin drop or an approval rating fall.\The governor may be faulted for his delivery and lack of oratorical flourish. But he cannot be faulted for his message. It is not springtime in the Garden State. Winter has come with an icy blast.\The governor has spent the past weeks on the road, meeting with New Jerseyans in town-hall-style meetings, trying to sell the public on his road asset monetization plan. The key component of the plan is toll increases. The more the governor has explained the plan, the more opposition has grown. ""Unpopular"" is an understatement.\However, political naysayers would be foolish to underestimate Corzine's resilience. Sitting in a Newark coffee shop Thursday morning, he was pragmatic about the big lift ahead.\Corzine attributed the Legislature's big chill to two things: One, legislators were interested to see whether he really would do what he said he would do deliver a no-frills budget. And two, the budget is painful.\According to the governor, the reasoning behind it is simple. ""We don't have the dollars,"" Corzine said. ""The money isn't there.""\I read polls as much as the next pundit, but judging by the walk-by traffic in Newark on Thursday, the public is less upset with Corzine than the polls suggest. Make no mistake, the public hates toll increases. But a half-dozen people in an unscripted environment made a point of interrupting the interview to praise the governor for the courage of his budget address.\The public wants cuts. And it will accept across-the-board pain, if it truly is across the board. And there's the rub. Special interest groups already are inflating pig balloons. Legislators and would-be legislators are clamoring for microphone opportunities to say what's wrong with Corzine's budget.\Corzine is open to compromise on cuts, but he is clear that ""there has to be a general balance"" to where the cuts are made. When asked if he was optimistic about the budget process ahead, he said, ""I'm not optimistic about anything until I see it's done."" The monetization road show has taught him a few things about New Jersey politics.\The tours probably will restart in mid-March with some new songs and dances. The public will expect Corzine to discuss the proposed budget, as well as show it a Plan B for monetization. Maybe that will include toll increases mixed with an increase in the gas tax. On Thursday, Corzine was keeping his options close to the sweater vest.\How all this will fare with the voting public in 2009 is anybody's guess in 2008. ""It's not that I don't want to be reelected. I do,"" Corzine said. But he doesn't intend to focus on reelection until after Thanksgiving.\For now, it's all about the budget. I asked if he was ordering up a cot for his State House office in the event that there is no approved budget by June 30. He said he never got rid of the cot from the 2006 budget standoff.\It's unlikely it will come to that. Republicans cannot quibble that Corzine isn't cutting. If Republicans want more cuts, they can go ahead and propose them. Voters will love to hear, ""We need more budget pain. More cuts. More pain."" Democrats, in turn, do not get a free pass either. It's one thing to criticize higher tolls, but it's another to criticize anything and everything that is politically unpopular.\The slogan for state legislators should read: Put up, shut up or get up.\Voters expect Corzine to show them a Plan B for reducing state debt and to fund transportation projects. But when it comes to the budget, voters expect the Legislature to spread the pain evenly. The details of the budget need to be publicly vetted and, undoubtedly, changes will be made. Forget the calendar; it will be a very long winter.\In the budget address, Corzine said this was ""cold-turkey"" therapy. After years of a steady diet of fatty pork, the time has come for New Jersey to lower its fiscal cholesterol.\And as to the initial silent reaction to the budget, legislators should remember that by the final curtain, ""Springtime for Hitler"" was a critical success. It was a scheme of excessive borrowing that did the show in.\***\Alfred P. Doblin is the editorial page editor of The Record. Contact him at doblin@northjersey.com."
389,"Gov. Chris Christie gave legislators a 100-day challenge come up with a plan to fund underfunded schools. Monroe Township is one of those districts, ranked 25th as one of the least-funded districts in New Jersey.\One hundred days is now in our rearview mirror as it arrived last week in silence. The circus-like atmosphere that characterized the budget hearings was gone. The fighting spirit seems to have also vanished. Weeks ago, our politicians were clamoring for the spotlight, attending meetings, coming to our Fair Funding Committee meetings and doing press conferences where they talked about ""the fight"" and how they were at the forefront of leading the charge against Trenton with a two-pronged approach. They promised that they would fight to secure funding this year before November. After that victory was achieved, they would then lead the charge to change the school funding formula to forever address the inequities that plague districts like Monroe Township.\So where are we today? I hear crickets, nothing but the sound of crickets. Our legislators seem to have moved on to a new flavor of the week, and school funding no longer seems to even be on the menu.\The interesting thing is that as I have spoken up following the 100-day deadline, I have had a couple of well-connected people whisper in my ear that the Democrats have a little problem that they have to fix before our issue can be fixed. They whisper (they both really whispered while telling me) that Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto needs to go and that Senator Steve Sweeney is spearheading the effort to unseat him so that Sweeney's plan can move forward and address all of the ills that plague our current school funding formula. Of course, this is now something that will be settled in November and ""Sweeney is leading that fight.""\So now we are waiting until after November for a fix they promised they would have last week? Our politicians have made a mockery of our fight and our plight. They use us as a piggy bank to fund their pet, pork-barrel projects, they drain our bank accounts to enrich themselves and their friends, and then they tried to commandeer our fight, make it their own and use the revolutionary zeal of our citizens for their own reelection efforts.\We must stand and fight. They do not care about our citizens. To our leaders, Monroe residents are nothing more than a bunch of deep wallets voting like sheep to keep them in power, even while they disrespect us with policies that actually harm our citizenry.\We are being unduly taxed by Trenton. We send nearly $40 million per year to Trenton and we get back less than 10 percent of that in school funding. We then self-fund our school district with taxpayers paying nearly 90% of the bill to fund our schools. Couple that with never-ending development going on in Monroe Township, and we have the disaster that is upon us and that continues to worsen.\The legislators and Christie were able to work well together to raise the gas tax. They couldn't stop tripping over themselves to show us how well they worked together in that instance. Now, when bipartisanship is needed to benefit our residents, the spirit of cooperation eludes our elected officials. Alas, they can't even agree within the confines of their own party to do what is right. It is time for the people of Monroe Township, of all political persuasions, to stand up and fight. With the realization that relief before November not coming and that relief after November is a joke, I am asking that we sue the state of New Jersey. I am asking we throw off the yoke of party affiliation and upset the applecart. Let's put our plight above the interests of the politicians until they decide to make our plight their priority.\Ken Chiarella\MONROE\Ryan needs to see the light on Trump\An open letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan,\As the leader of the Republican-controlled Congress, who is second in line to succeed the President, you have unique constitutional power and a responsibility to represent the American people. Please describe the circumstances under which you would be bound by duty to initiate impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump.\In the first few months of his administration President Trump has already demonstrated a complete disregard for the environment, with the roll back of EPA regulations and withdrawal from the worldwide Paris Climate Agreement, animus toward Muslims entering this country with his unconstitutional ban, continuing conflicts of interest such as his violation of the emoluments clause, blatant public support for a health care plan which will leave tens of millions of Americans without health insurance, increased military spending which already exceeds the next seven countries combined including Russia and China, and his continued push to build the unnecessary and expensive ""great wall.""\In addition Donald Trump's brazen support of Russia and Vladimir Putin and his interference in the investigation regarding any collusion between himself, his campaign, and his associates, belie a cover-up which resonates like Watergate. Blindly supporting a serially conflicted leader in order to further a regressive agenda which benefits the wealthy, hurts the majority of Americans who rely on you for thoughtful leadership.\Mark Del Mauro\DENVILLE"
390,"Investment guru defends mutual funds\""The public is always getting hosed.""\That's a quote from veteran money manager Martin J. Whitman of the Third Avenue Value funds.\As examples of scams, he mentioned real-estate tax shelters, oil and gas tax shelters, ""crazy IPOs, growth stocks, rampant borrowing, emerging markets -- as long as there is a big spread for whoever is doing the selling"" (big commissions for the salespeople).\Despite all the recent scandals, Whitman, who is in his late 70s, believes mutual funds are a wonderful way to protect investors.\""Investor protection is better with mutual funds than in other areas,"" he said during an annual Third Avenue conference last week. ""It's basically a sound industry.""\Mutual funds, he pointed out, are limited by law in how much they can borrow ... they must be somewhat diversified ... their fees are controlled ... a custodian holds the money.\The Investment Company Act of 1940, which governs mutual funds, ""was written by geniuses,""Whitman said.\Thanks to mutual funds, he argued, ""The public gets a break. All that stealing is penny-ante stuff done by stupid people. It's reprehensible and horrible.\""But at least no investors got wiped out -- contrary to my 53 years of experience with individual investors.""\Whitman is a colorful character and one of the most successful investors of our time.\""We're quite different from Bank of America, Putnam and the Strong Funds,"" he went on, referring to funds in trouble with the law.\""We wouldn't know how to cheat. The Third Avenue culture is extremely clean.""\Unlike Janus, Bank of America and Alliance, he commented, ""We're too dumb to get caught up in the trading environment.""\But he warned that steps the federal government and states may take against mutual funds ""may be overkill.""""They may really be unnecessary.""\One benefit of the scandals, he said, joking, is: ""Where will the shareholders of Putnam funds go but to Third Avenue Value funds?""\The four Third Avenue funds, which can be purchased directly, get high ratings from Morningstar, the publishing outfit in Chicago.\* n\On the subject of the seemingly unending financial scandals, there's another cause that I'd like to mention: the insolence of office.\People in positions of power, such as L. Dennis Kozlowski, tend to think they are God's anointed -- that they are utterly indispensable, modern-day Napoleons.\As a result, nothing is too good for them -- not even $10,000 shower curtains or birthday parties in Sardinia.\This is true even if these megalomaniacs inherited their businesses and are where they are today only by an accident of birth. Such people, someone once said, were born on third base and think that they hit a triple.\If it weren't for luck, of course, today they would probably be cleaning bathrooms at Wal-Mart.\Then, there are those people standing on third base only because of a fluke. They got on by an error, were sacrificed to second, then moved to third on an infield out.\These people may think of themselves as Napoleon, but we know who they really are: Mussolini.\Those miserable wretches under the thumb of these modern-day Mussolinis feed their fantasies. They flatter, they fawn, they show their genuine fear. Mussolini, after all, can help make them rich and powerful, too -- or fire them on a whim.\One modern-day Mussolini I once worked for had inherited his publishing business, which, not surprisingly, he almost drove into receivership.\When he was a teenager, it is reliably reported, he walked over to the kiosk of a blind news dealer, took a copy of his father's newspaper and walked away with it, calling over his shoulder, ""Charge it -- my father's the publisher.""\When he finally inherited the business, he approved having his portrait hung in the lobby. There were no portraits of his ancestors, who had started the business.\His building has a no-smoking policy. Only one person was allowed to smoke in the building. Guess who.\Then, there was the time he visited his company cafeteria late one morning and asked for scrambled eggs. The young man behind the counter, a recent hire, didn't recognize his all-important customer, informed him that it was after 11 and that breakfast was no longer being served. Our modern-day Mussolini walked away in a huff. Later that day, the poor kid was fired.\The insolence of office.\* n\How truly sad -- the scandals have even besmirched the Alger funds, which have offices in Morristown.\After losing so many key employees during the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the fund family struggled back to life.\Former employees nobly returned to the fold; remaining workers drove themselves hard, doing the work of the many missing employees. Alger came back from the brink.\But one Alger executive had succumbed to temptation -- not for personal gain, apparently, but to keep a big customer happy. And now the entire firm seems to be stigmatized.\I certainly hope not. The Alger funds still deserve to survive and prosper.\Boroson On Money appears Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

391,"STAFF WRITER\With local gas prices up by almost 40 cents per gallon during the last month alone, candidates vying for a 7th District U.S. House seat are backing a variety of solutions - many long-term - to provide Central Jerseyans with relief at the pump.\In the short run, several candidates from both parties back the suspension of new shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve beginning July 1 through the end of the year.\The measure was passed by Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by President Bush earlier this month.\The U.S. Energy Information Administration has predicted that, following a halt in those shipments, the price per barrel for oil could drop by $2 and reduce gasoline prices by 4 to 5 cents a gallon, according to published reports.\The likely Democratic nominee, Assemblywoman Linda Stender, D-Fanwood, voiced support Tuesday for temporarily halting the Reserve deliveries as part of a scheduled appearance at a Scotch Plains gas station on Route 22 with House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn, D-S.C.\On the Republican side, state Sen. Leonard Lance, R-Clinton Township, former Summit Councilwoman P. Kelly Hatfield, Scotch Plains Mayor Martin Marks, and businesswoman Kate Whitman are among the candidates also supporting the measure. Six GOP hopefuls are competing for their party's nomination on June 3.\But the field is far from unanimous when it comes to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR).\The opening of a 1.5-million acre coastal area of the reserve to oil development this year would increase domestic oil production starting in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The area has a mean estimate of 10.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to the agency.\Whitman - a former congressional staffer who owns her own public relations firm - said the country needs to increase its domestic oil production.\""I would support expanding off-shore drilling and in ANWR if it's done safely and protects the environment. I think that's the big difference you'll see between Leonard Lance and myself,"" Whitman said.\Lance does not support drilling in ANWR or off the Outer Continental Shelf and instead has called for extracting oil from oil shale and tar sands in western states as part of a broader, five-point plan. Lance also supports a variety of tax incentives for hybrid and hydrogen vehicles and renewable energy.\Scotch Plains Mayor Martin Marks, another proponent of drilling in ANWR, said ""We are probably going to see this level of gas prices for the foreseeable future.""\""In retrospect, this nation has made a tremendous error in not standing up to environmental extremists who have blockaded our own exploration of resources in our own soil,"" Marks said.\Iraq war veteran Tom Roughneen has also called for drilling in ANWR.\Stender, meanwhile, is opposed to drilling in ANWR and off the coast.\""I think it's a misplaced priority, because what we ought to be doing is investing in and developing new resources and new technologies which have been ignored at the expense of giving the tax breaks to the big oil companies,"" Stender said.\Also stressing the need to confront global warming, Stender said she would like to pay for tax incentives for hybrid vehicles and renewable energy sources by taking away some of those tax breaks for oil companies.\Oil companies have blamed rising gas prices on a host of factors including increased worldwide demand, with rapid economic expansion in countries such as China and India. Many note that those same oil companies are also seeing record profits.\On Tuesday, the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in the Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon region was more than $3.80, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report. The price was more than $2.96 one year ago.\Hatfield, who also calls for increased domestic oil production and tax incentives to promote a more diverse energy supply, pointed to the weak U.S. dollar as another reason for the country's gasoline woes.\""The economists tell us that we're not getting as much bang for our buck as we have in the past, the value of the dollar is so low it's costing us more to import oil,"" Hatfield said. ""Congress needs to do everything it can to make sure it encourages and promotes a strong economy here. It's all a big web.""\Stender supports a House measure that would allow the U.S. Justice Department to sue members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for limiting production or fixing prices when it comes to oil. The ""Gas Price Relief for Consumer Act"" would also create a task force to investigate price gouging.\The United States imports nearly 6 million barrels of crude oil from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries every day, according to Congress.\In a statement, Whitman called the act ""purely a political attempt led by the Democrats to provide false hope of lower gas prices to Americans.""\""We cannot say it is 'illegal' for foreign governments to restrict oil production when our government restricts oil production on our own soil,"" Whitman said, citing ANWAR and drilling off the Florida coast as two examples.\Candidates also disagree on whether to suspend the federal gas tax - 18.4 cents - for the summer.\Marks said ""the less money the government has, the better,"" while Stender called the proposal a ""gimmick.""\""It's not a real solution, and at a time when we know our infrastructure is crumbling and that we are already struggling to make sure we have the resources to invest in infrastructure, it's a mistake,"" Stender said.\Martin C.

The forums have engaged a number of political leaders from both parties to speak about ways to keep and create business for New Jersey, and ways to make New Jersey more affordable, for those who own businesses and who work and live in the state.\Toward that end, Oliver listed a series of topics she wants the Assembly to address, review and make recommendations upon during October:\Each standing committee will be charged at looking at ways to develop job-enhancement initiatives and support the evolution of jobs in the state.\Review and update 2009 stimulus plans.\Protect the unemployment insurance fund and see what can be done to avoid tax increases to do this.\Cultivate New Jersey as a place that can emerge as a leader for ""green"" jobs.\Examine whether tax credit initiatives are working.\Review urban enterprise zone initiatives and see how they can be made more successful, even in the face of funding cuts.\See how New Jersey businesses can be linked to international trade opportunities overseas.\Protect and promote New Jersey ports, including addressing the raising of the Bayonne Bridge. If this is not done, the state may lose substantial business to ports in Baltimore and Norfolk.\Improve the ability for businesses to get access to capital.\Jump-start the construction sector and get people back to work.\Get revamped Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) legislation introduced by Sept. 30 or Oct. 13.\Oliver said it is also crucial ""to look at the myriad of regulations that exist"" that have put a ""regulatory stranglehold"" on businesses.\A deliberate process\In doing all this, Oliver emphasized that her goal is to make the entire process inclusive and deliberative.\""Often we pass legislation with a flurry and then have to readdress it months later because of significant flaws,"" she said. ""We have to invest the time upfront to get all stakeholders involved.""\Oliver received a round of applause (and appreciative laughs) when she said, ""I also believe that we pass too many laws."" She said she wants to get away from an approach that focuses on specialized regulation, and instead focus on an approach that allows for the broadest possible application of legislation.\After the morning meeting, Oliver was heading to the Meadowlands where a summit on the gaming industry in New Jersey was conducted.\""I know that Somerset County is part of the discussion because you have so many people involved in horse breeding and horse racing here,"" Oliver said.\She said that revenues from New Jersey gaming businesses have been hampered by competition from neighboring facilities in Delaware and Pennsylvania, and that the New Jersey gaming industry failed to retool itself for changing times and audiences.\""We have to delve in and see how to help the industry solve"" the challenges it faces, she said, noting that the state also has to help cities do a better job with ""what happens to the monies that go into their coffers"" -- after pointing out that Borgata pays $43 million annually in taxes while still maintaining self-contained security and trash services.\Other issues addressed\During a question-and-answer session after her presentation, Oliver addressed a number of other issues, including her support for civil service and arbitration reform -- though, following a question from Franklin Councilman Daniel Glicklich, she said that any new agreement with a cap would be a starting point and that as the economy changes, so too could the cap.\Somerset County Freeholder Director Jack M. Ciattarelli noted that while the county has just finished an exhaustive study on combining many services across municipalities, there are existing laws that would prohibit some of those collaborations from going forward.\""We are very aware of the impediments,"" Oliver responded, ""and we know that we have to do legislative remedies."" She added that these would likely emerge as part of civil-service reforms worked on this fall.\Oliver also addressed the need to find ways to replenish the state's transportation trust fund, which could mean increasing the state's gas tax, she said. Similarly, Oliver is aware of the need for the state to address its pension obligations. ""The longer we delay this, the worse it will be,"" she said. Steps could include revamping the existing pension system and other efforts designed ""to stop the bleeding going forward.""\In emphasizing the need to make this effort nonpartisan, Oliver reflected the theme of the Somerset County Business Partnership's Make New Jersey Affordable initiative.\State Sen. Christopher ""Kip"" Bateman, a Somerset County Republican representing District 16, lauded the partnership for its work that reached across party lines, saying that ""this organization has accomplished a great deal in a short time, and has been a catalyst for a reform agenda in New Jersey.""\Frank Steinberg, chairman of the business partnership, noted that the initiative has grown to include a number of other business chambers from around the state, including Hunterdon, Edison, Newark and the state chamber.\""We're trying to get everyone involved in a discussion to get New Jersey to again be an economic driver in the Northeast,"" he said. ""We are going to keep doing what we've been doing.""\Among the things the partnership will be doing is a Nov. 1 ""Call to Service"" Summit scheduled from 1 to 4 p.m. at Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg. The aim of the event is to engage Somerset County employees and residents in leadership and service opportunities in their communities -- especially those that would make government more affordable. The event's keynote speaker will be Kelly Jonston, vice president of government affairs for Campbell's Soup.\WHAT YOU CAN DO: To learn more about Somerset County Business Partnership's Nov. 1 ""Call to Service"" summit, to review the partnership's Make New Jersey Affordable reform agenda or for general information about the partnership, visit www.scbp.org or call 908-218-4300."
393,"Governor Christie's vision of change for New Jersey could include freezing the salaries of teachers and other employees to make public education more affordable.\A report prepared by Christie's transition team members -- one of 19 released by the governor on Friday -- takes on salary increases planned to start this June in ""statewide contracts, as well as local district contracts.""\""If, absent a source of funds to pay these increases, the new administration must take action to freeze salaries for all public employees in FY 2011, that freeze should pertain as well to pre-K-12 employees at all levels,"" the education report says.\It also recommends other cost-cutting efforts, as well as major changes to existing education policy, including establishing merit pay for teachers and taking school budgets off the ballot if spending stays flat or rises only modestly.\Christie, a Republican, beat former Gov. Jon S. Corzine in November by promising to cut taxes and reduce government spending. And during his inaugural address on Tuesday, he declared that ""you voted loudly and clearly for change ... and today change has arrived.""\The 19 reports released Friday cover nearly everything state government does, from agriculture to transportation. And the reports, prepared by transition subcommittees Christie created after winning the election, share a common theme of eliminating wasteful spending and outdated or inefficient operating procedures.\Other recommendations included in the 19 reports call for telling the owners of Xanadu to open or surrender the property; attracting a new developer to the failed EnCap site covering 800 acres of former Meadowlands landfills; possibly putting tollbooths on some interstate highways to pay for road improvements; and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of outside consultants hired by the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission.\""These reports are full of bold ideas and recommendations for change from a bipartisan group of individuals from the private and public sectors,"" Christie said. ""They came to the task with a wide range of knowledge and expertise and gave us unvarnished assessments of our state government, its strengths, weaknesses and failures.""\Christie identified education reform as one of his top priorities during the campaign, and the transition subcommittee's education report covers many of the areas he talked about, including putting more emphasis on charter schools and making it more difficult for public school teachers to reach tenure.\The report also addresses education spending in New Jersey, which is higher than in 48 other states.\Local school district spending makes up the biggest part of most property tax bills, which currently average a record high of $7,045 statewide -- and $8,500 in North Jersey. And the current $29 billion state budget dedicates about $11 billion -- or more than one-third -- to school aid.\Teachers in New Jersey are due, on average, raises of 4 percent this year and next, but the recession is taking a toll on tax revenue at all levels of government throughout the state. Christie is grappling with what he says will be a $1.3 billion shortfall in the current budget and a looming structural deficit of at least $9.5 billion in the budget year that begins this July.\But a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association, which represents 200,000 teachers statewide, called the pay-freeze proposal a ""direct violation of collective bargaining."" Most districts are in the middle of current contracts, said spokesman Steve Wollmer.\""There are a lot of legal questions,"" he said. ""These agreements were legally negotiated under collective bargaining.""\Peter Tirri, president of the 3,700-member teachers union in Paterson, called the pay freeze idea an ""incredible slap in the face.""\""How do you overcome a negotiated contract?"" he asked. ""It's astounding they are even considering something like that. ... He's got a vendetta against the NJEA.""\Other education subcommittee recommendations call for lengthening the time to reach tenure to five years, developing systems to establish merit pay for teachers and promoting charter schools. Costly school budget elections would be eliminated if districts' spending increases don't exceed 4 percent.\The popular NJ Stars program would be scaled back so that only the top 5 percent of high school seniors are eligible for the free tuition at community colleges, rather than the current 15 percent.\The report also proposes streamlining some of the education bureaucracy, including eliminating the state's higher education commission, offices of county superintendents and 250 pages of so-called accountability regulations that recently were enacted.\And it calls for a slower phase-in of end-of-course testing in the high schools.\Wollmer questioned the recommendation to extend the time for teachers to reach tenure from three years to five, saying that ""if you can't tell within three years if someone has the talent to be a teacher, then maybe you shouldn't be doing the hiring.""\And on merit pay, he said, ""there is no research suggesting merit pay improves student achievement.""\""Merit pay is based on a corporate model. We don't think it fits at all into the educational model,"" Wollmer said.\***\(SIDEBAR)\Other findings\Nineteen reports compiled by Governor Christie's transition staff made scores of recommendations for all areas of state government Here's a look at some of the subcommittees' ideas.\TRANSPORTATION\* Possibly place tollbooths on select interstate highways to pay for road improvements.\* Consider a public referendum question on a gas-tax increase for transportation projects.\COMMISSIONS, AUTHORITIES, PROGRAMS\* ""It is clear that there is waste,"" the staff wrote. ""The leaders of the authorities must know the Governor's Office will scrutinize their books and use all the power at its disposal to bring accountability to each.""\* Eliminate public subsidies for the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority, which operates New Jersey Network.\* Evaluate the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission. ""The use of outside consultants, including attorneys and engineers, should be reviewed as a cost-saving measure, given the existence of in-house professionals.""\* Evaluate a Housing and Mortgage Finance program that offers subsidies of $60,000 to $70,000 for 250 home buyers every year.\ENVIRONMENT\* The Department of Environmental Protection was criticized at every level, including use of scientific data, permitting, rule making, enforcement and transparency. ""The DEP is the single most influential department impacting development, business investment and economic growth,"" the report said.\Elise Young"

To address the deficit, McCain has called for the elimination of earmarks and a one-year freeze in discretionary spending.\OBAMA: Obama has promised to cut taxes for the middle- and low-income families and increase them for those making more than $250,000 per year. To lower the deficit, Obama wants to cut earmarks to 2001 levels and force lawmakers to make budget cuts before passing new spending. To deal with the higher cost of gasoline, he would suspend the federal gas tax.\Environment\McCAIN: Breaking with President Bush, he was an early leader in the Senate's efforts to fight global warming; this at a time when many in his party were still disputing the existence of climate change. He sponsored legislation that would have cut global warming emissions 65 percent by 2050. He favors tougher fuel efficiency, and supports more nuclear power.\OBAMA: He has proposed a 10-year, $150 billion program to produce climate friendly energy supplies that he'd pay for with a carbon auction requiring businesses to bid competitively for the right to pollute. He joined McCain in sponsoring legislation that would set mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions. He wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050, and he supports tougher fuel efficiency standards.\Health Care\McCAIN: Opposes universal coverage and instead offers a plan to end the tax exclusion for employers offering health insurance to workers and give individuals ($2,500) and families ($5,000) tax credits to buy health insurance on the private market. The plan would promote greater health insurance availability through various regulatory reforms.\OBAMA: Supports mandatory coverage for children, but not a mandate for adults. He would require all employers to offer health insurance to workers or contribute to a new national public health insurance program where people and small businesses could buy affordable health insurance if not available elsewhere. The $65 billion a year package would be funded by increased taxes on wealthier families.\Iraq\McCAIN: Opposes scheduling a troop withdrawal, saying the latest strategy is succeeding. Supported decision to go to war, but was early critic of the manner in which administration prosecuted it. He predicts the war will be won and most American troops will be home by 2013 if he is elected. Remaining forces would not play a direct combat role. Also, he is willing to have permanent U.S. peacekeeping forces in Iraq.\OBAMA: Spoke against war at start and opposed the troop increase. His plan would complete withdrawal of combat troops by end of 2009. He would keep some in country to protect the U.S. embassy and possibly conduct counter-terrorism.\Iran\McCAIN: Favors tougher sanctions, opposes direct high-level talks with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He believes Iran and its nuclear research are an ""unacceptable risk"" to Israel and U.S. interests but said force must be a last resort to stop it.\OBAMA: Initially said he would meet Ahmadinejad without preconditions, now says he's not sure ""Ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now."" But he says direct diplomacy with Iranian leaders would give U.S. more credibility to press for tougher international sanctions, including economic pressure and political isolation.\Medicare\McCAIN: Favors allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with drug makers in some cases and letting people buy drugs from Canada. He believes Medicare payments should be changed to encourage better management of chronic diseases.\OBAMA: Favors allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with drug makers, letting people buy drugs from Canada, speeding generic drugs to market, reducing waste and undertaking fundamental health reform.\Social Security\McCAIN: Supports individual retirement accounts but not if funded by letting workers divert money from Social Security payroll taxes. He would consider raising the limit on worker income subject to Social Security tax. He opposes an increase in the early retirement age and higher payroll taxes.\OBAMA: Opposes letting workers divert money from Social Security into private accounts. He would support raising the limit on worker income subject to Social Security tax. He opposes cutting benefits or increasing the age at which benefits are drawn.\Stem cell research\McCAIN: Supports relaxing federal restrictions on financing of embryonic stem cell research.\OBAMA: Supports relaxing federal restrictions on financing of embryonic stem cell research.\Taxes\McCAIN: ""No new taxes,"" if elected. He opposed the Bush tax cuts for not being paired with spending cuts but now says they should be made permanent. He wants to lower the estate tax and taxes on dividends and capital gains, and he promises to balance the budget in first term.\OBAMA: Would raise income taxes on wealthiest people. He would let the Bush tax cuts on capital gains and wealthy expire, exempt first $7 million from estate tax, raise corporate tax, triple earned income tax credit for working poor, exempt seniors earning under $50,000 from income tax.\Sources: Gannett News Service, the Associated Press, and the candidates' Web sites: www.johnmccain.com and www.barackobama.com\REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES:\PRESIDENT: John McCain\AGE: 72\BORN: Aug. 29, 1936, at the Coco Solo Naval Air Station, Panama Canal Zone\FAMILY: Wife, Cindy; seven children, four grandchildren\EDUCATION: U.S. Naval Academy\PREVIOUS CAREER: Naval aviator\POLITICAL CAREER: U.S. congressman, 1982-86; U.S. senator since 1986\VICE PRESIDENT: Sarah Palin\AGE: 44\BORN: Feb. 11, 1964, in Sandpoint, Idaho\FAMILY: Husband, Todd; five children\EDUCATION: University of Idaho\PREVIOUS CAREER: Sports reporter for TV and newspaper; worked in husband's commercial fishing business\POLITICAL CAREER: Wasilla (Alaska) City Council member, 1992-96; Wasilla mayor, 1996-2002; governor of Alaska since 2006\DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES\PRESIDENT: Barack Obama\AGE: 47\BORN: Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu\FAMILY: Wife, Michelle; two daughters\EDUCATION: Harvard Law School, Columbia University, Occidental College\PREVIOUS CAREER: Lawyer, author\POLITICAL CAREER: Illinois state senator, 1997-2004; U.S. senator since 2005\PRESIDENT: Joe Biden\AGE: 65\BORN: Nov. 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pa.\FAMILY: Wife, Jill; three children, one deceased\EDUCATION: University of Delaware, Syracuse University\PREVIOUS CAREER: Lawyer\POLITICAL CAREER: New Castle County (Delaware) Council member, 1970-72; U.S. senator since 1973"
395," Republican Doug Forrester is a fiscal conservative who wants to enact constitutionally guaranteed tax cuts.\ Democrat Jon Corzine is one of the most liberal members of the U.S. Senate who won his seat by campaigning for universal health insurance, universal preschool and universal long-term care.\ Yet, when it comes to their plans for growing New Jersey's economy, the Democrat and Republican candidates for governor sound almost like ideological soul mates.\ To illustrate this point, a brief quiz:\ Which candidate, the Republican or Democrat, has vowed to change the state's economic paradigm from ""tax, borrow and spend"" to ""invest, grow and prosper""?\ Whose ""Blueprint for Economic Growth"" starts with enacting ""comprehensive ethics reform"" in Trenton?\ Who has promised to cut the number of salaried political appointees in Trenton by 50 percent?\ And which candidate has promised to place ""economic development at the very top"" of his agenda?\ The answer to all four questions is Corzine. But if you answered Forrester for any or all of the questions, you deserve at least partial credit because the Republican's campaign to restore the state's finances is built on many of the same themes.\ Both candidates, for instance, say they can wring substantial savings by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in state government.\ Forrester estimates as much as $3 billion could be saved right in the $60-plus billion that New Jerseyans spend every year for state, county and local government. Corzine has not offered such optimistic projections but says the savings could be ""substantial.""\ Both candidates say they will streamline the state's cumbersome economic development apparatus and replace political appointees with qualified development experts.\ Corzine says he will bring the state Economic Growth & Tourism Commission into the governor's office. Forrester says he will hire bona fide experts who will help businesses attract and grow jobs.\ The candidates also agree that the state's Economic Development Agency should no longer face political pressure to float long-term bonds to help pay for current state operating expenses.\ For both, an important first step in bringing economic health is cleaning up government.\ ""More and more, New Jersey is becoming a hostile economic environment for business,"" Forrester said in a recent interview. ""The state cannot continue to weigh taxpayers down with the cost of paying for a bloated and corrupt bureaucracy. If I am elected governor, this state's going into rehab.\ ""But it all starts with ending the corruption and pay-to-play culture that soak honest taxpayers,"" he said.\ Corzine, in a June speech to 500 members of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, even made reference to his Republican opponent in outlining his plans for the economy.\ ""I suspect Doug and I will agree: bringing down the cost of government, holding down the tax burden and creating a favorable investment climate depends on ending the culture of corruption in this state and the embedded 'corruption tax,'"" Corzine said. ""State and local government must be about serving the public, not about rewarding contracts or making money.""\ New Jersey's glum, some might say frightening, financial outlook may be one reason that Corzine and Forrester sound so much alike. With the prospect of another multibillion-dollar budget shortfall next year, with long-term problems such as a bankrupt state pension system looming and with major tax hikes unlikely, the options are few.\ Last summer, state Treasurer John McCormac estimated that the state is $25 billion behind on its obligation to employee pensions. The new governor will have to come up with about $1 billion of that in next year's budget alone.\ The state's Transportation Trust Fund is also near bankruptcy. New Jersey could lose more than $8 billion in federal road repair money if it cannot supply matching funds.\ And it appears that the era of one-shot budget fixes is ending. Last year, the state Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers could no longer borrow to pay operating expenses. The decision will force the budget makers, in the view of some economists, to raise broad-based taxes and make deep cuts in state services and employees.\ Whoever becomes governor will also have to deal with skyrocketing insurance and health-care costs, rising fuel prices and debt service expenses that assume an ever-expanding portion of the state's $29 billion budget.\ ""The real question is why anyone would want this job,"" said James Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.\ Despite the daunting realities of Trenton's balance sheet, Corzine and Forrester have promoted vastly differing positions on one area that could have a profound impact on the economy: taxes.\ Forrester has promised to hold the line on taxes. He argues that he can fund state government - and a property tax-relief program that Democrats say will cost as much as $9 billion in three years - solely on budget cuts and routine growth in revenue that stems from economic expansion.\ He has also ruled out the issuance of bonds to pay for transportation needs.\ Earlier in the campaign, Corzine refused to rule out a hike in the state gas tax, but now says he does oppose such a move. He also says he will have to borrow to meet the state's court-ordered obligation to build public schools.\ His tax relief plan, however, is likely to be much less expensive than Forrester's.\ ""I think we can grow the economy and increase spending for some things we need at the same time,"" Corzine said. ""In a state as prosperous as New Jersey, we shouldn't have to choose.""\ * * *\ (SIDEBAR)\ Fueling economic growth\ Republican Doug Forrester's and Democrat Jon Corzine's proposals to spur economic development:\ FORRESTER\ * Would make health plans for small businesses more affordable by establishing a health benefit's program modeled after the state Health Benefits Plan. The plan would provide greater bargaining power for small employers and individuals and help reduce costs.\ * Pledges not to raise any taxes; supports constitutional measure requiring a ""supermajority,"" or support of two-thirds of the Legislature before raising taxes.\ * Vows to appoint only ""qualified, respected and reputable people"" to state government posts, including appointments that impact New Jersey's economic development.\ CORZINE\ * Would stop using bond proceeds from the state Economic Development Agency for state operating expenses.\ * Plans to create an ""Edison Fund"" composed of public-private dollars to distribute research, development and business grants.\ * Wants to make state colleges and universities hubs for research and development.\ * Has refused to sign a pledge not to raise taxes, but says it would be an option of last resort."
396,"A Sept. 12 debate between the U.S. Senate candidates will be rebroadcast at noontodayon the NJN television network. HD:Even Democrats abandoning Torricelli\By ALAN GUENTHER\Courier-Post Staff GLOUCESTER CITY\Even with all his other problems, you'd think Democratic U.S.Sen. Robert Torricelli could at least count on Denise Ablett'svote.\Ablett, a 55-year-old Democrat, lives on Temple Avenue in theheart of working-class Gloucester City, where Democrats outnumberRepublicans by an almost 5-to-1 margin. Ablett lives across thestreet from a radioactive site that is part of a $17 million cleanupeffort.\The cleanup is being financed by the federal Superfund program,which provides money to fix serious environmental problems.\Torricelli says the Superfund program ought to be continued.His Republican opponent, Douglas Forrester, says the Superfundought to be scrapped because it wastes too much money on lawsuits.\On this key environmental issue, Ablett agrees with Torricelliwhen he says polluters -- not taxpayers -- ought to be forced to payfor cleanups.\Torricelli has been hammering Forrester on other key issueslike abortion rights and prescription drugs for seniors, tryingto shore up his weak support among Democrats.\But for Ablett, there's a bottom line, a central problem shecan't get around.\`I can't vote for him because of the ethics,' she said. She believesTorricelli is too corrupt to earn her vote.\To get the focus off his reprimand by the Senate Ethics Committeefor accepting expensive, improper gifts, Torricelli has triedmightily to change the topic to other issues.\Torricelli points out, for example, that low-income womenrely on the federal Medicaid program to pay for medical expenses,and Forrester is against Medicaid funding for abortions, evenin cases of rape and incest.\Forrester says he supports a woman's right to abortion, buttaxpayers should not be forced to pay for it. Torricelli calls thatposition `mean-spirited,' and he says rich and poor women shouldhave the same abortion rights.\While Forrester wants to abolish the Superfund program, hehas failed to provide details about his own plan to clean up toxicwaste sites in New Jersey.\After Thursday's debate, Forrester told the Courier-Posthe wants to spend `several hundred million dollars' to clean uptoxic sites. The Superfund program, he maintained, squandersmoney on expensive lawsuits, chasing polluters in court.\Asked where he'd find the money, Forrester said he'd get it fromthe federal government's general treasury. He said he won't raisethe gas tax or other taxes, but he'd get the money from existing revenuesources.\Without a detailed plan to offer on cleaning up the environment,New Jersey Sierra Club director Jeff Tittel said Forrester is nota viable alternative to Torricelli.\Relying on the general fund is a bad idea, said Tittel, because`the federal government is facing enormous deficits, and so themoney isn't going to be there.\`I listened to the debate, and I've been following what Forrester'sbeen saying, and he's just plain wrong,' said Tittel, whose groupplans to endorse Torricelli within the next week.\In an era when senior citizens are seeking prescription drugbenefits, Forrester's plan would cross most seniors off the list.\Own a house? Own a car? Under Forrester's plan, Torricelli pointsout, you'd be considered too wealthy to get your drugs paid for byMedicare.\Forrester says the government ought to start with a modest programthat can be expanded later. But Torricelli says any plan adoptedby Congress ought to provide immediate, widespread relief to seniorswho want help in paying for their medications.\Under normal circumstances, Torricelli could be coastingto an easy re-election against an unknown like Forrester.\But this is not a normal election for Torricelli.\Asian businessman David Chang is now in jail after funnelingmore than $53,000 in illegal donations to Torricelli's 1996 Senatecampaign.\At first, Torricelli denied receiving expensive personalgifts from Chang.\He later admitted receiving the gifts and was `severely admonished'by the Senate Ethics Committee for accepting three pairs of earrings,two bronze statues and a wide-screen television he received ata significant discount.\Chang has also claimed he repeatedly made large deliveriesof cash to Torricelli when he visited the senator's home, a chargethat Torricelli heatedly denies.\After investigating Torricelli for more than three years,federal prosecutors did not file charges against him. The prosecutorsdid, however, file a letter with a federal judge, explaining whatthey had found. Torricelli is fighting in court to prevent the releaseof the letter.\`There's no shame whatsoever,' Ablett said. `He's cocky asall get out.'\A Quinnipiac University poll, released Thursday, showed Torricelliand Forrester nearly tied in the race, although 71 percent saidthey don't know enough about Forrester to form an opinion abouthim.\Even though he's practically unknown in his first race for statewideoffice, Forrester is drawing support from 81 percent of likelyRepublican voters. Torricelli is backed by only 75 percent of likelyDemocratic voters, according to Quinnipiac.\Fully 72 percent of those who support Forrester said their voteis mainly a vote against Torricelli.\The poll showed other signs of weakness for Torricelli:\Among registered voters, 47 percent disapproved of the wayhe was handling his job, while 31 percent approved.\Among registered Democrats, 20 percent had a favorable opinionabout Torricelli, while 16 percent had an unfavorable opinion.Twenty-eight percent said their opinion of him was mixed, and 16percent didn't know enough to comment.\In the remaining eight weeks of the campaign, as voters beginto tune into the race and seek information about the candidates,analysts say Torricelli must create a negative image of Forrester,casting him as a dupe of the conservative Republicans in the Southand Midwest.\Meanwhile, Forrester must fend off the attacks without losingthe support of Republican conservatives.\During Thursday's debate, Forrester pressed Torricelli onthe ethics issue but offered few specific suggestions about whathe will do if elected, according to Rider University politicalscientist David Rebovich.\`Doug Forrester is going to have to be more clear about wherehe stands on the issues and not just rail on the negatives of Torricelli,'Rebovich said.\Torricelli is trying to avoid being the first state Democratto lose a U.S. Senate election in 30 years. And he's trying to avoidbecoming the first incumbent senator to lose a bid for re-electionin New Jersey over the past 60 years.\But if his fate rests in the hands of Democrats like Ablett, Torricellicould be in serious trouble.\`I'm tired of politicians doing their own thing,' she said,`and thinking they can get away with it.'\Gannett State Bureau reporter Sandy McClure contributed tothis report.

397,"They know the truth, they just don't know what to do about it.\Officials in Trenton and Washington know that the way they have paid to maintain and expand roads, bridges and mass transit for decades no longer works. For the federal government, the gas tax began generating less revenue than Congress wanted to spend in 2008, and creative financing or just adding to debt has been used to fill the gap since then.\With the latest multiyear national transportation law due to expire this fall, Republicans and Democrats on the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works say they will release a bipartisan agreement this week that would keep financing flat, with only an increase for inflation.\That's the easy part. The Senate Committee on Finance has the hard job of finding as much as $100 billion in new revenue to pay for a six-year renewal. Even if that happens, spending on maintenance and repairs would eat up a bigger part of the program, while major upgrades become rare.\""Shortsightedness has left us with a broken and increasingly second-rate transportation system ... mainly because of the high political costs associated with proposing any kind of revenue increase,"" Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said at a hearing last week.\While some conservatives are saying the time has come for transportation spending to be cut, there are Republican senators joining Democrats in arguing that keeping the program is a national priority.\There is just no agreement on how to pay for it.\The Obama administration's plan uses corporate tax ""reform"" that would require multinational companies to pay taxes on profits parked overseas. But any tax increase is not likely to advance.\""We should have a robust discussion as to how our tax system should deal with overseas earnings,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, said at a hearing last week. ""That discussion should take place in the context of a broader debate about tax reform, not as part of an ad hoc effort to pay for a highway bill.""\Broader tax reform will not happen this year, everyone agrees. Yet the clock is ticking, and sometime this summer the U.S. Department of Transportation says the Highway Trust Fund will be tapped out and payments to states, mostly reimbursements for projects already under way, will be reduced or suspended.\""We've got to find a way to pay for it,"" said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., a Democrat from Paterson and member of the Ways and Means Committee. ""My feeling is that an increase in the gasoline tax should be on the table, as well as giving states the authority to provide an increase in tolls.""\But with the interstate highway system now complete, states could be forced to play a bigger role.\""A straightforward solution ... would be to reduce spending to match current revenues,"" Chris Edwards, tax policy director at the Cato Institute, said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing last week. ""State governments would be free to fill the void as they choose.""\In New Jersey, the state Transportation Trust Fund is under similar strain, and Governor Christie has used creative methods to finance work without raising taxes.\The best example is the Pulaski Skyway, which was recently closed for an overhaul needed to keep the 80-year-old link between Newark and Jersey City safe.\To pay for it, Christie got the Port Authority to divert money that had been earmarked for a new commuter rail tunnel to New York City that Christie canceled because of fears of cost overruns.\Last week, the head of Amtrak said one of the two 100-year-old tunnels used now by its trains and NJ Transit's would have to be closed within the next 20 years, causing lengthy delays.\The Port Authority's diversion of money to the Skyway required classifying the bridge, which ends at the Holland Tunnel, as an access road to the Lincoln Tunnel instead. That move is reportedly under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\At least since 2009, Rep. Scott Garrett, a Republican from Wantage, has sponsored a bill that would let states opt out of the federal transportation system. The STATE act, for Surface Transportation and Tax Equity, would reduce the federal tax rate by the amount states raise their own taxes, effectively keeping the money paid at the pump in the state where it is collected.\It currently has 14 co-sponsors, none of them from New Jersey.\Knowing that federal payments could be halted or reduced when the trust fund runs dry, some states have started fewer projects this spring, members of Congress from both parties said last week.\New Jersey transportation officials did not return a message asking what the state's contingency plan is in the event of a suspension of federal financing.\It could be that looming problems with the state's financing system have kept anyone from looking at the issue. Next year, the state's Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for local projects and the state's share of federally financed work, will have to be renewed, and the costs of paying off bonds issued for past projects is crowding out what's available for new work.\Christie, who attacked his predecessors' reliance on debt, originally said his capital plan for 2012 through 2016 would rely more on ""pay as you go"" projects financed with current revenues, like sales tax collections and tolls from the New Jersey Turnpike.\But when the economic recovery Christie predicted never arrived, the extra sales tax revenue he was counting on never materialized. Christie also steered the turnpike tolls he had said would go into the trust fund to NJ Transit, according to an analysis by the Office of Legislative Services.\But the state continued spending the same amount and filled the gap with an extra $1 billion in borrowing through 2015, the OLS analysis said. The pay-as-you-go portion, originally projected at $1.2 billion, ended up being just $66 million. The state now expects to have to renew the program six months earlier than expected because it will hit the statutory debt limit.\In short, both the state and federal transportation programs are tapped out, or nearly there.\At last week's Senate Finance Committee hearing on options to fill the gap, the Congressional Budget Office offered three suggestions: spend less, raise more revenue, or transfer money from the general treasury.\With support still strong for at least the same level of spending, if not more, and taxes going nowhere, that would leave the general treasury, which already has a huge deficit.\So this problem, like commuter traffic in North Jersey, is going to be around a while.\Credit: Email: jackson@northjersey.com Blog: northjersey.com/thepoliticalstate"
398,"Rutgers should leave Big Ten\Regarding ""Knight terrors"" (Page S-1, Oct. 9):\Why in heavens name did Rutgers University officials decide to join the Big Ten Conference when being in the Big East was just fine? It's embarrassing, and there is no reason other than money to remain.\It will hurt football recruitment, because New Jersey high school athletes who look ahead to a college to play football are certainly not looking at Rutgers. Why would they? What high school star would want to play for a team that is so outclassed by Big Ten teams?\Rutgers may eventually be able to recruit high school superstars; it certainly can't now. But in the end, who cares? Education is the name of the game, and Rutgers has an excellent educational record. That is where the emphasis should be.\I am a Georgetown University alumnus, and I am not concerned with Georgetown's football prowess but am proud to see that it is still one of the top academic universities in the country. Rutgers, too, should strive to maintain its academic reputation and not be sullied by its inane presence in the Big Ten.\Bob Rizzotti\Waldwick, Oct. 11\Eliminating estate tax benefits many\Regarding ""Gas-tax hike and estate-tax cut take a toll"" (Other Views, Oct. 12):\John W. Callinan's analysis of the estate tax is misguided. Although it is true that only 4 percent of New Jersey estates pay the tax, the effect of the tax has been disastrous for New Jersey.\The estate tax has created the oft-repeated slogan: ""New Jersey is a great place to live but a terrible place to die."" Many of those who pay the tax are owners of businesses with many employees. The estate tax is one of the reasons so many successful businessmen have moved to tax-friendly states like North Carolina and Texas -- and taken their businesses with them.\The loss of jobs is an overlooked statistic when discussing high taxes in New Jersey. It is shortsighted to look only at the estate tax and the number of estates affected. There is a much broader picture that must be considered: the economic environment that such taxation creates. We should not penalize success with a ""tax the rich"" attitude.\We kill the goose that lays the golden egg (jobs) through excessive taxation. The fundamental economic theory of diminishing returns is alive and well and living in New Jersey. Eliminating the estate tax would be a major step forward for all New Jerseyans, not just the 4 percent of affected estates.\George Marootian\Franklin Lakes, Oct. 12\Northvale right to back police\Regarding ""Northvale lines up support for its Police Department"" (Page L-3, Oct. 11):\I think it is wonderful that Northvale has painted a blue line down the center of Paris Avenue to show support for its police officers. It seems a day doesn't go by that we don't read a story about police officers being killed on duty somewhere in the United States.\According to one analysis, police officer deaths are up a staggering 78 percent in the first half of this year alone. Unfortunately, where our elected officials, especially our president, should have our police officers backs, they don't. For example, President Obama is quick to condemn the actions of the police when it comes to fatal police shootings, yet some of the suspects killed by the police were either a criminal, engaged in criminal behavior, or someone who attacked or refused to obey the lawful commands of the police.\Instead of backing the police, opportunists like Obama throw their support behind the false narrative of groups like Black Lives Matter.\Officials in Northvale are reminding citizens that police officers are the thin blue line separating the criminals from law-abiding citizens.\Kelly Van Rijn\Washington Township, Oct. 12\Trump is no Truman\Regarding ""Trump's business acumen a plus"" (Your Views, Oct. 7):\The letter juxtaposed Donald Trump's tax-evading declared loss of more than $900 million in 1996 with Harry Truman's failed haberdashery of 1922.\One major difference between the two is that Truman, for more than 15 years, worked and continued to pay off all of his creditors.\It has also been generally acknowledged that the failure was due to economic fluctuations of the times. Once-affluent customers made it a thriving business for a while. When the same customers' funds were curtailed, the haberdashery business suffered.\The only thing the two men have in common is the first four letters of their last names.\Elizabeth Jordain\Teaneck, Oct. 7\Time to discuss the real issues\In response to the recent released video of Donald Trump's vulgarity against women in 2005, he has apologized.\Now he should challenge Hillary Clinton to publicly apologize to the women her husband allegedly molested and whom she trashed in defense of her husband.\Then they should discuss the issues facing the country.\Don Chucka\Franklin Lakes, Oct. 11\More casinos won't help N.J.\Let's review. In the 1950s, New Jersey had very little legalized gambling, only a few racetracks and bingo. Most sweepstakes were labeled void where prohibited, which was New Jersey. Then gambling started sneaking in.\It was the lottery, once a week. Then it was twice a week. Now it is every day and on some days it is twice a day. There are so many different lottery games it is hard to keep track of them all. I wonder if anyone gets carpal tunnel syndrome from all those scratch-offs.\In the 1970s, casinos were allowed in Atlantic City only. The revenue was to help senior citizens. Are your state taxes lower? Now we have online gambling, a push for sports betting and a proposal for more casinos.\Does any of that activity produce any real wealth? Does it produce any real goods and services? Does it lead to our citizens being more well-rounded, more complete human beings or more productive? No, it fosters an attitude to get rich quick for doing nothing.\Atlantic City did briefly benefit from casinos. But a great renaissance did not occur. A few people who owned or managed them got rich. Some of those people lost money, too. We need to stop looking for get-rich-quick schemes and develop projects that provide people with significant employment. Residents should vote no on the proposal to expand casinos outside of Atlantic City.\Michael P. McGrath\Hillsdale, Oct. 4\Christie needs to be impeached\Grover Cleveland said, ""A public office is a public trust.""\The revelations coming out of the Bridgegate trial have made it impossible for New Jersey's citizens ever to trust Governor Christie again. He misused the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey by giving a six-figure salary to someone to do nothing but promote his political career.\Using outrageous toll hikes to give away ""goodies"" in exchange for Democratic mayors' endorsements recalls the shenanigans of Boss Tweed. Christie used charred 9/11 artifacts as campaign tools. Of all his acts, this is the most stomach-churning.\Frankly I don't see how any honest and accountable state legislator can stand by even one more day and let this man run our state. He needs to be impeached and indicted.\Richard Cantisano\Ramsey, Oct. 5"
399,"From his earliest days in Trenton, Chris Christie clearly relished the prospect of one day having his portrait added to the gallery of past governors lining the walls of his State House office.\""I'm getting the oil portrait in the State House,"" he told an audience of educators in Washington, D.C in November 2010, when he was just 11 months into his first term. ""So here's the thing — when I bring my grandchildren back to the State House and I show them that painting...they're going to ask me, 'What did you do, Grandpa, what did you do?""\Seven years later, and just weeks before he leaves office, it is an even more relevant question being asked across the state.\There is no clear answer.\Christie's own reply can be summed up this way: I made the tough calls, upbraided a political class that needed drastic change. When the dust that he kicked up finally settles, his tenure will be viewed as a crucial pivot point in state history, Christie has said in recent months.\Not surprisingly, a wide spectrum of critics — from environmentalists and often demonized state workers to commuters and even fellow Republican leaders — point to lost opportunities and missteps. Christie, branded and marketed as the larger-than-life figure with the political skill to fix ""big things"", has little to show for all his bombast and pro-Jersey cheer leading, they argue.\Either way, analysts and those who've watched Christie closely, say his tenure rests somewhere in between the two extremes.\""If you look at Chris Christie and read what he did over the eight years and what he said he wanted to do, you would probably come out with a different conclusion,"" said Ingrid Reed, a former policy analyst at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. ""In terms of moving New Jersey forward, you might come out with more of a 50 (percent) good, 50 bad.""\In his first two years in office, Christie's pulled off a string of improbable successes and laid the foundation for further reform.\He wielded power, and showed himself to be a fairly shrewd bipartisan negotiator, pushing through public employee benefits, teacher tenure and a top-to-bottom restructuring of the state's medical education programs. It was a goal that eluded three of his predecessors.\Collaborating with South Jersey Democratic Party power broker George Norcross and his allies in the Legislature, Christie helped turn Camden into a laboratory of education and policing reforms. He pushed throughan overhaul of the state's Dickensian cash-bail system, a model other states are now following.\And while Christie's recent anti-opioid crusade strikes some as a cynical attempt at changing the tide of public perception, few other governors in the country have matched his focus and energy.\Christie wrapped his initiatives in campaign style slogans that would later serve as reminders of dashed expectations.\The ""Jersey Comeback"" was undermined by a slow-to-improve job market and an embarrassing 11 downgrades of the state's credit under his watch. The ""Stronger Than the Storm"" slogan rings hollow to Superstorm Sandy victims who are still struggling to rebuild their homes and lives five years later. ""The Telling It Like It is"" slogan for his 2016 presidential campaign seemed like a cynical joke to a public who never believed his denials of knowledge or involvement in the George Washington Bridge lane closing scandal.\Unlike past governors, Christie won't be identified with a monumental and enduring public works project.\The raising of the Bayonne Bridge's span to 215 feet high was a Port Authority project championed by Christie. It will allow super tankers, with mini-skyscrapers of cargo containers to dock at the Port of Elizabeth and Newark. It is expect to make the port more competitive and bolster the region's economy.\But in the public's consciousness, Christie's name is indelibly linked to the jamming up of the toll booths at the George Washington Bridge in a petty payback scheme carried out by top subordinates.\That may change, given time and all that Christie did accomplish.\""Typically, history is always kinder to elected officials,"" said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute of Politics at Rider University. ""Over time, people will forget why he (his approval rating) is at 15 percent and will remember other things.""\Christie's detractors and defenders are both correct, Dworkin said. The ""frustration"" with assessing Christie, he said, is that he had the opportunity ""to do so much more.""\""I think there will always be a disappointment that additional changes didn't come,"" he said.\Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican who served two terms and was Christie's political mentor, has said his skills were without peer, likening him to Bill Clinton.\Kean lamented that it was a ""shame"" that Christie didn't accomplish more.\""He's not going to go away. Somebody with that kind of ability is going to use it in some way or another....he's going to be a force.""\About this series\Gov.

Brendan T. Byrne's sweeping executive orders in the 1970s led to the preservation of the New Jersey Pinelands, a vast wilderness sprawling at the center of the state and home to an aquifer estimated to hold 17 trillion gallons of some of the nation's purest water.\If anything, Christie will be remembered as the governor who viewed the Pinelands as an impediment to progress – and to his ability to reward allies.\Christie muscled through approval of a 22-mile natural gas pipeline despite fierce opposition from environmentalists, residents and even four governors who preceded him. The project was originally defeated in 2014 but Christie replaced several members of the Pinelands Commission, which had jurisdiction over the project, with members who supported it. Christie stood with business and labor groups who argued that the project would create jobs, bolster the energy supply , and carry gas to a power plant that was switching from coal to natural gas.\Infrastructure\Christie championed the raising of the Bayonne Bridge, which allows supertankers to dock in Port Newark. But Christie stunned the nation in October 2010 by pulling the plug on $8.7 billion plan to build the first new rail tunnel under the Hudson River in a century. At the time, the ""Access To The Region's Core"" was the largest public works project in the country.\Christie's decision helped burnish national bona fides as a fearless new fiscal conservative, but in New Jersey, the move was viewed as a politically self-serving and shortsighted maneuver that let Christie sidestep the bipartisan and business community to raise the state's gas tax, the prime source of funding for transportation projects.\Earlier this year, Christie defended his decision, arguing that it's flawed design — the proposed line terminated 20 stories beneath Manhattan and lacked subway connections — would not have brought the promised relief to commuters. He also complained that New York stood to benefit from the project without having to invest a dime.\But transportation advocates and commuters say killing the ARC tunnel will have disastrous consequences, some of which will come into sharp relief when Amtrak begins closing the existing tunnels for repairs in 2020.\Property taxes\Observers from across the political spectrum credit Christie deals that made some headway with New Jersey's highest-in-the-nation property taxes, an issue that has bedeviled governors for decades.\Property tax rates jumped an average of 2.3 percent a year during Christie's first seven years in office, compared to an average 6.5 percent preceding his administration, state records show."
400,"HD: Blood alcohol limit should be stricter\I was pleased that our Gov. McGreevey recently vetoed the gas tax increase.\My question is, when is he going to sign into law the lowering of the blood-alcohol content level in the state of New Jersey?\It seems clear to me that the easiest way to get funding for our roadways is to regain the soon-to-be -lost $7 million in federal highway funding for lowering the BAC level.\I've seen some letters and articles over the last few months that have spoken out against this because it would prevent bars from selling that last drink. I'm glad our barkeeps are more concerned with what wouldn't be going into their pockets than what goes on when people leave their establishments. If I was a bar owner I would certainly want my customers to have one less drink and come back another day than have one too many and never come back to me or their loved ones.\The safety and welfare of the citizens in New Jersey should come before the fattening of the wallets of bar owners, and the agendas of our elected officials.

Mr. White repeatedly mentions that tolerance of homosexual unions is OK, but legalization is not; this statement begs the question of how the denial of legal status to a section of society, a section that has not caused any harm, can be considered tolerant.\He states that legalizing homosexual unions is wrong because it undermines the institution of marriage - an argument that a hundred years ago could have been used against allowing women to vote because it undermines the institution of voting. Or maybe we should deny financial aid to the under-privileged because it undermines the institutions of the wealthy.\We cannot simply claim something as exclusively essential because it is status quo. What about the many countries where polygamy, not the ""union of one man and one woman,"" forms the basis of society? Perhaps he should reconsider his usage of such generalizations.\The legalization of homosexual unions is not an attack on marriage as Mr. White views it; it simply provides equal legal protection for consenting, loving couples that lead normal lives, pay taxes, contribute to society, and provide a caring environment for their children. How do such activities threaten the survival of the state?\A heterosexual couple's legal rights and privileges would see absolutely no effect were this act passed today. Let us remember that the true threats to the institution of marriage are spousal and child abuse, infidelity, and the inability to compromise. These issues have no sexual orientation preferences, and neither should our laws.\And let us remember that denying legal rights to those that differ from us can never be masked under the guise of tolerance.\Sergey Alexandrov\SOMERSET"
401,"TRENTON - Behind the portraits of former governors are the walls that former President Woodrow Wilson once called home.\Somewhere in the Assembly chamber is the spot where Abraham Lincoln once addressed New Jersey legislators as the Civil War was breaking out.\Tour coordinator David April pointed out the archways, remnants from the original 224-year-old building, as he led a reporter past the Governor's Office and into the legislative wing, a short 50-foot hallway.\""You just walked the entire width of the original Statehouse, from the front door to the back door,"" he said. ""The building really evolved into what we see today, after 100 architects and almost 200 years.""\And, unfortunately for cash-strapped taxpayers, the Statehouse is falling apart from the inside.\Gov. Chris Christie recently announced plans for a complete renovation of the New Jersey Statehouse, the third-oldest statehouse in the United States. Today, the paint is peeling off the walls and the floors and stairwells creak under the weight of legislators, reporters and thousands of visitors each year.\The price tag? Christie estimated it will cost a cool $300 million, including $50 million for contingencies. Similar projects in other states have taken taxpayers for a ride, so there's no telling what the upper limit will be.\Christie, whose second four-year-term expires in January 2018, said: ""To leave the Statehouse in this condition is an embarrassment to the people of the state. It impacts the health and safety of the people who work here and visit here and have business here. And, quite frankly, it's shameful.""\Preservation experts said updating old buildings commonly leads to unforeseen issues or delays and that special construction challenges and materials can inflate costs.\""If you have a building that doesn't have historic character, then you're pretty much gutting it and reconstructing it,"" said Justin Mihalik, president of the 2,000-member New Jersey chapter of the American Institute of Architects. ""Here that's not the case, so it will take time and effort to figure out how it can be done.""\It hasn't always been smooth sailing when other states fixed up crumbling historic buildings and repaired out-of-date plumbing and electrical systems:\Restoring the Kansas Statehouse took 13 years and $325 million, more than triple the original estimate after legislators added plans for a visitors' center, office space and parking garage\Updating the Oklahoma Capitol Building is expected to cost $245 million, more than double the initial $120 million projection\The Minnesota Capitol is slated to reopen in 2017 after $310 million in improvements, a 29 percent price bump over the original $241 million estimate.\""Once you get to tearing into something that old, they're going to start finding interesting stuff that nobody anticipated,"" said Oklahoma State Rep. Mark McBride, who sits on an oversight committee for work on the state's Capitol building.\Another expansion\In New Jersey, as the legend goes, former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was walking through the Rotunda towards her office and made the mistake of looking up.\The condition of the golden dome had gotten so bad by 1993 that paint chips were actually falling down around her. That year, she kicked off a $12 million plan to renovate it.\""Statehouses not only house the instruments of government, but they also showcase the pride of the state,"" April said. ""They're showcases in the history and architecture the state has to offer. So when you see a Statehouse in such bad shape -- like Gov. Whitman saw the dome -- it reflects poorly on the state itself.""\But Christie's proposed expansion is an entirely different beast, which April said would likely be the most significant Statehouse work done since the 1800s.\""It's going to be pretty, pretty extensive -- and necessary, in the sense of life safety issues,"" April said. ""It's basically half of the building.""\When it opened in 1792, the tiny Statehouse held the entire Legislature, Governor's Office and Supreme Court. Visitors can still walk the entire width of the original Statehouse: It's a hallway stretching from the Rotunda to the legislative building, only a few dozen feet.\The Assembly and Senate chambers were added in the mid-1800s -- remodeled again a few decades later -- and the entire north side of the building was reconstructed and expanded after an 1885 fire.\The last major update occurred in the late 1980s, including construction of the parking garage, annex and restoring crammed office space into legislative meeting rooms.\The executive branch of the building hasn't been touched in decades. Instead of expanding it, Christie has instead proposed renovating what's left.\""The deteriorating conditions of the building necessitate that this project begin now to ensure the safety of workers and visitors and avoid additional costs,"" he said during a Nov. 29 project announcement, which he ended without taking questions from reporters.\The Statehouse is a hodge-podge of architectural designs and styles. Entire sections of the building are vastly different from adjacent areas, with marble furnishings in one hallway and Victorian stylings just a few feet away.\The patchwork of changes makes the planned updates problematic, said Susan Thrane, an expert on the nation's statehouses.\""I do not know if a new design can adequately reconcile with all the different styles already incorporated,"" said Thrane, author of ""State Houses: America's 50 State Capitol Buildings."" ""Think of the Louvre in Paris. The glass pyramid does not detract from the original protected architecture.""\Famously, the Assembly wing is noticeably different from the Senate wing after Assemblyman James Moylan demanded updates just 20 years after construction of the two chambers was complete.\An architect by trade, Moylan decided to design the wing himself.\A wise investment?\Former Kansas state Sen. Chris Steineger has been a frequent critic of the cost overruns in the restoration of that state's capitol building.\Steineger said New Jersey lawmakers should insist on caps and limits on spending on architects and contractors, and that project managers should build to only ""satisfy your basic needs,"" without ""add-ins and upgrades.""\""Follow these three rules, and your capitol renovation project costs will stay in control,"" Steineger said.\New Jersey officials have provided few details about how they'll monitor costs. Department of Treasury spokesman Willem Rijksen said Christie's renovation plan will be paid for with borrowed money, with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority issuing bonds for that purpose.\Ranking Democrats in the Legislature haven't raised issues with the Republican governor's plans.\""We always stand ready to impose strong legislative oversight as needed, but I also am confident the Economic Development Authority has the wherewithal to work through such a project,"" said Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, D-Hudson. ""Cost is always a concern, but so is public and employee health and safety.""\Two gubernatorial candidates have already expressed concern with the plan. If it goes through, it will require the relocation of the Governor's Office for at least three years -- meaning New Jersey's next governor likely won't occupy the Statehouse until 2019.\""Is this $300 million project the smartest, most efficient way to create a safe, modern environment for the executive branch?"" Democratic candidate Phil Murphy asked. ""The overriding need is for transparency and honesty with taxpayers as to what it is they're actually going to be stuck paying.""\""Our crippling debt is the reason we recently suffered our 10th credit downgrade. It also raises the constitutionality of the plan. Why isn't this debt going before voters?"" asked Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican candidate.\Murphy and Ciattarelli's concerns have been echoed by Wall Street analysts, who almost unanimously agree that the state has both spending and borrowing problems.\""New Jersey has been a very highly leveraged state for a number of years,"" said Baye Larsen, senior analyst for Moody's Investor Services.\""Along with that comes budget challenges brought on by the state's slow economic recovery, optimistic revenue forecasting and rapidly growing pension obligations and contributions.""\According to the Rockefeller Institute, New Jersey's revenues have grown approximately 7 percent over the past eight years, compared with a national average growth rate of 20 percent.\And it's come in a year where New Jerseyans have revolted against other tax-and-spend proposals, including a 23-cent gas tax hike and a bill to increase the salaries of certain state officials who already earn six figures, including judges.\""Our entire infrastructure is crumbling and first major renovation is the Statehouse,"" one Asbury Park Press reader commented on Facebook.\McBride, the Oklahoma representative, is wary anytime a state government gets involved in building projects.\""I'm a construction guy and I wasn't in politics at all until about five years ago,"" McBride said. ""That's when I found out the way I do a construction project and the way a government does it is totally different.""\Bob Jordan: 609-984-4343; bjordan@gannettnj.com\Mike Davis: 732-643-4223; mdavis@gannettnj.com"

Wealth will continue to concentrate in the hands of fewer and fewer, while the middle class slowly fades away.\The class war is officially over, and Wall Street won.\Bob Verbeek\Hamburg, Oct 27\'Time to give up damaging bigotry'\It is discouraging to find, this far into the 21st century, that there are those who still take comfort in the belief that when sinners die, they are condemned to suffer ""unquenchable fire"" (""Less tolerance than meets the eye,"" Your Views, Oct. 26). What kind of wickedness deserves such heart-sickening punishment?\For some, the answer is homosexuality, apparently a sin so reprehensible that it deserves eternal agony. But what evil is it to be gay? I have read and heard a number of assertions (""it is unnatural"" and ""gay marriage would damage heterosexual unions"" among them) but have never seen sound evidence of any wrongdoing.\The homophobe always falls back upon the Bible, but there is no condemnation of homosexuality in the Gospels. And if we are to accept the relevant passage in the Old Testament, we would also have to obey such other commands as how to take care of our slaves, consider our wives as property and slaughter all non-believers.\When one looks at well-known homosexuals in history, no more wickedness is to be seen than in heterosexual humans, and not infrequently considerably more genius, productivity, and humane behavior. It is time to give up this damaging bigotry, and accept one more group into respectable society.\Richard Lettis\Ramsey, Oct. 26\Seniors as excess baggage\My wife, Frances, and I are 78 years old and somewhat handicapped -- my wife, quite severely. We have lived on Medicare for many years and Medicaid in the past two years, surviving the best we can under the circumstances. We don't even own a car to get to doctors or do shopping, but somehow we manage.\However, recently Medicaid has become a health maintenance organization, and we have had no choice but to pick one. The problem is we must pick a primary care physician from among HMO doctors only.\Most of the doctors who have cared for us do not participate in the Medicaid HMOs. We are distressed about not being able to keep doctors who have cared for us for, in some cases, more than 30 years. This seems to be a flagrant violation of our constitutional rights.\If something doesn't happen to help senior citizens like ourselves out of our plight, our death rate will rise enormously. We are being passed off as unnecessary baggage. Maybe they should just dump us into a mass grave.\Washington doesn't seem to recall that we are parents and grandparents and great-grandparents. We are treated as if we are expendable.\Robert Lippi\Pompton Lakes, Oct. 25\*\Regarding ""A 'godsend' for seniors"" (Page A-1, Oct. 28):\The headline lauds the fact that premiums for Medicare Part B will increase less than expected. What is missing is the recent (quiet) decision of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to slash the pay of medical specialists and freeze the pay of general practitioners.\Implications of this decision include discouraging qualified applicants entering medicine, early retirement of skilled, experienced physicians and an increase in the number of doctors who refuse to participate in Medicare.\This is an insidious beginning of rationing health care for our senior citizens. Yes, seniors will face a smaller increase than anticipated for care, but that care may be harder and harder to access. The MPAC decision should be reported and investigated; our congressional representatives should be asked to roll back this decision.\Laura Burnham\Mahwah, Oct. 28\Voting is a right and a responsibility\In America, the unalienable right of every citizen to have a direct say in our electoral process is the quintessential hallmark of freedom and American democracy. The right to express our opinions and beliefs through the ballot box was a bedrock principle fought for during the American Revolution, and it remains a human right that is still not yet realized in many areas of the world. That there are places on Earth, in our modern age of freedom, where people are denied a process to chart their own future's course, should reinforce to us the power of our citizenship and the central truth of our democracy: government of the people, by the people and for the people.\Voting is not merely a paper right, however. It is a responsibility of action that, in order to have true meaning, must be exercised. In a time when our communities and the state face unprecedented challenges on many fronts, it is incumbent on every person to make their voice heard on Nov. 8.\I urge all of my fellow citizens to exercise their civic responsibility and cast their votes on Election Day.\John A. Girgenti\Hawthorne, Oct. 26\The writer, a Democrat, represents New Jersey's 35th District in the state Senate. Hawthorne has been moved into the 38th District, and he is not running for reelection.\Legislature peddles junk bonds\Regarding ""Legislators OK $1.38B in loans for road projects"" (Page A-3, Oct. 28) and Editorial Page Editor Alfred P. Doblin's ""Voters should pay attention to the chosen 120"" (Other Views, Oct. 28):\Trenton is at least constant. The ""chosen 120"" pander to the voter for votes and make choices that will harm the state rather than help it.\We are in a fiscal mess, with a debt load that would crush Atlas. Rather than raise the gas tax, the Legislature has just added $1.3 billion to our state's debt. They must think the voters are really, really stupid.\I do not know about how Wall Street rates bonds. But even I can spell, and smell, JUNK.\Raising the gasoline tax would not be the politically smart thing to do. It is however the proper thing to do.\Peter J. Peirano\Ridgewood, Oct. 28\No equivalence in two movements\Editorial Page Editor Alfred P. Doblin's critique of the Occupy Wall Street movement operating in various locales with their inchoate protests managed to be insulting and wrong in its sideswipe at the Tea Party, particularly in suggesting a moral equivalence between the groups (""Occupy Main Street would make more sense,"" Other Views, Oct. 17).\Most of the column's assertions regarding the Tea Party people appear to have been gleaned from blogs and tales. Here are some insights from one who has participated in a couple of rallies and several meetings.\The Tea Party agenda is simple and straightforward: limit government, lower taxes and lower spending. In comparison to Occupy Wall Street, Tea Partiers decries the bailout of banks with federal money because we understand where the money comes from. We believe it was an error to do so and want the error to be reversed; if not, to be made impossible in the future. Occupy Wall Street protesters decry the bailouts because they didn't get a cut.\Main Street is occupied. It is occupied by people who would like smaller government with a limited portfolio, who understand that it is not the government's job to create jobs, but to keep out of the way of the job-creation process in the private sector.\The condescension in Doblin's article was unwarranted. He should attend a Tea Party meeting and get firsthand exposure to thoughtful, intelligent discourse aimed at fixing the problems of the country and restoring it to the hopeful outlook for opportunity that created the best working and living environment ever known.\William A. Hoffman III\Ridgewood, Oct. 21\*\The Occupy Wall Street movement should acknowledge one obvious fact: The corporations that it assails for manipulating political policy have done so by ""occupying"" their legislators' offices to sway policy in their favor. Every citizen has that right.\Although the size and commitment of the movement is admirable, maybe the protesters involved should consider occupying the very political process they are protesting and show up at their senators' or representatives' offices. Staging on private property only adds a criminal element to the movement, which will inevitably discount the message they are attempting to create.\Paul Lothrop\Clifton, Oct. 27"

409,"From his earliest days in Trenton, Christie clearly relished the prospect of one day having his portrait added to the gallery of past governors lining the walls of his State House office.\""I'm getting the oil portrait in the State House,"" he told an audience of educators in Washington, D.C in November 2010, when he was just 11 months into his first term. ""So here's the thing — when I bring my grandchildren back to the State House and I show them that painting ... they're going to ask me, 'What did you do, Grandpa, what did you do?""\Seven years later, and just weeks before he leaves office, it is an even more relevant question being asked across the state.\There is no clear answer.\Christie's own reply can be summed up this way: I made the tough calls, upbraided a political class that needed drastic change. When the dust that he kicked up finally settles, his tenure will be viewed as a crucial pivot point in state history, Christie has said in recent months.\Not surprisingly, a wide spectrum of critics – from environmentalists and often demonized state workers to commuters and even fellow Republican leaders — point to lost opportunities and missteps. Christie, branded and marketed as the larger-than-life figure with the political skill to fix ""big things"", has little to show for all his bombast and pro-Jersey cheerleading, they argue.\Either way, analysts and those who've watched Christie closely, say his tenure rests somewhere in between the two extremes.\Failed slogans\Christie wrapped his initiatives in campaign style slogans that would later serve as reminders of dashed expectations.\The ""Jersey Comeback"" was undermined by a slow-to-improve job market and an embarrassing 11 downgrades of the state's credit under his watch.\The ""Stronger Than the Storm"" slogan rings hollow to ""Super Storm Sandy"" victims who are still struggling to rebuild their homes and lives five years later. ""The Telling It Like It is"" slogan for his 2016 presidential campaign seemed like a cynical joke to a public who never believed his denials of knowledge or involvement in the George Washington Bridge lane closing scandal.\Unlike past governors, Christie won't be identified with a monumental and enduring public works project.\The raising of the Bayonne Bridge's span to 215 feet high was a Port Authority project championed by Christie.\It will allow super tankers, with mini-skyscrapers of cargo containers to dock at the Port of Elizabeth and Newark.\It is expect to make the port more competitive and bolster the region's economy.\But in the public's consciousness, Christie's name is indelibly linked to the jamming up of the toll booths at George Washington Bridge in a petty payback scheme carried out by top subordinates.\That may change, given time and all that Christie did accomplish.\""Typically, history is always kinder to elected officials,"" said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute of Politics at Rider University. ""Over time, people will forget why he (his approval rating) is at 15 percent and will remember other things.""\Christie's detractors and defenders are both correct, Dworkin said. The ""frustration"" with assessing Christie, he said, is that he had the opportunity ""to do so much more.""\""I think there will always be a disappointment that additional changes didn't come,"" he said.\Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican who served two terms and was Christie's political mentor, has said his skills were without peer, likening him to Bill Clinton.\Kean lamented that it was a ""shame"" that Christie didn't accomplish more.\""He's not going to go away. Somebody with that kind of ability is going to use it in some way or another .... he's going to be a force.""\Christie made major strides on key New Jersey issues. But he made missteps on others. Here's an assessment on those issues:\Environment\Democratic Gov. Brendan T. Byrne's sweeping executive orders in the 1970s led to the preservation of the New Jersey Pinelands, a vast wilderness sprawling at the center of the state and home to an aquifer estimated to hold 17 trillion gallons of some of the nation's purest water.\If anything, Christie will be remembered as the governor who viewed the Pinelands as an impediment to progress — and to his ability to reward allies.\Christie muscled through approval of a 22-mile natural gas pipeline despite fierce opposition from environmentalists, residents and even four governors who preceded him.\The project was originally defeated in 2014 but Christie replaced several members of the Pinelands Commission, which had jurisdiction over the project, with members who supported it.\Christie stood with business and labor groups who argued that the project would create jobs, bolster the energy supply , and carry gas to a power plant that was switching from coal to natural gas.\Infrastructure\Christie championed the raising of the Bayonne Bridge, which allows supertankers to dock in Port Newark. But Christie stunned the nation in October 2010 by pulling the plug on $8.7 billion plan to build the first new rail tunnel under the Hudson River in a century. At the time, the ""Access To The Region's Core"" was the largest public works project in the country.\Christie's decision helped burnish national bona fides as a fearless new fiscal conservative, but in New Jersey, the move was viewed as a politically self-serving and shortsighted maneuver that let Christie sidestep the bipartisan and business community to raise the state's gas tax, the prime source of funding for transportation projects.\Earlier this year, Christie defended his decision, arguing that it's flawed design – the proposed line terminated 20-stories beneath Manhattan and lacked subway connections – would not have brought the promised relief to commuters. He also complained that New York stood to benefit from the project without having to invest a dime.\But transportation advocates and commuters say killing the ARC tunnel will have disastrous consequences, some of which, will come into sharp relief when Amtrak begins closing the existing tunnels for repairs in 2020.\Property taxes\Observers from across the political spectrum credit Christie deals that made some headway with New Jersey's highest-in-the-nation property taxes, an issue that has bedeviled governors for decades.\Property tax rates jumped an average of 2.3 percent a year during Christie's first seven years in office, compared an average 6.5 percent preceded his administration, state records show.\Christie's property tax-effort was aided by other factors. The 2011 landmark pension and health benefit reform he brokered with Democrats forced workers to pay a larger share of their pay toward pension and health care costs, a step that helped towns reduce their payroll costs, according Marc Pfeiffer, assistant director at the Bloustein Local Government Research Center at Rutgers University.\Yet, there are important caveats. School districts received nominal, and in some cases, no increases in public school aid during the Christie years, putting pressure on school districts to raise taxes — school districts comprise the largest share of the property tax bill. Most homeowners also stopped getting the annual rebate from Trenton which helped offset the annual rise in their local property tax rates.\So while Christie could reasonably claim that he restrained annual property tax increases, most people didn't seem to notice.\Bail reform\Christie's eventual support of a historic overhaul of the bail system that will endure as one of his most significant achievements. Seizing on the finding of a study commissioned by Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, Christie brokered a bipartisan bill that effectively wiped out bail for all except those charged with violent crimes or at risk of committing another.\The reforms, enabled by a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2014, has its critics. Some law enforcement groups warn the system has placed burdens on police officers, and that the system will allow the occasional violent offender to slip out on the street. The bail bond industry views the law as a mortal threat and has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop it.\Yet, it has all-but eliminated an antiquated, and unfair system that has placed generations of small time offenders on a lifelong downward spiral of crime and poverty.\The Christie-led reforms have inspired other cash-strapped states to study New Jersey's law, which is by far the most comprehensive. Twenty-seven other states are now considering similar laws, said Udi Ofer, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union-New Jersey and who is now heading the organization's national mass incarceration project.\""New Jersey is ground zero for bail reform,"" Ofer said.\Medical education\Christie's push in 2012 to radically realign New Jersey's medical education systems triggered a firestorm of protest. Rutgers faculty and staff raised concerns. Rutgers absorbed almost all of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey — including its medical schools in Newark and Piscataway.\In South Jersey, Rowan University in Glassboro was elevated to a research university and took over UMDNJ's osteopathic medical school in Stratford.\Critics worried that it was too much for Rutgers to absorb and lead to layoffs. Others say the entire plan was an elaborate bid by Norcross to expand his political empire in South Jersey.\But officials argue that the merger has proven to be a boon for the university.\In fiscal year 2016, Rutgers drew $637.9 million in grants, a 24 percent increase over fiscal year, 2014, the first year of the merger. Rutgers has since climbed in the academic rankings and applications from international students jumped by 56 percent, according to university figures."
410,"HD: LETTER OF THE WEEK\Gas-tax hike answer to transportation woes\An increase in the state gasoline tax is being considered by our state Legislature.\Even with the recent increase in the price of gasoline, New Jerseyans still pay far less at the pump than other motorists in the country and the rest of the world. Although New Jerseyans currently pay a tax of 10.5 cents per gallon for gasoline, the state has the third-lowest gasoline tax in the entire nation. Unlike some other states, New Jersey does not subject gasoline to sales tax. As a result, gas is relatively cheaper in New Jersey.\The relatively low gasoline tax encourages people to drive more, use public transportation less and pay little attention to fuel efficiency. For budget-strapped New Jersey, the relatively low gasoline tax also means a loss of valuable state tax revenue and the need to find the money elsewhere for transportation improvements. The gasoline tax should be increased and strictly dedicated for transportation expenses, including public-transit subsidies and improvements.\Don't get me wrong. I am not generally in favor of raising taxes. In fact, a gasoline tax is an unfairly regressive tax. Lower income New Jerseyans who own older, cheaper and less fuel-efficient cars would shoulder more of the tax burden. However, a gasoline tax also ensures the people who benefit the most - those who drive the most and inflict wear and tear on the roads - pay the most. Simply put, a gasoline tax is a user fee, which makes it more equitable, even for those who traditionally oppose all taxes.\Nonetheless, in the end, New Jersey's system of taxation remains a mess. We are plagued by an antiquated, inequitable system of property taxes, rebates and credits. The state desperately needs a comprehensive property-tax overhaul. But the state also desperately needs to fund essential transportation projects. An increase in the gasoline tax is the answer.\Parag Patel\township councilman,\EDISON\HD: Nature requires its predators\We have read comments about the upcoming state bear hunt and, at first blush, it would seem that sterilization might be an alternative. What we have not read is how will sterilization reduce the bear population? What we have not read is: Who will pay for the drugs and the cost of administering them?\We have read letters claiming that hunting increases the reproduction rates of the animals we hunt; therefore, hunting adds to the problem and simply increases game stocks.\Ask the residents of the Princeton area, who banned hunting within their boundaries, what was the effect of that decision? Ask them what it has cost to hire out-of-state organizations to trap and kill deer, using methods illegal for any New Jersey hunter and considered inhumane by almost any thinking person.\We have read letters telling us that animal populations will level off ""naturally"" if hunting were eliminated. What we have not read is the ""natural"" reduction will be a painful death due to disease and starvation.\Humans are the dominant animal on this planet. Some of us - hunters - are the dominant predator in New Jersey. For many species we are the only predator. While ""predation"" may sound cruel or inhumane, as most animal-rights-before-people-rights groups claim, it seems to me that death by disease or starvation is certainly much more cruel.\As I watch deer sneak across the parking lot adjacent to where I work, I wonder which ones will survive if we have even a normal winter. I try not to think of the animals that certainly will die an agonizingly painful and cruel death if the legal reduction of their numbers is eliminated.\Charles Karolewski\EAST BRUNSWICK\HD: Same-sex marriage isn't corrupting force\Robert T. Heath, author of the Nov. 22 letter ""New Jersey must resist gay marriage,"" claims that the majority of New Jersey voters are opposed to same-sex marriage. This is an unfounded claim with no support from any opinion poll. If he is going to promote New Jersey as a state of hate, he better have some evidence.\People have more important battles to fight than keeping innocent people apart from those they love. Homosexuals have done nothing to harm this country's youth. The majority of child molesters are heterosexual. Merely being taught to tolerate alternative lifestyles is not about to corrupt this nation's children.\What is more important for New Jerseyans to resist is hate. The intolerance is much more dangerous to the youth of this nation than gay marriage.\Roger Nokes\FORDS\HD: Gay unions conform to American values\Though I would never be as absolutely bold as Robert T. Heath to ""profess to know right from wrong,"" I find his Nov. 22 letter to the editor against gay marriage to fit squarely in the latter category.\First and foremost, homosexuality is not a choice. It is grossly presumptuous for any heterosexual to claim such a thing about a characteristic they do not possess. It is no more an individual's decision than being left-handed, or red-headed, or black, or part of any other inborn minority.\I am heterosexual, but I find such narrow thinking as Mr. Heath's to be objectionable. Quote me any number of Bible passages supposedly damning the homosexual, but I believe he's missing the forest for the trees. Jesus' message was one of love and tolerance, an ""agenda"" Mr. Heath refers to as ""deceptive."" That is where the ""Christian influence over American societal values"" can be found.\Yet rights in America thankfully are not limited to just Christians, males or Caucasians; freedom is available to everyone. And just as ""activists"" fought for freedom of religion, gender and race, so must they strive for equality of sexual orientation.\The particular issue at hand, that of gay marriage, is essential to the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of the homosexual community. It is unfairly accusatory to refer to the movement toward gay marriage as ""destructive,"" since elevating gay rights would do absolutely nothing to lower the rights of heterosexuals. Rather than ""trample"" or ""degrade"" the institution of marriage, I argue that legislation permitting gay marriage would help to uphold it. At the heart of the matter, we are discussing the right of two people to legally bind themselves in a loving, monogamous union, a commitment that an overwhelming number of today's heterosexuals choose to ignore, defy, or break.\Marc Longenecker\SOMERSET\HD: N.J. GOP out of touch with majority of voters\The recent story about the ""GOP looking for a winning strategy"" showed exactly what is wrong with the party: Republicans still don't get it; they are not in touch with the voters.\The old guard is still ""soul-searching,"" as Tom Wilson, one of the failed strategists, put it. They have been soul-searching since the last gubernatorial election when they undermined their own candidate because he was not chosen by the party leadership but by the people who go to the polls and vote.\People were (and still) are clamoring for tax reform. Why didn't the GOP embrace the issue instead of just bashing Gov. James E. McGreevey? It is time for them to go and give a chance to somebody who doesn't have to go ""soul-searching"" and is not afraid to support the issues the voters want.\Miklos Bognar Sr.\EAST BRUNSWICK\HD: Does God really roam sideline to sideline?\I was watching the football games Sunday.

New Jersey's air pollution is the worst in the nation, and our nuclear-power plants are becoming more unsafe as they age. Municipalities such as New Brunswick can and must employ smart energy solutions to protect public health and the environment. Increased energy efficiency not only means less air pollution, it also means lower electricity bills for the city.\Through a statewide funding program, the state Board of Public Utilities already offers rebates, available to municipalities, for installing clean renewable energy such as solar panels. The Clean Energy Program at the BPU also is starting a loan-assistance program for municipalities that will ensure that the city immediately starts saving money as it switches to cleaner, more efficient technologies.\In short, the city has the opportunity to become one of the cleanest in the country! City officials should work closely with the students to quickly make their clean-energy proposal a reality.\Emily Rusch\energy advocate,\NJPIRG, TRENTON\HD: Restaurant headline was in very poor taste\I would like to comment on the front page of the supplement ""A Day in the Life of Highland Park"" in the Nov. 20 edition of the Home News Tribune.

It appears to be the title of a picture that shows the inside of Jerusalem Pizza.\I am not kosher, but go there from time to time because the food is very good, and the atmosphere is pleasant and fun. It is hard for me to believe the editors would not be aware that that headline next to a picture of a restaurant can be interpreted negatively.

411," Editor's note: As Governor McGreevey finished his first two years in office, he sat down with The Record's Herb Jackson and Josh Gohlke to discuss his record and the challenge ahead. Here are the highlights of that interview.\ ****\ The Record: How would you rate your year against what you set out to accomplish?\ McGreevey: A good strong year on education. We clearly made substantial advances on what counts. Three hundred thousand children involved in reading initiatives. New Jersey schoolchildren, particularly third grade, having among the highest performance in the nation on reading and mathematics; lifting standards for teachers, particularly requiring subject matter proficiency for teachers...\ On the economy, now for the eighth month in a row we are below the national unemployment rate. We've created 41,000 jobs in contrast to the loss of 66,000 jobs [nationwide]. According to the Federal Reserve, Philadelphia, we arguably have the forth strongest job performance in nation, and as with the Xanadu project in Bergen County, ... 21,000 construction jobs, 20,000 permanent jobs while preserving attractive land the size of Central Park, and with the advent of the rail spurs making it among the most competitive, attractive family recreational sites in the nation.\ In terms of the environment ... . we protected upwards of 7,000 acres of reservoirs, and we've had significant efforts and accomplishments in protecting increase acreage in the Highlands.\ At the beginning of the year you really made sprawl the biggest point on your agenda. There's a perception at least that you had to back off the boldest points of your initiatives.\ There's a distinction between backing off and still fighting. If this were easy, it would have been done years ago. Developers are not going to readily acquiesce to impact fees, namely the fact that they can build 500 houses and not have any sense of responsibility for the cost of schools. ... it's a fight that I'm in to the finish and a fight that we're going to win.\ What happened with the Rutgers merger [with NJIT and UMDNJ]? You've been criticized for being too willing to back off of that when it became controversial.\ It was controversial from the beginning. ... . It was an idea ahead of its time, and the report has yet to come back and set forth opportunities for innovation, making the business community strongly embrace it. NJIT embraced it, UMDNJ's board embraced it, the faculty embraced it. There are those who still have legitimate concerns, but for an idea we developed less than a year and a half ago, this is ground breaking.\ But if the Rutgers merger is such a good idea, why put it on the shelf?\ I'm not putting it on the shelf; putting it on the back burner. There is a difference.\ How do you feel about the pace of ethical reform in pay to play? None of it looks like it's doing very well in the Legislature right now.\ The Legislature, for better or worse, moves slowly and sometimes painfully. I would like to see movement on ethical reform, which is long overdue.\ Is there something more the administration could have done to get that further along over the past year? This was high on the agenda at the beginning of the year.\ What we could do, we have done. In terms of the executive branch of office, we have the most comprehensive, fullest disclosure not only of any branch in state government but arguably of any governor's office, full disclosure, strict prohibition, prohibition of working outside at all, and disclosure of all assets, as well as, obviously, income, so that I personally, as well as every individual who works for the governor's office, lives by the highest ethical standards and with full transparency, which is critically important. And all I am asking the legislature to do is don't do as I say, do as I do.\ But along those same lines, your administration has given contracts to firms that were donors. If the pay to play law that you endorsed as a candidate had been law, you would not have been able to give contracts to [them].\ My goal, my responsibility is to set an ethical standard for the individual in the governor's office, and we have done that. We have also heightened standards for procurements, standards for requests for proposals. For example, the solicitation of the developer in the Xanadu project was full and open, and inclusive of Republicans and Democrats..\ What's critically important is that every contract, every process is open, is public, and subject to review. That is what we did with the Xanadu project. The previous administration was looking to award the contract to the Mills Corp., and we told Mills, no, this is going to be an open, transparent process, which is going to be competitively bid, which is in the best interest of the citizens of Bergen County and the state.\ The money that we received for property tax relief, the design of the project and the public input on transportation as well as the necessity for $150 million rail spur was all basically a result of that public input, criticism, and direction. So we had a better product at the end of the process which was in sharp contrast to what the previous administration was going to do.\ Is there any single policy achievement from this year that you hope the voters will remember in two years and identify you with?\ We closed a $14 billion deficit without raising the sales tax, without raising the income tax on working families, middle class families that are struggling to hold their own, and we had corporations that were only paying 200 bucks a year less than a single mother with a child, and we requested, required corporate America to pay their fair share, and we garnered a billion dollars a year and, I may add, with no Republican assistance.\ When you have a total Democratic control of the Legislature, what's going to be at the top of your agenda?\ The focus is jobs, jobs, jobs. The economy, the economy, the economy. Our economy is in transition. The national economy is in transition. One of my concerns is that the Bush administration is spending $167 billion in Iraq to date - more than the total amount the federal government will spend on education, transportation, and homeland security combined - in a nation infinitely smaller than the continental United States.\ This is the time to invest, this is the time to stimulate economic growth, this is the time to stimulate job growth. We have, according to the Bush administration, a ""jobless recovery."" But to a family that's concerned, it's not a recovery without a job.\ It's jobs, jobs, jobs. But inextricably linked is education. They are the opposite sides of the same coin and they're so critically important. That state's economy will prosper that has the most technically proficient work force, and that's why we're consolidating 40 sometimes non-functional work training programs in one program in the Department of Labor. It will be a powerful opportunity to retrain workers that are out of work and provide for an upgrade of training for existing workers.\ And it's $8.6 billion in school construction, which is critically important. And it's moving forward with road construction.\ How do you move forward on road construction, when your funding source [the Transportation Trust Fund] is being consumed by debt payments?\ The least expensive process is resurfacing, repaving, maintaining existing road structure, and ... a prioritization of new high-end technologically advanced designs. And we'll ask developers to pay more infrastructure costs. For example, on the Xanadu project, we'll get $65 million from the developers, plus $150 million from the Port Authority. Then there's the reauthorization of transportation monies in Washington - that's going to be critically important.\ But don't you have to come up with matching money for that? You don't think you have to come up with a long-range reauthorization plan with a different revenue stream to replace the gas tax?\ We can easily work with the road plans we have in place to make this happen. This can get done. Part of it will require increased developer contribution. Part of it will require increased collaboration with the Port Authority ... and other agencies.\ Some people feel that it is almost worse at DYFS now because there's more cases, fewer foster parents, more pressure on them not to make a mistake. How do you respond to that when they say that things are worse than they were before Faheem Williams died?\ I don't agree with that. Part of that is when you read these cases, and I've read them, the overwhelming number of cases of parents who abuse, neglect, or batter their own children, so at some fundamental level these are parents who are abhorrent, who deserve to be criminally prosecuted and do time. DYFS will never be a replacement for the family. There are bad people doing horribly destructive actions against their own children and they should be prosecuted and sent to jail, and they will be.\ DYFS is in a profound period of transition. The DYFS system as is presently constituted hasn't worked in 25 years, so it's not a matter or it working better or less well this year as opposed to six years or five years ago.\ It's broken and it needs to be fixed. We brought in a Federal District Review Panel, which is setting forth a corrective action plan, which could require the fundamental redesign of DYFS. We'll receive that plan on Jan. 18, and we're going to implement it, and there are going to be lots of people that are going to be upset by that plan, well, damn it, my responsibility is to these children, and we will implement a plan that works.\ How will they be upset?\ Well, we're going to upset the status quo, from A through Z.\ What do you think of the idea of a Cabinet-level Department of Children?\ Having another Cabinet member won't solve anything. ...\ It's not more programs. It's not even necessarily more money. It's making it simple, making it work, and making it accountable. Making it accountable not to a bureaucracy but to a child. The fact is ... Williams should have been in school, he wasn't. Why wasn't he? Well the school district didn't require him to go to school.\ When Faheem's mother went to jail, the court did not notify DYFS. So creating another cabinet level isn't going to send Faheem Williams to school, isn't going to require the courts to notify DYFS, and isn't going to require the school district to work with the police department. You have to fundamentally bring the district elements together to provide the greater accountability for the child.\ Do you have any regrets about the past year, things you wished you'd done?\ Regrets on the impact fees,transfer development rights - that the Legislature would have moved faster. But nonetheless we're still committed to getting it done. We're still committed to moving it, whether it's stem cell research, whether it's a cellphone [while driving] ban, some of this legislation requires longer periods of time to accomplish. The Legislature, for better for worse, doesn't move as quickly as the executive branch.\ And you didn't think that when you were in the Assembly or the Senate?\ I only stayed one term for a reason."
412," It's no secret that New Jersey has slow job growth, a tough business climate, little space for development and a sewage-grade political reputation.\ So what does a mature, economically struggling state do when the national economy hits the skids?\ The question will dominate New Jersey's economic landscape this year as the country falls into what economists expect to be at best a slowdown, and perhaps a recession.\ In some respects, economists say, New Jersey is better positioned than other states to weather hard times. The subprime meltdown hurt the state less than others, and New Jersey's personal income has shown solid growth.\ The state unemployment rate has consistently been lower than the nation's. And key New Jersey industries that are less vulnerable to recessionary swings, such as pharmaceuticals and health care, may bolster the economy.\ Yet the state also has little momentum to carry it through hard times. It added 28,000 to 36,000 new jobs each year since the last slowdown - less than half the number after past recessions, and fewer even than the state's historic annual average of about 40,000. Two of the state's key industries financial services and construction shed jobs in 2007.\ ""It's clearly going to be a challenge for the state to move forward,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist for Cherry Hill-based Commerce Bancorp.\ ""If the nation does go into a recession, then the question is: 'Where is the state going to generate growth from?' "" Naroff said. ""And it's tough to see where that could be.""\ The question is especially pertinent given New Jersey's precarious financial situation and a budget deficit that could top $3 billion.\ Governor Corzine has made economic growth a priority, arguing that new-business development and job creation would generate income to help plug the budget gap.\ But the state has little money for the kind of new incentives and economic development programs that could help create jobs and generate more tax revenue. And a recession would likely shrink revenue further.\ In addition, Corzine wants to reduce the state's massive long- term debts by issuing $38 billion in bonds that would be paid off with large increases in highway tolls over the next 25 years.\ Short term, the plan could further burden state finances. And some business leaders worry that the hikes would add to New Jersey's reputation as a difficult place to do business.\ The importance of incentives, and their ability to attract new businesses, can be seen at City Theatrical Inc., whose owner is confident that the $6 million-a-year business will shrug off a slowdown.\ In April, the manufacturer of theatrical lights moved from the Bronx to Carlstadt thanks, in part, to a $47,000 grant awarded under the state Business Employment Incentive Program.\ The company has 42 employees. Its lights sell worldwide, owner Gary Fails said. Revenue increased by 34 percent in 2007 - a performance strong enough that Fails is ""not overly worried"" about a recession, even though the industry generally suffers from the cutback in discretionary consumer spending that goes with a slowdown.\ ""We export a great deal, and we are about to open an office in London to take advantage of that increase in business,"" said Fail, adding that exports were boosted in 2007 by the weakening of the dollar.\ His confidence could soon be tested if Joseph Seneca, a Rutgers University economist, is correct. Seneca believes that a slowdown in the first half of 2008 is so certain it's ""baked in the cake.""\ ""Whether or not we skirt a recession nationally, there are going to be echo effects in New Jersey, resulting in slower employment and income growth,"" said Seneca, the chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors, an organization that reports to the governor.\ Jeffrey Wolpov, chief executive officer of Clifton-based Distribution Solutions Inc., which provides warehouse services and distribution for big retailers, agreed. He predicted that his company's sales would grow by 20 percent in 2008 - well below the 35 percent increase last year.\ ""We are expecting the first nine months of '08 to be very soft,"" he said. ""We think it will be a struggle.""\ The impact of a national slowdown on the state in the past has varied.\ The 1981-82 recession, the nation's worst since the Depression, barely affected New Jersey, said James Hughes, a Rutgers University economist and dean of the school's Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. At the time, the state enjoyed a buoyant economy due to a suburban office construction boom, he said.\ The 1989-92 recession, although mild nationally, hit New Jersey hard due to the bursting of the state's real estate bubble, he said. While the 2001 recession was less severe than others of the past for both New Jersey or the nation, it also did not yield the kind of job- creation rebound that followed previous economic troughs, Hughes said.\ ""Compared to past expansions, we really didn't have a breakout year where we had very strong growth,"" Hughes said.\ That pattern continued in 2007. The state added just 29,400 jobs - 4,500 fewer than in 2006. Twenty percent were government jobs.\ The state's job growth even lagged behind the anemic national performance, growing by six-tenths of 1 percent compared to the 1 percent increase in the national workforce, Seneca said.\ Hughes and Seneca attribute the slow job growth partly to the state's long-term trend away from the creation of skilled, high- paying jobs.\ They say job employment data show the state is now adding well- paid jobs more slowly than it is creating positions at the bottom of the wage scale. Seneca calculates that about one-quarter of the state's 2007 job growth came in the high-paid sectors, and the remainder in lower-paid jobs.\ The grim outlook was reflected by the Rutgers Economic Advisory Service, an analysis and consulting group at the university, which said in January that New Jersey is caught in the ""economic doldrums."" The service predicted the state's economy will perform worse than the rest of the nation's through 2012.\ Business leaders also say the state economy is on the wrong track and blame a difficult business environment. They argue that excessive taxes, government regulation and high land costs deter companies from relocating into the state, or expanding here.\ Yet the state economy in 2007 was clearly shaped by short-term factors, too most notably the subprime mortgage meltdown.\ By some indicators, New Jersey weathered it better than other parts of the country. About 2.54 percent of mortgages in the state were in serious delinquency or foreclosure in the third quarter, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Mortgage Bankers Association. That was lower than the national figure of 2.95 percent, and well below the 5 percent rate of delinquency and foreclosure in the worst-hit states, such as Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.\ But New Jersey's financial sector suffered. The state lost 1,700 financial services jobs in 2007, compared with a gain of 1,700 jobs in 2006.\ And while financial services companies such as Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank and UBS AG have lately announced thousands of cuts worldwide, North Jersey saw a steady drumbeat of layoff announcements throughout 2007. The downsizing companies included the Jersey City offices of Morgan Stanley, Mellon Investor and TD Waterhouse; CIT Technology in Mahwah; Washington Mutual in Clark; JPMorgan Chase in Maywood; GMAC Rescap in Parsippany; and Equity One in Parsippany.\ Mike Ramer, owner of Livingston-based Ramer Search Consultants Inc., an executive search firm, said financial services job hunters face a mixed picture.\ ""Anything to do with structured finance and credit derivatives, the mortgage market, has stopped,"" he said. And although the market for wealth management, commercial lending and retail banking workers has held up, non-mortgage-related sectors could soon be hit, he said.\ ""The stock market in the last few weeks has been horrible,"" Ramer said. ""So I would expect the retail brokerages over the next six months will be hurting. There may be layoffs.""\ That was the case in the collapse of Foxtons, the discount real estate company, which cost 350 workers their jobs in the fall and showed the weakness of the state real estate and construction sectors.\ New Jersey lost 1,400 construction jobs in 2007, after adding 1,500 in 2006. The state issued 27 percent fewer residential construction permits in the first 11 months of 2007 than in the same period a year earlier, figures from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development show.\ The biggest permit declines in North Jersey came in Bergen County, with a 31 percent drop, and Hudson County, which saw a 32 percent drop.\ ""New Jersey has definitely gone from a boom to a bust,"" Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said. ""But it's not on the magnitude of other states.""\ Indeed, some New Jersey job sectors showed resilience in 2007, which could bode well for 2008.\ Education and health services added 12,500 jobs, or 43 percent of the total increase for the state, and the leisure and hospitality sector added 3,800 jobs. About 45 percent, or 13,100 jobs, of the total came in the professional and business services sector, which generally produces highly paid jobs.\ The sector includes companies such as Glen Rock-based Holdcom, which supplies recorded telephone announcements and prompts.\ In 2007, the company added two employees, taking the full-time workforce to 20, with 50 freelancers.\ CEO Harvey Edelman said he expects 2008 to be strong despite talk of a slowdown.\ He said that even if existing customers cut back, the company has lately seen a steady stream of new clients, fueled by the growing use of sound for Web sites and by the company's line of new products.\ ""We have always felt like we were recession-proof,"" Edelman said. ""Even as people are tightening their belts and getting more conservative, we are in an area where opportunities keep opening up.""\ Among sectors where employment declined in 2007, manufacturing shed 4,800 jobs, 1,900 fewer than in 2006.\ And the next-biggest drop came in the transportation, warehousing and utilities sector, which lost 3,100 jobs.\ That loss came as foreign trade declined slightly, even though it remained strong.\ Exports grew by about 15 percent in the first 11 months of the year over the same period in 2006, according to Holyoke, Mass.- based WISER, which analyzes federal trade data.\ That was helped by the weakening dollar - which makes U.S. goods cheaper for foreign buyers. But the increase was smaller than in 2006, when exports increased by 28 percent.\ Imports into New Jersey ports, which became more expensive for U.S. buyers as the dollar weakened, grew by just 5 percent in the first 11 months of 2007, compared with 9 percent growth in 2006.\ Wolpov, the CEO of Distribution Solutions, said the distribution and warehouse industry underwent a reversal of fortunes late last year, after a strong beginning. In April, his company opened a 360,000-square-foot, $9 million warehouse and corporate headquarters in Clifton, he said.\ The company hired about 150 people, ending the year with 600 employees. And in the spring, high demand for trucks and drivers helped send delivery prices upward.\ But demand dropped in November, largely due to poor retail sales for Christmas, he said, adding that he may have to lay off workers this year to control overhead costs.\ ""December was extremely weak across the board,"" he said. ""We are limping into the first quarter of 2008.""\ ***\ How're we doing?\ A snapshot of the New Jersey economy in 2007:\ Sources: New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development; PricewaterhouseCoopers; New Jersey Treasury Department\ ***\ Garden State jobs picture\ Here's how the employment market changed in 2007:\ Source: N.J.

413,"Christie's Legacy Part 3: Three-part series examining the governor's record.\From his earliest days in Trenton, Chris Christie clearly relished the prospect of one day having his portrait added to the gallery of past governors lining the walls of his State House office.\""I'm getting the oil portrait in the State House,"" he told an audience of educators in Washington, D.C., in November 2010, when he was just 11 months into his first term. ""So here's the thing — when I bring my grandchildren back to the State House and I show them that painting...they're going to ask me, 'What did you do, Grandpa, what did you do?""\Seven years later, and just weeks before he leaves office, it is an even more relevant question being asked across the state.\There is no clear answer.\Christie's own reply can be summed up this way: I made the tough calls, upbraided a political class that needed drastic change. When the dust that he kicked up finally settles, his tenure will be viewed as a crucial pivot point in state history, Christie has said in recent months.\Not surprisingly, a wide spectrum of critics — from environmentalists and often demonized state workers to commuters and even fellow Republican leaders — point to lost opportunities and missteps. Christie, branded and marketed as the larger-than-life figure with the political skill to fix ""big things"", has little to show for all his bombast and pro-Jersey cheer leading, they argue.\Either way, analysts and those who've watched Christie closely, say his tenure rests somewhere in between the two extremes.\""If you look at Chris Christie and read what he did over the eight years and what he said he wanted to do, you would probably come out with a different conclusion,"" said Ingrid Reed, a former policy analyst at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. ""In terms of moving New Jersey forward, you might come out with more of a 50 (percent) good, 50 bad.""\In his first two years in office, Christie's pulled off a string of improbable successes and laid the foundation for further reform.\He wielded power, and showed himself to be a fairly shrewd bipartisan negotiator, pushing through public employee benefits, teacher tenure and a top-to-bottom restructuring of the state's medical education programs. It was a goal that eluded three of his predecessors.\Collaborating with South Jersey Democratic Party power broker George Norcross and his allies in the Legislature, Christie helped turn Camden into a laboratory of education and policing reforms.\He pushed through an overhaul of the state's Dickensian cash-bail system, a model other states are now following.\And while Christie's recent anti-opioid crusade strikes some as a cynical attempt at changing the tide of public perception, few other governors in the country have matched his focus and energy.\Christie wrapped his initiatives in campaign style slogans that would later serve as reminders of dashed expectations.\The ""Jersey Comeback"" was undermined by a slow-to-improve job market and an embarrassing 11 downgrades of the state's credit under his watch. The ""Stronger Than the Storm"" slogan rings hollow to Superstorm Sandy victims who are still struggling to rebuild their homes and lives five years later. ""The Telling It Like It is"" slogan for his 2016 presidential campaign seemed like a cynical joke to a public who never believed his denials of knowledge or involvement in the George Washington Bridge lane closing scandal.\Unlike past governors, Christie won't be identified with a monumental and enduring public works project.\The raising of the Bayonne Bridge's span to 215 feet high was a Port Authority project championed by Christie. It will allow super tankers, with mini-skyscrapers of cargo containers to dock at the Port of Elizabeth and Newark. It is expect to make the port more competitive and bolster the region's economy.\But in the public's consciousness, Christie's name is indelibly linked to the jamming up of the toll booths at the George Washington Bridge in a petty payback scheme carried out by top subordinates.\That may change, given time and all that Christie did accomplish.\""Typically, history is always kinder to elected officials,"" said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute of Politics at Rider University. ""Over time, people will forget why he (his approval rating) is at 15 percent and will remember other things.""\Christie's detractors and defenders are both correct, Dworkin said. The ""frustration"" with assessing Christie, he said, is that he had the opportunity ""to do so much more.""\""I think there will always be a disappointment that additional changes didn't come,"" he said.\Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican who served two terms and was Christie's political mentor, has said his skills were without peer, likening him to Bill Clinton.\Kean lamented that it was a ""shame"" that Christie didn't accomplish more.\""He's not going to go away. Somebody with that kind of ability is going to use it in some way or another....he's going to be a force.""\Democratic Gov. Brendan T. Byrne's sweeping executive orders in the 1970s led to the preservation of the New Jersey Pinelands, a vast wilderness sprawling at the center of the state and home to an aquifer estimated to hold 17 trillion gallons of some of the nation's purest water.\If anything, Christie will be remembered as the governor who viewed the Pinelands as an impediment to progress — and to his ability to reward allies.\Christie muscled through approval of a 22-mile natural gas pipeline in South Jersey, despite fierce opposition from environmentalists, residents and even four governors who preceded him. The project was originally defeated in 2014 but Christie replaced several members of the Pinelands Commission, which had jurisdiction over the project, with members who supported it. Christie stood with business and labor groups who argued that the project would create jobs, bolster the energy supply and carry gas to a Cape May County power plant that was switching from coal to natural gas.\Christie championed the raising of the Bayonne Bridge, which allows supertankers to dock in Port Newark. But Christie stunned the nation in October 2010 by pulling the plug on $8.7 billion plan to build the first new rail tunnel under the Hudson River in a century. At the time, the ""Access To The Region's Core"" was the largest public works project in the country.\Christie's decision helped burnish national bona fides as a fearless new fiscal conservative, but in New Jersey, the move was viewed as a politically self-serving and shortsighted maneuver that let Christie sidestep the bipartisan and business community to raise the state's gas tax, the prime source of funding for transportation projects.\Earlier this year, Christie defended his decision, arguing that it's flawed design – the proposed line terminated 20 stories beneath Manhattan and lacked subway connections – would not have brought the promised relief to commuters. He also complained that New York stood to benefit from the project without having to invest a dime.\But transportation advocates and commuters say killing the ARC tunnel will have disastrous consequences, some of which will come into sharp relief when Amtrak begins closing the existing tunnels for repairs in 2020.\Observers from across the political spectrum credit Christie deals that made some headway with New Jersey's highest-in-the-nation property taxes, an issue that has bedeviled governors for decades.\Property tax rates jumped an average of 2.3 percent a year during Christie's first seven years in office, compared to an average 6.5 percent preceding his administration, state records show.\Christie's property tax-effort was aided by other factors. The 2011 landmark pension and health benefit reform he brokered with Democrats forced workers to pay a larger share of their pay toward pension and health care costs, a step that helped towns reduce their payroll costs, according to Marc Pfeiffer, assistant director at the Bloustein Local Government Research Center at Rutgers University.\Yet, there are important caveats. School districts received nominal, and in some cases, no increases in public school aid during the Christie years, putting pressure on school districts to raise taxes – school districts comprise the largest share of the property tax bill. Most homeowners also stopped getting the annual rebate from Trenton, which helped offset the annual rise in their local property tax rates.\So while Christie could reasonably claim that he restrained annual property tax increases, most people didn't seem to notice.\""They (property taxes) kept going up from a rate that was already unacceptable,"" said Patrick Murray, the Monmouth University pollster who tracked Christie's career.\Christie, an ex-federal prosecutor, did not fit into easy ideological definitions when it came to criminal justice matters.\In 2012, Christie began declaring the ""War on Drugs"" launched in the late 1980s as a well-intentioned failure and arguing that more extensive investment in drug treatment programs would prove to be a more cost efficient and humane approach.\It was a surprisingly progressive tone for an avowed conservative to make, but Christie was joining a chorus of Republican leaders over the country saddled with the costs and consequences of mandatory prison sentences meted out decades earlier.\But Christie never entirely abandoned the hard line postures of the past. He remained a staunch foe of decriminalizing marijuana laws that contributed to prison overcrowding, and hotly opposed legalizing marijuana outright, calling any tax revenue reaped from legal pot sales ""blood money.""\Christie also vetoed a measure in December 2016 that restricted the use of solitary confinement in prisons as an ""ill-informed, politically motivated press release.""\But in 2012, he expanded the state's system of ""drug courts,"" where non-violent drug offenders are assigned to a treatment program instead of prison.\Christie's reforms made treatment mandatory. Christie backed reforms smoothed the re-entry into the mainstream for drug users, such as signing a ""ban the box"" law that prohibited employers from automatically rejecting job applicants with criminal histories. He has also backed a package of laws would also prohibit companies from rejecting job seekers who had their criminal histories expunged.\Christie's eventual support of a historic overhaul of the bail system will endure as one of his most significant achievements. Seizing on the finding of a study commissioned by Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, Christie brokered a bipartisan bill that effectively wiped out bail for all except those charged with violent crimes or at risk of committing another.\The reforms, enabled by a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2014, has its critics.\Some law enforcement groups warn the system has placed burdens on police officers, and that the system will allow the occasional violent offender to slip out on the street.\The bail bond industry views the law as a mortal threat and has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop it.\Yet, it has all-but eliminated an antiquated and unfair system that has placed generations of small time offenders on a lifelong downward spiral of crime and poverty.\The Christie-led reforms have inspired other cash-strapped states to study New Jersey's law, which is by far the most comprehensive.\Twenty-seven other states are now considering similar laws, said Udi Ofer, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union-New Jersey and who is now heading the organization's national mass incarceration project.\""New Jersey is ground zero for bail reform,"" Ofer said.\Christie's push in 2012 to radically realign New Jersey's medical education systems triggered a firestorm of protest. Rutgers faculty and staff raised concerns. Rutgers absorbed almost all of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey – including its medical schools in Newark and Piscataway.\In South Jersey, Rowan University in Glassboro was elevated to a research university and took over UMDNJ's osteopathic medical school in Stratford.\Critics worried that it was too much for Rutgers to absorb and would lead to layoffs. Others say the entire plan was an elaborate bid by Norcross to expand his political empire in South Jersey.\But officials argue that the merger has proven to be a boon for the university.\In fiscal year 2016, Rutgers drew $637.9 million in grants, a 24 percent increase over fiscal year 2014, the first year of the merger. Rutgers has since climbed in the academic rankings and applications from international students jumped by 56 percent, according to university figures.\New Jersey lacks a robust, two-party system, in large part due to Christie's indifference.\Christie, known as the ""One Constituent"" party and staff needed to serve, gave Republican candidates only token help during the height of his power, spending little attention on party building or allowing other potential successors to shine. The state party became his piggy bank for his political travel and he saddled it with legal bills caused by the George Washington Bridge scandal.\Christie was widely praised for leading the Republican Governors Association in 2014. But back home, he became an albatross for Republicans.\Eight years after his arrival, Democrats expanded their seats in the Senate by one, to 25, and the seven-seat gain to 54 seats in the Assembly represents the largest Democratic majority in nearly 30 years. The 2011 redrawing of legislative districts created a map that allowed Democrats to consolidate power.\A sense that Christie put his own ambitions ahead of the needs and future of his own party has become almost an article of faith among New Jersey Republicans. ""The party is not in great shape. We have no bench,"" asserted Sen. Christopher ""Kip"" Bateman, a veteran legislator from Somerset County. ""It was all about him.""\Christie's Legacy Part 3: Three-part series examining the governor's record.\About this series\Gov.

414,"'Listen to right-wing America'\I'm fed up with Republicans usurping 33 percent of The Record's opinion page with right-wing propaganda (""We want change, but reasoned change,"" Other Views, Oct. 5).\Listen to right-wing America. It's against all blacks, Hispanics, gays, unions, government employees, welfare, abortion rights, unemployment benefits, minimum wage laws, rebates to poor seniors and the disabled, a tax freeze for seniors, equal pay for women, libraries, school lunches for poor kids, sex education in schools, evolution taught in schools, public schools, stem cell research, medical marijuana, aid to the developmentally impaired, the blind, the disabled and any and all social programs that do not benefit its members directly.\Its proponents favor unrestricted gun ownership and love war (provided they don't have to go). They like tax breaks for the rich because they may hit the lotto and because the rich create jobs, even if they're in China or India.\They don't want the government regulating corporations, banks, the environment or anything. They hate that Muslim, Hitler, Socialist, Kenya-born, black Obama, and they want him to fail. They think Sarah Palin is beautiful, and they love Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. They believe we should name everything after Ronald ""the government is the problem!"" Reagan.\Johnnie Najarian\River Edge, Oct. 5\*\Christie Whitman says fury and betrayal are not coherent values on which to found public policy (""We want change, but reasoned change,"" Other Views, Oct. 5). What the heck was the American Revolution about?\Anyway, let me get this straight: I am to take a values course from a person who vetoed a bill that outlawed partial birth abortions as governor in 1999? Oh how sweet it is.\Mike Castle is reasonable and a fiscal conservative? I guess being a wishy-washy, middle-of-the-road, reach-across-party-lines, see-both-sides-of-the-issue ""moderate,"" as our former governor is explains her description of Castle. It is precisely this thinking from these intellectuals that got us TARP and cap and trade. Whitman says fiscal conservative; I say a typical liberal who spends our hard-earned money.\She extols Castle's virtues, then rips Christine O'Donnell. She says O'Donnell has no credentials and can't manage her finances. Well, at least she didn't mismanage the finances of how many teachers in New Jersey by mismanagement of the public pension fund.\Whitman says O'Donnell's views are out of step with the mainstream. So, cutting spending, limiting government regulation and bureaucracy and cutting taxes are not in the mainstream.\Whitman laments: ""Even if she wins how will she work with people across the aisle."" Wake up. This is what working across the aisle means: getting the Republicans to do what the Democrats want.\Whitman says gridlock born of extremism is not going to produce solutions. So, adhering to our Constitution, empowering the individual and pursuing liberty and freedom through personal responsibility is extreme?\Wow.\And I thought frisking a black youth for no good reason was the definition of extreme.\David Cavalluzzo\Hackensack, Oct. 6\*\I'm not a Tea Party member, but the answer to ""A question for Tea Party"" (Your Views, Oct. 2), although not simple, is obvious. The original Tea Party's eventual answers to the question of ""Now what?"" were the Declaration of Independence, the War for Independence and the U.S. Constitution, which set the stage for the creation of the greatest nation on Earth: just, compassionate, lawful and entrepreneurial.\These qualities are fraying because we've put expediency before character, votes before just government and self-interest before the interest of the nation as a whole.\Before anyone can solve a problem, there must be recognition that there is one. We must uncover the reasons behind them and remove those reasons. Then policy questions can be practically answered, so long as they are constructed from a standpoint that's just, compassionate, lawful and ""liberal"" in regard to letting people make their own ways in life and business without government interference.\Gerald Wisz\Garfield, Oct. 2\*\With disgust, I read that the income gap between the richest and poorest Americans grew last year to its largest margin ever (""Other census findings,"" Page A-13, Sept. 29) and Republican are outspending Democrats on TV ads by a 6-1 margin (""GOP groups outspend Democrats on ads,"" Page A-6, Sept. 28).\This is what 40 years of right-wing propaganda has wrought.\President Nixon went to China and provided opportunity for corporations and rich investors while ultimately forcing the American middle class to compete against slave-wage workers. Then, President Reagan attacked the labor movement and helped prop up corporate profits.\The right wing always blames government claiming it is too big. Then, after their deficit spending and inept legislation, they make the American middle-class bailout the ""too big to fail"" right-wing elite. Legislation and tax codes do redistribute wealth, and for 40 years the greedy have made fools of the working middle class.\During the 1950s the top marginal income tax rate on the super rich was more than 90 percent, and they reinvested in the American economy and worker. Today, the right-wing elite pay less tax because it invested in Congress.\Daniel Buckley\Lodi, Sept. 28\*\It pays to analyze the right's policy agenda, particularly the Republican Party's ""Pledge to America."" It really is an old shirt turned inside-out and called new.\The pledge condemns federal debt 16 times but proposes to make the Bush tax cuts for the rich permanent. It hints at fewer national parks, no more Small Business Administration loans, no more Medicaid, child health or nutrition programs and no more homeland security. Later, the Republicans will tackle Social Security and the new health care additions.\It should come as no surprise that Republicans oppose any or all of President Obama's ideas for the economy and unemployment because if those measures worked it would greatly embarrass and undermine all Republican arguments. That would not bode well in the next presidential election.\How can anyone ignore the fact that billionaires and high financiers head the Tea Party? How can one believe that they are interested in the middle class' welfare when the middle class is being nudged into the poverty zone?\Republicans' behavior -- twittering while the president speaks, calling him a liar during a speech -- fortifies my opinion that they are bent on demeaning a man who is for the middle class, for children's education, for the returning vet, and for better health care. They are busy creating divisions; the president is anxious to unite. But that's what the Tea Party is all about -- division.\Phyllis Sembos\Emerson, Sept. 26\*\Regarding ""Old-style campaigning suits Pascrell just fine"" (Page A-1, Oct. 4):\Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, claims that he ""said to the Tea Party early on, you're fighting against big government, what would you have done? Would you have recommended to President Bush not to bail out these banks and let the whole thing crash and do nothing? What would you have done? I never got an answer.""\Never got an answer? How might Pascrell propose that we ought to have let him know our numerous answers?\Perhaps we could have shown up at his shamefully all-too-infrequent town hall meetings. Maybe we could hosted giant rallies in several New Jersey locations and in Washington, D.C., on a regular basis. Perhaps pollsters could ask us our opinions and report them in hundreds of different media outlets. Of course, my fellow tea partiers and I did all these things -- and Pascrell makes it abundantly clear that he doesn't care about what we have to say.\Mark Kalinowski\Clifton, Oct. 6\The ARC tunnel and Christie\In the spring, Governor Christie went on the warpath against our children in the name of taking down the teachers union. His aggressive campaign against approving school budgets has led to thousands of teachers losing their jobs and jeopardizes the future of our children.\Thursday, he killed the thousands of jobs that were being created by the digging of a new rail tunnel under the Hudson. His shortsighted decision will lead to more crowded streets and highways and more auto and truck pollution.\Instead of building for the future, Christie is content to operate in the short term. The question is: What will Christie do next to kill jobs, damage our future and lower the quality of life in New Jersey? I can't answer that question beyond guaranteeing that there will be something, and it'll probably happen soon.\Roger Berkley\Woodcliff Lake, Oct. 7\*\I am appalled by ""Christie shoots down tunnel project"" (Page A-1, Oct. 8). It is so one-sided and typical of your paper's political philosophy. Instead of just reciting a list of potential people who may suffer, including, of all things, those whose property values might go up, you might have also attempted to list the consequences of cost overruns if Governor Christie had not acted.\I commend Christie for taking into account the fiscal impact of probable, not only potential, cost overruns on New Jersey's finances. Fortunately, New Jersey can't print money like the federal government. Guess who would wind up paying for overruns? We taxpayers from all over New Jersey.\Richard W. Rudmann\Elmwood Park, Oct. 8\*\Everyone talks and writes about how to stop bullying. Why don't we start at the top with Governor Christie? With him it's, ""My way of the highway."" He's turned out to be the biggest bully of them all. It's getting to the point where the more I read about his shenanigans, the more I regret having voted for him.\Anne Reynolds\Oradell, Oct. 8\*\I recoiled at the news that Governor Christie wants to scrap the ARC tunnel project which, incidentally, would save me over an hour per day on my round-trip commute.\My wife always tells me to listen to her because, as she says, she's always right. She voted for former Gov. Jon Corzine. I voted for Christie. My wife is right again.\Abraham Weintraub\Fair Lawn, Oct. 7\*\Governor Christie's decision to block the building of a new commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River is grounds at least for a public vote on the project.\This is a blunder of epic proportions. Christie may think he's being ""bold,"" but in fact his decision is cowardly.\The Governor says we're ""broke."" Yet he won't raise the gas tax a penny a gallon, which would raise $50 million annually. He won't raise taxes on the top 1 percent.\It will stunt growth in the state. It will kill jobs and it is exactly the wrong thing to do now. We are coming out of this economic downturn. We cannot afford not to build this tunnel.\Our rail system needs upgrading. Our roads, bridges and tunnels are both antiquated and operating far beyond their capacities now.\For pessimists who saw a bleak future, this decision offers affirmation. For those who see bright signs, this decision dims them.\This man is now an official disaster. Let's get rid of him. Don't think only Tea Party types are fed up.\Michael Fremer\Wyckoff, Oct. 7\Taxpayers are Pequannock's bank\The Pequannock Township Council decided a number of years ago to buy out the homes along the river and pay the market value to their owners through the Open Space program. This was a good thing for residents who owned homes along the river; however, it also resulted in lost tax revenue for the township, which will tap the remaining taxpayers for the lost revenue.\""Little Falls gets $5.9M to elevate flood-prone homes"" (Page L-1, Oct. 2) reported on how Little Falls created a mitigation plan that made the township eligible for federal grants. Due to its efforts, Little Falls received a $5.9 million grant to elevate 34 homes in the flood zone.\Why the Pequannock Township Council couldn't have created a mitigation plan as well is beyond comprehension. Apparently, the township's elected officials had no knowledge of such an undertaking. All they know how to do is go to the bank and spend, spend, spend our tax money. After all, we the taxpayers are their bank.\Henry L. Samek\Pompton Plains, Oct. 3\The writer, a former Pequannock mayor, ran unsuccessfully as an independent in 2008 for a seat on the Township Council.\Public pays price of presidential visit\I am still quite disturbed by President Obama visiting Cresskill for a fund raiser at a big-shot resident's home for one hour.\He will be flying into Newark and leaving via Air Force One along with its dummy twin and four or five Marine helicopters. I understand it costs taxpayers at least $2.5 million any time Air Force One goes anywhere. For days, dozens of Secret Service and state police vehicles will turn Cresskill upside down; his limo will wait in the firehouse, and the Secret Service will take over the police station.\I learned from a chat with Cresskill's mayor that the visit will cost the borough and state well over $50,000. The mayor was not among the guests at the gathering.\This is disgusting. I don't even think Wall Street would do something like this. But who am I to say anything. I just give the federal government 40 percent of my hard-earned money.\Silly me.\Doug Daniele\Paramus, Oct. 6\*\We already know The Record leans to the left. But the way you framed the news about President Obama on Oct. 7 was really a disservice to your journalistic credibility.\Your lead story is "" Obama visit boosts party war chest"" (Page A-1) about the president's visit to a Cresskill home to rally Democrats. Buried on Page A-11 is ""Panel faults White House"" about the president's own commission on the administration's control of information about the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It faults the administration for systematically minimizing the dimensions of one of our nation's worst environmental disasters, raising questions about the administration's candor and competence.\Let's get real. Don't you think this news is more important to the public than the president's fund-raising trip?\Robert Budelman\Hawthorne, Oct. 7\*\Regarding ""Obama visit boosts party war chest"" (Page A-1, Oct. 7):\Who could afford a $30,400-a-plate dinner other than the ""fat cats"" aptly named by President Obama?\However, I guess that they are viewed differently when contributing to the Democrats' coffers.\Hypocrisy or just another lie? You make the decision.\Ronald Cutro\Tenafly, Oct. 7"

The 2011 landmark pension and health benefit reform he brokered with Democrats forced workers to pay a larger share of their pay toward pension and health care costs, a step that helped towns reduce their payroll costs, according to Marc Pfeiffer, assistant director at the Bloustein Local Government Research Center at Rutgers University.\Yet, there are important caveats. School districts received nominal, and in some cases, no increases in public school aid during the Christie years, putting pressure on school districts to raise taxes – school districts comprise the largest share of the property tax bill. Most homeowners also stopped getting the annual rebate from Trenton, which helped offset the annual rise in their local property tax rates.\So while Christie could reasonably claim that he restrained annual property tax increases, most people didn't seem to notice.\""They (property taxes) kept going up from a rate that was already unacceptable,"" said Patrick Murray, the Monmouth University pollster who tracked Christie's career.\Bail reform\Christie's eventual support of a historic overhaul of the bail system will endure as one of his most significant achievements. Seizing on the finding of a study commissioned by Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, Christie brokered a bipartisan bill that effectively wiped out bail for all except those charged with violent crimes or at risk of committing another.\The reforms, enabled by a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2014, has its critics. Some law enforcement groups warn the system has placed burdens on police officers, and that the system will allow the occasional violent offender to slip out on the street.The bail bond industry views the law as a mortal threat and has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop it.\Yet, it has all-but eliminated an antiquated and unfair system that has placed generations of small time offenders on a lifelong downward spiral of crime and poverty.\The Christie-led reforms have inspired other cash-strapped states to study New Jersey's law, which is by far the most comprehensive. Twenty-seven other states are now considering similar laws, said Udi Ofer, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union-New Jersey and who is now heading the organization's national mass incarceration project.\""New Jersey is ground zero for bail reform,"" Ofer said.\Medical education\Christie's push in 2012 to radically realign New Jersey's medical education systems triggered a firestorm of protest. Rutgers faculty and staff raised concerns. Rutgers absorbed almost all of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey – including its medical schools in Newark and Piscataway.\In South Jersey, Rowan University in Glassboro was elevated to a research university and took over UMDNJ's osteopathic medical school in Stratford.\Critics worried that it was too much for Rutgers to absorb and would lead to layoffs. Others say the entire plan was an elaborate bid by Norcross to expand his political empire in South Jersey.\But officials argue that the merger has proven to be a boon for the university.\In fiscal year 2016, Rutgers drew $637.9 million in grants, a 24 percent increase over fiscal year 2014, the first year of the merger. Rutgers has since climbed in the academic rankings and applications from international students jumped by 56 percent, according to university figures.\N.J. Republicans\New Jersey lacks a robust, two-party system, in large part due to Christie's indifference.\Christie, known as the ""One Constituent"" party and staff needed to serve, gave Republican candidates only token help during the height of his power, spending little attention on party building or allowing other potential successors to shine. The state party became his piggy bank for his political travel and he saddled it with legal bills caused by the George Washington Bridge scandal.\Christie was widely praised for leading the Republican Governor's Association in 2014, which spent $130 million expanding the number of Republican governors from 29 to 31 while defending 22 incumbents.\But back home, he became an albatross for Repubicans.\Eight years after his arrival, Democrats expanded their seats in the Senate by one, to 25, and the seven-seat gain to 54 seats in the Assembly represents the largest Democratic majority in nearly 30 years. The 2011 redrawing of legislative districts created a map that allowed Democrats to consolidate power, but there was a sense that the Christie-led party mustered only a meager attempt to compete.\A sense that Christie put his own ambitions ahead of the needs and future of his own party has become almost an article of faith among New Jersey Republicans.\Criminal Justice\Christie, an ex-federal prosecutor, did not fit into easy ideological definitions when it came to criminal justice matters.\In 2012, Christie began declaring the ""War on Drugs"" launched in the late 1980s as a well-intentioned failure and arguing that more extensive investment in drug treatment programs would prove to be a more cost efficient and humane approach.\It was a surprisingly progressive tone for an avowed conservative to make, but Christie was joining a chorus of Republican leaders over the country saddled with the costs and consequences of mandatory prison sentences meted out decades earlier.\But Christie never entirely abandoned the hard line postures of the past. He remained a staunch foe of decriminalizing marijuana laws that contributed to prison overcrowding, and hotly opposed legalizing marijuana outright, calling any tax revenue reaped from legal pot sales ""blood money.""\Christie also vetoed a measure in December 2016 that restricted the use of solitary confinement in prisons as an ""ill-informed, politically motivated press release.""\But in 2012, he expanded the state's system of ""drug courts,"" where non-violent drug offenders are assigned to a treatment program instead of prison.\Christie's reforms made treatment mandatory. Christie backed reforms smoothed the re-entry into the mainstream for drug users, such as signing a ""ban the box"" law that prohibited employers from automatically rejecting job applicants with criminal histories. He has also backed a package of laws would also prohibit companies from rejecting job seekers who had their criminal histories expunged.\CAPTION: \Gov.

416,"From his earliest days in Trenton, Christie clearly relished the prospect of one day having his portrait added to the gallery of past governors lining the walls of his State House office.\""I'm getting the oil portrait in the State House,"" he told an audience of educators in Washington, D.C in November 2010, when he was just 11 months into his first term. ""So here's the thing — when I bring my grandchildren back to the State House and I show them that painting ... they're going to ask me, 'What did you do, Grandpa, what did you do?""\Seven years later, and just weeks before he leaves office, it is an even more relevant question being asked across the state.\There is no clear answer.\Christie's own reply can be summed up this way: I made the tough calls, upbraided a political class that needed drastic change. When the dust that he kicked up finally settles, his tenure will be viewed as a crucial pivot point in state history, Christie has said in recent months.\Not surprisingly, a wide spectrum of critics — from environmentalists and often demonized state workers to commuters and even fellow Republican leaders — point to lost opportunities and missteps. Christie, branded and marketed as the larger-than-life figure with the political skill to fix ""big things"", has little to show for all his bombast and pro-Jersey cheerleading, they argue.\Either way, analysts and those who've watched Christie closely, say his tenure rests somewhere in between the two extremes.\""If you look at Chris Christie and read what he did over the eight years and what he said he wanted to do, you would probably come out with a different conclusion,"" said Ingrid Reed, a former policy analyst at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. ""In terms of moving New Jersey forward, you might come out with more of a 50 (percent) good, 50 bad.""\In his first two years in office, Christie pulled off a string of improbable successes and laid the foundation for further reform.\He wielded power, and showed himself to be a fairly shrewd bipartisan negotiator, pushing through public employee benefits, teacher tenure and a top-to-bottom restructuring of the state's medical education programs. It was a goal that eluded three of his predecessors.\Collaborating with South Jersey Democratic Party power broker George Norcross and his allies in the Legislature, Christie helped turn Camden into a laboratory of education and policing reforms. He pushed through an overhaul of the state's Dickensian cash-bail system, a model other states are now following.\And while Christie's recent anti-opioid crusade strikes some as a cynical attempt at changing the tide of public perception, few other governors in the country have matched his focus and energy.\Failed slogans\Christie wrapped his initiatives in campaign style slogans that would later serve as reminders of dashed expectations.\The ""Jersey Comeback"" was undermined by a slow-to-improve job market and an embarrassing 11 downgrades of the state's credit under his watch. The ""Stronger Than the Storm"" slogan rings hollow to ""Super Storm Sandy"" victims who are still struggling to rebuild their homes and lives five years later. ""The Telling It Like It is"" slogan for his 2016 presidential campaign seemed like a cynical joke to a public who never believed his denials of knowledge or involvement in the George Washington Bridge lane closing scandal.\Unlike past governors, Christie won't be identified with a monumental and enduring public works project.\The raising of the Bayonne Bridge's span to 215 feet high was a Port Authority project championed by Christie. It will allow super tankers, with mini-skyscrapers of cargo containers to dock at the Port of Elizabeth and Newark. It is expect to make the port more competitive and bolster the region's economy.\But in the public's consciousness, Christie's name is indelibly linked to the jamming up of the toll booths at George Washington Bridge in a petty payback scheme carried out by top subordinates.\That may change, given time and all that Christie did accomplish.\""Typically, history is always kinder to elected officials,"" said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute of Politics at Rider University. ""Over time, people will forget why he (his approval rating) is at 15 percent and will remember other things.""\Christie's detractors and defenders are both correct, Dworkin said. The ""frustration"" with assessing Christie, he said, is that he had the opportunity ""to do so much more.""\""I think there will always be a disappointment that additional changes didn't come,"" he said.\Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican who served two terms and was Christie's political mentor, has said his skills were without peer, likening him to Bill Clinton.\Kean lamented that it was a ""shame"" that Christie didn't accomplish more.\""He's not going to go away. Somebody with that kind of ability is going to use it in some way or another .... he's going to be a force.""\Christie made major strides on key New Jersey issues. But he made missteps on others. Here's an assessment on those issues:\Environment\Democratic Gov. Brendan T. Byrne's sweeping executive orders in the 1970s led to the preservation of the New Jersey Pinelands, a vast wilderness sprawling at the center of the state and home to an aquifer estimated to hold 17 trillion gallons of some of the nation's purest water.\If anything, Christie will be remembered as the governor who viewed the Pinelands as an impediment to progress — and to his ability to reward allies.\Christie muscled through approval of a 22-mile natural gas pipeline despite fierce opposition from environmentalists, residents and even four governors who preceded him. The project was originally defeated in 2014 but Christie replaced several members of the Pinelands Commission, which had jurisdiction over the project, with members who supported it. Christie stood with business and labor groups who argued that the project would create jobs, bolster the energy supply , and carry gas to a power plant that was switching from coal to natural gas.\Infrastructure\Christie championed the raising of the Bayonne Bridge, which allows supertankers to dock in Port Newark. But Christie stunned the nation in October 2010 by pulling the plug on $8.7 billion plan to build the first new rail tunnel under the Hudson River in a century. At the time, the ""Access To The Region's Core"" was the largest public works project in the country.\Christie's decision helped burnish national bona fides as a fearless new fiscal conservative, but in New Jersey, the move was viewed as a politically self-serving and shortsighted maneuver that let Christie sidestep the bipartisan and business community to raise the state's gas tax, the prime source of funding for transportation projects.\Earlier this year, Christie defended his decision, arguing that it's flawed design — the proposed line terminated 20-stories beneath Manhattan and lacked subway connections – would not have brought the promised relief to commuters. He also complained that New York stood to benefit from the project without having to invest a dime.\But transportation advocates and commuters say killing the ARC tunnel will have disastrous consequences, some of which, will come into sharp relief when Amtrak begins closing the existing tunnels for repairs in 2020.\Property taxes\Observers from across the political spectrum credit Christie deals that made some headway with New Jersey's highest-in-the-nation property taxes, an issue that has bedeviled governors for decades.\Property tax rates jumped an average of 2.3 percent a year during Christie's first seven years in office, compared an average 6.5 percent preceded his administration, state records show.\Christie's property tax-effort was aided by other factors.

It is expect to make the port more competitive and bolster the region's economy.\But in the public's consciousness, Christie's name is indelibly linked to the jamming up of the toll booths at the George Washington Bridge in a petty payback scheme carried out by top subordinates.\That may change, given time and all that Christie did accomplish.\""Typically, history is always kinder to elected officials,"" said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute of Politics at Rider University. ""Over time, people will forget why he (his approval rating) is at 15 percent and will remember other things.""\Christie's detractors and defenders are both correct, Dworkin said.

Somebody with that kind of ability is going to use it in some way or another....he's going to be a force.""\Democratic Gov. Brendan T. Byrne's sweeping executive orders in the 1970s led to the preservation of the New Jersey Pinelands, a vast wilderness sprawling at the center of the state and home to an aquifer estimated to hold 17 trillion gallons of some of the nation's purest water.\If anything, Christie will be remembered as the governor who viewed the Pinelands as an impediment to progress – and to his ability to reward allies.\Christie muscled through approval of a 22-mile natural gas pipeline in South Jersey, despite fierce opposition from environmentalists, residents and even four governors who preceded him. The project was originally defeated in 2014 but Christie replaced several members of the Pinelands Commission, which had jurisdiction over the project, with members who supported it. Christie stood with business and labor groups who argued that the project would create jobs, bolster the energy supply and carry gas to a Cape May County power plant that was switching from coal to natural gas.\Christie championed the raising of the Bayonne Bridge, which allows supertankers to dock in Port Newark. But Christie stunned the nation in October 2010 by pulling the plug on $8.7 billion plan to build the first new rail tunnel under the Hudson River in a century. At the time, the ""Access To The Region's Core"" was the largest public works project in the country.\Christie's decision helped burnish national bona fides as a fearless new fiscal conservative, but in New Jersey, the move was viewed as a politically self-serving and shortsighted maneuver that let Christie sidestep the bipartisan and business community to raise the state's gas tax, the prime source of funding for transportation projects.\Earlier this year, Christie defended his decision, arguing that it's flawed design – the proposed line terminated 20 stories beneath Manhattan and lacked subway connections – would not have brought the promised relief to commuters. He also complained that New York stood to benefit from the project without having to invest a dime.\But transportation advocates and commuters say killing the ARC tunnel will have disastrous consequences, some of which will come into sharp relief when Amtrak begins closing the existing tunnels for repairs in 2020.\Observers from across the political spectrum credit Christie deals that made some headway with New Jersey's highest-in-the-nation property taxes, an issue that has bedeviled governors for decades.\Property tax rates jumped an average of 2.3 percent a year during Christie's first seven years in office, compared to an average 6.5 percent preceding his administration, state records show.\Christie's property tax-effort was aided by other factors. The 2011 landmark pension and health benefit reform he brokered with Democrats forced workers to pay a larger share of their pay toward pension and health care costs, a step that helped towns reduce their payroll costs, according to Marc Pfeiffer, assistant director at the Bloustein Local Government Research Center at Rutgers University.\Yet, there are important caveats. School districts received nominal, and in some cases, no increases in public school aid during the Christie years, putting pressure on school districts to raise taxes – school districts comprise the largest share of the property tax bill. Most homeowners also stopped getting the annual rebate from Trenton, which helped offset the annual rise in their local property tax rates.\So while Christie could reasonably claim that he restrained annual property tax increases, most people didn't seem to notice.\""They (property taxes) kept going up from a rate that was already unacceptable,"" said Patrick Murray, the Monmouth University pollster who tracked Christie's career.\Christie, an ex-federal prosecutor, did not fit into easy ideological definitions when it came to criminal justice matters.\In 2012, Christie began declaring the ""War on Drugs"" launched in the late 1980s as a well-intentioned failure and arguing that more extensive investment in drug treatment programs would prove to be a more cost efficient and humane approach.\It was a surprisingly progressive tone for an avowed conservative to make, but Christie was joining a chorus of Republican leaders over the country saddled with the costs and consequences of mandatory prison sentences meted out decades earlier.\But Christie never entirely abandoned the hard line postures of the past. He remained a staunch foe of decriminalizing marijuana laws that contributed to prison overcrowding, and hotly opposed legalizing marijuana outright, calling any tax revenue reaped from legal pot sales ""blood money.""\Christie also vetoed a measure in December 2016 that restricted the use of solitary confinement in prisons as an ""ill-informed, politically motivated press release.""\But in 2012, he expanded the state's system of ""drug courts,"" where non-violent drug offenders are assigned to a treatment program instead of prison.\Christie's reforms made treatment mandatory. Christie backed reforms smoothed the re-entry into the mainstream for drug users, such as signing a ""ban the box"" law that prohibited employers from automatically rejecting job applicants with criminal histories. He has also backed a package of laws would also prohibit companies from rejecting job seekers who had their criminal histories expunged.\Christie's eventual support of a historic overhaul of the bail system will endure as one of his most significant achievements. Seizing on the finding of a study commissioned by Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, Christie brokered a bipartisan bill that effectively wiped out bail for all except those charged with violent crimes or at risk of committing another.\The reforms, enabled by a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2014, has its critics. Some law enforcement groups warn the system has placed burdens on police officers, and that the system will allow the occasional violent offender to slip out on the street. The bail bond industry views the law as a mortal threat and has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop it.\Yet, it has all-but eliminated an antiquated and unfair system that has placed generations of small time offenders on a lifelong downward spiral of crime and poverty.\The Christie-led reforms have inspired other cash-strapped states to study New Jersey's law, which is by far the most comprehensive. Twenty-seven other states are now considering similar laws, said Udi Ofer, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union-New Jersey and who is now heading the organization's national mass incarceration project.\""New Jersey is ground zero for bail reform,"" Ofer said.\Christie's push in 2012 to radically realign New Jersey's medical education systems triggered a firestorm of protest. Rutgers faculty and staff raised concerns. Rutgers absorbed almost all of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey – including its medical schools in Newark and Piscataway.\In South Jersey, Rowan University in Glassboro was elevated to a research university and took over UMDNJ's osteopathic medical school in Stratford.\Critics worried that it was too much for Rutgers to absorb and would lead to layoffs. Others say the entire plan was an elaborate bid by Norcross to expand his political empire in South Jersey.\But officials argue that the merger has proven to be a boon for the university.\In fiscal year 2016, Rutgers drew $637.9 million in grants, a 24 percent increase over fiscal year 2014, the first year of the merger. Rutgers has since climbed in the academic rankings and applications from international students jumped by 56 percent, according to university figures.\New Jersey lacks a robust, two-party system, in large part due to Christie's indifference.\Christie, known as the ""One Constituent"" party and staff needed to serve, gave Republican candidates only token help during the height of his power, spending little attention on party building or allowing other potential successors to shine. The state party became his piggy bank for his political travel and he saddled it with legal bills caused by the George Washington Bridge scandal.\Christie was widely praised for leading the Republican Governors Association in 2014. But back home, he became an albatross for Republicans.\Eight years after his arrival, Democrats expanded their seats in the Senate by one, to 25, and the seven-seat gain to 54 seats in the Assembly represents the largest Democratic majority in nearly 30 years. The 2011 redrawing of legislative districts created a map that allowed Democrats to consolidate power, but there was a sense that the Christie-led party mustered only a meager attempt to compete.\A sense that Christie put his own ambitions ahead of the needs and future of his own party has become almost an article of faith among New Jersey Republicans.\""The party is not in great shape.

420,"As 2015 comes to a close, MyCentralJersey.com, the Courier News and the Home News Tribune take a look back at the most popular and most read stories of the year.\To quote MyCentralJersey.com Audience Analyst Dave Siminoff: ""Mayhem and controversy sell. Always have, probably always will. But our readers also seem to really like TV entertainment."" In the new metrics-driven world of journalism, this is what the readers of MyCentralJersey.com told us loud and clear.\But we covered all of your news, and made a special effort to provide the storytelling and useful information you require -- and we pledge to provide -- in our commitment to a caring community.\Just missing the Top 10 were the preview and follow-up preview for subsequent showings of the Round Valley documentary film, by Mike Deak, and sad story of a wayward dolphin in the South River, covered by Susan Loyer and Jenna Intersimone.\Here are the Top 10 stories for 2015. This year, we combined desktop and mobile numbers so we have a total page-view look at all stories. Our big stories also were significantly more read on mobile devices than desktop devices, which underscores our more-news-now readership.\10. N.J. Property taxes\Covered by MyCentralJersey.com staff and Gannett New Jersey Statehouse Bureau.\Property taxes in New Jersey are highest per capita in United States, while state taxes rank 12th, according to Tax Foundation analysis.\New Jerseyans' average overall tax bill is the second highest in the United States, measured as a percentage of income, according to a nationwide survey and analysis. The primary culprit: the property tax.\Income taxes, primarily at the levels paid by the rich, and business taxes rank in the top 10 nationally, according to Tax Foundation numbers. Taxes related to consumption, such as the sales tax, rank in the middle. New Jersey's gas tax -- at least for now -- is one of the nation's lowest.\But it's the property tax that pushes New Jersey's state and local tax burden to the second-highest percentage in the nation, equal to 12.3 percent of per capita income in 2011. The local tax is also the prime reason New Jersey is rated the worst state in the union for a favorable business environment, the Tax Foundation showed.\State taxes in New Jersey rank 12th highest per capita, but the property tax is so high -- and rising $540 million a year, as our Tax Crisis series recently reported -- that it increasingly drives homeowners to flee New Jersey and ensures the state's ranking as having the nation's worst business climate.\More than 13,000 people signed a Gannett New Jersey petition, delivered to Trenton, demanding that top elected officials commit to a plan for cutting the property tax 10 percent by year's end. Fifty-seven lawmakers signed an accompanying tax-cut pledge -- 43 Republicans and 14 Democrats.\9. MyCentralJersey.\com Snapple Bowl\Covered by Greg Tufaro.\Extensive coverage Snapple Bowl XXII, the annual gridiron battle of all-star football players in Middlesex and Union counties, generated great attention. From the caring community background stories of the charities the game supports, to the forum it provides for many people to reach New Jerseyans and beyond, to the football game itself, which many regard as a welcome summer treat, the event was incredibly well-received.\As founder and director of the MyCentralJersey.com Snapple Bowl, Marcus Borden promotes ""the charity all-star football game with enthusiasm and creativity. But when it comes time to presenting money raised to the event's beneficiaries, Borden does so with absolutely no fanfare, simply mailing checks to Children's Specialized Hospital in Mountainside and the Lakeview School in Edison.""\But because of the huge success of this year's event, just one week after the game was contested at Kean University's Alumni Stadium, Borden let the recipients know that the event raised a single-game record $50,000.\The work done by Borden's cause not only aids worthwhile charities but offers entertainment, opportunity and sometimes a forum that spurs great pride.\Citing declining enrollment and mounting deficits, the Diocese of Metuchen announced in late May that Cardinal McCarrick would close at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.\Sabrina Leff a former Cardinal McCarrick cheerleader, realized that she was going to be the last individual to represent the 130-year-old high school at a public event.\Her thoughts going into the game: ""I think it's important to wear that (Cardinal McCarrick cheerleading) uniform,"" said Leff, who lives in South Amboy.\""Even though I'm going to another school, my heart is always going to be at Cardinal McCarrick. No one is ever going to see a McCarrick uniform again after (the Snapple Bowl), so this is like the closing of Cardinal McCarrick pretty much for sports.""\As for the game, the smallest player on the field, Spotswood High School's Chase Fee, made the biggest impact, as the 5-foot-8 running back scored on two of his first three carries, staking Middlesex County to an early lead that it would not relinquish en route to an impressive 33-13 victory before an estimated crowd of more than 3,000.\8. Amy Vachal's run on 'The Voice'\Covered by Cheryl Makin.\With her sweet and soulful sound, Franklin Township (Somerset) resident Amy Vachal performed exceptionally well on ""The Voice.""\Vachal was praised in her blind audition and Battle Round performances by judges Adam Levine, Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton and Pharrell Williams.\Unfortunately, the 27-year-old did not make it to the Live Finals.\Though her rendition of Bob Dylan's ""To Make You Feel My Love"" charted on iTunes at No. 5, Vachal's journey ended after a night of exceptional excellence on ""The Voice"" semifinal performances. Each of the Top 9 contestants proved they deserved to be on ""The Voice"" stage, making it all the more difficult for coaches and viewers to see five of them go the next day. Only four could make it through to live finals.\""I am so honored to have been on this show. Right now, there is still a lot settling in, and I am still trying to distill all of the chaos of this whole experience. And I say chaos in the best way because this experience has been so amazing. It has been such a blessing to grow in so many ways,"" Vachal said.\7. Double homicide in Raritan Borough\Covered by Sergio Bichao and Mike Deak.\Ramon Cadiz, 51, is charged in the grisly murder of his girlfriend and her daughter. He already is a convicted killer who was allowed early release from state prison and went on to commit more crimes.\He was arrested and charged just hours after police had found the badly disfigured and decomposing bodies of the victims in their First Avenue home In Raritan Borough. Cadiz was found sleeping in a parked car in North Brunswick. The car was registered to his girlfriend.\The Somerset County Prosecutor's Office said that a forensics expert had positively identified the two victims as Sandra Giuseppe, 51, and her daughter Kimberly Streath, 15.\The cause of Giuseppe's death was blunt-force trauma to the head with a mallet type of hammer and strangulation with a rope, Streath was killed by blunt-force trauma to the head with a hammer. The mother and daughter, slaughtered with a mallet type of hammer, were left to rot with T-shirts covering their heads. The bodies were found after the teen girl had missed school and police were dispatched to the home to check on the family.\Cadiz has an extensive criminal record, including a 1992 conviction for aggravated manslaughter.\He was charged with murder in 1991, when he was 27 and went by ""Raymond."" He was accused of fatally stabbing a man at a bar in Vineland after the two got into a fight.\He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in July 1992 as part of a plea deal but was released just eight years later, then amassed more criminal convictions.\6. Cop charged after fatal crash\Covered by Suzanne Russell.\When Linden Police Officer Pedro Abad Jr. apparently drove the wrong way on the Staten Island Expressway and struck a tractor-trailer in an accident that killed two people, including another officer, he did not have a valid driver's license.\The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office was assigned to investigate the driving and employment history of a city police officer.\After a preliminary review, the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General and the Union County Prosecutor's Office determined that an investigation of Abad's driving and employment history would be conducted by another county prosecutor's office (Middlesex) to avoid any possible conflict of interest.\Abad's driver's license previously had been suspended for 210 days on Oct. 16, 2013, following a Feb. 26, 2013, accident in Rahway in which he received violations for driving under the influence and refusing to submit to a chemical test. The suspension ended on May 14, 2014, when his driving privileges were restored, but the Rahway Municipal Court judge also required Abad to drive with an ignition interlocking device on his vehicle, used to measure a driver's breath alcohol content before the vehicle will start. That period ended on Sept. 11, 2014.\A 2013 Rahway police report describes Abad just before he was arrested for driving under the influence after striking a parked vehicle on Monroe Street as leaning against the Rahway police car for balance. His eyes were bloodshot and watery and his eyelids droopy. He slurred his speech and he smelled of alcohol.\The Rahway arrest was one of two for Abad since becoming a police officer in 2008. Abad was suspended from the Linden Police Department where he worked for six years.\The suspension became effective just hours after a 27-count New York Supreme Court indictment was unsealed charging Abad in connection with the March 20 alcohol-fueled crash in Staten Island that killed fellow Officer Frank Viggiano and civilian Joseph Rodriguez and injured Officer Patrik Kudlac.\Abad also was seriously injured in the crash. Following the accident, he spent three months in a hospital before going to a rehabilitation facility, according to Mario Gallucci, Abad's Staten Island-based attorney.\5. Football player struck in head with own helmet\Covered by Harry Frezza and Greg Tufaro.\After appearing to wrestle the helmet off an opponent, a Linden High School defensive lineman Fritz Moncion proceeded to strike the same player in the head with the helmet during a routine second-quarter running play in a game against Immaculata High School at Linden's Tiger Stadium. The Linden Police Department's Juvenile Bureau investigated the incident.\Linden Schools Superintendent Danny A. Robertozzi issued a statement regarding the matter: ""The Linden Public School District is aware of the incident. An investigation by administration is taking place and disciplinary consequences will be issued accordingly. Due to student confidentiality, no further comments will be released. The Linden Public School District is taking this very seriously and by no means is this incident a reflection of our school community or athletic teams.""\Immaculata Athletic Director Tom Gambino received an apology from Linden school officials and that the principals of both Linden and Immaculata high schools communicated about the incident.\Linden school officials took action, kicking Moncion off the team and suspending him from school for 10 days. But the viral nature of a video of the incident guaranteed this story would escalate, and so it did, including accusations of unfair treatment of Moncion.\4. Viral anti-gay Facebook post by teacher\Covered by Sergio Bichao and Mike Deak.\Longtime Catholic school teacher Patricia Jannuzzi was suspended by Immaculata High School two weeks ago after her personal Facebook post on the gay 'agenda' went viral.\Jannuzzi was asked to disable her Facebook page and was placed on administrative leave after MyCentralJersey.com, and then other media outlets, reported on the outrage that her anti-gay comments had stirred among alumni, who felt it was inappropriate for a teacher of young students to demonstrate intolerance.\Immaculata graduate Scott Lyons helped draw attention to Jannuzzi's statements by writing her an open letter, which his aunt, actress Susan Sarandon, shared with thousands of fans on Facebook.\After school officials and Diocese of Metuchen Bishop Paul Bootkoski distanced themselves from Jannuzzi's remarks, the Diocese received backlash from conservatives and traditionalists upset that the school and church did not side with their teacher against a liberal Hollywood activist.\Jannuzzi's family, fearing she would lose her job, raised more than $31,000 online. After Bootkoski issued a statement that Jannuzzi continued to receive salary and benefits and that no long-term decision over her job had been made, the Catholic leader was slammed on two radio ads broadcast on New York radio state WOR-AM and accused of trying to cover up Jannuzzi's firing.\The Jannuzzi family fundraising plea was posted on YouCaring.com. Several conservative media pundits shared the webpage with their followers. Maggie Gallagher, the former president of the National Organization for Marriage and a former syndicated newspaper columnist who for years railed against same-sex marriage, called attention to the fundraiser and defended Jannuzzi in an essay for the National Review.\Jannuzzi, the teacher once known by few outside Immaculata and the Immaculate Conception parish, returned to her job after being suspended. In a letter shared with faculty and staff, Monsignor Seamus Brennan highlighted her many years of good service as an instructor of young people.\3. Colonia mom of 3 allegedly killed by live-in ex-husband\Covered by Suzanne Russell.\Giorgina Cimino Nigro, 32, was found dead in her home on Devon Road in the Colonia section of Woodbridge, the victim of a homicide linked to a suicide attempt.\Her live-in ex-husband, Vito Nigro, 42, attempted suicide by jumping onto the Garden State Parkway in the Iselin section of the township later that day.\Cimino Nigro, a mother of three young children, died from blunt-force and sharp-force trauma, according to the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office.\Cimino Nigro was remembered as by family and friends who displayed their love for her in a funeral room filled with hundreds of photos, a video, flowers, angel wings and a large blanket with a photo Cimino Nigro.\Vito Nigro has been charged with murder and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Officials have not said what type of weapon was used.\A Middlesex County judge denied a request for emergent relief to transfer physical custody of the children -- ages 10, 6 and 4 -- to Giorgina Cimino Nigro's family.\Later, Cimino Nigro's mother, Angela Cimino, was granted a care arrangement for weekends and other days, and said her three young grandchildren cry every weekend when they leave her care. ""It breaks my heart,"" said Cimino. ""They are brokenhearted. I'm really very concerned about their emotional state.""\Physical custody of the children is with Vito Nigro's mother, Pasqualina Nigro.\A Middlesex County Family Court judge has postponed making a decision about the future custody arrangement for the children following a court hearing because the state Division of Child Protection and Permanency has not finished its investigation, Cimino said.\Vito Nigro has yet to make his first court appearance in connection with the criminal murder charge. Nigro has not been indicted.\2. Double homicide/\suicide in Warren\Covered by Everett Merrill, Cheryl Makin and Suzanne Russell.\Heidi Lynn Errickson, 45, and her brother, Frederick William Errickson Jr., 55, of Middlesex Borough, who both grew up in Warren, were killed after Frederick Errickson had gone to his sister's home in Warren to check on her welfare. As he arrived, he was shot and killed by his sister's fiance, John Reno, 48, of Warren, in the driveway of her home.\As police arrived to check on Reno, they spotted an unresponsive, fatally injured Frederick Errickson in the driveway. As they exited their vehicles, Reno fired at them from a first-floor window, starting a six-hour standoff with police.\After police were unable to communicate with Reno, they entered the home and found Heidi Errickson fatally injured in the first-floor hallway.\Reno's body, with a self-inflicted fatal gunshot wound to the head, was later found lying in a drainage ditch in a wooded area behind Errickson's home. According to authorities, Reno had a history of mental illness, and had been arrested in the past.\Heidi Errickson, a 1988 graduate of Watchung Hills Regional High School, was a paraprofessional at Central School and loved music, NASCAR, the Philadelphia Flyers and fine German beers. She is survived by a son.\Frederick Errickson lived in Warren until moving to Middlesex Borough 15 years ago. He worked for County Auto Wreckers in Jersey City as a facility manager. He was a motorcycle enthusiast. He is survived a wife, two daughters and a grandson.\1. Jax's run on 'American Idol'\Covered by Cheryl Makin.\The exhaustive coverage of Jax's amazing run on American Idol featured dozens of stories by Cheryl Makin, who covered not only the events, the TV shows and the personal interviews but the incredible phenomenon.\From the time she blew up on ""American Idol,"" it seemed like Jax never left the news. She finished third on the 14th season of ""American Idol,"" the American singing competition series.\Jax auditioned for ""American Idol"" performing ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" by The Beatles.\She also sang ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears for her first solo audition during Hollywood Week and sang The Beatles' ""Let It be"" for her final solo performance.\She later performed Janis Joplin's ""Piece of My Heart"" with Steven Tyler during the show's season finale. Her first single, ""Forcefield,"" was released following the finale. In July, Jax and the other Top 5 American Idol contestants began the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2015.\Jax and the Top 5 hit the Garden State on July 22 with a show at the MPAC in Morristown.\""American Idol Live!"" took Atlantic City by storm on Aug. 1 and rocked Red Bank on Aug. 2.\The Top 5 love appeared strong as ever, with all the Idols seemingly happy to be back on stage together again. The Top 5 is Jax, ""American Idol"" winner Nick Fradiani, Clark Beckham, Tyanna Jones and Rayvon Owen.\Jax played piano and sang three songs that she performed on ""American Idol"" for the her oldest fans at the Jewish Home at Rockleigh, as she met the Senior Jax Pack. The Senior Jax Pack and nursing home staff had some special performances for the singer.\Some might think that a ""dream come true"" for Jax was spending most of last year singing her heart out on Season XIV of ""American Idol."" It was, but for the 19-year-old zombie-loving, all-things-scary aficionado, it was at Jackson Township's Six Flags Great Adventure's Fright Fest where she realized her ""dream come true.""\She sneaked into the park mid-afternoon through the employee entrance. Then, through the makeup magic of Tony Mandile and wardrobe wonders of costumer Sarah Dawson, the petite blonde from East Brunswick was turned into a freaky clown with a prosthetics that covered her nose, forehead and cheeks, a ghostly white face and a creepy grin.\""Halloween is my absolute favorite time of year,"" said Jax, who is a big fan of the AMC's hit show ""The Walking Dead."" ""I'm so pumped to scare people.""\Jax loves the community. And she cares.\It was to Mancini Pizza in East Brunswick that Jax headed, straight from the airport the day after the ""American Idol"" finale. Missing her favorite pizza, Jax and her family had dinner together that night. Less than a week later, on May 19, an early-morning fire shuttered Mancini Pizza.\The news spread fast on social media with hope that the popular family owned and operated Italian-American restaurant would reopen.\Last month, the community got its wish. Jax reacted with excitement to the news that one of her favorite places was back.\""So pumped,"" she said with a wink. ""I heard they hired some crazy, blonde chick to serve some pizza for the occasion!""\And hire her they did. Jax worked the 5 p.m. shift, handing out the Brooklyn-style pies and entrees, taking orders and ringing the register with flair. She hoped to go on a few deliveries later in the night.\Chosen by you\These stories were chosen by you.

421,"As 2015 comes to a close, MyCentralJersey.com, the Courier News and the Home News Tribune take a look back at the most popular and most read stories of the year.\To quote MyCentralJersey.com Audience Analyst Dave Siminoff: ""Mayhem and controversy sell. Always have, probably always will. But our readers also seem to really like TV entertainment."" In the new metrics-driven world of journalism, this is what the readers of MyCentralJersey.com told us loud and clear.\But we covered all of your news, and made a special effort to provide the storytelling and useful information you require -- and we pledge to provide -- in our commitment to a caring community.\Just missing the Top 10 were the preview and follow-up preview for subsequent showings of the Round Valley documentary film, by Mike Deak, and sad story of a wayward dolphin in the South River, covered by Susan Loyer and Jenna Intersimone.\Here are the Top 10 stories for 2015. This year, we combined desktop and mobile numbers so we have a total page-view look at all stories. Our big stories also were significantly more read on mobile devices than desktop devices, which underscores our more-news-now readership.\10. N.J. Property taxes\Covered by MyCentralJersey.com staff and Gannett New Jersey Statehouse Bureau.\Property taxes in New Jersey are highest per capita in United States, while state taxes rank 12th, according to Tax Foundation analysis.\New Jerseyans' average overall tax bill is the second highest in the United States, measured as a percentage of income, according to a nationwide survey and analysis. The primary culprit: the property tax.\Income taxes, primarily at the levels paid by the rich, and business taxes rank in the top 10 nationally, according to Tax Foundation numbers. Taxes related to consumption, such as the sales tax, rank in the middle. New Jersey's gas tax -- at least for now -- is one of the nation's lowest.\But it's the property tax that pushes New Jersey's state and local tax burden to the second-highest percentage in the nation, equal to 12.3 percent of per capita income in 2011. The local tax is also the prime reason New Jersey is rated the worst state in the union for a favorable business environment, the Tax Foundation showed.\State taxes in New Jersey rank 12th highest per capita, but the property tax is so high -- and rising $540 million a year, as our Tax Crisis series recently reported -- that it increasingly drives homeowners to flee New Jersey and ensures the state's ranking as having the nation's worst business climate.\More than 13,000 people signed a Gannett New Jersey petition, delivered to Trenton, demanding that top elected officials commit to a plan for cutting the property tax 10 percent by year's end. Fifty-seven lawmakers signed an accompanying tax-cut pledge -- 43 Republicans and 14 Democrats.\9. MyCentralJersey.com Snapple Bowl\Covered by Greg Tufaro.\Extensive coverage Snapple Bowl XXII, the annual gridiron battle of all-star football players in Middlesex and Union counties, generated great attention. From the caring community background stories of the charities the game supports, to the forum it provides for many people to reach New Jerseyans and beyond, to the football game itself, which many regard as a welcome summer treat, the event was incredibly well-received.\As founder and director of the MyCentralJersey.com Snapple Bowl, Marcus Borden promotes ""the charity all-star football game with enthusiasm and creativity. But when it comes time to presenting money raised to the event's beneficiaries, Borden does so with absolutely no fanfare, simply mailing checks to Children's Specialized Hospital in Mountainside and the Lakeview School in Edison.""\But because of the huge success of this year's event, just one week after the game was contested at Kean University's Alumni Stadium, Borden let the recipients know that the event raised a single-game record $50,000.\The work done by Borden's cause not only aids worthwhile charities but offers entertainment, opportunity and sometimes a forum that spurs great pride.\Citing declining enrollment and mounting deficits, the Diocese of Metuchen announced in late May that Cardinal McCarrick would close at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.\Sabrina Leff a former Cardinal McCarrick cheerleader, realized that she was going to be the last individual to represent the 130-year-old high school at a public event.\Her thoughts going into the game: ""I think it's important to wear that (Cardinal McCarrick cheerleading) uniform,"" said Leff, who lives in South Amboy.\""Even though I'm going to another school, my heart is always going to be at Cardinal McCarrick. No one is ever going to see a McCarrick uniform again after (the Snapple Bowl), so this is like the closing of Cardinal McCarrick pretty much for sports.""\As for the game, the smallest player on the field, Spotswood High School's Chase Fee, made the biggest impact, as the 5-foot-8 running back scored on two of his first three carries, staking Middlesex County to an early lead that it would not relinquish en route to an impressive 33-13 victory before an estimated crowd of more than 3,000.\8. Amy Vachal's run on 'The Voice'\Covered by Cheryl Makin.\With her sweet and soulful sound, Franklin Township (Somerset) resident Amy Vachal performed exceptionally well on ""The Voice.""\Vachal was praised in her blind audition and Battle Round performances by judges Adam Levine, Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton and Pharrell Williams.\Unfortunately, the 27-year-old did not make it to the Live Finals.\Though her rendition of Bob Dylan's ""To Make You Feel My Love"" charted on iTunes at No. 5, Vachal's journey ended after a night of exceptional excellence on ""The Voice"" semifinal performances. Each of the Top 9 contestants proved they deserved to be on ""The Voice"" stage, making it all the more difficult for coaches and viewers to see five of them go the next day. Only four could make it through to live finals.\""I am so honored to have been on this show. Right now, there is still a lot settling in, and I am still trying to distill all of the chaos of this whole experience. And I say chaos in the best way because this experience has been so amazing. It has been such a blessing to grow in so many ways,"" Vachal said.\7. Double homicide in Raritan Borough\Covered by Sergio Bichao and Mike Deak.\Ramon Cadiz, 51, is charged in the grisly murder of his girlfriend and her daughter. He already is a convicted killer who was allowed early release from state prison and went on to commit more crimes.\He was arrested and charged just hours after police had found the badly disfigured and decomposing bodies of the victims in their First Avenue home In Raritan Borough. Cadiz was found sleeping in a parked car in North Brunswick. The car was registered to his girlfriend.\The Somerset County Prosecutor's Office said that a forensics expert had positively identified the two victims as Sandra Giuseppe, 51, and her daughter Kimberly Streath, 15.\The cause of Giuseppe's death was blunt-force trauma to the head with a mallet type of hammer and strangulation with a rope, Streath was killed by blunt-force trauma to the head with a hammer.

422,"GANNETT NEWS\When the wintry clouds cleared over Janice and David Isaacs' home in Georgetown, Ind., this month, their new solar panels soaked up the rays of the sun and converted the energy to electricity.\The power is reducing the utility bills at the couple's home - and better yet, they say, helping the environment by trimming the amount of coal burned to heat and cool their home.\""The other day I got home from work and saw the meter running backwards,"" David Isaacs said. ""That's just a neat feeling.""\The Isaacses have joined a tiny but growing movement among Indiana and Kentucky homeowners, farmers and schools to plug wind and solar panel systems into the power grid - conserving energy, while also saving money, because they're credited for the excess energy they send back to the utility.\The process is known as net metering, where homeowners who produce more electricity than they consume - often during daytime hours when they're away - can see their electric meter spin in reverse.\At night, when the family is home with lights and appliances running, electricity flows into the home, spinning the meter forward to record the consumption. Their meter registers the net amount of energy produced or consumed during the billing period.\Some 30 states, including Kentucky, have enacted net metering laws in recent years. Indiana legislators, however, have for the second year in a row failed to pass that state's first such statute.\Reducing dependence\Legislation allowing residential and commercial energy producers to get credit for what they generate is a step that environmentalists and renewable-energy advocates insist is crucial to spurring solar, wind and other green energy forms that can cut dependence on coal and other fossil fuels.\Without such a benefit, ""it's kind of like encouraging people to get a driver's license, and making cars cost $1 million,"" said Andy McDonald, director of the Kentucky Solar Partnership that promotes increased use of solar power. ""Net metering is a way for people to connect in a fair and efficient way"" to the grid.\Utility customers with net metering realize savings based on how much power they produce.\At Tim Darst's home in the Louisville Highlands, for example, he and his wife received credit for 1,335 kilowatt-hours supplied to LG&E last year from their solar panels. They paid the difference between the electricity their home used and what their system sent to the grid, saving about $91.\That annual savings will slowly allow them to repay their $20,000 investment, but the top priority wasn't money, Darst said. Because nearly 90 percent of Kentucky's electricity comes from burning coal, he and his wife believe finding another way to power their home makes sense.\Doing so would have been even more costly without net metering, which would force them to store the extra power in batteries, Darst said, noting that ""not net metering would be a real hurdle.""\The Kentucky Public Service Commission does not track how many customers of the utilities under its jurisdiction produce their own power and use net metering. But E.On, parent of LG&E, has 28 of them, according to Chip Keeling, the utility's spokesman.\In Indiana, Duke Energy, Indianapolis Power and Light Co. and Vectren have begun allowing more than 100 customers to use net metering, despite the lack of a statewide policy.\The legislation that was considered in Indianapolis would have expanded administrative rules to allow customers of investor-owned utilities to credit excess power that their customers generate from wind, hydroelectric generators, solar and other types of renewable energy systems, something that utilities like Duke already are doing.\""We think it's important to try and provide customers with a way"" to benefit from renewable energy, said Lew Middleton, a spokesman for Duke in Indiana, which had 74 net metering customers last year.\They included 47 homes, 14 schools and 13 businesses that generated a combined 279 kilowatts last year, most of it from solar power, according to a Duke report.\Fine-tuning the law\Advocates of renewable energy also are seeking flexibility for farmers and businesses to avoid caps on generating large amounts of power or having to pay excessive charges for multiple meters. They also want customers to be allowed to produce power from multiple sources - biogas and windmills, for instance.\Indiana supporters also wanted to remove any exemption for municipalities and rural membership cooperatives from participation in net metering practices. Solar and wind vendors and other industry advocates oppose such exemptions because they believe a uniform policy that applies to all utilities is best, said Laura Arnold, a lobbyist for Indiana Distributed Energy Advocates.\In Kentucky, the legislature passed a net metering law about six years ago and broadened it in 2008 in a bill widely supported by Gov. Steve Beshear, top legislators and industry groups.\The new law expanded the types of electrical power eligible for net metering and doubled limits on alternative power generation. It also extended the use of net-meter credits to the life of a customer's account.\Earned in '09; used now\That provision is bound to help lower the bills at Louisville dentist Don Feeney Jr.'s modest home in the Germantown neighborhood. His 10 solar panels supply the home with power to spare, so he racks up credits that can be applied to future bills.\Because of the number of cloudy days in January and February, Feeney said, LG&E dipped into the 300 credits - worth about $60 - that he had accumulated last year. That left him with 175 by late February. Although it may take 10 to 15 years for him to recoup the $18,000 investment in the panels, that wasn't the point, Feeney said.\""The reason I got them is the little I could do for the environment,"" he said.\Jay Shoaf, a farmer from Hope, Ind., who has a wind turbine, figures he saves about 10 percent each month on his electric bill - hardly denting the power needs of his home and a 1,100-head swine operation. But like Feeney, he said the payback on his $12,000 turbine is secondary.\His epiphany about alternative energy came a few years ago while he was watching a Discovery Channel program about a Saudi Arabian prince who had made so much money in oil profits that he bought an Airbus jetliner and customized it to carry his Learjet. It was during a stretch when $4-a-gallon gas prices boosted the diesel bill on Shoaf's farm from $10,000 to $25,000 a year.\""I thought, 'That's my money,'"" Shoaf recalled. ""It just kind of made me mad. I got on the Internet and started researching.""\Isaacs, a retired science and math teacher, also began researching alternative energy years ago. He said he was pleasantly surprised at how quickly Duke responded to an e-mail asking to hook up his system to the grid and install a meter that could record the energy generated at the home.\Even though it could take 20 to 25 years to recover the $40,000 that he and his wife spent, Isaacs figures they're positioned to weather future energy price increases. They're also doing their part for the environment.\""The main thing was lowering our carbon imprint and saving some money,"" he said."

""It's the environment, and we like to be environmentally friendly.""\Even after three decades of prominence as a nonpetroleum energy source, solar cannot pay for itself without various government subsidies because of the high up-front costs.\Capitol covered the cost of its $900,000 system with a $490,000 grant under the New Jersey Clean Energy Program plus various federal tax credits and accelerated depreciation of the hardware that generates further tax savings, said Richard King, vice president of Wayne-based Stellar Energy Solutions, which installed the system.\The clean energy program, overseen by the state Board of Public Utilities, distributes about $125 million a year collected from surcharges on power bills to a wide range of recipients, such as people who buy energy-efficient appliances.\Without government help, it would have taken years or even decades to recoup the investment despite the lower electric bills, Lebersfeld said.\The subsidies ""are the only way we could have done it,"" he said.\While the system was commissioned about two months ago, Capitol does not have enough experience with it to know if the 25 percent savings estimate is accurate.\It was only earlier this month that Capitol was tied into the Jersey Central Power & Light grid, a critical component of the system.\Now, Capital can take advantage of what is known as net metering, where power generated and stored by the solar panels can be fed to JCP&L, King said.

425,"In his guest column of Nov. 13, 2008, Marvin Smith made some excellent points about the world's energy situation. Who can dispute that every additional gallon of foreign oil burned could wind up supporting terrorism? There is no doubt the United States needs to move toward more renewable and carbon free energy sources.\I appreciate Mr. Smith's kind words about the Vineland Municipal Electric Utility (VMEU). I know our employees work very hard and take pride in the fact that the public is supplied with a reliable source of electricity.\It is my opinion, however, that Mr. Smith has little understanding of the deregulated energy market, does not understand VMEU's energy supply plan and underestimates the degree of knowledge and environmental aggressiveness of VMEU's planners.\The market -- Mr. Smith, in questioning the $8 million/year in annual savings, cites Atlantic City Electric's parent company's plan to build a 230 mile transmission line from Virginia to South Jersey, which, he seems to claim, will eliminate the savings. What he fails to mention is that the same company's deregulated energy supply unit, Conectiv Energy, is in the process of building a 100mw simple-cycle gas turbine at Cumberland Station in Millville, with another to follow. Why do you think they are doing that? The answer is their analysis shows the same benefits in terms of capacity savings and congestion relief as our own analysis. They know as well as we do that the planned transmission expansion will be used up by load growth and unit retirements before it goes into service, so that the transmission congestion levels will remain at elevated levels, and they want to cash in. VMEU's new, efficient gas turbine will insulate our customers from the effects of transmission congestion and prevent Conectiv from cashing in at our customers expense. Atlantic City Electric makes its money by getting a return on its investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure.\I agree with Mr. Smith when he states ""It stretches the imagination to think anyone could predict oil prices or electricity costs four years from now."" What he seems not to understand is that the absolute value of the fuel pricing is of less strategic importance than the price of fuels relative to one another. We believe the differentials will remain about the same, and that assumption generates the $8 million in annual savings.\I find Mr. Smith's statements about coal burning bizarre. He seems to think we can import cheap coal power from western PJM without paying any transmission charges. In fact, because of transmission limitations, generation produced by cheap coal units in western Pennsylvania on summer days will cost four to five times the production cost by the time it gets to Vineland.\The VMEU plan -- As I read through Mr. Smith's comments, it seems as though he believes VMEU intends to install an oil-fired unit. What the utility will actually install will be primarily a natural gas-fired unit. Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel with the added advantage that it is almost exclusively domestically produced. The new unit will actually reduce, not increase, the utility's dependence on foreign fuel sources.\The VMEU plan also calls for switching away from coal to natural gas or a renewable fuel for existing units as well. In addition VMEU is in the final stages of negotiations that will hopefully result in a sizable renewable installation within Vineland, which will be structured so that it will reduce our customer costs, not increase them.\The environment -- Currently VMEU is unique in that we are the only N.J. municipality to offer net metering for renewable installations. We also have a geothermal rebate program. A municipal electric utility is not subject to the state energy master plan; however, we have set goals for ourselves which are more aggressive than what the master plan requires. Unfortunately, one of the most effective subsidies available for renewable projects is the 30 percent federal investment tax credit, which VMEU on its own cannot derive benefit. In partnership with another entity, however, we can take advantage of the tax credit provided our potential partner is willing to share the benefit in the form of lower energy costs. VMEU also has initiated a program to install solar panels on its operations building to serve as a model for a comprehensive effort to go solar on municipal buildings where applicable.\In conclusion, VMEU's main focus is to lower the cost to our customers while moving to a cleaner energy supply portfolio. In the past, these two objectives have been mutually exclusive. But through a combination of prudent investment in peaking units that will allow unfettered access to the market and creative negotiating approaches so that energy from renewable sources can be delivered to our customers at reasonable prices, I am confident we can achieve our goal.\Joe Isabella\Director\VMEU"
426,"Courier-Post Staff\Across New Jersey, many educators are getting the same bright idea: Put solar panels on school rooftops to generate power and much-needed revenues.\On Tuesday, local voters will consider multimillion-dollar proposals to tap the sun's power for classrooms in Lumberton and Palmyra -- and at least six other districts statewide.\""School districts have been lining up to go solar,"" said Schools Superintendent Richard Perry in Palmyra, where solar panels are proposed for the Charles Street School as part of a $9.9 million project.\The reason is simple, educators say.\""We're anticipating utility bills will go down $288,000 a year,"" said Tom Fanuka, Lumberton's business administrator. The district wants to spend about $10.8 million to put solar panels on all four of its schools.\The Lumberton district expects annual revenues of at least $600,000 from its proposed solar system. When you factor in lower energy costs, said Fanuka, ""we'd be bringing in revenue.""\""Plus it's good for the environment,"" Perry added of solar power.\But some voters are not so convinced.\Residents last year rejected solar power plans for the Washington Township and Delsea Regional High School districts. Each plan, although expected to save money in the long term, would have caused initial tax hikes for the districts' property owners.\""It was very frustrating,"" said Jan Giel, a spokeswoman for the Washington Township district. The district had hoped to cut its electric bills by 30 percent, or about $240,000 a year, through a $6.2 million solar project.\The district's school board on Tuesday night is to consider the future of its solar power proposal.\""We may pursue it again,"" said Giel, noting the district has received a $1.6 million grant from the state's Clean Energy Program to help fund a voter-approved solar project.\But she added, ""I understand with the state of the economy, it's going to be an even harder sell.""\The solar panels in Lumberton would represent the bulk of a $15 million plan to upgrade township schools. If approved, the entire project would boost property taxes by about $125 a year for an average home assessed at $312,000.\Palmyra's solar work would be part of a $9.9 million upgrade for three schools. It would cause an annual tax increase of $186 for a home assessed at $186,000.\State aid would cover about 40 percent of each district's costs.\The solar units are especially attractive at a time when schools face rising costs and limited state aid, said Mike Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.\""They can save precious financial resources over the long run,"" he observed. ""A solar system can typically pay for itself in 10 years, and some will pay in half that time.""\Solar energy systems operate in at least two area districts -- Clementon and Voorhees, which this year added a second panel at Voorhees Middle School.\A five-year program of state rebates stopped taking applications in April when demand outstripped supply, the School Boards Association said. That program spurred 33 districts to pursue solar projects at 65 school buildings, it noted at the beginning of this school year. Another 42 districts were in line for potential rebates at that time, the association added.\Districts now can seek funding assistance through the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, a Board of Public Utilities initiative to promote alternative energy.\And districts can make money by selling ""solar renewable-energy credits"" -- open-market transactions that allow utilities to claim a school's solar power as part of its own output, said Fanuka in Lumberton. His district expects to raise at least $600,000 a year through the sale of credits.\A solar school also can sell excess power to its utility company, said the School Boards Association. That ""can lead to a process called ""net metering,"" where the electric meter actually spins backwards,"" it noted in a statement. ""This more commonly occurs in the summer, when schools are closed and the solar system is generating at peak capacity.""\In Palmyra, Perry said schools must successfully argue that higher taxes now will bring relief later.\""We're trying to reduce the tax burden or at least maintain it,"" he said. ""We're trying to be creative. We're very frugal in terms of how much we spend. Solar power is a good way to do that.""\Reach Jim Walsh at (856) 486-2646 or jwalsh@courierpostonline.com\VOTING HOURS\The Palmyra and Lumberton school districts will seek voter approval Tuesday for local financing for school improvement projects that include solar power components.\Voting hours are from 2 to 9 p.m. in Palmyra and from 3 to 9 p.m. in Lumberton."

Mulligan\EDISON\HD: Student Bible club is a positive activity\As the mother of three teenage children, none of whom belong to The Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the big question to me is why? Why is there so much controversy in Monroe over a club? A number of senior citizens in Monroe live in communities that have their very own clubhouse. I'm sure that in these clubhouses many organizations meet, no matter what their purpose or religion. They provide a forum for activities and entertainment for many or all who wish to come. Unfortunately, most teenagers don't share that same luxury. Their biggest social environment is school.\My question to the seniors and all those opposed to this club is: What are you hoping to accomplish in attempting to disband this club? Also, what price are you willing to pay to achieve this victory? And I'm not talking about financial prices here. These teenagers are the ones that may have retrieved something from a top shelf in the supermarket for you. They may have helped you with your groceries or with your car.\What lesson are you trying to teach these kids? That hundreds of adults that are supposed to be their role models can ban together just to stop a handful of teenagers from gathering in the pursuit of reinforcing morality in our youth through athletics?\The moral fiber of today's society is deteriorating every day. We should be applauding their effort rather than attempting to shut them down. There is absolutely nothing objectionable about this club.\Rose Ferrito\MONROE\LETTER OF THE WEEK\HD: Renewable energy has to be high priority\Are you concerned about the pollution of our air and water caused by the power plants burning fossil fuels and its effect on global warming? Our country's dependence on foreign oil? The United States has 5 percent of the world's population but uses 25 percent of its natural resources.\There have been many newspaper articles about renewable energy, and I decided to investigate some of them. One article reported on a house in Hamilton heated by the sun. The owner, Susan Deckert, was gracious enough to meet with me and the other members of the Natural Resources Committee of The League of Women Voters of Monroe Township. She has been a naturalist for most of her life, having worked in the Mercer County Park System, the state departments of Agriculture and Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection's Hazardous Waste Program, the Mercer County Solid Waste Commission, and on the Hamilton Township Environmental Commission. Recently she became a pioneer in installing solar/photovoltaic panels to provide electricity for her home. She described the procedure to us and answered our many questions.\Solar panels are one of the means of producing renewable electricity along with wind power, geothermal, small hydroelectric and ocean-wave power. These methods are usually too expensive to be in general use yet, but prices would decrease with improvement in production and increased usage. Renewable energy can reduce pollution from coal and oil, reduce global warming, save our natural resources, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The federal government subsidizes the oil and coal industries but gives very little aid to the development of renewable energy. However, some of the states help much more. New Jersey, with its dense population and pollution blowing in from factories in the Midwest, reduces taxes and gives rebates for renewable energy through its Clean Energy Program.\Deckert described how the panels were installed (tilted for optimal use of the sun's rays), connected to an inverter to change from DC to AC and wired into her electricity panel box. She told us the installation was very expensive and she would not have been able to afford her solar home if it were not for subsidies toward about 60 percent of the cost. She still isconnected to the grid, or central power supplier for the central Eastern states - i.e. for all of us, so she can draw power when there is not enough sunshine and when the sun is down. When she uses ""grid"" electricity the meter runs forward as usual, but often the solar panels overproduce for her needs and then the meter runs backward to reduce her bill. This is called ""net metering."" She expects to save more than $600 a year, more if the price of electricity goes up. Susan ran into a great deal of ""red tape"" from her municipality (which was not familiar with the subject) in trying to get building permits for her solar system, but she finally accomplished her goal. Hopefully she will have smoothed the way for others.\In addition, newspapers have reported on other methods of renewable energy. Wind farms produce much of the municipal power in the Midwest and are being considered in several places in New Jersey. Cape May expects to build one to run a sewerage plant, and other companies are studying the prospects for wind farms offshore and in the Highlands. In addition to wind and solar, there are ""hybrid"" cars that use both gasoline and electric engines and can get about 50 mpg. Honda and Ford have these in production now, and other automakers are investigating production in various cars and sport utility vehicles. Fuel cells, which get even better mileage and emit only water as exhaust, aren't yet practical for mass production in automobiles but are being used in certain government buildings and industries.\European countries are way ahead of the United States in production of renewable energy, but, unfortunately, our government encourages principally the use of oil and gas and favors these industries with financial incentives.\Barbara Curtis\MONROE\HD: Crackdown needed on concert-ticket sales\What is wrong in this country when hard-working individuals want to go to ticketed events only to find that the tickets apparently sell out in less then an hour? Many of us spent last Saturday morning either at a Ticketmaster outlet, Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City or at home manning the computer and phone trying to get through to Ticketmaster. Within 15 minutes of the sale, the show was completely sold out. For every one person who got through and was lucky enough to get tickets, 10 more people were shut out.\And then later on you discover that there are ticket brokers all across the United States who seem to have blocks of these tickets going for obscene prices.\Here is a good example: For a well-known musician's sold-out concert at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City this coming March, there are a number of online broker sites across the United States (one with an address in Mountain Lakes, N.J.) who have the same seats listed. For $1,840 you can have one ticket in section 121 ROW: BB. Currently, this broker has 120 matches for tickets available for a variety of prices, the cheapest being $310. These are tickets clearly stamped by Ticketmaster at the price of $75 plus the usual charges. A nice profit margin.\Last October, one site was selling tickets to that same musician's appearance through advertisements on ""Saturday Night Live.""\How are the brokers and scalpers getting these tickets? I see on some of the sites that they buy tickets from folks who don't want them. I also am hearing a lot about corporate types who manage to get these tickets and give them to hired scalpers to sell on the street or online. The scalper is given a nice piece of the action. In the world we live in now, with all of the corporate scandal, don't you think some of these corporations should be investigated? And all of this money is tax-free income. Meanwhile, you and I have to pay a little extra to the government so these ""classy"" individuals can live the high life.\I hear of gadgets on the market that are ""power dialers"" that enable you to beat the busy signals. There is also an ugly rumor floating around about how the casinos bought up many of these tickets. What is wrong with this picture?\And if you go to eBay, it's just as bad. The highest price is $2,000 for two tickets being sold by an individual claiming to be in ""New Jersey."" How is it legal and right for these folks to buy tickets for a show they had no intention of seeing and then sell them either to the brokers or on eBay? What gives them the right to shut out someone of average means who is a fan but cannot afford these prices? This is the case for every entertainment event we see in the world. I keep hearing supply and demand. How true it is. If you can manage to get all of the good seats, someone in a Mercedes will be willing to buy them. And sometimes sell them as well at a profit.\When will people wake up and realize that if we stop patronizing these folks for our tickets they might have to close up shop? There is too much apathy in this world. There needs to be a fairer way of selling tickets to the folks who want to see these events but cannot at these prices. Laws need to be in place to prosecute those who would take your hard-earned money. A ticket priced at $75 should be sold at $75. Not a penny more. People need to contact the politicians in their respective states and say enough is enough.\Dave Hummel\BOUND BROOK\HD: Woodbridge mayor not focused on sprawl\The former mayor of Woodbridge and now Gov. James E. McGreevey has expressed a desire to reduce development in the state, why can't current Mayor Frank Pelzman do the same for Woodbridge.\If the added tax income is worth building on every empty parcel of land and the resulting congestion, then why do our property taxes continue to increase every year?

""Our seniors will certainly be missed, but I am looking forward to the continued drive, leadership and passion of the underclassmen. The experience the team received last year will only help to propel us forward.""\Lasda said she is confident the coaching staff will be able to keep the team grounded despite all their success this past year, including winning the school's third NJSIAA Group 1 state championship as well as the NJIGILL division crown.\""Since the younger players have already gone through this process, they know how much hard work and dedication it took to get where we ended last season,"" said Lasda, who was named All-USA Girls Lacrosse Coach of the Year by America Family Insurance in June.

Kaufelt, a 1969 RPS graduate.\""This year's recipients demonstrate the commitment to animal protection that the award seeks to honor,"" said Bernard Unti, senior policy advisor and special assistant to the CEO of The HSUS. ""Both Kayla and Riya have volunteered for local sheltering organizations while also devoting energy to international animal welfare concerns. They exemplify the compassion and respect for animals that inspired the creation of the Florence Kaufelt Memorial Scholarship.""\Bancone and Patel were selected based on essays they submitted describing their involvement with and ongoing concern for animal protection and how that has been expressed in their daily life, family experience and volunteer activities.\In her essay, Bancone, a senior, describes her work with a friend to re-start the school's animal club - RPawS (RPS) - which sent members to volunteer at the Somerset Regional Animal Shelter and brought attention to elephant poaching and the global ivory trade. Patel started a non-profit organization to help shelter pets called Can6 Pets, holding can drives at birthday parties and other events.

The five-story, 170,000 square-foot building overlooks the Raritan River and is a major component of Rutgers-New Brunswick's College Avenue redevelopment initiative. A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony is being conducted on Friday, Sept. 25.\The Honors College will offer academic opportunities and challenges beyond traditional curriculum and classroom experiences. Students will have direct access to live-in faculty fellows, on-site Honors College advising and administrative offices, as well as high-tech seminar and study spaces and lounge areas.\Students are also moving into the four Bishop Quad residence halls following completion of extensive upgrades. Hegeman, Wessels, Leupp and Pell halls, located in the heart of the College Avenue Campus, date from the 1920s and have undergone a two-year, $13 million renovation. Approximately 300 undergraduate students reside in the Bishop Quad buildings. Rutgers also has opened the new New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition and Health. The $55 million, 78,000 square-foot building on the George H. Cook Campus houses state-of-the-art laboratories, community clinics, a children's nutrition center and preschool, as well as a dining facility offering healthy food options.\Other completed projects include:\15 Washington St. (Rutgers University-Newark): An icon on the Newark skyline, the former home of Rutgers School of Law-Newark has been converted to apartment-style units for 333 graduate and undergraduate students that are configured as studios and one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom units. There will be common areas for student and academic use, and spaces that support events and arts performances and exhibitions produced by Rutgers faculty, staff and students in collaboration with Newark performers, artists and creators of all ages. The building will also serve as a residence for the chancellor of Rutgers University-Newark. The project cost was $85 million. A formal dedication is scheduled Nov. 17.\School of Health Related Professions Clinical Lab Renovation (Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences): This $4 million renovation will improve the use of existing interior space by reconfiguring approximately 4,410 square feet to provide space and resources for the renovated SHRP Clinical Science and Interprofessional Health Laboratories and the adjacent research and clinical support area.\Several major projects are scheduled for completion during 2015-2016:\School of Dental Medicine Oral Health Pavilion (Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences): This $13.5 million project in Newark adds more than 24,000 square feet of clinical teaching space to the C Level of the building. The clinic seamlessly integrates into the existing building and features a corridor that links to the adjacent Bergen Building, and will be completed by the end of 2015.\The Chemical and Chemical Biology Building (Rutgers University-New Brunswick): With nearly 145,000 square feet, the facility will be connected to the Wright Reiman complex on the Busch Campus in Piscataway. The $115 million building will be energy efficient, sustainable and reconfigurable. It will provide needed laboratory, teaching and collaboration space that will enable Rutgers' faculty to expand and accelerate in groundbreaking research drug design, alternative energy, biomaterials, nanotechnology and molecular engineering. The project is scheduled for completion in fall 2016.\Global Village Learning Center at the Jameson Dormitory Complex (Rutgers University-New Brunswick): The new 19,000 square-foot center at Douglass Residential College on the Douglass Campus will be the home of the Global Village Learning Community.

The $11.5 million project is scheduled for completion in fall 2016 and is a partnership between alumnae donors and Rutgers University.\Express Newark, a university-community collaboratory (Rutgers University-Newark): Occupying about 10 percent of the 500,000 square-foot classic Hahne & Co. building, a former downtown department store, Express Newark will be an interdisciplinary learning space housing the collaborative practice of community residents and artists who will innovate and experiment with Rutgers University-Newark faculty, staff and students to engage in creative practice, foster democratic dialog and promote positive transformation.\Writers House (Rutgers University-Camden): 305 Cooper St. (Henry Genet Taylor House) is on the National Register of Historic Properties. The project includes a major renovation of the existing 6,685 square-foot building to restore the building to its former glory by fall. The facility, which will be occupied by the Department of English, will provide students, faculty and guest writers an environment in which to meet and discuss literature and scholarly projects. Total cost is $4.5 million.\Alumni House and Development Office (Rutgers University-Camden): 312 Cooper St. (the former Red Cross Building) will be the home of the Alumni and Development offices.

Michael Subach of Hillsborough, Robert Waldrop of South Plainfield.\The Hun School\What does innovative teaching look like? How can established institutions ensure they evolve in innovative ways? Grant Lichtman attempted to answer these questions while traversing the country and visiting educators. The results were the basis for his book, #EDJourney. During a visit to The Hun School of Princeton on August 27, Lichtman addressed the Hun School's faculty about his findings and invited them to join him in the conversation about educational innovation today.\During his keynote address, Lichtman said, ""We have to teach our kids, essentially, for their future, and not for our past. And, I think that is what you are thinking about here. You are thinking about the operating system of your school, not just the hardware and software.""\After Lichtman's keynote address, faculty spent time participating in breakout groups. They worked together to develop new ideas and discussed how best to support innovation on campus.\They collaboratively imagined systematic-level, big picture changes - aspirations for high-level innovations that aligned to the school's strategic plan. When they reconvened as a whole to share these goals, themes emerged that included interest around student voice, interdisciplinary programs, and testing boundaries of space and time.\""If we are going to be leading and significant as opposed to just great and successful, we do that by taking some degree of risks,"" Lichtman said. ""It's a healthy thing to have in your risk-reward portfolio. The question for some schools is, 'Can we do it?' The question for your school is, 'Well, we have to decide to do it.'""\Upper School head Ryan Hews said, ""In recent years, The Hun School has shifted curricular focus from traditional disciplines and content to a more skills-based curriculum, with an eye toward higher levels of student engagement. Mr. Lichtman's visit both affirmed this innovative work and inspired Hun's visionary faculty to imagine what's next. Schools need to be dynamic, adaptable, and reflective places and it was rewarding to have Mr. Lichtman partner with us toward these ends.""\Wardlaw-Hartridge\The Wardlaw-Hartridge School in Edison kicked off its 133rd year with the annual Convocation Ceremony in Laidlaw Gym on Sept. 10.\Lower and Middle School Students entered the gym with their teachers, smiling and eager to begin the new school year.

Webster spoke about the school's six core values - Integrity, Opportunity, Support, Diversity, Community and Sustainability. He emphasized Community and gave a special welcome to new students and international students.\Jeanne Barbet of Plainfield, an officer on the school's Board of Trustees, shared the Robert Frost poem The Road Not Taken and challenged students to explore different paths during her remarks. Soni asked his fellow students to try something new and step out of their comfort zone in his speech before Webster concluded the program by wishing everyone a successful school year.\Union County College\Union County College's Class of 2015 is the most successful graduating class in the College's 82-year history, according to a college news release. The total number of graduates this year hit 1,505. That's 200 more than the prior year's record.\Union County College President Margaret M. McMenamin announced the milestone achievement during the college's annual Convocation on Sept. 1. She said, ""That's another 1,505 college-educated people to enrich our community. That's not just good for our workforce, it's good for America. As Thomas Jefferson once said, 'An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people.'""\This year's graduation total is nearly three times higher than it was five years ago. In addition, the three-year graduation rate for full-time students surpassed 15 percent -- which is 5 percent higher than last year and the highest percentage in more than 20 years.\The president gave credit to faculty and staff for their commitment to student success. She offered even more accolades to the students themselves, saying ""their record of achievement is proof that a little tender-loving-care can go a long way. Given the right amount of support, our students have proven that they can and will succeed.""\As is tradition, the annual Convocation was held the day before the start of the Fall semester. Classes began at all three of the College's campuses (Cranford, Elizabeth, and Plainfield) today, welcoming more than 11,000 new and returning students.\Following President McMenamin's meeting with employees was a presentation by the University of Tennessee's Dr. Robbie Melton, who energized the audience with a series of demonstrations on educational technology. Melton showed the faculty a veritable smorgasbord of new tools for engaging students in what she called ""the active and interactive pursuit of learning.""\For more information on Union County College or to register for ""later start"" classes, visit www.ucc.edu.\ALSO: The American Honors program at Union County College provides high achieving, motivated students the opportunity to earn an associate degree and transfer to a four-year university as a junior. The in-county tuition cost for the American Honors program at Union County College is $7,220, while the average cost nationally for a four-year college education is approximately $23,000 before the cost of housing, travel and other fees.\But it isn't all about the money saved.

Those who need remediation will have it done during their senior year to ensure they are college ready. This program is designed to help reduce the time students have to stay in school and reduce the loans they have to pay when they get out.\Union County College has launched the program with four County high schools: Plainfield High School, Abraham Clark High School of Roselle, David Brearley High of Kenilworth, and the Hillcrest Academy. Another six County high schools are also seeking to participate in the program at the start of the fall semester.\Westfield Public Schools\A total of 36 new Westfield Public School teachers and support staff attended the in-house New Staff Institute (NSI) prior to the start of school, receiving orientation and training to become familiar with expectations of the district and community. The majority are new to the district, while a few stepped in as mid-year leave replacements during the last school year. To offer further support to both these first year educators and to those veteran teachers who are new to Westfield, NSI meetings also will take place in the next two years.\At a NSI luncheon held on Sept. 1, Westfield Board of Education Vice President, Gretchan Ohlig, welcomed the new teachers to the district. Westfield Education Association President, Michael Seiler, told the newcomers that they are entering a district with a well-deserved reputation for excellence.

The five-story, 170,000 square-foot building overlooks the Raritan River and is a major component of Rutgers-New Brunswick's College Avenue redevelopment initiative. A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony is being conducted on Friday, Sept. 25.\The Honors College will offer academic opportunities and challenges beyond traditional curriculum and classroom experiences. Students will have direct access to live-in faculty fellows, on-site Honors College advising and administrative offices, as well as high-tech seminar and study spaces and lounge areas.\Students are also moving into the four Bishop Quad residence halls following completion of extensive upgrades. Hegeman, Wessels, Leupp and Pell halls, located in the heart of the College Avenue Campus, date from the 1920s and have undergone a two-year, $13 million renovation. Approximately 300 undergraduate students reside in the Bishop Quad buildings. Rutgers also has opened the new New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition and Health. The $55 million, 78,000 square-foot building on the George H. Cook Campus houses state-of-the-art laboratories, community clinics, a children's nutrition center and preschool, as well as a dining facility offering healthy food options.\Other completed projects include:\15 Washington St. (Rutgers University-Newark): An icon on the Newark skyline, the former home of Rutgers School of Law-Newark has been converted to apartment-style units for 333 graduate and undergraduate students that are configured as studios and one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom units. There will be common areas for student and academic use, and spaces that support events and arts performances and exhibitions produced by Rutgers faculty, staff and students in collaboration with Newark performers, artists and creators of all ages. The building will also serve as a residence for the chancellor of Rutgers University-Newark. The project cost was $85 million. A formal dedication is scheduled Nov. 17.\School of Health Related Professions Clinical Lab Renovation (Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences): This $4 million renovation will improve the use of existing interior space by reconfiguring approximately 4,410 square feet to provide space and resources for the renovated SHRP Clinical Science and Interprofessional Health Laboratories and the adjacent research and clinical support area.\Several major projects are scheduled for completion during 2015-2016:\School of Dental Medicine Oral Health Pavilion (Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences): This $13.5 million project in Newark adds more than 24,000 square feet of clinical teaching space to the C Level of the building.

Every year, the St. Joseph High School community has come together to honor and pay tribute to the thousands of people who lost their lives, especially St. Joseph High School alumni: William Fallon, class of 1966, James Lynch, class of 1972 and R. Andrew Spencer, class of 1984.\Justin Fleetwood, the newly appointed Principal of St. Joseph High School, began the ceremony with remarks about how difficult it is to capture what this anniversary means to us as Americans, as Catholic Christians. Fleetwood asked the assemblage, ""As we come before the presence of God and one another with our prayers and petitions, our questions, our grief and our anger, we hear these words from the ancient prophet: 'Forgive your neighbors in justice; then when you pray, your own sins will be forgiven. Think of the Commandments, hate not your neighbor; remember the Most High's covenant, and overlook faults'.""\Lucas Pick, a member of the senior class, recalled, at the age of three, that he was sitting at home watching television while the screen went blank and his Mom tried to fix the set to no avail. Once the cable was restored, they changed the channel from PBS to NBC. Lucas said that he would ""never forget the horrifying image that flashed across the screen that cloudless blue morning. While unable to comprehend the meaning of these attacks, I knew a tragedy had just transpired before my very eyes."" Like thousands of families that day, his parents sat anxiously by the phone waiting for news of friends and relatives who worked in downtown New York City.\Pick shared the story of his Unlce Ted, a trained EMT, who made his daily commute into the city that day and after the attack spent his entire day caring for the wounded and comforting the distressed. It was not for over 24 hours that his family did finally receive word that he was safe. He concluded his thoughts by saying, ""As we recall the events of 9/11, let us keep in mind our roles as Americans, students of a Catholic school, and members of the human race. This is why we gathered here today: to remember those who were lost, to pray for those who sinned, and to serve one another as Christ served us.""\The Citadel\Robert Waldrop of South Plainfield was named to the spring president's listat The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.\The Hun School\What does innovative teaching look like? How can established institutions ensure they evolve in innovative ways? Grant Lichtman attempted to answer these questions while traversing the country and visiting educators. The results were the basis for his book, #EDJourney. During a visit to The Hun School of Princeton on August 27, Lichtman addressed the Hun School's faculty about his findings and invited them to join him in the conversation about educational innovation today.\During his keynote address, Lichtman said, ""We have to teach our kids, essentially, for their future, and not for our past. And, I think that is what you are thinking about here. You are thinking about the operating system of your school, not just the hardware and software.""\After Lichtman's keynote address, faculty spent time participating in breakout groups. They worked together to develop new ideas and discussed how best to support innovation on campus.\They collaboratively imagined systematic-level, big picture changes - aspirations for high-level innovations that aligned to the school's strategic plan. When they reconvened as a whole to share these goals, themes emerged that included interest around student voice, interdisciplinary programs, and testing boundaries of space and time.\""If we are going to be leading and significant as opposed to just great and successful, we do that by taking some degree of risks,"" Lichtman said. ""It's a healthy thing to have in your risk-reward portfolio. The question for some schools is, 'Can we do it?' The question for your school is, 'Well, we have to decide to do it.'""\Upper School head Ryan Hews said, ""In recent years, The Hun School has shifted curricular focus from traditional disciplines and content to a more skills-based curriculum, with an eye toward higher levels of student engagement. Mr. Lichtman's visit both affirmed this innovative work and inspired Hun's visionary faculty to imagine what's next. Schools need to be dynamic, adaptable, and reflective places and it was rewarding to have Mr. Lichtman partner with us toward these ends.""\Thomas Edison State\Thomas Edison State College recently ranked as the third safest college campus in America!

Webster spoke about the school's six core values - Integrity, Opportunity, Support, Diversity, Community and Sustainability. He emphasized Community and gave a special welcome to new students and international students.\Jeanne Barbet of Plainfield, an officer on the school's Board of Trustees, shared the Robert Frost poem The Road Not Taken and challenged students to explore different paths during her remarks. Soni asked his fellow students to try something new and step out of their comfort zone in his speech before Webster concluded the program by wishing everyone a successful school year.\Union County College\Union County College's Class of 2015 is the most successful graduating class in the College's 82-year history, according to a college news release.

In addition, the three-year graduation rate for full-time students surpassed 15 percent -- which is 5 percent higher than last year and the highest percentage in more than 20 years.\The president gave credit to faculty and staff for their commitment to student success. She offered even more accolades to the students themselves, saying ""their record of achievement is proof that a little tender-loving-care can go a long way. Given the right amount of support, our students have proven that they can and will succeed.""\As is tradition, the annual Convocation was held the day before the start of the Fall semester. Classes began at all three of the College's campuses (Cranford, Elizabeth, and Plainfield) today, welcoming more than 11,000 new and returning students.\Following President McMenamin's meeting with employees was a presentation by the University of Tennessee's Dr. Robbie Melton, who energized the audience with a series of demonstrations on educational technology.

433," There couldn't be another strike in modern America that compares with the standoff now occurring between United Parcel Service and the Teamsters.\ There isn't another large, unionized company that could be shut down with effects so widely felt. There's not another union that could draw such attention to its fight.\ And the stakes for all of organized labor are as big as the adversaries.\ This strike is a battle over the role of part-time workers in the American workplace and the role of unions in the evolving, service-industry-driven national economy.\ For those reasons, the AFL-CIO's president, John Sweeney, is strongly backing the Teamsters. Sweeney's purpose is nothing less than ""trying to use the UPS dispute as a vehicle for showing the benefits of unions,"" said Charles Craver, a professor of labor law at George Washington University.\ An outcome seen as positive for the Teamsters could help spur labor's fledgling attempts at a resurgence. A perceived defeat could do real damage.\ ""The issues on the bargaining table go to the heart of the economic anxiety so many Americans feel,"" said Harley Shaiken, a labor scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. ""We may well look back a decade from now and see the strike as a symbol of labor's resurgence.""\ Or it may be seen as a sort of last stand by the labor movement, which has seen a steady decline in its share of the work force - now down to about 10 percent in the private sector.\ ""The strike is only going to push the unions further downhill,"" said Leo Troy, a Rutgers University economist. Even a win for the Teamsters will be so marginal, he said, ""that workers involved will have to ask themselves at the end of the day, Was it worth it?""\ UPS is just the kind of service-oriented employer that unions must focus on if they are to survive.\ In the past, when unions have tried to organize manufacturing companies, or demand a lot from them, those companies have sometimes responded by shutting down U.S. factories and opening new ones overseas. UPS, like many other service-oriented businesses, doesn't have that option. It can't go anywhere.\ Beyond that, the part-time question is key. UPS has grown increasingly reliant upon part-timers - albeit relatively well-paid ones who receive some benefits - because the competitive environment dictates the flexibility that comes with using part-timers.\ Nearly 60 percent of UPS workers are part time, making an average of $11 an hour. In its last formal offer, the company proposed making about 11,000 of those workers full time. But 90 percent of those jobs would come as other full-timers - who average nearly $20 an hour - retire or leave, meaning the structure of the work force would be little changed.\ Teamsters President Ron Carey, who began his career as a UPS driver in Queens, has declared that American workers can't build a life on part-time work - even though surveys show that most part- time workers in the United States are part time by choice - and that it's time to make a stand. He has called for a much larger increase in full-timers.\ He has been joined by Sweeney, who has been championing a new, more militant union activism since his election two years ago.\ ""Because their fight is our fight, we are making this strike our strike,"" Sweeney said last week as he pledged $10 million a week in AFL-CIO loans to the Teamsters' strike fund. ""It's about part-time jobs and half-time pay. . . . And it's about a greedy, hugely profitable employer who wants to make even more money by shortchanging workers.""\ Company officials, for their part, say the strike has less to do with part-time jobs than with pension money.\ In their view, the key issue is the union's resistance to the company's plan to create a new pension fund that would cover UPS employees alone - and take billions of dollars out of the Teamsters' control.\ The strike also is, in some ways, a throwback to years past. Generations ago strikes shut down businesses and picket lines held firm. Companies did not hire replacement workers.\ That changed in 1981, when the nation's air-traffic controllers walked out - and were fired by President Ronald Reagan.\ With that strike, the etiquette of labor relations changed, with management realizing that replacement workers could be hired and that business, if not quite as usual, could go on. Strikes began to decline dramatically in both number and effect. In 1995, the number of strikes was the lowest it had been since the unions' heydays of the 1940s.\ Thus far, at least, UPS seems to be playing by the old rules. While the company has said that as many as 15,000 jobs may have to be eliminated if the job action continues, it has not indicated - at least so far - that it will try to replace the 185,000 striking Teamsters.\ UPS has generally enjoyed good relations with the Teamsters over the years, but in the last decade the company has seen increasing competition from rivals such as FedEx Corp. and RPS Inc., which are non-union. Those competitors have managed to stave off the unions, keeping their labor costs lower.\ Labor's failure to organize those new companies is making the Teamsters' fight against UPS all the more difficult because there is credence for UPS' arguments that it needs flexibility to compete against non-union companies.\ But that has hardly dissuaded big labor. UPS' contract with the Teamsters has made for the biggest, most visible negotiations since Sweeney took over the AFL-CIO and attempted to reassert labor's influence. His allies, while acknowledging the risks in the UPS strike, see it as the perfect opportunity for the labor movement to go for a big victory.\ ""It's the right time and the right industry for the AFL to draw a line in the sand,"" said Michael Holland, a Chicago labor lawyer and former general counsel to the United Mineworkers Union. ""It's as good a chance as we'll see.""\ For now, the Teamsters' arguments seem to be resonating with many Americans. Two polls last week showed the union getting more support than the company.\ But that could easily change. If the strike should drag on, more and more small businesses that rely on UPS will suffer. Those businesses might have to lay off workers.\ Such developments could swing public opinion toward UPS, said Thomas Kochan, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\ ""We're getting close to that,"" he warned late last week."
434,"Keep those guns away\from the wrong people\I would like to make a few comments about gun control and on the survey that shows that many people would be in favor of rescinding and repealing the Second Amendment.\While I do believe that we do need tough, fair and reasonable gun laws, I do not support the extreme and radical idea of abolishing the right of common people to have guns.\Making the private ownership of guns illegal will not do anything to make society any safer, but will only result in disarming law-abiding people.\Criminals are going to find a way to get guns, no matter how many laws are passed. I think many people are thinking emotionally and irrationally instead of using common sense.\I feel it would be wrong to raise the age that one can buy a gun from 18 to 21 because if an 18-year-old can carry a gun in war in service to his or her country then he or she should be able to buy a gun as a civilian.\Nor do I think it is sensible to sue gun manufacturers for gun crimes. That would be like suing the car makers for reckless drivers.\We need good laws that keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people, but not from all people. All guns should be licensed and registered. Before anyone can get a permit for a gun, he or she should have to take a complete mental and psychiatric exam. Everyone who owns a gun should have to take a test every six months. There should be a waiting period of at least three days before anyone can get a gun, and anyone who has a gun in the home who has children must keep that gun locked and secured so no child can get to it or accidentally use it.\We should increase the penalty for using a gun in a crime - so if anyone uses a gun, the sentence for that crime is increased by one to five years or by 10 percent, whichever would be greater.\Passing unfair gun laws that take away the right of the people to possess guns will not make us any more safe. Passing fair and tough laws that keep guns away from the wrong people will.\MICHAEL S. SMITH\Berkeley Heights\Multicultural festival\a success in Fanwood\The Fanwood Cultural Arts Committee and the Fanwood Millennium Committee managed to present a splendid multicultural festival Oct. 10, despite a rainy afternoon and soggy grounds around the Patricia Kuran Cultural Arts Center (formerly known as the Carriage House).\As a member of the cultural arts committee, I would like to thank all the talented performers, their friends and families, the wonderful audience that enjoyed the music and dancing, the volunteers on our committees, our local merchants, Merck (which generously sponsored the celebration), and the leaders of our committees: Adele Kenny, director of the cultural arts committee, and Pat Plante, chairwoman of the millennium committee.\I'd also like to thank Ray Manfra, director of Fanwood's Public Works Department, and his dedicated staff for their help with the preparations for the festival. A steady rain didn't stop them from getting the job done and we appreciate their effort and consideration.\TOM PLANTE\Fanwood\Forget fancy shovels;\cut a ribbon instead\On Oct. 1, a local newspaper had a picture of a politician using a Somerset County $1,000-dollar, chrome-plated shovel to break the ground for a sidewalk project.\When the Somerset County freeholder broke ground for the county baseball stadium, 40 gold-leaf shovels were required.\In the future, to save money, the freeholders should use and cut a ribbon for their ceremonies.\TOM GILLICK\Somerville\Reason we have oods\quite easy to gure out\After one or two floods in previous years, I wrote letters to the editor stating that there was too much construction going on in our area.\Recently, an article in the paper headlined ""Dangers of development"" caught my eye.\Mark Gutshall, a watershed consultant, was quoted as saying, ""There is a direct correlation between stormwater runoff ... and, land use."" I bet he went to college to learn that.\Unfortunately, I couldn't afford to go to college, but I hope my math is correct for the following:\Suppose a car covers 6 square yards of ground. Each square yard holds a gallon of water. Build a parking lot which holds only 200, not including space to open the doors, and you should have about 1,200 gallons of water, or, for viewing purposes, 120 10-gallon fish tanks.\Now add to this thousands of square yards of building and sidewalks and, of course, the road to drive through the parking lot and the result is a lot of displaced water that has to go somewhere, because there's no ground to sink into.\Conclusion? Build more malls and houses and to hell with the businesses and homes in the lowlands?\This, dear readers, is the attitude of mall builders. They care less about the ""little guys"" and the ""mom-and-pop"" stores, as long as the buck goes into their own pocket.\Home-building lots should be increased in size, so fewer homes can be built.\The distance between malls should be set, and the state should enforce that.\Homes are being built so close together that you can talk to neighbors through open windows.\Greed in the construction business is ruining the lives of thousands of people.\Now, if I may digress. Another item that caught my eye was headlined ""Some branches of military seeing recruiting dropoff.""\Having been in the Marine Corps at the time of the Korean War, I didn't have to worry about being put under the U.N. command.\That draft dodger in the White House thinks nothing of going against the Constitution and putting our men and women under the anti-U.S. United Nations. I don't blame anyone for not signing up. He didn't.\TED ZYCHLINSKI\South Plainfield\For change, Raritan needs nonpartisan unity\By Mike Lopez\Last year the Raritan Democratic Party initiated a move for change toward political responsibility. This move was brought about because of the beligerent and totalitarian attitude of our mayor and certain council members. Their actions consisted of intimidations and harassment of other council members and the citizens of Raritan.\They attempted to impose silence concerning the issue of illegal boarding houses and multiple dwellings. In one instance they were successful in enlisting the aide of a prominent newspaper. What we got at the end was a notice of intent to sue our town and an errant council member. The issue of boarding houses and illegal apartments is now mute.\You may wonder why this issue is so important. The answer is simple. It takes $8,000 of your tax monies to put one child through school. Consequently, every illegal apartment and/or rooming house becomes a burden on the taxpayer.\The mayor and certain council members seem to insult the intelligence of town folks. Councilman Gaburo seems to think that he can change lead into gold. He views the potential loss of our left-hand turn from Route 206 (northbound turn) into Raritan and the addition of a jug-handle turn into Somerville as a victory. I do not know about you, but potentially sending loved ones into the Somerville circle is not my way of showing love.\Mayor DeCicco, Councilman Gaburo and Councilman Whittlesey have been energetic in causing the removal of volunteers who have for years devoted their time and effort to the betterment of our town. If you are not on the mayor's side, then you are the enemy. The removal of persons from the board of directors of the Raritan library, the Basilone Parade Committee and town committees are examples of the mayor's high-handedness.\The mayor has refused to hold in mind the needs of his own constituents. Among the recent fiascos: the low-prioritized flood zone issue (which simply has been ignored even though the topic has been brought up in the past). In absolute disgrace and in defiance of public sentiment, Mayor DeCicco, Councilman Gaburo and Councilman Whittlesey have championed the development of vacant properties. One of the proposed sites in question comprises the flood zone.\Early this year the federal government had asked the state to consider the use of $1 billion that would be earmarked for the improvement of the Raritan River.\In the mayor's zest to bond every capital issue at the expense of the taxpayer, he ignored the desperately needed revitalization of the sewer and drainage system, a system that by his own admission is antiquated. When questioned as to why we need to finance projects with bond issues, the mayor and his council supporters echo en masse that they are saving the taxpayer money. The mayor rationalizes this by stating that everybody does this, even the citizens of our town. ""Don't they borrow money on their credit cards? Don't they make monthly installments to pay their bills? Why that's the American way - buy now, pay later.""\Nonsense! this is not a way to have a sound fiscal standing. You cannot expect to defer the payment of interest to the future and, expect the taxpayer to fund an issue that could have been paid through a capital surplus account. Fortunately, the wiser and newer members of our current council implemented a capital surplus account which will allow for this surplus to build up. Eventually, other towns will follow suit and pay for what they can afford with the savings on hand or apply the surplus to reduce the amount needed to borrow.\In any event, the public has the right to know, in a timely fashion, what their representatives are voting on. The council should make it plain and clear (in simple terms) what is being proposed.\IT IS APPARENT that we need change, that change must come from nonpartisan unity. The Democratic, Republican and Independent-minded citizens of our town are calling for this change. We need a government that is accountable, a government that will support traditional not-for-profit public service organizations, without taking into account its members' political background.\About two years ago, I was entrusted to develop and promote change by the Democratic Municipal Committee. On Nov. 2, you will speak your voice and hopefully that change will come about. Every individual who has been chosen (inclusive of those elected in 1998) has made a solemn promise to bring about change that includes people from all walks of life. The most important thing to remember is that each and every one of those candidates are now responsible to you.\Vote for change. Vote for Phil Possessky for mayor, and Anthony Hudak and Kenneth Orcolek for council.\Mike Lopez is the Raritan Democratic municipal chairman.\Most important vote will be for public question\By Raymond M. Pocino\One of the most important votes that New Jersey residents will cast Nov. 2 will not be for a candidate. It will be for a public question on the ballot: the Statewide Transportation and Local Bridge Bond Act of 1999.\While it in no way should be considered a substitute for swift renewal of the Transportation Trust Fund, the $500 million bond issue will still provide multiple benefits for motorists and the economy of our state.\THERE IS AN undeniable need for increased transportation funding in New Jersey. We face a $2 billion backlog over the next five years in funding needed for road and bridge improvements. Nearly 40 percent of our bridges are deficient and pose a potential danger to motorists and pedestrians alike.\More than a third of our roads are considered in mediocre or poor condition. Our motorists pay an average of $133 per year in extra operating costs to drive on roads and bridges that need repair.\The large percentage of roads currently in mediocre condition should also be of great concern since it will be about four times more costly to repair them once they deteriorate to poor condition.\It stands to reason that the same applies to bridgework. In this case, delayed funding would be an extremely expensive form of under-investment.\But, the need to keep or transportation infrastructure in good repair is more than just a series of statistics. There is a crucial link between transportation investments and our state's ability to compete in the regional marketplace.\Money invested in infrastructure projects generates a significantly greater return in terms of dollars, jobs, quality of life and competitiveness than is ever spent on such projects. For example, one of the residual benefits of improving our transportation infrastructure is the creation of some 3,700 jobs for every $100 million expended.\TRANSPORTATION SHOULD NO longer be seen as just a way to travel between home and other destinations. Efficient transportation also serves to enhance the economy of communities and the quality of life of the people who live there.\A well-designed and maintained infrastructure helps secure public safety and welfare. Our economy, our environment, our energy resources all depend upon our willingness to make the right choices.\Voting yes on the Statewide Transportation and Local Bridge Bond Act on Nov. 2 is the right choice for all New Jersey residents.\Raymond Pocino is a commissioner of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and vice president and eastern regional manager of the Laborers' International Union of North America.\Dems must maintain\a Franklin foothold\I am writing to ask you to join me in supporting Bill Grippo, Al Ceaser, Councilman Harry Weber and Mayor Alex Kucsma in their bid for Franklin Township Council this Election Day. All four have worked very hard for the Democratic Party and for their community, and they are deserving of our support.\Franklin has become an anchor for the Democratic effort in Somerset County. We cannot hope to succeed in electing Democrats to the county and state level seats if we lose our base in Franklin. It is the largest electoral prize in the county, and Democrats have held it since 1995. Our party's growth and success throughout the county has coincided with Democratic success in Franklin, and to lose this large foothold could have tremendously negative results on our party's efforts for years to come.\I know our party has had some growing pains in recent years, but political parties are like families and, like all families, we sometimes disagree. These disagreements need to be discussed and ironed out so that we may continue to thrive. However there are times when despite our differences, we ignore our problems and stand by our family.\On Tuesday, I ask you to stand with the Democratic Family and vote for Grippo, Ceaser, Kucsma and Weber for Franklin Township Council. The Somerset Republicans have had enough victories. Let's not hand them one more.\ELIA PELIOS\Chairman Somerset County\Democratic Committee\Re-elect Democrats\in Franklin Township\Four years ago, when I came on the Franklin Township Council, the police had aging computers and still were using pencils and paper to file reports. They drove squad cars for which they could no longer get parts. The workers in town hall had no modern computers, and town hall looked like a mess with leaking ceilings and a heating system that didn't work.\The Public Works department had a fleet of aging trucks that could not do the job of plowing the roads. Township workers were working without contracts. The citizens wanted open space but there was no Open-Space Committee. Senior citizens were meeting in basements or in the corridors of a run-down town hall.\The township's master plan had not been revised in 15 years. No plans existed for new playgrounds and parks. The recreation program suffered from neglect.\In the last four years, I and my fellow Democrats have worked hard to change the image of Franklin Township. Our community has a newfound sense of pride. Does anyone want to go back to 1995? Do you remember all the negative talk about our police and our schools? Now everything that happens in Franklin Township is positive. In fact, things are so good that our opponents, including some in our own party, can't attack our record, so they have taken to making up ""whopping"" lies about us. Two recent `'whoppers"" relate to issues concerning the police and the board of education. Let me state my position and that of my running mates:\1. Police Issues. We do not want to see a police director in Franklin Township. The township manager and the council do not need a civilian employee to watch the budget of the police department. We can do that ourselves. Taking a close look at a police budget, the largest department budget in the township, does not mean that we are anti-police. Are the police anti-public when they do their job? Questioning the police budget is our job. We believe the process is working.\2. Board of Education Issues. We do not want an appointed board of education. We think that the current board of education is one of the finest in Franklin Township's history. We think board Chairwoman Eva Nagy is a real asset. She is doing a great job.\In politics there is an old saying: ""If you can't beat the opposition with the truth, make up the biggest lie you can think of and repeat it over and over again."" That's exactly what our opponents have been doing. However, in politics there is another saying: ""Truth is the best weapon to use if you have it.""\We have it. On Nov. 2, vote for the team that's not afraid of the truth or their record or accomplishments. I ask you to vote for me, Harry Weber, and my running mates - Mayor Alex Kucsma, Al Ceaser and Bill Grippo.\HARRY WEBER\Franklin Township\South Plaineld needs\Kubala and Vokral\For the past six years, Ed Kubala and Jim Vokral have been tirelessly working for South Plainfield.\The results of the efforts of these two dedicated public servants have been nothing short of outstanding.\More than 60 roads repaved, downtown revitalization, renovations to our library, Borough Hall, Fire and Police Departments and PAL, a budget-spending plan that has not increased in six years, a municipal tax rate with no increase for two consecutive years, interlocal agreements with Middlesex County and neighboring communities to reduce costs and enhance services, all on a pay-as-you-go program.\I know Kubala and Vokral, and you know that they have earned your trust.\Both are truly deserving of your continued support.\On Tuesday, cast your vote for Kubala and Vokral for South Plainfield Council.\MAYOR DANIEL GALLAGHER\South Plainfield\Possessky's leadership\good for Raritan Boro\In this year's election, voters in Raritan have a chance to elect someone who will make a difference for all of us. That person is Councilman Phil Possessky. Throughout his career, I have supported him as a member of the Republican Party, and this year I will support him as a member of the Democratic Party.\To us, the label of one party or another means nothing. Last year, we lost a dedicated leader, Councilwoman Joann Liptak, because of one man's quest to oust her. We can't afford to lose Possessky, a mayoral candidate, for the same reason.\His dedication and leadership have been unmatched by anyone in public office over the past two decades. I recently witnessed firsthand how he is a leader for all of us.\When our Parent Teacher Organization representatives were concerned about the addition to John F. Kennedy School and many safety issues, we approached the mayor and council at a meeting and asked for their support. Who was the leader that stepped forward for our cause? It was Possessky. He appeared before the Board of Education Board on school PTO executive board. He voiced our concerns professionally, meeting after meeting, and subsequently the addition was rethought and revisions were made to accommodate the concerns we raised.\During the planning and installation of the new track at the school, Possessky again was a liaison. It was his leadership that rallied support and got other community members involved, and the whole project was a success. His leadership made it all happen. His efforts on behalf of our children will live on for decades.\Possessky is running for mayor, and it is an exciting time for Raritan. Finally we have a choice of someone who is on our level, a regular guy with the same concerns we all have.\He is someone we can relate to, and someone who will let us express our concerns without having to worry about political ramifications. This election is about having a new leader that will allow us to participate in our government. Please support Possessky's efforts to bring the government back to us, the people of Raritan. Vote Possessky for mayor, and support his team of Anthony Hudak and Ken Orzolek.\PATTI ESPOSITO\Raritan\Cast votes to reward\reghters, squads\Many communities throughout the state and most communities in Somerset County are truly blessed with dedicated emergency-services volunteers, providing fire and first-aid response to their neighbors, visitors, transients and businesses.\These volunteers give of their time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They are there for all of us as trained professionals when we need them.\The state has allowed for municipalities and fire districts to establish Length of Service Award Programs through deferred compensation accounts for qualifying volunteers. The maximum contribution for a volunteer is $1,150 each year of qualified service.\On Nov. 2 at the general election, if your community is sponsoring such a program for its emergency-services volunteers, the question will be on your ballot.\Please say thank you to your volunteers by voting yes on any referendum for these programs. This is the least you can do to show your support.\JOSEPH H. METELSKI\Bedminster\The writer is a member of the Township Committee.\Somerset residents\must vote for GOP\Read with interest the letters by our current Mayor and Councilmen Weber and Clyde. I find their remarks very misleading because I have attended Council and Board meetings for over five years.\True, the Republicans put in the Vital Tax System. Updating assessments is more equitable because everyone is paying their fair share of taxes.\True, the municipal budget will have a zero tax rate but Mayor Kucsma and Mr. Clyde neglected to mention the million-dollar surplus that was found and not explained because it was resolved to the ""mayor's satisfaction."" True, the mayor was very happy to be able to spend it but I consider that extra spending.\True, the Democrats were responsible for the Senior/Community Center but I have never heard any senior say it is the most beautiful building in central New Jersey.\True, the County has completed several projects but what has this to do with the present Council. True, the Democrats fought hard to win approval for Mr. Weber's plan for the realignment of Crash Curve. True, this Council voted for the 17 year County Plan even though a traffic expert stated the cars would be able to travel at a greater speed. This was done because Weber's fellow Democrats could not get the necessary six votes needed for bonding.\Mr. Schrum believes things have never been better in Franklin but I live near Crash Curve and I have seen our mailboxes taken down and vehicles jumping the curve, putting ruts in our lawns. True, I've enjoyed better days in Franklin.\True, the Democrats have an 8-1 majority on the Council, but that majority is divided. True, a computer system has been installed but Mr. Weber was against it. True, there was no open space program but Mr. Weber was against it. True, Mr. Weber has worked hard to change the image of Franklin but in reality the developers have aided Mr. Weber.\True, Mayor Kucsma, Mr. Weber and Mr. Clyde would like to take credit for the good things that have happened but they did not do one thing to improve the image of Franklin. I have listened and watched them for a long time. True, it was Joan Bottcher and other good Democrats who worked very hard to do this. Now, Mr. Weber claims their opponents are making up ""whoppers."" True, this man of experience knows about ""whoppers.""\True, it is time for a change and this can be done by voting straight Republican Nov. 2 to keep Franklin in a two-party system rather than a puppet of the Middlesex County Machine. Let's be proud of Franklin once again.\LUCRETIA CORTELYOU\Somerset\Mayor's campaign\misses the mark\I just received a very curious letter from Mayor James Dowden, who's campaigning for re-election in Bridgewater. It was interesting for what it said, and didn't say.\The gist of what it said: I (Dowden) have no control over township planning so I'm not to blame for development in Bridgewater, and my opponent should know that.\What it didn't say was anything about the issue, itself - the accelerating pace of development throughout Bridgewater. That's what I want to hear about. There are sections of the township that I now try to avoid because the traffic and congestion is a mess. I'm especially concerned about the fate of our residential areas - our neighborhoods - and how to preserve them from commercial encroachment and overbuilding.\This issue of overdevelopment must be a sore point and an election concern for the mayor, else his re-election committee would not have sent out a letter trying to distance Dowden from responsibility. However, I would rather have read his position on this key issue and a discussion of how we can have reasonable growth while balancing the needs of Bridgewater residents with commercial and development interests. Instead, we received an ""it's-not-my-job"" letter. Good politics perhaps, but not good leadership.\BOB STEWART\Bridgewater\Avert strange results;\vote in S. Plaineld\I was watching the news the other day, and the commentator was pointing out this is an ""off-, off-year election."" He said the lowest-ever turnout is expected, and sometimes low turnouts lead to strange results.\Let's work hard to be certain that doesn't happen in South Plainfield. From Democracy Day to pay-as-you-go government, South Plainfield is one of the most innovative towns in New Jersey. Two of the people most responsible for the change in the way South Plainfield government works are Ed Kubala and Jim Vokral.\We have to be certain we get out and vote so they continue to be able to work hard for our residents. Write down the date - Tuesday, Nov. 2. Vote for Kubala and Vokral.\TIMOTHY I. MORGAN\South Plainfield\Proud friend backs\Kubala and Vokral\Ed Kubala is a friend, and I couldn't be prouder. Every elected official should use Kubala as a model. He really cares, and not only does he care, he delivers.\I know the hard work that he put into getting the money for improvements in the town center. It looks beautiful with the new Belgian-block curbs, sidewalks and decorative lights. Kubala worked hard to get grants, so the project would come at no cost to the taxpayers.\I ask everybody to vote for my friend, Ed Kubala, for Borough Council along with Jim Vokral. They deserve your votes.\JOSEPH M. SCHUCH\South Plainfield\Parks retiree backs\incumbents, ex-cop\I started working for Middlesex Borough in 1963, as parks supervisor from 1968 until my retirement in 1993. During that time, I also was a member of, and continue serving on, several borough committees - Field Development and Shade Tree Commission. Because of my background and expertise, I have been asked to help with the renovations of Victor Crowell Park.\Twice a year I work with the mayor and borough clerk to sell bicycles that have been turned in or found in our borough. I give you this background information so you will understand when I endorse Mayor Ron Dobies and Borough Council President John Fuhrmann for re-election, and retired police officer Bob Heisch for election to the council, I do so because I worked with, and continue working with these men and understand their commitments to our residents and borough.\I worked with Dobies when he started on the council in 1976 and continued to work with him through his years as our mayor. I still remember the many meetings we had Saturdays and Sundays, when I stopped at Borough Hall after making my tours of the parks and recreation fields when I was the supervisor. Whether it was on weekends or late in the evening on weekdays, you usually could find him at Borough Hall working on borough matters, reading or trying to help residents with problems.\Apparently, he still keeps this schedule, because I continue meeting him in my volunteer capacity. I had the opportunity to work with and observe him during the recent floods when once again he displayed his total, untiring dedication to our community by leading and working hand in hand with the borough staff and volunteers.\During the storm he stayed over at Borough Hall, where he was observed by many taking 20 winks, a commitment I still recall from his earlier days. I am supporting him because of his accomplishments, his dedication and his concern for all residents. I encourage my friends to support him on Election Day.\In working with Fuhrmann over the years, I found another dedicated person that spends considerable time serving our borough. His professional banking background, expertise and knowledge of working through the red tape of contracts and other government reports were instrumental in the successful development of our senior-citizen housing, in obtaining federal and state grants and in preparation of our municipal budgets. His abilities, experiences and interest in maintaining a stable tax rate while increasing services will be an asset on the council.\I worked with Heisch throughout his 25-year police career. His election will bring still another dimension and perspective to the council because of his building and police background and experience. Heisch is a hard worker, an energetic individual who truly is interested in increasing our recreational activities, programs and fields. As a 34-year resident, his knowledge of our borough and our people will be an asset to the council. Heisch will be an excellent addition to the council who will be an asset in resolving many of the problems facing the council.\This year, I am supporting the team of Dobies, Fuhrmann and Heisch because I have firsthand knowledge of what they have done and what they are doing for our borough and residents. I urge you to review their experience, their records and their accomplishments and recommend your support.\FRED WOROWSKI\Middlesex\It's the best of times\with Dems in charge\The Republican Party doesn't understand residents of Franklin don't want negative campaigns that distort the truth. A simple look at the facts will show you how untruthful the Republican attacks have been.\The Democrats saved more than $1.2 million on the reconstruction of JFK Boulevard by phasing in the project over three years. They did such a good job and saved so much money that the Republicans in Trenton will not let them phase in any other projects.\The Democrats supported the open-space referendum and have saved more than 700 acres from development. Have the Republicans forgotten who was in control when development exploded in Franklin? Do the citizens of Franklin have to be reminded of the time Republicans tried to approve a Roadway (RPS) Warehouse on Davidson Avenue? Think of how traffic on Easton Avenue would be today if the Republicans had their way.\The Democrats have modernized the Municipal Building. The place is beautiful. Under Republican leadership, the place was a disgrace. It had a leaky roof, torn chairs and 25-year-old carpeting. Come to the next council meeting to see for yourself.\The Democrats built the Senior/Community Center. Have the seniors forgotten how they used to sit at tables in a dilapidated town hall? Have they forgotten when Councilman Harold Weber and Alexander Kucsma, now mayor, used to pass by and tell them, ""Soon, you'll be sitting in your new Senior/Community Center."" Had it not been for the Democrats, the seniors still would be sitting at tables in a hallway.\I could go on and on about the Democrats and the good work they have done. Fact is, there is not one negative thing the Republicans can say about the Democrats, so instead they make up lies about police directors and appointed boards of education. Nobody wants those things, just as nobody wants to go back to the days under Republican leadership when nothing got done.\Times have changed, and they are for the better. I hope all Franklinites will vote for the Democratic team of Weber, Kucsma, William Grippo and Alfred Ceaser. Let's continue the vision.\GERI FUDGE\Somerset section of Franklin"

Recently, Caso, a sophomore in the Hunterdon County Vocational School District's Biomedical Sciences Academy learned that she was also selected for the Emperor Science Award Program. Both opportunities offer hands-on research experience in a university facility.\WISE is a two-week intensive summer program that engages high school students in a research project in molecular biology and bioinformatics. The project focuses on the isolation, characterization and DNA sequence analyses of genes from the duckweed Landoltia punctata, and how these compare to those found in other species.\Participants analyze the gene sequences using the same bioinformatics tools used by practicing scientists worldwide. They then submit their vetted DNA sequence analyses for publication on GenBank, the international repository of DNA sequences, which is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Education. Each published sequence acknowledges the student responsible for it by name.\Caso's selection for WISE was dependent on her grades and a personal essay. In the essay, she wrote about her scientific interests, which include DNA sequencing and cancer research.\Caso first learned about WISE through HCVSD Director of Curriculum and Academies Jessica Cangelosi-Hade, who regularly encourages tudents to pursue opportunities to enhance their studies.\HCVSD's BSA is a fulltime, four-year vocational high school housed at North Hunterdon High School. The BSA attracts high-achieving students, such as Caso, who have an interest in the growing biomedical career field.

The class leads to certification as a recreational diver, a rescue diver, and, by the American Academy of Underwater Sciences, a scientific diver.\""Scientific diving is essential to oceanographic research, an area in which Rutgers is a worldwide leader,"" Miller said. The students in her class learn advanced open water and rescue diver skills, as well as the use of scientific methods underwater. That they can acquire these skills and attain this certification while still undergraduates opens more doors, and opens them sooner, than would be the case if they had to wait until they entered graduate school as in other institutions.\Rutgers sends its faculty and student scientific divers around the world. For example, they help deploy, recover and repair the submersible robot gliders whose use the university has pioneered as ocean-observing instruments. Right now in the Philippines, a team led by environmental sciences professor Malin Pinsky is using scientific diving to research how anemone fish disperse their larvae in coral reefs.\The following Central Jersey residents at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, were recognized for their academic and military leadership and excellence: Matthew Ranson (Army) of Warren received the Military order of the World Wars award and Joseph Scerbo (Navy) of Flemington received the Sons of the American Revolution medal.\Plainfield resident Stanislav DeLaurentiis, a junior at The Wardlaw+Hartridge School in Edison, won the second-place award at The 13th Chinese Bridge Speech Contest for U.S. high school students on March 31 at the Confucius Institute at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.\Contestants were divided into three groups: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. DeLaurentiis was placed in the Advanced Division with a group of competitors who spoke fluent Chinese. Other competitors started learning Chinese as early as 4 years old, and two went to a Chinese immersion school.\""This competition was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It allowed me to be surrounded with people who share my love for learning the Chinese language and its culture. Furthermore, my performance in the competition is less a recognition of me as an individual, and is rather a testament to the excellence of the Wardlaw+Hartridge Chinese program,"" he said.\ALSO: Tracy K. Smith, the current U.S. Poet Laureate and Director of the Creative Writing Department at Princeton University, spent a few exciting hours at The Wardlaw+Hartridge School in Edison reading to and meeting with students on April 4.\At the Berry Performing Arts Center, Smith read poems from her Pulitzer Prize winner, ""Life on Mars,"" as well as new poems from her collection published this month, ""Wade in the Water."" She also read poems from her current project involving the American South and the inescapable visual vestiges of slavery and institutional racism. To help provide insight into a poem's imagery, sound and form, Smith shared her inspiration behind particular poems. Students asked Smith questions at the end of her reading.\A small group discussion with Upper School students followed in the Center for Global Learning.\""The students here are so poised and deeply thoughtful,"" Smith said. ""Their questions were unique and I was moved by the writing they have done in response to the poems.""\Thomas Edison State University President Merodie A.
