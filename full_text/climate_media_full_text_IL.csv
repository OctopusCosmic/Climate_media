0,"The Obama administration plans to push ahead with efforts to aggressively limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming despite fears that it could further slow the recessionary economy.\Instead of backing away, the administration plans to portray the limits as a boost for America's ""clean energy economy,"" according to congressional leaders and energy experts who have talked with top Obama advisers. The step would spur competitiveness and promote investment in renewable alternatives to imported oil, the government will argue.\At issue is the so-called cap-and-trade initiative, under which the government would set limits on carbon emissions by power plants, factories and other installations but allow those that emit more to buy or trade permits with companies and facilities that emit less than the prescribed limit.\The idea is that raising the cost of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere would encourage companies and other emitters to cut back, thus reducing a principle cause of global warming.\""If we don't put a price on carbon,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, ""we'll never get these clean energy sources online.""\But cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth, a concern raised frequently by opponents of climate change legislation.\""The whole economic issue will be front and center in the debate on this,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, who has discussed President Barack Obama's global warming plans with senior administration officials ""on both sides.""\Polls show voters increasingly losing interest in the global warming issue. By pressing ahead anyway, Obama would be sticking with a program he said during the campaign would be a high priority of his presidency.\""There's a general consensus that things are going to be done with climate"" in Washington this year, said Daniel Yergin, author of the Pulitzer-winning ""The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power,"" who recently updated his book with an epilogue on Obama and energy.\He added: ""We're going to go through a very intense national seminar on cap-and-trade and carbon tax.""\Details of the administration's approach are far from set, though Obama has repeatedly said he favors cap-and-trade. The administration will argue that greenhouse gas restrictions should be part of a two-pronged effort to stimulate renewable energy supplies and ensure demand for the megawatts they'd produce.\The first part is to invest heavily in wind power, solar power and biofuels, through the massive stimulus bill working its way through Congress. The second is to help that power compete with cheaper fossil fuels by pumping up fossil fuels' costs to reflect the potential economic damage from a warmed Earth.\Critics, including many Republicans on Capitol Hill, say those moves will only increase energy prices and hurt already-struggling families.\""I just have concerns on the impact on the economy with all of the issues of global climate change,"" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who sits on the Senate's energy and environment committees, ""and what restrictions there's going to be, what expenses there's going to be for American taxpayers.\Economists generally agree that limiting emissions is likely to curb economic growth, at least in the short term. Peter Orszag, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office who now heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Congress last year that emissions limits would reduce long-term economic risks but ""also impose costs on the economy ... in the form of higher prices for energy and energy-intensive goods.""\Orszag also testified that the size of those costs could depend on whether the government sells emissions permits, and if so, how it spends the proceeds.\Environmentalists have recently pushed that idea one step further, arguing that if Congress passed emissions caps today, it could borrow against the future revenues from permit sales and spend the money on alternative-energy research and technology.\That would stimulate the economy and ""allow polluters to transition from a high-polluting environment to a low-polluting environment,"" said Andy Stevenson, a former hedge fund manager who is now a finance adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\Other experts are more skeptical. Subsidizing alternative energy could stimulate the economy, said Robert Shapiro, an economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton and now chairman of the U.S. Climate Task Force. But a cap-and-trade system, he said, ""would raise energy prices at a time when you're trying to increase consumption. ... It goes against everything [Obama] campaigned on.\Shapiro and many economists would prefer for the government to tax carbon emissions and refund the proceeds straight to taxpayers. The Democratic leaders working with Obama on climate legislation prefer cap-and-trade. So do a coalition of business leaders -- including Shell oil and the Big Three automakers -- who joined with some environmental groups to release an emissions-limit proposal earlier this month.\Boxer said Friday that she has learned from the defeat of a cap-and-trade bill in the Senate last year. She's set to unveil basic principles of a simpler, more focused plan within a week in hopes of passing a bill by year's end.\Her counterpart on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) talks even more optimistically: He has promised a bill by Memorial Day.\----------\jtankersley@tribune.com\Get green news at one site\Tribune's Green page has news about recycling, jobs and getting eco-friendly at chicagotribune.com/green\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, Washington Bureau"
1,"In what are likely to be blueprints for a national effort to fight climate change, clusters of states on the East and West Coasts and in the Midwest are setting up marketplaces for electric utilities and other companies to buy and sell credits to emit carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming.\Building on a voluntary market system pioneered in Chicago, 10 Northeastern states recently launched what they are billing as the biggest, most coordinated effort yet in the U.S. to take on climate change by mandating that electric utilities take part in an emissions-allowance trading program.\But an alliance of seven Western states and four Canadian provinces could surpass their efforts with a more ambitious trading system they unveiled last month. It encompasses industry as well as utilities, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent in 12 years.\And a consortium of six Midwestern states, including Illinois and Wisconsin, and one Canadian province are establishing their own carbon-trading market, aiming to have it running in 2010.\These programs embrace the ""cap-and-trade"" approach that has the support of both the Democratic and GOP presidential nominees. Proponents say it offers an effective way to cut the emissions blamed for warming the climate, and to do so cheaply and more efficiently than a regulatory program.\The results for consumers are unclear. Although cutting carbon dioxide emissions is predicted to raise electric rates, cap-and-trade may mean the cost will be less than conventional regulations, and in many states some of the proceeds from the sales of emissions allowances will be spent on promoting energy efficiency and conservation, saving households money on their electric bills.\Whatever the eventual impact on household budgets, the first auction of emissions allowances at the New York Mercantile Exchange last month represented the opening of a new chapter in America's response to the threat of climate change caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.\""The start of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative auction of emission allowances demonstrates both how far we've come and how far we need to go to effectively address climate change,"" said Eileen Claussen, head of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, referring to the effort by the Northeastern states. ""These states are paving the path to a comprehensive national program that offers the most cost-effective solution to significantly reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.""\Emissions trading started in the 1990s with efforts to reduce sulfur dioxide, the cause of acid rain. When that proved successful at cutting emissions quickly for much less than the cost of a conventional regulatory program, the cap-and-trade approach came to be seen as a way to tackle the bigger problem of global warming.\Chicago's Richard Sandor, credited with creating a host of financial futures markets at the Chicago Board of Trade, established the first full-fledged carbon market, the Chicago Climate Exchange, in 2003. A voluntary trading system, the exchange has a membership of 300 companies and organizations.\""We continue to be very positive on the growth of worldwide emissions markets, despite the current economic situation,"" said Sandor, who also oversees a Chicago-based futures market for carbon credits and a European climate exchange.\Indeed, with presidential candidates Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) favoring a cap-and-trade system, it's likely that a national trading program will be set up, after years of little action on the federal level, to combat global warming.\""There are differences between the two candidates on climate,"" said Harvard University's Robert Stavins, a specialist in environmental economics. ""However, what's most striking is that if the difference between the two candidates is 1 foot, then both of them have a distance of about 1 mile from the current administration.""\The cap-and-trade approach can have pitfalls. When European countries set up carbon trading in 2005, they not only issued the credits for free, they gave away too many. That led to huge profits for some companies.\The Northeastern states have been criticized for setting too generous a cap -- 188 million tons annually -- for the first several years of their program. Emissions have fallen below that level in recent years because of rising fuel prices and a slowing economy.\But Jonathan Schrag, executive director of the regional initiative, noted that during the first auction, the allowances fetched $3.07 each, well above the $1.86 floor price the states had set. And although only 12.6 million allowances were sold -- covering an equal number of tons of carbon dioxide emissions -- the states received bids for four times that many allowances, a sign that utilities recognize the value of the trading process.\""I think we have set the bar very high for a model that could easily be adapted for a national program,"" said Pete Grannis, commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\But Harvard's Stavins noted that the Northeastern states require only power plants to take part in the cap-and-trade program. The Western Climate Initiative, which includes California, will take in a much broader array of sources, including industry and transportation.\Although still in the planning stage, the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, of which Illinois is a member, will include a variety of sources, said accord chief Jesse Heier.\""It makes more sense, we thought, to look at the whole range of sources,"" Heier said. ""We didn't think it was right to pick just one and go after it. Emissions really know no borders.""\- - -\How a cap-and-trade system works\The concept is that some power plants and businesses can reduce emissions more easily than others for a host of reasons, such as having newer facilities, different fuel supplies or more flexible generating or manufacturing processes.\By issuing a set number of credits, states give those utilities and manufacturers an incentive to reduce their emissions quickly so they will have leftover allowances to sell to companies that cannot adjust as cheaply or quickly.\But because the overall number of credits gradually declines, total emissions fall.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has set a limit of 188 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year for the 233 power plants in the 10 Northeastern states it covers. The group has begun auctioning emission allowances totaling 188 million tons.\Utilities must have allowances to cover their emissions, either by buying them through the auction, buying them from someone else (such as another utility or a broker) or by reducing their emissions. And they can sell any allowances they don't need, giving them an incentive to reduce their emissions.\The ""cap"" will remain at 188million tons through 2014. After that it will decline by 2.5 percent a year, yielding a 10 percent reduction by 2018. The money that the group raises through the auction of allowances will be distributed to the member states, many of which are using it to promote energy efficiency, conservation and alternative energy sources.\----------\soswanson@tribune.com\Get more on the environment\To learn about living green and efforts being made by other cities, go to chicagotribune.com/green\Credit: By Stevenson Swanson, Tribune correspondent"
2,"When it comes to cutting carbon, what's old, it seems, is new again.\Exelon Corp. executives are using terms like ""cap and trade"" and ""carbon tax"" in describing how they think Illinois should lower its carbon footprint in anticipation of the Environmental Protection Agency's bid to cut greenhouse gases from power plants. \At its first public presentation to Illinois regulators last week, Exelon Corp.'s remarks were brief. \The Chicago-based parent company of Commonwealth Edison presented just three slides that explained how a more than $10-per-ton tax on carbon pollution could aid the company's financially flailing nuclear plants. \""There are a number of factors causing this -- which include low natural gas prices and wind subsidies -- but chief among them is the absence of market mechanisms to value the carbon-free nature of nuclear power,"" said Kathleen Barron, senior vice president of federal and regulatory affairs and wholesale market policy for Exelon. \Asked to clarify Exelon's position, Barron told the Tribune: ""It's not that different from the basic premise of cap and trade. There could be a carbon tax that just taxes the sources of pollution."" \If it sounds familiar, it should. \John Rowe, who retired in 2012 as Exelon's chief executive, spent much of his 28-year utility-running career pushing for legislation that would create a national market for carbon pollution. That effort flamed out in 2010. \Last week, Rowe, 69, told the Tribune we could be looking at Cap and Trade 2.0. ""These things don't really go away,"" Rowe said. ""Old wine gets put into new bottles."" \Many would like to see that old wine poured down the drain. \NRG Energy, which owns four coal plants in the state, has said that voluntarily switching inefficient coal-burning plants to natural gas, augmented by developing renewable energy such as wind and solar power and reducing energy consumption, will lower carbon pollution enough to meet mandates. \Environmental groups say money spent on energy projects should go toward renewables and energy efficiency, not ""technology that powered the past."" \For Rowe, the journey to see federal regulation of greenhouse gases began in the early 1990s, when he was president and chief executive of the New England Electric System. \""This must be a clarion call, not for more bureaucracy or regulation or unnecessary costs, but instead for American ingenuity and creativity, to produce the best and most energy-efficient technology,"" he said in 1993 at a climate conference in Washington. \In 2003, when then-U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sponsored ill-fated legislation that would have set up a national ""cap and trade"" market for carbon patterned after the 1990 system that limited sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain, Rowe told the Tribune that he thought the pollutants should be taxed, even if it meant increased costs for consumers. \""I think the climate change problem is real,"" he said. \By 2008, all three presidential contenders favored some form of cap and trade. A trading arrangement seemed so inevitable that Time magazine hailed Chicago Climate Exchange founder Richard Sandor as a hero of the environment for his foresight in founding an exchange for voluntary carbon trading. \The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap and trade system for power plant CO2 emissions, began auctioning emissions permits in 2008. \At the time, the total trading volume for carbon products worldwide was 2.7 billion metric tons valued at $60 billion. A U.S. cap and trade plan, experts said at the time, would triple that market. \By 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a cap and trade plan that would require companies to buy an allowance, or permit, which could be bought and sold for each ton of carbon emitted, priced at $13 to $20 per ton. \But by 2010, cap and trade had collapsed politically. It hit its high-water mark with House passage of the so-called Waxman-Markey bill. But in the wake of a national recession, the proposal couldn't escape its label as a ""jobs killer."" \Shortly thereafter, the Chicago Climate Exchange quietly ceased. Only those with mandated exchanges like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and California continue to trade in carbon. \But at least one proponent of the concept hasn't given up. \""I think when you take a state like Illinois, with all its attention deficit problems and revenue problems, a modest carbon tax would be a wonderful way to try to comply with the EPA rules,"" Rowe reiterated last week. He said the taxes generated could be used to fund education or pensions. \It stands to reason that Exelon would favor taxing carbon emissions. Its six nuclear plants in Illinois don't emit carbon, while such a tax would hit competitors whose plants burn coal and natural gas. \Exelon's nuclear plants, along with others, are struggling to compete. A carbon tax or cap and trade plan looks more like a lifeline. The EPA estimates that 6 percent of the 100 nuclear reactors in the United States are threatened with closing. \The EPA's aggressive goals of 30 percent greenhouse gas reductions from 2005 levels by 2030 give states like Illinois an incentive to keep Exelon's nuclear plants in the state open. \Exelon's Barron told regulators last week that about 43 percent of Exelon's nuclear generation is at risk. \The EPA's so-called carbon rule gives states any number of ways to comply with the proposed law. Illinois can choose to go it alone or team with other states on a regional approach. \That would buy Illinois more time and save the Midwest region an estimated $3 billion annually in compliance costs, according to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which controls the part of the electrical grid that includes most of Illinois. \Exelon said it supports a ""regional"" approach to cutting carbon, a major contributor to greenhouse gases and climate change, saying it believes it would be cheaper for consumers if states work together within their regional transmission organizations. \Barron said she envisions carbon taxes collected from sources of pollution and credited back to customers. That, she said, would help offset the inevitable expense that would come as coal plants shut down, switch to natural gas or pass along the costs associated with those taxes to consumers. \David Brown, senior vice president of federal government affairs at Exelon, said most of the utility sector would have preferred a national approach to the varied cap-and-tradelike plans that may arise out of the carbon rule. \He said he can imagine a ""slim"" chance the utility sector will join forces to return to Capitol Hill for legislation that beckons the return of a plan similar to Waxman-Markey. \The question remains -- is Illinois ready to return to the days of cap and trade? \Rowe said he expects that states won't be ready to jump on board just yet. Maybe they would, he said, five years from now. \""We can't help ourselves. We're America,"" he said. ""If there's an expensive way to solve the problem, we try that first."" \---------- \jwernau@tribune.com \Twitter @littlewern\Credit: By Julie Wernau, Tribune reporter"
3,"As President Barack Obama capped a weeklong focus on climate change with a push for greater energy efficiency, his pitch was particularly attuned to reach two groups: big-dollar donors in the green movement and activists once inspired by his 2008 ambition to heal the planet.\Both groups will play a role in turning out Democratic voters in November -- a critical factor for the party's hope to retain control of the Senate. \But Obama has faced palpable frustration among some supporters who had hoped for more progress on his six-year-old promises. \While he notched some early accomplishments, such as increasing fuel economy standards for automobiles and placing limits on air toxins from new power plants, he abandoned his pursuit of cap-and-trade and major energy legislation because of opposition in Congress. \More recently, though, he has cheered the environmental community by again delaying a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline, which environmentalists oppose. \Next month, the administration plans to issue major new regulations that cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. \This week, the White House seized the moment to build greater credibility on climate change -- a push timed to the administration's release of a major report and a Senate debate over energy-efficiency legislation. \After the White House released the National Climate Assessment, which warned of the effects of climate change, Obama sought to highlight the issue in interviews with meteorologists, remarks at Democratic fundraisers across California and a speech Friday. \From a stage in a solar-powered Wal-Mart store in Mountain View surrounded by racks of tube socks and glitter-encrusted flip-flops, Obama announced a series of corporate pledges to increase use of renewable energy and several incremental steps to boost solar generation. \""Together, the commitments we are announcing today prove that there are cost-effective ways to tackle climate change and create jobs at the same time,"" Obama said. ""Inside of Washington, we've still got some climate deniers who shout loud, but they're wasting everybody's time on a settled debate."" \The message was a notable detour for Democrats, who have emphasized stagnant middle-class incomes and a higher minimum wage as their top-tier message in the midterm elections. \But the shift reflects a strategy to use every lever to push the party's base to the polls -- and ensure left-leaning groups have the money needed to execute that plan. \The White House said it thinks its climate push speaks to voters across the spectrum. \""For voters, any time you're taking an action that cuts pollution, it is as close as you can come to a position that has broad and deep appeal across the board,"" said one White House official, who would not be named talking about the politics of what the administration said was a policy effort. \The official said the message resonated with some of the groups Democrats are most worried may stay home -- particularly young people, who view acceptance of climate change as a threshold issue. \A number of pollsters and political scientists said, however, the approach has its limits. Many noted the voters who will be most excited by Obama's renewed focus on climate change form a sliver of the electorate. \Only 29 percent of Americans think global warming should be a top priority for the president and Congress, and it ranked second-to-last on a list of 20 issues, a Pew Research Center survey found this year. \But a Gallup poll in March found that about 70 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said they either worried a ""fair amount"" or a ""great deal"" about climate change. \Next month, when the administration unveils regulations to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants, the renewed attention could also activate the environmental donor community, which has sought a more assertive voice in the 2014 cycle. \----------\mreston@tribune.com\Credit: By Maeve Reston and Kathleen Hennessey, Tribune Newspapers"

5,"In almost every speech, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney criticizes President Barack Obama for overregulating, and he has made cutting regulations in two areas -- the financial industry and the environment -- a staple of his campaign.\Obama's financial industry regulations stem from the Dodd-Frank law, approved by Congress in 2010. Romney wants the law repealed. He has suggested he wants to replace it with something else but hasn't said what. \""Dealing with all the new regulatory burden has caused a lot of community banks to pull back at the very time we'd like them to step forward and provide financing to small business,"" he told reporters recently. ""I'd like to get rid of Dodd-Frank and go back and look at regulation piece by piece."" \The Dodd-Frank law established a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which started setting up shop last year. Its first enforcement action came in July, when it ordered Capital One to pay $210 million in refunds and fines for allegedly using deceptive marketing tactics on credit card customers. The bureau also has unveiled a simplified mortgage disclosure form, proposed new rules to limit mortgage fees and started overseeing credit reporting firms. \The law also called for toughening up rules for the nation's banks and investment funds. \Although he said he would like to have the law repealed, Romney also said he supported regulation to ensure ""greater transparency in the trading of derivatives"" and ""capital requirements for banking institutions so that people don't go out and leverage themselves to the point where any small hiccup could cause the entire institution to fail."" \Romney also has criticized Obama for overregulation on environmental issues. That covers many areas, but the biggest difference involves global warming. \Climate change, like health care, is an issue on which Romney's positions have changed. As governor, particularly early in his tenure, he saw climate change as a priority and pushed an ambitious plan to cut Massachusetts' emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases tied to global warming. \In his 2010 book ""No Apology: The Case for American Greatness,"" Romney wrote: ""I believe that climate change is occurring -- the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor."" \In his campaign, however, he has avoided the issue, giving deference to the skepticism that many Republicans express about whether global warming is real. He has promised to push amendments to the Clean Air Act to end the Environmental Protection Agency's power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. \Obama made global warming a significant issue in his 2008 campaign. The administration's major effort on that front, the cap-and-trade bill, passed the House in 2009 but failed in the Senate. \That proposal would have set an overall ceiling on the amount of carbon dioxide that the U.S. economy could produce. The cap gradually would lower, and industries would be allowed to buy and sell permits allowing them to emit carbon dioxide. The idea is that free trading of permits would allow the market to find the least expensive ways to reduce emissions. \In the absence of new legislation, the administration has taken two major regulatory steps to combat global warming. Last year, the administration reached agreement with automakers on a plan that would significantly raise the fuel economy of new U.S. cars, reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Earlier this year, the EPA proposed new rules that would limit power plant emissions -- effectively eliminating nearly all new coal-fired plants. \Obama has not said whether he would push the EPA to take more regulatory actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions in the future if Congress adopts no new legislation. \Romney has said he would seek to roll back the higher fuel economy standards for 2017-25, which he has labeled unrealistic.

7,"
Recent environmental policy debate has focused on whether to enact new policies -- such as a cap-and-trade system -- to control greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change. The fact is, however, that we already have policies that affect such emissions, whether we think of them this way or not. Any policy designed to improve national energy security will likely affect oil prices -- and therefore emissions -- just as any policy to encourage alternative fuels also will affect energy security, electricity prices, consumer welfare and the environment.
\
The real question is not whether to enact climate policy, but whether our current piecemeal policies are coordinated and rational. Consider how existing policies are interrelated, using three major examples.
\
First, several existing policies affect the amount you drive and, therefore, vehicle emissions. The federal gasoline tax is only 18 cents per gallon, but we pay an additional 19 cents to Illinois, 5 cents to the city of Chicago, 6 cents to Cook County and another 1-cent environmental levy. A tax of 50 cents per gallon in Chicago is higher than most other cities but is considerably lower than in Canada, Australia and other comparable areas. In fact, the gasoline tax exceeds $2 per gallon in Japan and most of Europe. As those countries have learned, a higher tax discourages driving and encourages fuel-efficiency, which helps reduce urban smog and global warming.
\
Instead, the U.S. has tended to avoid taxes in favor of mandates and standards. Cars sold in the U.S. must meet emission-per-mile standards for local pollutants that contribute to ozone. Those rules also indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards require each automaker to meet a minimum miles-per-gallon average for all the cars they sell. Those rules, in turn, affect climate gases.
\
For another example in a completely different realm, consider the pricing of electricity to consumers and businesses -- a policy choice made by many state and local public utility commissions. They are primarily worried about balancing the need for fair pricing and their bottom line. Although the environment is not their biggest concern, the way commissions set the price of electricity inevitably affects electricity use and generation. This affects a host of environmental issues, from coal use to urban smog to greenhouse gas emissions.
\
A final example: the Environmental Protection Agency places monitors across the U.S. to measure National Ambient Air Quality Standards for various local pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. The EPA requires Illinois and every other state to implement a plan for any county that exceeds maximum allowed levels. At certain times, Cook County has been deemed out of compliance, and the state has required restricted operations at certain polluting plants or devise a plan to reduce vehicle emissions. Implementing a plan to reduce local pollutants will often also affect greenhouse gas emissions.
\
These interconnections between energy and environmental policies are unavoidable. You are a consumer who wants lower gas taxes and lower electricity prices, but you also may worry about national energy security, the use of our natural resources and the quality of our environment. Highway congestion affects your commute, and urban smog affects your health. And we will all feel the effects of climate change over time. In the end, we need to think holistically about energy and environmental policy and act for the public good.

CORRECTION: Greenpeace event date wrong A Dec. 1 story about local Greenpeace USA organizer Drew Thomas attending the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change last week in Poland gave the wrong date for an event in which his fellow Greenpeace volunteers collected signatures and handed out information in Urbana as part of an international Day of Action against global warming. That event happened Saturday. (12/09/08)
\
Champaign-Urbana will have a representative at the United Nations summit on climate change this week in Poland.
\
Drew Thomas, 24, who opened the new Greenpeace office in Urbana last May, is one of 14 Greenpeace USA organizers headed to talks sponsored by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
\
The convention drew up the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, with binding targets for countries to reduce greenhouse gases through 2012. Delegates hope to draft targets for 2013 and beyond by next year's meeting in Copenhagen. The U.S. is a member of the convention, but President Bush withdrew from the Kyoto accord in 2001, favoring voluntary targets.
\
""The Bush administration has made it seem like Americans don't care about global warming,"" Thomas said.
\
He and other Greenpeace USA delegates want to show the international community that Americans do care.
\
In Champaign-Urbana and across the country, he said, average Americans are making lifestyle changes to reduce energy consumption and holding politicians accountable.
\
""Global warming was an issue in almost every campaign"" this fall, Democrat or Republican, he said. ""This is something people care about, and they're getting active.""
\
Gas prices have dropped precipitously in recent weeks, and Thomas said there is concern consumers might lose focus on energy issues as a result. That happened after the energy crisis of the 1970s, he said.
\
It's a pocketbook issue for some consumers, he said, but most are just as concerned about global warming.
\
""This time it's about the effect on the environment, and where our energy comes from,"" he said.
\
Americans have also learned that energy prices fluctuate wildly and fossil fuels are a finite resource.
\
""Prices will go back up again,"" he said.
\
The two-week talks in Poznan, Poland, begin today and are expected to draw 8,000 participants. Greenpeace and other environmental groups can't vote on the provisions but take part in negotiations and meet informally with delegates, he said. Thomas isn't sure what his role will be, but said Greenpeace will submit measures to combat deforestation.
\
The group has a reputation for ""edgy"" protest actions, the soft-spoken Thomas said, but ""we're honored to be invited.""
\
Greenpeace is sponsoring ""A Day of Action"" on Sunday, with groups around the world collecting signatures on petitions and photos of supporters calling for more action on climate change. In Champaign-Urbana, activists will ask supporters to sign a 12-foot windmill at Green and Wright streets, and hand out information on renewable energy and the talks in Poland.
\
President-elect Barack Obama will not attend the talks in Poland. But earlier this month, he promised that once he takes office, the U.S. would ""once again engage vigorously in these negotiations and help lead the world toward a new era of global cooperation on climate change."" Obama supports a ""cap and trade"" system, providing economic incentives to reduce pollution emissions.
\
Greenpeace USA has pressured members of Congress, including Rep. Tim Johnson, R-Urbana, to speak out in support of specific targets on emissions. Many countries support an 80 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2050, Thomas said. Johnson has a history of supporting environmental issues, and ""this doesn't contradict anything he stands for,"" Thomas said.
\
Johnson spokesman Phil Bloomer said the congressman has supported efforts to combat climate change, including the FutureGen clean-coal project, new renewable-fuels standards to replace gasoline with ethanol and biodiesel, and higher Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards requiring better gas mileage for American cars.
\
But Johnson won't commit to any carbon-emission targets until he sees specific legislation - how it will be implemented, at what cost and for which industries, Bloomer said. Any proposal would have international implications, he said, and Johnson doesn't want to hurt U.S. competitiveness.

9,"This is in response to ""Refinery pollution may soar; Midwest projects would increase emission up to 40%"" (Page 1, Feb. 12), by Tribune reporter Michael Hawthorne.\Hawthorne's article makes clear that our nation will face difficult choices as we take steps to foster economic growth, ensure our nation's energy security and protect the environment.\A decade ago BP was the first oil company to acknowledge the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the years since, we have worked to reduce emissions from our own operations and to provide energy consumers with cleaner, lower-carbon energy options.\However, because the energy industry is so large, diverse and complex, there are limits to what a single company or a single refinery can do to address this global problem.\For that reason, BP has long advocated creation of a single, mandatory U.S. greenhouse gas emissions registry and a national cap and trade program. Cap and trade programs deliver the greatest and fastest reductions at the least cost. Just as important, they create a level playing field, meaning that everyone must be part of the solution and first movers aren't placed at competitive disadvantage."
10," As many as one in six newborn babies could be at risk for developmental disorders because of mercury exposure in the womb coming from consumption of what should be a healthy food, fish. That's according to the latest analysis by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency scientists. A staggering figure, and one that should drive all of us to find a solution.\ The answer to this potential public health crisis is clear-- reduce mercury pollution as much and as soon as possible to limit the damaging effects to hundreds of thousands of American children. Unfortunately, the federal government is not taking the sensible approach backed up by its own scientists, but instead is proposing to delay mercury reductions for 15 years or longer.\ In December, the new EPA Administrator Michael Leavitt proposed a 15 to 20 year delay in the reduction of mercury from power plants-- the No. 1 source of industrial mercury pollution and the only major source still unregulated by EPA.\ Mercury is a potent neurotoxicant that is extremely harmful to a child's developing brain. The damaging health effects of mercury on fetal brain growth and children's neurologic development are well documented--measurable declines in motor skills, learning capacity and memory, along with other symptoms of neurological damage. If the EPA proceeds with its mercury rule, we'll run the risk of having more children who struggle to keep up in school and who may require remedial classes or special education.\ Allowing coal-burning power plants to release excess mercury for another 15 years or longer protects heavily polluting energy companies at the expense of our nation's children. The existing Clean Air Act requires all coal-burning power plants to install state-of-the-art pollution controls, which are projected to reduce annual mercury emissions by 90 percent over the next five years. Instead, the EPA proposes a cap-and-trade mercury reduction scheme that will not only delay mercury reductions by many years, but also requires smaller reductions and permits local polluters to buy credits so they can continue to pollute, our air, water and the fish we eat.\ The EPA's proposed mercury rule lets polluters off the hook and risks our children's health simply to save coal-fired electric utilities a few dollars. But who will pay for our children's lost potential and the special education costs that may result? My guess is that parents and local school districts will bear the heaviest burden. It is simply unacceptable for the U.S. government to look the other way while power plants continue to emit mercury that contaminates our air, waterways, food and ultimately, hundreds of thousands of American children.\ The EPA's proposal flies in the face of new warnings being developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that indicate children and women of child-bearing age should further limit their consumption of common fish species as a result of unsafe mercury levels. Forty-five states--including Illinois--have so far issued 2,140 specific fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination. These advisories have doubled over the last 10 years. Lest any of us in Chicago think that our children are immune to mercury contamination, consider that Illinois is ranked fourth in the nation for mercury ""hot spots,"" locations where mercury deposition is highest. In addition, the Illinois Department of Public Health has issued a statewide advisory for mercury in fish from all our state's lakes and rivers.\ But fish advisories are only a stopgap. The solution is to require power plants to reduce mercury pollution as quickly and completely as is technically possible. We need to make sure that fish is safe for women and children to eat. The EPA should abandon its weak mercury proposal in favor of a stronger standard that protects our most precious resource, our children, by reducing mercury pollution as much as possible, as soon as possible. We all must raise our voices and send a clear message to the EPA that we expect and demand air, water and food free from mercury pollution."
11,"In the 1970s and early 80s, having seized control of the U.N. apparatus (by power of numbers), Third World countries decided to cash in. OPEC was pulling off the greatest wealth transfer from rich to poor in history. Why not them? So in grand U.N. declarations and conferences, they began calling for a ""New International Economic Order."" The NIEOs essential demand was simple: to transfer fantastic chunks of wealth from the industrialized West to the Third World.\On what grounds? In the name of equality wealth redistribution via global socialism with a dose of post-colonial reparations thrown in.\The idea of essentially taxing hardworking citizens of the democracies in order to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies went nowhere, thanks mainly to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (and the debt crisis of the early 80s). They put a stake through the enterprise.\But such dreams never die. The raid on the Western treasuries is on again, but today with a new rationale to fit current ideological fashion. With socialism dead, the gigantic heist is now proposed as a sacred service of the newest religion: environmentalism.\One of the major goals of the Copenhagen climate summit is another NIEO shakedown: the transfer of hundreds of billions from the industrial West to the Third World to save the planet by, for example, planting green industries in the tristes tropiques.\Politically its an idea of genius, engaging at once every left-wing erogenous zone: rich mans guilt, post-colonial guilt, environmental guilt. But the idea of shaking down the industrial democracies in the name of the environment thrives not just in the refined internationalist precincts of Copenhagen. It thrives on the national scale too.\On the day Copenhagen opened, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over the regulation of carbon emissions by declaring them an ""endangerment"" to human health.\Since we operate an overwhelmingly carbon-based economy, the EPA will be regulating practically everything. No institution that emits more than 250 tons of CO2 a year will fall outside EPA control.\Not everyone is pleased with the coming New Carbon-Free International Order. When the Obama administration signaled a U.S. commitment to major cuts in carbon emissions, Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote the president protesting that he lacks the authority to do so unilaterally.\With the Senate blocking President Obamas cap-and-trade carbon legislation, the EPA coup detat served as the administrations loud counterresponse to Webb. With this EPA ""endangerment"" finding, we can do as we wish with carbon. Either the Senate passes cap and trade, or the EPA will impose even more draconian measures: all cap, no trade.\Forget for a moment the economic effects of severe carbon chastity. Theres the matter of constitutional decency. If you want to revolutionize society as will drastic carbon regulation and taxation in an energy economy that is 85 percent carbon-based you do it through Congress reflecting popular will. Not by administrative fiat of EPA bureaucrats.\Congress should not just resist this executive overreaching, but trump it: Amend existing clean air laws and restore their original intent by excluding CO2 from EPA control and reserving that power for Congress and future legislation.\Do it now. Do it soon. Because Big Brother isnt lurking in CIA cloak. Hes knocking on your door, smiling under an EPA cap."
12,"The Senate's Environment Committee is set to take up an energy and climate-change bill that features a 20 percent cut in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, a target that is stricter than legislation passed by the House this summer, according to a draft of the bill obtained by the Tribune Washington Bureau.\The measure, to be unveiled Wednesday, is co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. It will serve as the starting point for what promises to be a long and complicated series of negotiations that may not produce a final bill until next year at the earliest.\The legislation also pushes back several key decisions for future discussion, such as how to allocate emissions permits under the bill's centerpiece cap-and-trade system. But its details send an important signal to international delegates who are preparing to negotiate a global warming treaty in December. Essentially, the bill shows how far the United States would likely go to curb its emissions over the next decade.\Environmentalists hailed the draft bill as a major step toward Senate action, and they expressed hope of a vote before climate negotiations open in Copenhagen a little more than two months from now.\""This appears to be a very solid start, one we hope will get the attention of the entire Senate and galvanize action this year,"" said Frank O'Donnell, president of the Washington-based group Clean Air Watch.\The bill is likely to meet resistance from many Republicans and top industry groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber released a statement Tuesday supporting emissions limits in theory but reiterating its opposition to the House climate bill ""because it is neither comprehensive nor international, and it falls short on moving renewable and alternative technologies into the marketplace and enabling our transition to a lower-carbon future.""\- - -\Keys to the proposal\In departures from the House bill, the Senate version:\*Includes protections designed to minimize the cost of emissions permits for utilities and other major greenhouse gas sources.\*Preserves the EPA's ability to regulate emissions unilaterally.\*Offers incentives for nuclear power plant construction.\----------\jtankersley@tribune.com\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, Tribune Newspapers"
13,"Most of us like the idea of being green no matter where we stand on the global warming debate. More of us carry reusable grocery bags, drive hybrid cars, recycle our trash.\But in these days when dollars and jobs are scarce, few among us want those efforts to cost more. And most businesses cringe at the thought of increased costs for anything, even if it is meant to improve the climate.\That said, we hope our Congressional lawmakers take a close look at the pending American Clean Energy and Security Act, known as the Waxman-Markey bill, now before the U.S. House of Representatives and likely soon before the Senate.\Youve probably heard the term cap-and-trade lately. What it means is the government wants to cap or limit pollution from fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. You and your employer will get ""credits"" permitting a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions. If you go over, you can ""trade"" or buy additional permits. The idea, of course, is well avoid polluting, use better energy sources, be better stewards to avoid the higher cost. And that well be increasingly encouraged to offset any additional burden on the environment by doing something green such as planting more trees.\Opponents worry those cap-and-trade costs will further burden businesses and homeowners already struggling in a grim economy.\Supporters say we need to take these steps to make sure that Aunt Sally and newborn Johnny have a safe, healthy world to live in. Better still, they say the bill creates millions of ""green"" jobs with clean energy and energy efficient companies.\The bill also will make it more and more costly to use ""dirty"" energy such as what comes from coal, which accounts for about half of the electricity used in the United States. Opponents worry that means costs will rise. Supporters admit thats the case. But they say well use less energy, meaning the bottom line will be lower. They also note that the bill includes a number of cost containment measures to limit the impact.\Few of us want to be hot in the summer or cold in the winter. And most of us want to be able to get where we need to go when we want. But our energy use keeps increasing and the impact of dirty fuel continually harms the environment.\Environmental experts increasingly warn that the droughts, heat waves, even more intense storms of recent years are warning signs we cant ignore. Wed agree.\The extensive Waxman-Markey bill deserves a close look from our federal lawmakers. Modifications may be needed but its a strong start toward ensuring our energy needs will be met in the future. Taking this action to improve our environment will cost, no question. But inaction will undoubtedly cost far more."
14,"Environmental groups used to like Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk.\They picked him over a Democrat in two heated congressional races, and he cited their support in countless ads, crafting an image as an independent politician.\No more.\""We are extremely disappointed ... and we want the people of Illinois to know that,"" says Tony Massaro, League of Conservation Voters senior vice president for political affairs.\Kirk, now a candidate for U.S. Senate, just signed a pledge from a conservative group opposing President Barack Obamas push for cap-and-trade legislation aimed at taxing pollution tied to global warming.\Its the same legislation that Kirk voted for earlier this year while in the U.S. House, and he was singled out by conservative groups and commentators as one of only eight Republicans to support the Democratic proposal.\Kirk says he voted for it then because his North suburban 10th District supported it. He argued it was also a matter of national security as an important element of weaning America off foreign oil.\But soon after declaring his candidacy for Senate, Kirk started saying he would oppose the measure if elected to represent Illinois in the upper chamber of\Congress. Now he says the southern Illinois coal industry would be hurt by the legislation and it would be irresponsible of him to support it.\Critics have deemed Kirks move a transparent attempt to pacify opponents in the more conservative base of the party as he works through a GOP primary fight for the Senate seat.\Powerful national conservative groups have been eyeing Patrick Hughes of Hinsdale to possibly support, but they have yet to pull the trigger less than two months from the Feb. 2 primary.\Kirk spokesman Eric Elk said Friday the five-term congressman has a long history of supporting environmental policies, including moves to clean up the Great Lakes and prevent pollution increases. Elk says opposing cap-and-trade shouldnt label Kirk as anti-environment.\""Congressman Kirk will continue to support policies that end our dependence on foreign oil and improve our environment without harming Illinois jobs and incomes,"" Elk said.\Yet, environmental groups have been an important element of support Kirk has used to gain traction beyond Republican voters, backing that he may need to win a statewide Senate race next year.\Kirk has also relied on endorsements from gun control advocates and legalized abortion supporters to strengthen his image as a ""moderate.""\Environmental groups who champion cap-and-trade say Kirk has now cost himself general election support in a decidedly Democratic state. Cap-and-trade tops their agenda and appears to surpass other pro-environment positions the congressman holds.\""Mark Kirk is catering to a very vocal, very angry minority,"" says Jack Darin, director of the Sierra Clubs Illinois chapter. ""This is a very important seat and we want to know that our next U.S. senator is going to be a leader on environmental and energy policy.""\Both the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters sided with Kirk in his 2008 race against Wilmette Democrat Dan Seals, a battle that drew millions of dollars in spending and national attention.\Both groups have yet to endorse in the Republican Senate primary, though it is unlikely they will find a candidate to back who supports cap-and-trade in the current field.\An endorsement from the Sierra Club or League of Conservation Voters often carries more than just kind words to put on campaign mailers and TV ads.\Just this summer the League of Conservation Voters paid for cable TV ads in Illinois urging Kirk to continue supporting cap-and-trade.\Massaro pointed out the organization played a significant roll for Barack Obama in his 2004 Senate primary bid. The group bought $400,000 in TV ads for Obama early in the Democratic race.\""We will be doing more than just the general work for whoever we pick in Illinois,"" Massaro said of the upcoming general election.\But what he has lost in support from environment groups, Kirk may have gained from the so-called right.\Joe Calomino, Illinois director for Americans for Prosperity, said Kirk was right to sign his organizations pledge against cap-and-trade. ""I think our members were outraged, clearly,"" Calomino says, ""and we are grateful he changed his mind.""\Other candidates in the GOP primary for Senate include Internet commentator Andy Martin of Chicago, retired judge Don Lowery of downstate Golconda, Springfield activist Kathleen Thomas, former Harvey alderman John Harrington and Rockford businessman Robert Zadek."
15,"Chicago Climate Exchange founder Richard Sandor dresses impeccably; the cuffs, lapels and necktie dimples would delight a tailor. Few would associate his appearance with peddling billions of tons of pollution. In fact, he now has rivals, and his theory that you can fight global warming with futures contracts has currency in the presidential election, setting the stage for what might literally be Chicago's hottest commodity.\The New York Mercantile Exchange officially launched similar European carbon emission contracts on Monday, the same day the CME Group agreed to buy the energy and metals market for $9 billion.\Factory smokestacks, vast farms, big-rig trucks, mammoth tankers, power plants -- all the drivers of the global economy -- belch more than 27 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, according to recent government estimates. Those greenhouse gases heat the Earth, potentially causing future environmental and economic disasters.\By capping emissions and then allowing exchanges to offer rights to pollute in the future, governments can presumably reduce greenhouse gases in a more affordable manner than with a direct tax.\""The difference between this market and, say, pork bellies and crude oil is you need government regulation for this to work,"" said Peter Fusaro, chairman of Global Change Associates, an energy investment adviser. ""The idea is not to trade pollution, but to ratchet down pollution and give industry time to invest in new plants and equipment.""\Support by candidates\All three presidential contenders -- Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) -- favor some form of cap and trade. During the course of the presidential primaries, carbon prices in Chicago soared to $5.75 a ton from $1.90 as investors assumed that the voluntary contracts could become mandatory.\Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John Warner (R-Va.) have a cap-and-trade bill under consideration. Supporters include utilities such as Chicago-based Exelon Corp., but the policy does not have universal acclaim. The National Association of Manufacturers and the American Council for Capital Formation, a Washington think tank, claim the cost of carbon permits would reach $74 a ton by 2020, leading to higher energy prices that would slice 3.7 million jobs from the U.S. economy.\A coalition of evangelical Christians and fiscal conservatives announced their opposition to cap and trade last week. As president of the Frontiers of Freedom Institute, George Landrith belongs to this coalition and describes himself as an environmentalist who hikes and drinks water straight out of creeks. Yet he is unconvinced that global warming is man-made and that sufficient political will exists for carbon trading.\""It was much easier to be for cap and trade when the economy was booming a year or two ago,"" Landrith said. ""I think right now this is a very difficult conversation for politicians.""\Sandor refers to these opponents as the ""forces of darkness,"" noting that not all Christians object to cap and trade. The Jesuit Community of Santa Clara University in California was among the first members of the Chicago Climate Exchange.\Cap and trade can have positive net impacts, some say. The Environmental Protection Agency created a cap-and-trade program more than 17 years ago for sulfur dioxide, the chemical behind acid rain. It estimates that the $3 billion spent on the program in 2010 will produce $120 billion worth of health benefits.\Carbon prices in Chicago are about $20 below those of the European Climate Exchange, which has government-structured contracts. The European Union Allowance covers half of that continental alliance's carbon emissions, while the United Nations-sponsored Certified Emission Reductions established contracts so that a ton of carbon from an Indian steel mill and Italian motorcycle factory are interchangeable.\Shares of Climate Exchange PLC, parent company of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the European Climate Exchange, were selling at $31.52 Friday in London, having nearly doubled in price since January while stock for American exchanges plunged.\""We are an exchange that has focused on the environment and the belief that carbon will become the world's largest commodity,"" Sandor said. ""We're trying to establish a worldwide brand.""\Part of that growth comes from the fact that carbon remains an immature market. The total trading volume for carbon products last year was 2.7 billion metric tons valued at $60 billion, according to Point Carbon, a Norwegian consulting firm.\If America had cap and trade, it said, that figure would balloon by an additional 6 billion metric tons.\""We're just scratching the surface on the possibilities,"" said Nymex Chief Executive James Newsome. ""As China and India become more industrialized there's going to be greater need to offset these risks.""\Carbon complements the oil, natural-gas and gasoline contracts already provided by the Nymex. It began trading the European and UN products Monday, attracting a 1,700-contract volume for 1.75 million tons of carbon during the four-day week.\These contracts will eventually transfer to the new Green Exchange, which also has the backing of Merrill Lynch & Co., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Evolution Markets, among others. With the Nymex acquisition, the CME Group would have a 20 percent stake in the Green Exchange, which will use the CME Group's electronic platform.\""The ability to do trading within the energy space is a strong differentiator with [the Chicago Climate Exchange],"" said Abyd Karmali, a Merrill Lynch managing director based in London. ""We already trade on Nymex and clearly having the ability to hedge off the other commodities we trade on one exchange is very efficient.""\Unlike the voluntary contracts bought and sold among the 400 members of the Chicago Climate Exchange, the Green Exchange would focus on higher-quality contracts that correspond with government standards, said Andrew Ertel, chief executive of Evolution Markets Inc. Only 10 percent of carbon market participants thought the voluntary model was transparent, according to a recent Point Carbon survey.\""After McCain won the nomination there was a speculative run-up in Chicago pricing,"" Ertel said. ""People thought those would be good for regulatory compliance. That's nonsense. They won't be fungible.""\The Chicago Climate Exchange currently reports to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the non-governmental Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, meaning that even without an official cap-and-trade program it still has some oversight.\Strong competitor\The Green Exchange plans to capture market share in environmental commodities, but dislodging Sandor could prove difficult. First-movers in futures markets seldom lose their liquidity to challengers, with the exceptions being open-outcry floors that were challenged by electronic exchanges.\And as one of the fathers of financial futures during his tenure at the Chicago Board of Trade in the 1970s, Sandor, a former University of California at Berkeley economist, has cultivated a strong reputation within the industry.\""Anyone entering the carbon market is going to be asked, 'Do you want to compete against Dr. Richard Sandor?'"" said Jeffrey Sprecher, founder of the IntercontinentalExchange. ""The answer is 'No.'""\----------\jboak@tribune.com\Credit: By Joshua Boak, TRIBUNE REPORTER"
16,"Almost nobody noticed when the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange launched a new set of carbon-credit contracts for delivery in 2013, and who would?\If ever a market were half-baked, this is it. For years, insiders have talked about its great potential, and its results have improved steadily. But a toothpick inserted into the heart of it would come out covered in sticky crumbs: Not ready. Not yet.\That could change -- by 2013, if the traders in those far-off contracts know their stuff.\Over the next five years, new regulations could create a national ""cap-and-trade"" program that caps the amount of carbon pollution that can be emitted and officially endorse a system to trade it on exchanges. The same unified system, in theory, could cover Europe and Asia too. The prospects never have been brighter.\Trading pollution is an old idea around Chicago, hatched by Richard Sandor, a visionary financial engineer from way back.\As it stands, however, the market remains fragmented, balkanized and subject to the whims of global politics. ""Carbon markets are about the most political market there is, even more than oil,"" said Jim Kharouf, editor of the Environmental Markets Newsletter. Because governments control the amount of the carbon that can be traded via caps, he said, ""the political environment is the most important factor.""\The Barack Obama administration holds promise for the business, since the incoming president and his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, both know it and, so far at least, say they like it. That could translate swiftly into an energy bill making cap-and-trade the centerpiece of a national policy to control greenhouse gas. Less likely, but still possible, Obama could work through the Environmental Protection Agency to impose cap-and-trade without any new legislation.\As Sandor put it last month at a futures industry trade show, ""It's a very happy time.""\Assuming cap-and-trade becomes a reality, then what? This is Chicago, after all, and guys like Brian Rice are standing at the ready.\Rice developed a trading business based on futures and options in the dairy industry, another small-time contract based on a huge, government-regulated industry. His firm, Rice Dairy, has grown to 13 employees.\In 1999, he read about Sandor's climate exchange. He bought a membership in 2004, and he now has a trading and advisory business as well as an investment fund.\To say the Atrium Carbon Fund is volatile would be putting it mildly. It opened last December and by June had shot up more than 160 percent. As of last month, it was down 50 percent. ""Not for the faint of heart,"" Rice said.\With those wild swings comes opportunity, and Rice sees pay dirt. Those 2013 carbon futures contracts trade for more than 10 times the price of contracts for 2008 delivery -- with good reason. For cap-and-trade to work, carbon must become costly enough to discourage emissions and inspire investment in carbon-reducing technologies. ""Most economic analyses will tell you we need $50 a ton,"" he said.\He's not expecting the contracts to run up to $50 any time soon, but over time, in fits and starts, why not? ""Hopefully,"" Rice said, ""it will be a fun ride along the way.""\Hang on tight.\----------\gburns@tribune.com\Greg Burns on business: To read more columns by Greg Burns, go to chicagotribune.com/burns"

Aren't liberals supposed to love to hate corporations? Haven't President Obama and Democrats on Capitol Hill made that clear in the BP debacle?
\
Wait, wasn't President Obama the biggest recipient of BP campaign cash? And didn't BP support and lobby for Obama's stimulus package, the Wall Street-bailout and, more recently, Obama's pending cap-and-trade legislation? Where was the animus from the left? Why were there no objections from Obama?
\
Corporations obviously don't do stuff like this for no reason; they clearly do it to gain favorable market advantage and maximize profit. BP apparently had early success in its influence brokering efforts, as it got environment waivers that made it feel it could cut safety corners in its drilling practices with barely a wink and a nod from friendly regulators.
\
Never mind that their engineers' warned of catastrophe. Even the often vilified Halliburton scolded of a probable disaster. But, as we all know, BP gambled, lost and perpetrated a disaster of epic proportions.
\
Now, finally, Obama speaks, and the words are disparaging. But are they, really?
\
BP, it appears, still has a big profit card to play. Remember BP's support for Obama's cap-and-trade plans?
\
And isn't Obama now talking about cap-and-trade legislation as a positive response to BP's mess?
\
Why would Obama favor legislation that BP wants? What does BP stand to gain from its passage? If BP is for it, wouldn't you think Obama would be against it? What else is going on here?

"
18," Legislation that has the potential to significantly change the nation's approach to air pollution has been at an impasse in a Senate committee for weeks. You can count one committee member, U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, among the skeptics.\ The measure, the latest incarnation of President Bush's Clear Skies initiative, would set industry caps on emissions for mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, and it would bring a welcome market flexibility to achieving such reductions. The measure doesn't address limits on carbon dioxide emissions, which have been closely linked to global warming.\ The matter's up Wednesday before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The crux of the argument: How clean and how fast?\ The most appealing piece of Clear Skies is the expansion of so- called ""cap and trade"" rules to create more flexibility in efforts to cut some major pollutants from power plants over the next decades. Here's how that works: The federal government sets a limit, or cap, on a certain pollutant, then allows companies to buy and sell the right to release that pollutant into the atmosphere. Industry officials prefer that method, arguing that it chops away a dense undergrowth of often vague and confusing government regulation and that it allows greater efficiency in how a company reduces pollution. Such a trading system has proved successful in cleaning up acid rain since the early 1990s.\ But the trading system has limits. On mercury, for instance, there are strong indications that it's the wrong strategy. The Chicago area was identified last year in EPA estimates as a mercury ""hot spot,"" where nearly two-thirds of the pollutant comes from sources within Illinois. Since trading programs allow polluters to buy and sell the right to release mercury into the atmosphere, some utilities may decide to buy their way out of federal limits, thus helping to create a ""hot spot"" of more intense mercury pollution.\ Clear Skies should adopt what Rep. Mark Kirk suggests: Stop industry from buying pollution ""credits"" to emit more mercury in the region.\ It's a good idea to give the industry more flexibility to meet pollution limits. But right now, this bill doesn't go far enough and fast enough to reduce major pollutants. Unless Republican leaders are able to peel off a vote in committee, the bill will die. Unless they're willing to make some concessions, it will deserve just that fate.\ Former EPA chief Christine Whitman, in her book ""It's My Party Too"", blamed ""intransigence on both extremes of the environmental debate"" for ""preventing significant progress that might be made if there was less fixation on doing away with all regulations on one side and with writing more and more regulations on the other.""\ Clear Skies can make significant progress--if Republicans are willing to give."
19,"July 20, 2009.\As Mark Kirk stood on the doorstep of his childhood home in Kenilworth to announce his campaign for U.S. Senate, he ran his hands over his carefully parted hair. Pinching his thumb and forefingers together, he adjusted the monogrammed cuffs of his starched white shirt. He bounced slightly on the balls of his feet.\He was ready. After nearly a decade as a popular congressman in the North suburban 10th district, he was confident, prepared to move to the next level of the political arena the upper chamber.\Long before midterm polls suggested some Americans might be frustrated with Democratic leadership, and analysts predicted a possible ""Republican wave,"" former Gov. Jim Edgar pronounced Kirk ""a Republican who can win in November.""\Even as a group of protesters heckled Kirk that warm July day, he stayed on course, speaking in the\crisp, fact-laden manner that he has trademarked.\It was all exactly as he'd planned. A military man, dependability and precision are key components of his persona characteristics he insists are the real thing even in the face of revelations that he had embellished his military record and despite a move away from that independence he says voters can count on.\Kirk, a self-described moderate previously endorsed by gay rights and abortion rights groups, has, since winning the Senate primary in February, voted the party line more often than not. Kirk sees no discrepancy. He says he's owned up to his mistakes, and is making votes as a moderate with an eye on fiscal responsibility.\During a speech last month in Northbrook, the 51-year-old Highland Park Republican touted the suburban legacy he'd established during the past decade. A legacy of moderate, independent leadership, he said.\""Together, we saved the North Chicago V.A. from closing,"" he said.\""We completed the double-tracking of Metra's North Central Line, relieving traffic congestion and improving our environment for communities in the North and Northwest suburbs. We helped fund the Northern Illinois Gang Taskforce and gave the Waukegan police the tools and federal backup they needed to crack down on gang leaders. We led the efforts to clean up Waukegan Harbor, restore the Great Lakes and promote cleaner, American energy sources to end our national dependence on foreign oil. ... Effective leadership. Responsive government. Promises made, promises kept.""\Born in Champaign, Kirk lived in Chatham and Downers Grove, before moving to Kenilworth in fifth grade, graduating from New Trier High School in 1977.\Childhood friend Bill Hartel remembers Kirk as ""studious. He would become interested in a topic, and learn everything we could about it.""\The pair regularly played the world-domination board game Risk and held root beer-tasting contests, and listened to Jim Croce and show tunes, Hartel said.\They also wrote and filmed a home science-fiction movie centered around the country's 1976 bicentennial, where ""everyone was buying souvenirs that were infected with this disease,"" he laughed.\Kirk says a near-drowning experience while sailboating on Lake Michigan at age 16 propelled his desire to pursue a career in public service.\But media reports this summer that questioned the details of that experience, including the level of hypothermia he suffered and how long he was waiting out in the water, stripped some of the shine off the tale of a life-changing experience.\Kirk attended Blackburn College in downstate Carlinville, spending a semester abroad at Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, before transferring to Cornell University, where he graduated in 1981.\He noted proudly during an ABC 7/League of Women Voters debate on Oct. 17 that he was an alum of the Mexican school though in reality, he spent only a semester there.\He attended graduate school overseas, at the London School of Economics, spending time working for the 1983 re-election of English Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and at an English private school before returning to the U.S., working for U.S. Rep John Porter and enrolling in Georgetown's law school at night.\When Kirk first announced his bid for Congress in 2000, U.S. Rep. Phil Crane predicted Kirk's experience as a member of Porter's staff would make him an independent legislator, following in Porter's footsteps with a record of leadership on environmental issues and fiscal responsibility.\""John has that kind of historical record that is valuable, but Mark has that record, too, by serving with John,"" Crane said.\Commissioned as a Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer in 1989, Kirk served during conflicts with Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and Bosnia, after which he was decorated with several prestigious awards.\While working at the Pentagon in 1998, he met future wife Kimberly Vertolli, also a Naval Intelligence Officer. Married for eight years, the pair divorced in June 2009.\This summer, Kirk's seemingly sparkling resume was tarnished when it became clear that he had added details that were not true.\He said he was the Navy's intelligence officer of the year, when, in fact, he was part of a team named for outstanding service. It also was revealed that he exaggerated claims of having commanded the Pentagon war room, served in the Gulf War, and come under enemy fire in Iraq.\Kirk has apologized repeatedly for those mistakes, though has been vague as to why he made them.\His opponent, Democrat Alexi Giannoulias, has been dogged by his own share of troubles this campaign the April collapse of his family's Chicago bank and subsequent reports of loans to organized crime by that bank.\As Kirk branded Giannoulias a ""mob banker,"" Giannoulias, in turn, has painted Kirk a ""serial liar"" whose exaggerations seep into his record as a public servant.\Kirk's campaign has called those attacks unfair, yet has spent millions on ads branding Giannoulias as a mob banker.\The exaggerations of his record have been difficult to shake for Kirk, especially as his moderate voting record also been called into question.\Kirk, in an editorial endorsement interview at the Daily Herald Oct. 7, showed a chart detailing members of Congress votes on a left-to-right spectrum. He pointed out that he falls in\the exact center, voting against his party to end subsidies for big oil, to cut student loan interest rates, and for stem cell research.\However, in recent months, Kirk has taken a majority of votes with his party voting against a small business lending bill, and teaching jobs legislation.\He said he wouldn't support cap and trade anti-pollution legislation though he'd previously voted for it, and lost the gay rights group the Human Rights Campaign's endorsement after voting against repealing the military's ""don't ask, Don't tell"" policy in May.\Responding to the criticism that he may be shifting further right since he announced his bid for Senate, he said, ""that's mainly the other side. In the firestorm of a campaign, both campaigns will try to push their (opponents) to the extreme. But my voting record is pretty clear,"" he said.\Kirk said he knew he was ""going to go through a firestorm of scrutiny"" as he campaigned.\""My job is to take it as an adult, to respond,"" he said. ""In the case of my military record, to apologize, and in the end submit to the judgment of the people."""
20,"Think outside the 'big box,' Wheaton\These 50-year rains seem to be happening quite frequently. When those rains happen, Wheaton's South Main Street seems to flood. Instead of putting a big box store at Main and Roosevelt where the decommissioned middle school is, the Wheaton City Council needs to consider converting that whole area into a park with some deep, large retention ponds.\Besides being able to help solve the chronic flood water issues, such a park would add charm and beauty. Converting that area to a big box retailer could worsen the flooding problem and would cheapen the gateway to downtown Wheaton.\Long ago, the city council wisely decided to stop the planned development of a flood-prone area on the Northwest side of Wheaton and instead converted it to the Lincoln Marsh. It's time for the current city council to think outside the ""big box"" and solve the water problem by converting the area near Main and Roosevelt to a nice park that would help solve the flooding problems.\Daniel C. Pearson\Wheaton\When all else fails to stir economy ... sue\Now that the Bush administration tax cuts are headed for extinction, we should be thinking of ways to make up for more of our money being taken and a likely continuing downturn in the economy as a result.\I could try and work more hours, but I in put in a lot already. So while I was looking at some satellite pictures I realized what I could do. I'll take the Democratic approach: I'll sue. If they pass cap and trade or the EPA acts out its threat to impose its own regulations, I'll sue the urbanites. See, I think they owe us money; I'm 10 times greener than almost all city dwellers. I have more trees, flowers, grass, my own well, a pond. Heck, I have over 50 indoor plants. Look at how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and pollution are produced in the concrete heat-producing urban areas where, you know, most liberals reside.\If I lose I'll just keep suing until I find, you know, a sympathetic judge who shares my newfound viewpoint for the environment. I know the city might sue me back for driving in there everyday, but this scheming, and pitting one group against another is sort of cool, it makes me feel like, you know, presidential.\Martin J.

Simply looking at the photo (one of millions to choose from) of Lance Armstrong, it suggests an expression of guilt. The title, ""Bracelet of shame"" supports that expression.\Might I suggest a more relaxed photo of Lance Armstrong, and the article title be: ""Bracelet or Shame?"" By allowing the reader only two choices, ""bracelet"" (suggesting innocence) or ""shame"" (suggesting guilt), would the Daily Herald be providing truly unbiased reporting.\Dwight Bouck\Wheaton"

URBANA - Americans can fight global warming and its causes, but they'll have to make some sacrifices to do so.
\
That was the gist of the message three experts delivered during a Wednesday discussion about global warming and the public policy necessary to fight it. The conversation took place at the University of Illinois' Beckman Institute, the sixth annual Craig S. Bazzani Lecture in Public Affairs. After experts gave 10-minute talks on their primary findings concerning global warming and the policies needed to regulate it, Moderator John Foreman and audience members questioned them about the subject. Foreman is the editor and publisher of The News-Gazette, Inc.
\
Paul Portney said he believes the price of energy - such as electricity produced in coal-fired plants or gasoline burning cars - should be increased dramatically in order to spur people to use cleaner, more environmentally friendly alternatives. That will limit the emission of greenhouse gases, he said, which could in turn combat global warming.
\
Portney is the dean of Eller College of Management at the University of Arizona and formerly a chief economist for the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
\
As gas prices rose from $2.50 to $4 a gallon over the last year and a half, a large number of people started biking, carpooling and using public transit, Portney said. He believes that regulation keeping non-renewable energy costs high will force changes toward conservation.
\
Likewise, the cost of developing technologies to replace those currently in use will also cost money.
\
""We simply have to spend more on research and development,"" Portney said.
\
Christine Ervin, the president of Christine Ervin/Company and former president and CEO of the Green Building Council, said changes must happen quickly. They have to happen on a large enough scale to make a difference, and they shouldn't merely shifting the problem to a new area, she said. Speed is of the essence, because the longer it takes for public policy to address global warming, the more damage global warming will do, and the more money it will cost to repair.
\
Chester ""Chet"" Gardner, special assistant to UI President B. Joseph White for Global Campus and an engineer who has studied atmospheric dynamics and global climate change, believes environmentally sound technology must be demonstrated and then put to use all over the world. He cited the stalled-for-now FutureGen low-emissions coal plant project originally slated for Mattoon as one way this could be done.
\
Another way to spur change could be with the cap and trade system, which basically puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions, the experts said. It requires those emitting greenhouse gases to buy permits for the amount of carbon they emit. Regulatory bodies could decrease the number of permits sold, therefore capping the amount of emissions. For businesses that find limiting emissions too expensive, trading or buying permits from those who are able to cut down on emissions is possible.
\
Portney admitted, after an audience question about the feasibility of cap and trade, that the system would have to find a way of accurately measuring emissions to verify their benefit to the environment.
\
Ervin said she believes changes can be made to combat global warming through incorporating sustainable practices in building codes everywhere.

23,"Republicans are trying to sell the false premise that protecting the environment inevitably means sacrificing jobs. President Obama should denounce this snake oil for what it is -- rather than appear to accept it.\The GOP presidential candidates are in remarkable agreement on two articles of faith: The human imagination, apparently, is incapable of conjuring any circumstance under which any tax may ever be raised. And the Environmental Protection Agency is a sinister laboratory where Birkenstock-shod evildoers conjure regulations purposefully designed to rob Americans of their God-given jobs.\Actually, I'm being somewhat unfair to Mitt Romney, who tempers his EPA-bashing with the admission that he supports the agency ""in much of its mission."" When he was governor of Massachusetts, Romney favored initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, perhaps even a regional cap-and-trade system. He doesn't bring this up much on the campaign trail, but his opponents do.\The other contenders range from anti-EPA all the way to ... well, to Michele Bachmann's pledge to abolish the agency. At the GOP debate in New Hampshire, Bachmann added that ""there is no other agency like the EPA. It should really be renamed the Job-Killing Organization of America."" Newt Gingrich agrees that the EPA -- established in 1970 by that noted tree-hugger, Richard Nixon -- should be dismantled.\Rick Perry has an actual record as an EPA-basher, having taken the agency to court in an effort to block rules on greenhouse gas emissions. Ron Paul says most environmental questions should be resolved through the courts. Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman take the orthodox position: that any new environmental regulations should be put on hold because enacting them would kill jobs.\On Friday, Obama appeared to cede the point. He blocked new EPA rules limiting ground-level ozone -- otherwise known as smog -- as part of a larger effort to reduce ""regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty"" for U.S. businesses. The move came hours after a disappointing labor report showing that the economy added no new jobs in August.\The move to block the ozone rules may make sense politically, since it defuses an issue on which Republicans were prepared to hammer Obama and the Democrats all year. As a matter of public policy, however, it's wrong.\In developing the rule that Obama nixed, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was simply fulfilling the agency's prime mission: protecting human health. ""Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation and congestion,"" says the agency's website. ""It can worsen bronchitis, emphysema and asthma.""\As for the predictions of massive job losses, they sound just like the warnings we heard when environmental regulations ended acid rain, or ensured that the citizens of Cleveland no longer had to worry about the Cuyahoga River catching fire.\There is plenty of evidence that the net effect of smart environmental regulation is to create jobs, not destroy them. New, more efficient plants are built; older, dirtier facilities are retrofitted. Companies innovate by developing new technology -- ultimately making U.S. industry more competitive. And everyone is a little healthier.\As Jackson noted in a statement, the Obama administration has made great strides in limiting such atmospheric pollutants as sulfur dioxide and mercury. Not every conceivable environmental regulation makes sense. But the ozone rule seemed well-grounded, and the objections to it were more political than rational.\We don't have to choose between jobs and health. History demonstrates we can have both."
24,"Keep downtown\Wheaton viable\I have always felt that Wheaton was like Grovers Corners in ""Our Town"" by Thornton Wilder. People grow up here, work here, raise their children and grow old here. It is a very special place to me.\I am a walker, so I get around and look at houses and stores and get to know the shop keepers, the city workers and my neighbors. We have a very friendly and nice downtown with some lovely shops run by some very special people who are there to offer you their wares and their friendship and their comfortable surroundings to make you happy and feel good.\They also are trying to make a living at the same time. They need us to shop in their stores, to support their events, and to look to them first when needing a purchase. These are hard times; we all know that. But our neighborhood shops wont make it without our help. We want a viable downtown, and we will have that if we support our local business people. Shop Wheaton.\Mary W. Landreth\Wheaton\ComEd employees like trees, too\ComEd is committed to providing safe, reliable and affordable electricity. We believe providing this critical service something often only noticed when unavailable can go hand-in-hand with our natural environment.\ComEd is required by state and federal government regulations to maintain clearances around and beneath our electric lines to minimize the possibility of a major power outage, such as the 2003 East Coast blackout that affected 45 million people in eight states.\Tree contact is a leading cause of power outages on the ComEd system. Tree contact on distribution lines, those that serve neighborhoods with power, can cause outages that affect thousands of people. And a single tree-related incident involving a high-voltage transmission line could knock out power to millions of Chicagoland homes and businesses. ComEds vegetation management program is designed to avoid such occurrences, thereby protecting the delivery of electricity to customers.\Recently, ComEd presented a plan to private citizens and representatives from the DuPage County Trail Maintenance Task Force and Forest Preserve District of DuPage County. This plan balances the interests of all parties and property owners, including ComEd, while highlighting the restoration of native prairie plants along portions of the trail system.\Throughout ComEds 11,400 square-mile service territory, our professional crews follow industry-best practices as well as Environmental Protection Agency and Illinois Department of Agriculture directives when conducting vegetation management activity. In many cases, ComEds practices and procedures, including targeted, low-volume use of approved herbicides, are consistent with those of the communities we are privileged to serve.\Like our customers, ComEd employees appreciate the value of wooded communities and the aesthetics and pleasure that plant life provides. But we also take very seriously our obligation to provide reliable electricity, which is essential to economic development, modern society and the quality of life for our 3.8 million customers.\Craig Chesley\ComEd vegetation management manager\Scientists do not agree on warming\Im sorry if I offend you, but anyone who thinks there is irrefutable evidence that humans are causing climate change is ignoring a ton of recent scientific counter-evidence.\Many studies conducted by reputable scientists show that: The earth has not warmed in the past several years; natural fluctuations in the earths temperature are highly correlated with sun activity and several other factors; increases in CO2 actually follow periods of increasing global temperature; man-made CO2 accounts for 0.123% of total greenhouse gases.\So, if we reduce man-made CO2 by 50 percent, then we will reduce greenhouse gases by a whopping 0.0615 percent to possibly address a problem that may not even exist. Doesnt that seem like detonating all the nukes in the world to eliminate the mosquito that just bit me in the arm?\There is only one logical conclusion if you consider all the currently available evidence there is no consensus, and the scientific community is not yet capable of drawing any irrefutable conclusions. It is totally irresponsible for world leaders to succumb to the political rhetoric surrounding the Copenhagen treaty, or for our government to enact the so-called ""cap and trade"" legislation.\Roger Willis\Naperville\EPA needs to crack down on emitters\Despite near-unanimous consensus among scientists that global warming is a man-made disaster closing in on us faster than predicted, the U.S. government has been slow to adopt new policies, technologies or laws.\Comprehensive federal legislation is slowly emerging from the partisan debates but no end is in sight for a climate bill with enough teeth to take a bite out of the U.S.s 25 percent share of global warming pollution.\The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is stepping up to the challenge with proposed regulation of large producers of carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act. It requires all new major emitting facilities to use the best available control technology for emissions. This is a proven approach and has been successful with other types of air pollution. By focusing on the largest sources of global warming pollution, the EPA is making the best use of available resources.\The EPA must use its authority to put the strongest regulations possible on carbon from the largest emitters. Climate change science is calling for action now and the planet, its people, plants and animals are relying on the EPA to hear the call.\Lonnie Morris\Chairman, River Prairie Group, Illinois Sierra Club\Lombard\Pray for no\socialist takeover\On Saturday, Nov. 7, one Republican voted for HR 3962. That is not a bipartisan majority. The bill passed by a very slim margin and against the wishes of the majority of American people.\This bill will only increase the debt we are piling on our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, it does not cover all uninsured and takes away our freedom of choice. This bill would go a long way to rationing health care and extending the governments control into our personal lives.\We do not need more government in our lives, we need less. A ""Nanny State"" or a communist, socialist state does nothing to improve the economy or peoples lives. Just do a little research. Look at Russia and Cuba for starters. I, for one, do not want to live in that kind of society! We need to thank the representatives who had the moral courage to stand against the pressure of the administration and vote no.\The American people are starting to wake up to the socialist takeover of our government, and I pray that we will not allow that to happen.\Mary Miles\Lisle\Follow veterinarians on health care bill\Please do not support health care bill HR 3962. The size of it is unmanageable. There is no proper way of giving health care to everyone equally.\Medicine is a professional service just like any other ""trade."" There is nothing wrong with shopping around for the lowest price for everything, starting with the office call and continue on from there. It is well worth shopping around to get the best price.\Different hospitals have different prices for the same procedures. It is really in the best interest of commerce to keep this professional service away from federal regulations.\Hospitals should compete for the best price. The veterinary medicine industry has this under control. Follow their lead and do not support the bill.\Mickey Pauly\Roselle"
25,"From all appearances, Earl Pomeroy was the wrong guy at the wrong place in the wrong year -- with the wrong message to deliver.\""Sometimes you look at Washington and only negative things come to mind,"" Pomeroy said in a speech to a coal executives last week. ""I want to give you some positive thoughts.""\Coming from a nine-term Democratic congressman in conservative North Dakota, kind words about Washington would seem to be political suicide. All things considered, Pomeroy should be a goner -- and he may yet lose in November, when Republicans are expected to win dozens of Democrat-held seats.\But polls show him in a competitive race against challenger Rick Berg.\""We're still in this race,"" Pomeroy said.\Here, as well as in other pockets of the country, House Democrats in conservative-leaning districts have dug in, fought back and begun to reverse declining poll numbers and poor favorability ratings, developing what they believe are winning messages in a hostile political environment.\Cumulatively, their efforts could blunt some of the predicted GOP gains next month, Democrats hope, showing that even a powerful wave can run up against break walls.\""They've been able to get voters to focus on their own record, on how they're different from the national party,"" said Nathan Gonzales, an analyst for The Rothenberg Political Report.\The Dakotas, with a base of conservative, white voters inherently distrustful of the federal government, would seem an unlikely proving ground for Democratic hopes. But along with Pomeroy, Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin of South Dakota, another incumbent, now appears to have the wind at her back.\Other Democratic incumbents, such as Reps. Scott Murphy and Michael Arcuri in upstate New York and Dina Titus in Las Vegas, are first-termers who have shown staying power by staying locked on economic issues.\Elsewhere, lawmakers such as Reps. Bobby Bright of Alabama and Joe Donnelly of Indiana have distanced themselves from President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at every opportunity in a bid to woo independents. Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia, a 28-year veteran from coal country, is leading in his race despite taking an unpopular stand in favor of the so-called cap-and-trade climate bill.\Still others, such as Reps. Walt Minnick of Idaho and Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, appear to have an edge because they drew a tea party challenger instead of a more mainstream Republican, allowing them to capture support from moderate voters.\Murphy won a special election in 2009 in a moderate district in upstate New York -- and then voted for both the cap-and-trade bill and the health care overhaul, which, according to the prevailing narrative of this election, should have doomed him.\Instead, Murphy is pulling away from his GOP challenger, Chris Gibson. A former venture capitalist, Murphy has focused on job creation. And like almost every Democrat in a difficult race, he's emphasized his independence from his party.\""Scott's background as a businessman gives him credibility on today's No. 1 issue, the economy,"" said spokesman Josh Schwerin, adding that Murphy visited all 137 towns in the district in his first year.\Murphy also has raised more than $5 million.\Indeed, many Democrats who are remaining competitive are doing so because they have the financial resources to combat not only their local GOP adversary but money from national third-party groups, which are spending millions this year pummeling Democrats on the airwaves.\For Boucher, a possible path to victory means pointing to his history of aiding economic development in his southwestern Virginia district, talking up his anti-health-care vote and deflecting criticism over the climate bill.\""It's not going to be a (Republican) wave. I've seen no signs of it,"" he said.\A year ago, that prediction would have seemed almost heretical. The same would be true for Herseth Sandlin, who was down in the polls to charismatic challenger Kristi Noem.\Herseth Sandlin, a moderate endorsed the National Rifle Association and who voted against both the health care and climate bills, has been painted by Noem as someone who hasn't done enough to rein in federal spending.\""She has not been a leader for South Dakota,"" says Noem. ""There's bad legislation that passed that needed to be stopped. She could have helped with that.""\But Noem has been upended by a different kind of local issue: her driving record. She's racked up a bevy of speeding tickets.\Herseth Sandlin, like Pomeroy, has benefited from the relatively strong economy in the Dakotas, which perhaps has put voters in a more forgiving mood.\Still, even if Democrats manage to stem their losses, with more than 70 seats in play, the GOP could easily secure the 40 it needs to regain control of the House.\But it that does not happen, races such as the one between Herseth Sandlin and Noem likely will be the reason.\Either way, said Noem, it's ""going to be a very tight, tough race.""\------------\joliphant@tribune.com\Credit: By James Oliphant, Tribune Washington Bureau"
26," Environmentalists always said there would be a price to pay for all the carbon dioxide being spewed into the atmosphere. Well, now there is.\ While prized resources such as oil, gold and wheat have been traded for decades, there is a budding market for one of the industrialized world's abundant but unwanted byproducts: carbon dioxide, a gas produced when fossil fuels are burned and which many scientists believe causes global warming.\ If it succeeds, the new market for carbon emissions will reward businesses that minimize their output of this ""greenhouse"" gas. It will also benefit the environment and thereby prove, advocates say, that making green and being green are compatible goals.\ ""It's a sign of things to come,"" said Luis Martinez, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\ The only mandatory carbon emissions trading program is in Europe. It was created in conjunction with an international treaty on climate change--the Kyoto Protocol--that goes into effect Feb. 16 and caps the amount of carbon dioxide that power plants and fuel- intensive manufacturers in more than two dozen countries are allowed to emit.\ A similar program is scheduled to begin in 2008 in Canada, which also signed Kyoto.\ By contrast, the United States, one of the few industrialized countries that did not ratify Kyoto, is many years away from compulsory trading or nationwide caps on carbon dioxide, concepts that are strongly opposed by industry and the Bush administration.\ However, nine Eastern states are developing a regional cap-and- trade program that will require large power plants from Maine to Delaware to reduce their carbon emissions, and California is attempting to place greenhouse gas limits on automakers. Separately, a small group of companies has voluntarily agreed to cap their carbon emissions in the United States as part of an experimental market that is based in Chicago.\ ""We believe that at some point in the United States there will be mandatory legislation,"" said Bruce Braine, vice president of strategic policy analysis at American Electric Power Co., a large power producer and one of the founding members of the Chicago Climate Exchange, or CCX. Other members include chemicals giant DuPont Co., computer manufacturer IBM and electronics maker Motorola Inc.\ Under the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme some 12,000 industrial plants will be granted a limited number of emissions allowances, or credits, equaling the amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit. Companies that exceed their limits must purchase credits to cover the difference, while those that produce less carbon dioxide than they are legally permitted can sell surplus credits for a profit.\ Companies can trade directly with each other or through exchanges located throughout Europe.\ By giving the private sector a financial incentive to make their operations more environmentally friendly, proponents believe, the market-based approach will accelerate investment in emissions- reduction equipment, create positive reinforcement from investors and spur technological innovation.\ ""We're confident that once people get used to managing carbon in their businesses it will be successful,"" said David Hone, climate change adviser at Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which has 46 facilities across Europe that will be regulated under the cap-and-trade system.\ Hone said his optimism is based in part on the success of the cap- and-trade system the United States designed more than a decade ago to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, which cause acid rain.\ The U.S. sulfur dioxide market, on which the EU's carbon market is based, is widely praised for accelerating emissions reductions at a lower cost than originally anticipated by industry.\ But environmentalists and executives said there is much more at stake when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions, both in terms of the ecological benefits and the potential costs to industry.\ ""The main concern of environmentalists is that the governments have been too generous in how many allowances they've given out,"" said Andrew Nind, principal consultant at Ilex Energy Consulting of Oxford, England.\ The lower the price, the less incentive there is to invest in equipment that reduces emissions, he said.\ In the United States, carbon-intensive industries successfully lobbied against Kyoto by minimizing the threat of global warming itself, and by arguing that the treaty would hurt the global competitiveness of American companies and cause electricity prices to rise.\ ""There are some notable exceptions, but on the whole it remains an ongoing battle to try to convince corporate America to deal with greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Ethan Podell of Orbis Energy, which advises companies seeking to devise long-range strategies on carbon emissions.\ U.S.-based companies that are already engaged in the issue-- either because they have factories in Europe or are part of CCX-- believe early involvement could pay off down the line, in large part due to the logistical expertise they are gaining.\ CCX participants agreed beginning in 2003 to cut their carbon emissions by 1 percent per year through 2006, or 4 percent below their baseline, which is determined by their average annual emissions from 1998 through 2001.\ There is virtually no chance of federal limits on carbon emissions under the Bush administration, which is openly skeptical of the threat global warming poses. But U.S. executives anticipate a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide, at least at the state level, within the next decade."
27,"Burning enough coal to power a city of 200,000 people, Alcoa's Warrick Operations aluminum smelting plant in southwestern Indiana is exactly the kind of energy hog that could face heavy fines under President Barack Obama's plan for combating global warming.\Yet Alcoa executives and other big users of coal are pushing Congress to pass a version of the plan. The reason? With the right tweaks, they say, Obama's plan could not only help the environment but boost their profits as well.\""If we act wisely and swiftly,"" an Alcoa official told a House committee last month, global warming legislation ""will assist in restoring growth and provide the means for America to be the global leader in low-carbon technology.""\In getting behind at least the broad outlines of climate legislation, corporations such as Alcoa are mirroring the strategy of their counterparts in the health and pharmaceutical industries that have joined the push for health-care reform: Having concluded that some government action is likely whatever they do, corporate strategists have decided they might fare better being at the table when decisions are made.\""Increasingly, industry leaders in both areas have come to the realization that a solution has to be found to both our energy and health problems,"" said Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), a top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee who co-authored the House version of Obama's climate plan. ""Many leaders in both areas are willing to break out of what has been conventional wisdom, and as a result, we've been able to build coalitions of CEOs.""\Not everyone in the business world is onboard. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, is playing a lead role in fighting Obama's climate plan, warning that the fines and fees envisioned will raise the cost of doing business too high and make U.S. companies vulnerable to foreign competition.\But the Democrats have won growing corporate support, in part by giving business interests the kinds of concessions that anger some environmentalists in their own party.\Obama will need that backing to win over swing votes from members of Congress in manufacturing and coal- and oil-producing states. Those states almost certainly would face higher costs under the so-called cap-and-trade system Obama wants to create.\""There are two issues to get the bill passed,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). ""One is the states that are heavily dependent on coal need some relief if their energy bills spike, which they will.\""The other is, how do you deal with manufacturing?""\Alcoa's aluminum operations across the United States, for example, generated 23 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2007. Obama wants to require emitters to purchase permits to release emissions. The cost-per-ton of emissions permits hasn't been determined yet, but if it starts around $20 -- which falls in the middle of recent EPA projections -- then cap-and-trade might add $460 million a year to Alcoa's annual operating costs.\Under an approach favored by industry, the government could soften the blow considerably by giving Alcoa nearly enough free permits in the early years of the cap-and-trade-system to cover its current emissions.\The company already has cut emissions by one-third since the 1990s. If it continued to reduce emissions while keeping its full quota of free permits, it would reach a point where it had surplus permits that it could sell to other emitters, raising money to help pay for the improved technology.\In effect, a cap-and-trade system designed that way would stimulate the drive to reduce emissions, advocates say.\And Alcoa officials see another benefit: Government pressure for cleaner air would increase demand for lighter cars and more efficient buildings, boosting the market for aluminum.\Such an approach would require Obama to modify his original proposal, which called for using revenue from permit sales to help finance health-care reform and tax cuts for the middle class. The White House has signaled its willingness to compromise.\So have Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee -- including members from coal and manufacturing states -- who announced agreement on the outlines of such legislation earlier this month.\Given the troubled economy and U.S. companies' vulnerability to foreign competitors with lower costs, many analysts have been skeptical about the chances of moving ahead this year.\But companies such as Alcoa and Duke Energy, the nation's largest producer of electricity generated by burning coal, have been marshaling votes on Capitol Hill, working behind the scenes and providing what House leaders call a ""blueprint"" for compromise.\Beyond political strategy, Alcoa executives say, scientific evidence has convinced them that carbon dioxide and other emissions contribute to global warming.\Many also have concluded that the more energy-efficient world Obama envisions might raise demand for aluminum, environmentally friendly forms of electric power and other products.\The potential stumbling block is cost.\Any warming legislation that boosts fossil-fuel prices ""is going to have some costs,"" said Meg McDonald, Alcoa's director of global issues. How much it costs companies like hers, she added, ""is dependent on the fine details.""\-----------\jtankersley@tribune.com\The Swamp is never dry: For a local take on national politics, visit chicagotribune.com/swamp\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, WASHINGTON BUREAU"
28," Daring to go where the U.S. government hasn't, a group of industrial giants announced Thursday they will voluntarily reduce and trade greenhouse gas emissions, which are currently unregulated but linked to global warming.\ The Chicago Climate Exchange, the first attempt in the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gases with a market-based solution, will allow participants to swap the right to pollute in a four-year pilot project.\ The electronic trading scheme involves a baseline pollution limit- -a certain number of tons of six greenhouse gases that each company can put into the air--and allows members that cut emissions below the baseline to sell credits to firms that can't meet the mark.\ The central idea behind the system, known as a cap and trade program, is not new. It is used worldwide and was employed by the Environmental Protection Agency beginning in 1990 to control sulfur dioxide levels. What makes the Chicago Climate Exchange unusual is that participation is strictly voluntary, and there is currently no government involvement.\ The big industrial corporations include DuPont, Ford Motor Co., Motorola and American Electric Power--the largest power supplier and the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the nation. They were joined by the City of Chicago and other companies, including Waste Management Inc. and Baxter International Inc.\ Many joined for the chance to experiment with cost-effective ways of reducing emissions before they are forced to do so by future laws. Some overseas markets, including Europe, are developing a cap and trade system for greenhouse gases, as permitted by the Kyoto Protocol, to thwart climate change. Britain and Denmark are already trading on a small scale.\ For some companies, who might be able to cut emissions and resell their credits at a higher price, the incentive is profit. Others said they want to show their shareholders, customers and investors that they are concerned about environmental issues.\ ""There's a growing passion that markets lend themselves to solving social and environmental problems,"" said Chicago Climate Exchange CEO Richard Sandor, a former economist with the Chicago Board of Trade, called by some the ""father of financial futures."" ""We all believe energy efficiency is good business. We're trying to build and inform the debate to give companies a vehicle to test cut and trade.""\ Carbon dioxide, one of the leading greenhouse gases, is produced when fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal are burned to drive cars, warm homes and light offices. Electricity generation and transportation are the two largest contributors of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.\ The 1997 Kyoto pact established that developed nations would have until 2012 to cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 5 percent from 1990 levels. The U.S., which is responsible for about 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, pulled out after President Bush said the cuts would hurt the U.S. economy.\ Though the Bush administration supports emissions trading efforts, it hasn't developed one for greenhouse gases and is instead relying on a voluntary emissions reduction. Under that policy, U.S. emissions are expected to grow by 12 percent by 2012, according to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.\ The concern is over the mounting evidence that rising global temperatures are caused by greenhouse gases and will increasingly cause extreme droughts and storms and alter ecosystems.\ ""Virtually all industrialized nations have now committed themselves to reducing their greenhouse gases,"" Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said in congressional testimony last week. ""Most view emissions trading as an essential component of their climate change strategies.""\ In a Senate hearing last week, Republican John McCain and Democrat Joe Lieberman called for a cap and trade system through a government-provided Greenhouse Gas Database, which would contain an inventory of emissions and a registry of reductions.\ The group Environmental Defense supports the notion, saying its better than traditional bureaucratic approaches. Others point to the cap and trade program of sulfur dioxide emissions, which create acid rain. The program, which Sander helped design, reduced emissions by more than 30 percent from 1990 levels and cost industry 20 percent of what the government originally estimated, according to the EPA.\ But a report commissioned by the Clean Air Trust said that while emissions fell nationwide, trading programs allowed them to increase in certain states, a threat to local health.\ ""The record is very clear that emission trading has been a complete failure when attempted as a way to meet clean air health standards at the local level--as it has in Southern California, New Jersey and Michigan,"" said Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust.\ The 14 founding Chicago Climate Exchange members produce about 270 million tons of six different greenhouse gases. They have agreed to reduce or offset their greenhouse gas emissions by 1 percent below baseline for 2003 through 2006. By 2006 the companies are expected to be 4 percent below the baseline target.\ Trading, which will be electronic, is targeted to begin by spring. Like other commodities, the price will be determined by the buyer and seller. Violators will undergo the same peer reviewed system as other capital markets.\ Chicago agreed to participate as part of the city's goal to become the ""greenest city in America,"" said city Environment Commissioner Marcia Jimenez. Ten percent of Chicago's energy comes from renewable sources, and the city wants to improve on that by retrofitting city buildings and making sure they're cost efficient, Jimenez said."
29,"In the 1970s and early '80s, having seized control of the United Nations apparatus (by power of numbers), Third World countries decided to cash in. OPEC was pulling off the greatest wealth transfer from rich to poor in history. Why not them? So in grand U.N. declarations and conferences, they began calling for a ""New International Economic Order."" The NIEO's essential demand was simple: to transfer fantastic chunks of wealth from the industrialized West to the Third World.\On what grounds?\In the name of equality -- wealth redistribution via global socialism -- with a dose of post-colonial reparations thrown in.\The idea of essentially taxing hard-working citizens of the democracies in order to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies went nowhere, thanks mainly to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (and the debt crisis of the early '80s). They put a stake through the enterprise.\But such dreams never die.\The raid on the Western treasuries is on again, but today with a new rationale to fit current ideological fashion. With socialism dead, the gigantic heist is now proposed as a sacred service of the newest religion: environmentalism.\One of the major goals of the Copenhagen climate summit is another NIEO shakedown: the transfer of hundreds of billions from the industrial West to the Third World to save the planet by, for example, planting green industries in the tristes tropiques.\Politically it's an idea of genius, engaging at once every left-wing erogenous zone: rich man's guilt, post-colonial guilt, environmental guilt. But the idea of shaking down the industrial democracies in the name of the environment thrives not just in the refined internationalist precincts of Copenhagen. It thrives on the national scale, too.\On the day Copenhagen opened, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over the regulation of carbon emissions by declaring them an ""endangerment"" to human health.\Since we operate an overwhelmingly carbon-based economy, the EPA will be regulating practically everything. No institution that emits more than 250 tons of CO(-2) a year will fall outside EPA control. This means more than a million building complexes, hospitals, plants, schools, businesses and similar enterprises. (The EPA proposes regulating emissions only above 25,000 tons, but it has no such authority.)\This naked assertion of vast executive power in the name of the environment is the perfect fulfillment of the prediction of Czech President (and economist) Vaclav Klaus that environmentalism is becoming the new socialism, i.e., the totemic ideal in the name of which government seizes the commanding heights of the economy and society.\Socialism having failed so spectacularly, the left was adrift until it struck upon a brilliant gambit: metamorphosis from red to green. The cultural elites went straight from the memorial service for socialism to the altar of the environment. The objective is the same: highly centralized power given to the best and the brightest, the new class of experts, managers and technocrats. This time, however, the alleged justification is not abolishing oppression and inequality but saving the planet.\Not everyone is pleased with the coming New Carbon-Free International Order. When the Obama administration signaled (in a gesture to Copenhagen) a U.S. commitment to major cuts in carbon emissions, Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote the president protesting that he lacks the authority to do so unilaterally. That requires congressional concurrence by legislation or treaty.\With the Senate blocking President Barack Obama's cap-and-trade carbon legislation, the EPA coup d'etat served as the administration's loud response to Webb: The hell we can't. With this EPA ""endangerment"" finding, we can do as we wish with carbon. Either the Senate passes cap-and-trade, or the EPA will impose even more draconian measures: all cap, no trade.\Forget for a moment the economic effects of severe carbon chastity. There's the matter of constitutional decency. If you want to revolutionize society -- as will drastic carbon regulation and taxation in an energy economy that is 85 percent carbon-based -- you do it through Congress reflecting popular will. Not by administrative fiat of EPA bureaucrats.\Congress should not just resist this executive overreaching, but trump it: Amend existing clean air laws and restore their original intent by excluding CO(-2) from EPA control and reserving that power for Congress and future legislation.\Do it now. Do it soon. Because Big Brother isn't lurking in CIA cloak. He's knocking on your door, smiling under an EPA cap.\----------\letters@charleskrauthammer.com\Credit: By Charles Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist based in Washington: Washington Post Writers Group"

It helps with climate change and builds our economy.""\Jennifer Zordani\As clean energy ramps up, there still will be times when its production is inconsistent, said Zordani, a 53-year-old regulatory and financial services attorney from Clarendon Hills.\""With the growth in technology,"" she said, ""we're going to need ever-increasing energy supplies.""\To buffer against clean energy gaps, she said, the country should connect sources like wind and solar power to the same grid as fossil fuels. This would boost the economy, help utility companies meet consumer needs and help ""end users build new infrastructure and plan for the future,"" Zordani said.\Carole Cheney\Working for 11th District U.S. Rep. Bill Foster, a former physicist, Cheney said she learned to ""stand up for science and rationality,"" both of which she said are necessary in climate change discussions.\""We already are seeing the negative impact of mankind's actions on our environment,"" she said in a written statement. ""We must become less reliant on fossil fuels by expanding the use of renewable energy sources and working to build a clean energy economy.""\Cheney said she supports an end to subsidies for fossil fuel companies and opposes what she calls ""dangerous pipeline proposals.""\Amanda Howland\Training workers to fit the eco-friendly industries of the future, such as wind and solar energy or robotics, is one environmental action Howland said she supports.\""We need to train people to take over these jobs, and that's going to help the environment,"" she said.\The nation also should follow the example of the College of Lake County, where Howland, a 65-year-old Lake Zurich attorney, serves as a trustee. She said the college is constructing buildings to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards and has installed a geothermal field to help with heating and cooling.\Becky Anderson Wilkins\Increasing investment in clean energy infrastructure is one way the government can address the ""global crisis"" of climate change, said Anderson Wilkins, a 59-year-old bookstore owner and Naperville City Council member.\""Such investments reduce our carbon footprint, employ skilled labor in jobs of the future and bring much-needed repair and modernization to our current system,"" she said in a written statement.\Money from fossil fuel companies, however, prevents progress on climate-related investments, Anderson Wilkins said. She has said her campaign plans not to take any contributions from what she calls ""special interests.""\Credit: By Marie Wilson mwilson@dailyherald.com"

In a recent guest commentary, Urbana Alderman Charlie Smyth mentioned a carbon tax or tradable carbon credits would be good ways to reduce greenhouse emissions and better for raising revenue. I agree. But from talking with people, I have the impression that few know what these ideas mean.
\
It will cost everyone far more to let the environment degrade than to take simple steps to reduce carbon emissions, like using fluorescent bulbs and public transportation. However, real progress requires bigger shifts in energy use that only the government can organize.
\
A carbon tax is the simplest way to provide incentives to switch from carbon-dioxide-emitting technologies to less harmful ones. It would be based directly on the actual net environmental harm produced by different activities, and any way to reduce carbon emissions would be fairly rewarded. The revenues collected could be used to reduce income taxes.
\
Carbon taxes would be simple to collect because nearly all carbon emissions involve centralized points - like oil refineries or power plants - where the carbon flowing through can be measured.
\
Some countries use a ""cap and trade"" carbon credit system. Credits allowing institutions like power plants to emit carbon dioxide are issued, and then can be bought and sold on an open market. This provides incentives to reduce carbon use in order to sell credits.
\
One drawback of the standard cap-and-trade system is that it initially provides no incentives to reduce carbon emissions, and even rewards major polluters. The main advantage of the cap-and- trade system is political: It buys off the big polluters who otherwise tend to fight clean-air measures.
\
One way or another we have to get started on these changes soon. Now is the time to start.

34,"Some questions and answers about the energy and environment bill pending in the House:\Q. What's the purpose of this legislation?\A. To reduce the gases linked to global warming and to force power sources away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner sources such as wind, solar and geothermal.\Q. How does the bill accomplish this?\A. By placing nationwide limits on emissions of heat-trapping gases from major sources like power plants, refineries and factories. This limit effectively puts a price on the pollution, giving companies an incentive to seek cleaner alternatives.\Q. How does this ""cap-and-trade"" system work?\A. Companies with facilities covered by pollution limits -- the cap -- would receive permits to continue producing gases, an annual pollution allowance. This bill would initially give the bulk of the permits away. Companies that don't get a big enough allowance to cover their pollution would either have to reduce it or buy additional permits from companies that have reduced pollution and have allowances left over. That's the trade. Polluters also have a third choice: They can invest in pollution reductions made elsewhere, such as at farms that capture methane or plant trees. These are known as offsets.\Q. So the idea is to try to reduce the overall level of pollution, not necessarily emissions from a particular factory?\A. That's true in the beginning. But as the cap gets lower and lower -- reaching an 83 percent reduction by 2050 -- eventually all polluters would have to reduce.\Q. Who opposes this approach, and why?\A. Republicans, some farm groups, some environmentalists, the oil industry -- which feels it has not gotten enough free permits -- and some moderate Democrats. They are all worried about the cost and the loss of jobs if industries move to countries without controls. Recent analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office show that the rules would eventually cost the average household an extra $175 a year.\Q. Beyond potential consumer costs, how would this affect most Americans?\A. It would fundamentally change how we use, produce and consume energy, from gas-guzzling cars to our insatiable appetite for cheap electricity.\Credit: By Dina Cappiello and Eric Carvin, Associated Press"
35,"Senate should reject cap-and-trade bill\We are encouraging all citizens to urge U.S. senators to vote ""no"" on the cap-and-trade legislation - HR 2454 - that has been approved in the House of Representatives and is pending in the U.S. Senate. \The bill is supposed to reduce global warming. But there is evidence that it would have minimal effect on the climate while driving up energy costs for everyone. \If this bill is approved, prices would increase for gasoline, diesel and fertilizer. \The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that production costs for farmers in Illinois would increase by $515 million per year by 2020. That's an additional $34.50 per acre of corn and $9.91 per acre of soybeans that we will be unable to recapture. \The Energy Information Administration reports that the bill will boost electric rates 25 percent by 2025. EIA also reports that gasoline will increase by 25 cents per gallon by 2020. This will mean higher costs for all consumers. \The goal of the bill is to decrease use of coal and other fossil fuels. But as a nation, we do not yet have the nuclear, solar, wind and other alternative energies to replace coal. \We are urging our U.S. senators to vote against the cap-and-trade legislation and instead create comprehensive energy solutions that will benefit the environment, the country and its individual citizens. \Dennis Haab \Rural Forrest\Scott Hoeft\Rural Bloomington\The writers are, respectively, presidents of the Livingston County and McLean County farm bureaus.\Restore aid to students; they are our future \We also want to thank Illinois Wesleyan University for its presence at the Illinois Student Assistance Commission hearing. \Our grandson was awarded an Illinois MAP (Monetary Award Program) Grant. He and the other college students in Illinois will have a hard time if this funding is lost. \Our lawmakers must restore this funding. These students are our future. We must not let them down! \Robert and Simone Jones \Lexington\Will pay hikes follow higher license fees?\I read the article about our state's new hike on drivers' licenses and license plates - both jumping $20 a piece. They didn't hesitate and boldly announced it. \Justification? Well, there probably isn't a legitimate one, but since they were so non-hesitant in introducing the raise, I wonder if they will non-hesitantly produce pay hikes for their employees.\Wiley Ayers \Clinton\Report more instances where guns foil crimes\Guns defend and protect. \Why is it the mainstream media seldom if ever reports where a crime has been thwarted when a law-abiding citizen has defended himself or property by possessing a handgun or gun? It's not because it seldom happens because there are thousands of stories where it happens on a daily basis. \There are approximately two million defensive gun uses per year by law-abiding citizens. \That was one of the findings in a national survey conducted by Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist in 1993. \It's time for the media to report the good since they are quick to point out when a gun is used in committing a crime against others.\There's also the question of crime increasing in areas where strict gun laws are enacted or guns are banned entirely. I think Australia is one example of this. \We are in need of conceal carry and open carry in Illinois.\Ron Hall \Mackinaw"
36," Hard to believe in the heart of a polar Chicago winter, but the planet is warming. That, many scientists have warned, is likely to be a problem in the future. The question is: what, if anything, should we do about it now?\ The Bush administration has set voluntary goals for reducing emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, which have been linked to global warming. And officials reportedly are collecting written pledges from various companies around the country to voluntarily curb emissions.\ There's nothing wrong with voluntary goals, but the potential threat of global warming demands far tougher measures. A better course of action has been suggested by Sens. Joseph Lieberman and John McCain, who introduced a bill recently that would would force U.S. companies to modestly reduce greenhouse emissions or pay penalties.\ Their bill makes sense because it calls for mandatory reductions, but provides flexibility in how those reductions are reached. It is far less stringent than the emissions cuts proposed in the much- reviled Kyoto treaty, which the president rightly rejected because it put an inordinate burden on the U.S. while largely exempting some of the world's largest polluting nations.\ McCain and Lieberman would set up a flexible, market-based ""cap and trade"" system under which emissions of greenhouse gases-- including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide--would be traded by companies.\ Here's how such a system generally works: Federal officials would set a national limit or ""cap"" on emissions of certain pollutants. Then they would tell each company that operates power plants or other significant sources of that pollution what they can emit. If a company's emissions fall below the cap, that company would earn credits it could sell on the open market, or ""bank."" Companies that exceed their limits could reduce their emissions or buy some of those credits.\ That approach has worked extremely well in a federal effort to cut levels of sulfur dioxide--a main component of acid rain--since 1990.\ The key to all cap and trade systems is setting the cap at a reasonable level, tight enough to make a difference, but not too tight to hobble industries. The McCain-Lieberman bill calls for industries to reach 1990 levels of greenhouse gases by 2016--an estimated 15 percent reduction.\ There's little doubt a cap and trade system can work with greenhouse gases, and the first proof of that may come in Chicago. At City Hall recently, officials unveiled a private, voluntary pilot program to start a market for trading in greenhouse gas emissions, the first in the country.\ The brainchild of financial futures guru Richard Sandor, the Chicago Climate Exchange has quite modest goals--each company in the exchange promises a 1 percent yearly reduction in greenhouse gases through 2006. It's encouraging that a heavyweight roster of companies has signed up--including DuPont, Ford Motor Co., Motorola, American Electric Power, Waste Management Inc. and Baxter International Inc.\ All of these companies apparently figure there's going to be mandatory cuts some day and they can not only learn about cost- effective ways to reduce emissions but help shape the market in pollution credits. Some also figure that sooner or later there could be profit in that trading. In the meantime, the companies reap a whirlwind of good public relations for taking steps toward cleaning the environment.\ In other words, they're getting ahead of the curve, trying to start solving the problem before it gets a lot worse. That's the right idea, and more companies need to get it. But that won't happen without new laws that have teeth."
37,"If one message has emerged from the long and often tortuous hours of climate negotiations in recent years, it is this: In the end, progress is being made.\The level of international ambition to deal with climate change is growing, as was evident at the latest round of UN climate talks, which ended Friday in Poland. It's happening despite a range of obstacles -- and sometimes even because of them.\The looming economic crisis has raised widespread fears that the costs of achieving deep greenhouse gas cuts might be intolerable, at least in the short term, as families struggle to pay mortgages and heat their homes. But nations including the United States, under President-elect Barack Obama, have responded by promising to use economic stimulus packages to push green technology and create green jobs.\Under what UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon is calling a green New Deal, laid-off employees are expected to be put to work insulating houses rather than building dams, and companies manufacturing solar panels and efficient cars will get government investment.\After months of wavering, Europe also agreed Friday to adopt tough binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2020, or 30 percent if other developed nations match their ambition, a move that ""puts Europe firmly on the road to becoming a sustainable, low-carbon economy,"" said Stavros Dimas, European commissioner for the environment.\Around the world, combating climate change is becoming a greater priority, particularly as more nations begin to see evidence of problems at home. A growing number of hurricanes and other severe storms, droughts, wildfires, floods and melting glaciers have added a sense of urgency to talks that once seemed to focus on a distant threat.\Climate negotiators agreed at Poznan last week to step up interim talks in the coming months to help ensure a deal next December in Copenhagen on a treaty to replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol, which requires most developed nations to cut their emissions. The U.S. never ratified the Kyoto treaty.\If a deal is reached at Copenhagen, it will then have to be approved by legislatures around the world, which could take years, according to UN climate head Yvo de Boer.\But there are signs of support for the deal even from former bitter opponents of the process. A growing coalition of major U.S. businesses, afraid of losing competitive advantage to counterparts overseas, has pressed for the government to set mandatory emissions reduction levels, which they see as crucial to preparing long-term business plans. U.S. states, cities and regions also have set emission reduction targets.\More businesses also support the establishment of national carbon markets and a cap-and-trade system where emission permits can be bought and sold, a measure Obama has promised to make a priority.\At climate meetings, a consensus is growing on the need for measures ranging from a fund to help the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations adjust to a changing climate, to mechanisms to ensure that new emission-cutting technologies are shared with developing countries.\How far have attitudes shifted? Saudi Arabia, which has long tried to stall climate treaty negotiations, fearing a wholesale shift away from fossil fuels, began laying the groundwork at Poznan to try to eventually win benefits itself from adaptation and technology-transfer funds.\Major developing nations including China, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico similarly have proposed national emissions reductions after long insisting that developed countries act first. Most developed countries that have not set targets for emissions reductions now expect to do so by March.\""A pattern is emerging of countries taking the negotiations seriously,"" said Jennifer Haverkamp, climate policy expert with the Environmental Defense Fund. Like the talks in Bali, the Poznan negotiations ""could have been more ambitious and detailed. But they're enough"" to push forward, she said.\The bigger question, some climate analysts say, is not whether a new treaty will be passed, but whether it will work. The Kyoto Protocol, negotiated a decade ago before a widespread sense of urgency emerged, has failed to produce significant emissions cuts, new research shows.\Negotiators say a new treaty is more likely to result in real progress, not least because it will encompass a broader range of countries and because the technology needed to bring about cuts is better understood.\Still, some scientists warn that the slow pace and limited ambition of negotiations up to now mean substantial climate change is already unavoidable and that the current target of holding greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million -- up from about 380 ppm at present -- is impractical. More likely, they say, are higher concentrations that could lead to a disastrous 7- to 11-degree rise in global temperatures.\""The scale and immediacy of emission reductions necessary cannot be reconciled"" with the current efforts to make them, said Kevin Anderson, research director at the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester.\""We're running out of reserves of time,"" said Henry Derwent, president of the International Emissions Trading Association and a former UK climate negotiator. ""But unless you get the deal right, [needed cuts] are just not going to happen.""\----------\lgoering@tribune.com\Credit: By Laurie Goering, Tribune correspondent"

39,"John McCain launched a green-tinted courtship of West Coast swing voters on Monday, with a call to action on global warming and an indictment of the Bush administration's ""failed"" policies to combat it.\The presumptive Republican presidential nominee visited the wind-power technology firm Vestas, near Portland International Airport, to decry melting polar ice, vanishing glaciers, changes in animal migration and ""rising temperatures and waters,"" all products, he said, of a reliance on fossil fuels that threatens America's economy and security.\McCain championed nuclear power and warned that China and India must take steps to curb their own rising carbon emissions. ""The facts of global warming demand our urgent attention,"" McCain said, ""particularly in Washington.""\He endorsed a ""cap and trade"" system that would impose carbon-emission limits on industries and require businesses that exceeded those caps to buy credits from businesses that pollute under their limits. Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both support such a ""cap and trade"" system, with stricter limits than under McCain's plan.\Obama, Clinton and some environmental groups criticized the reach of McCain's proposals. And analysts and voter-registration statistics suggest that even with his green appeal, McCain faces an uphill battle to put this increasingly blue state into play in the fall.\Democrat John Kerry won Oregon by 76,000 votes in 2004, a 4-percentage-point margin over President George W. Bush. McCain advisers believe the Arizona senator's environmental stances could help push the state his way this fall.\Analysts note that Oregon's electorate has shifted over four years, with heated opposition to the Iraq War and Bush in general. Voter registration reflects that: In November 2004, registered Democrats outnumbered registered Republicans by about 63,000. This month, a registration surge in advance of the state's May 20 mail-ballot primary helped swell the Democrats' advantage to 190,000 voters.\The Portland speech expanded on an issue McCain has stressed throughout the campaign, before friendly and skeptical audiences alike. In it, he laid out his targets for carbon emission reduction: 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, compared to the 80 percent reduction proposed by Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. In a veiled shot at Bush, he promised to lead the world in the effort.\""I will not shirk the mantle of leadership that the United States bears,"" McCain said. ""I will not permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges.""\Clinton and Obama both stressed energy policy in trips to Oregon last week, and both criticized McCain's remarks on Monday for not going far enough.\""While Sen. McCain's proposals may be improvement on President Bush's, that's not saying much,"" Clinton said in a statement her campaign released.\Obama ripped McCain for his vote on a 2005 bill that contained incentives for renewable energy development. ""It is truly breathtaking for John McCain to talk about combating climate change while voting against virtually every recent effort to actually invest in clean energy,"" Obama said in a statement.\McCain will keep up the environmental theme Tuesday with a round-table discussion in a suburb of Seattle. Pollster Tim Hibbitts said the global warming pitch probably won't get him ""on the green side"" of Obama or Clinton among environment-first voters but could help ""take the edge off"" among voters concerned with the environment but more focused on other issues.\----------\jtankersley@tribune.com\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, TRIBUNE CORRESPONDENT"
40," Juan Molina can no longer wait for the nation's green movement to come to his doorstep, which is one house away from the ""diesel death zone"" of Interstate Highway 710.\ The smog from trucks traveling to the nearby seaport is just too much, and it's one reason that he, his pregnant wife and their two small boys are moving.\ ""There's too much pollution, especially by the freeway, and it affects the kids more than us,"" said Molina, 25, a construction worker.\ Frequently the trendsetter, California is providing the nation's most aggressive law yet in response to a growing belief, advanced by an international study this month, that mankind and its pollutants are making the planet warmer.\ With Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger taking a lead role against traditional interests in his party, California will impose restrictions on just about every business to reduce carbon emissions under a law that took effect in January. Other states in the West as well as New England are devising measures, but none has passed a law as groundbreaking as the Golden State's, experts and officials said.\ ""California has taken the lead in actually establishing a law to do it,"" said Chris Field, director of the department of global ecology at the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University. ""I think one of the goals of the California legislature and governor was to come up with an initiative that was tougher than anybody else's, and they want the bragging rights of having the strongest climate policy.""\ As the 12th-largest emitter of carbon in the world and responsible for 10 percent of carbon dioxide nationally, California has a record of leading the way on reducing emissions, particularly from vehicle tailpipes. In 2002, California passed tougher standards on automakers for greenhouse gases, and at least 10 other states are seeking to adopt those standards, officials said.\ In Illinois, a new committee on greenhouse gases impaneled by Gov. Rod Blagojevich is to meet for the first time this week and will look at California's newest law as a model.\ Next month, California regulators will meet with industry leaders to put together an early action plan that ultimately will lead to reductions of carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2020--equal to the level of 1990.\ The stakes are high, as the California Chamber of Commerce last year called the law a ""job killer"" that ""discourages economic growth with little or no proven environmental benefit.""\ Businesses are battling to ensure that California will implement the new law under a marketlike system in which pollution permits could be bought and sold--something that Schwarzenegger favors. What they fear is that legislators favor direct regulation. A system must be decided upon by January.\ If other states don't follow California's emission laws, businesses may go to those states--and take their emissions with them. ""There would be no net benefit to the environment,"" said Vince Sollitto of the California chamber.\ Others believe a national green movement is in the making under California's overarching Global Warming Solutions Act--a much broader attack than the state's past landmark measures of constraining only automakers.\ ""Anecdotally it appears that there is a movement,"" said Mark Bernstein, visiting instructor of political science at the University of Southern California. ""You just see lots of companies taking action and reducing energy use and reducing emissions.""\ California is hardly alone in responding to global warming. Other states and local governments, including Chicago's, have adopted their own measures as officials in Washington remain deadlocked on a federal solution.\ Among particular interest to Illinois is Schwarzenegger's preference for the ""cap-and-trade"" structure, in which businesses create a value for reducing pollution by trading their permits to pollute, officials said.\ Whether a company would be forced to close because its carbon footprint exceeds standards is unclear, experts say.\ ""Let's say you and I own competing power plants,"" said California Air Resources Board spokesman Jerry Martin. ""I got an old, dirty, coal-powered plant that puts out a lot of emissions. You got a brand- new power plant run by compressed natural gas and it's much more efficient.\ ""I can approach your company and buy your credits from you. You can sell your credits on the open market or you can save those credits because you're going to build more and you're going to pollute more,"" Martin said, illustrating the cap-and-trade model.\ That paradigm is active in the Kyoto protocol, the international global warming treaty that President Bush opposes, as well as at the Chicago Climate Exchange. That exchange, founded in 2002 as the world's first, is a voluntary but legally binding group of U.S. businesses and local and state governments that trade permits to pollute. The city of Chicago and state of Illinois are members.\ At a minimum, the California model of forcing all industries to reduce carbon emissions is inspiring Illinois officials.\ ""We're definitely moving down that path, and we're the first Midwestern state to do it,"" said Illinois EPA Director Douglas Scott, who leads the state's new 35-member greenhouse gas advisory committee.\ Whatever Illinois decides, it could touch every citizen and business in the state, much as California's law does, with an expectation of greater cost to everyone, Scott said. For example, residents might have to buy curliecue fluorescent light bulbs for their homes, which cost three to four times more than incandescent bulbs but are energy savers, he said.\ ""You start with the premise that if we don't do anything, it's absolutely going to touch everyone in the state because of the dangers in greenhouse gases: the temperature increases and the different diseases that can occur because particular viruses can thrive when it's warmer--to floods and storms and the ability to get an insurer,"" Scott said.\ - - -\ Official: Heat to be on Chicago\ If global warming continues, Chicago will change dramatically by 2095, a city official says.\ It'll be hotter and dryer. Summers will be like those in Dallas now.\ Most trees won't survive, so the city is considering planting new types, said Sadhu Johnston, the city's environment commissioner.\ Storms will be larger yet fewer, with annual precipitation remaining steady.\ Neighborhoods may be viewed differently. Some, like Goose Island, will be ""a hot spot"" in the ""urban heat island"" that Chicago has become, Johnston said. Black surfaces, from pavements to roofs, mark such spots.\ Solutions include the more than 2.5 million square feet of ""green roofs"" in the city, more than the rest of the country combined, and more solar panels and cleaner buses.\ --Michael Martinez\ ----------\ mjmartinez@tribune.com"
41,"When the Obama administration on Monday unveils its much-anticipated proposal to curb power plant emissions, this cornerstone of the president's climate change policy -- the most significant environmental regulation of his presidency -- will not be declared in a Rose Garden news conference or from behind the lectern in a major speech.\It will not be announced by the president at all, but instead by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, while President Barack Obama adds his comment in an off-camera conference call with health advocates. \The low-key rollout from the man who once boldly predicted his election would be remembered as the moment when ""our planet began to heal"" and likened the climate change challenge to the U.S. space program shows just how far Obama has shifted his strategy. \After charging into office in 2009 with a goal of passing comprehensive legislation and making massive investments in alternative energy, Obama saw his first-term effort to get a cap-and-trade bill passed tank and the government's investments in the Solyndra solar company turn into a political embarrassment. \Since then, Obama and his team have retooled and climbed back slowly -- too slowly, some say -- with Plan B: incremental, politically cautious and legally aggressive environmental regulation, culminating in the EPA rule this week. \""I think we scaled back the legislative ambition but continued to push where we could,"" said Dan Utech, the White House energy and climate change adviser. ""It's been an adaptive process, a process of figuring how best to push at each point in time."" \Though it may be unveiled with no more fanfare than that of a routine public health announcement, the proposed rule will mark the most significant step on climate change of Obama's presidency. \It is expected to set hard targets for state-by-state reduction of carbon emissions from power plants, the single largest source of carbon pollution in the nation. \Experts note the rule will likely spur the growth of state-level cap-and-trade marketplaces, the very system Obama tried to institute on a national level in his failed legislation. In that sense it may be remembered as a rare moment when Obama worked around opposition in Congress to implement one of his top goals. \Obama's policies and his strategy have detractors on the left and right. Industry groups and many Republicans say the president's drive to regulate will only increase the cost of energy, kill jobs and weaken a still-fragile economy. They accuse him of stretching the current law. \""They have to push the Clean Air Act much further than it's ever been used before,"" said Jeffrey Holmstead, a former assistant EPA administrator during the George W. Bush administration. \Others complain Obama's environmental concerns do not seem to extend to the potential hazards of extracting natural gas or the increased use of fossil fuels that could result from construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project Obama has delayed but not killed as some environmentalists have called for. \To be sure, evaluating Obama's legacy on the issue is premature. Monday's proposal will likely be debated over the next year. Its success in cutting carbon emissions will depend on how strict the targets are and how the federal government holds states to them. \U.S. emissions have been declining recently because of increased use of natural gas to generate electricity, but the country is still second to China in annual emissions. It is far from clear whether the rule will win back U.S. credibility and leverage in negotiations over an international climate change agreement, as the White House hopes. \Current and former aides say the shift in strategy from one term to the next was driven by Obama himself. They describe the president as capable of diving deep into the science of the matter and dismissive of doubters. Obama often seems taken by the possibilities of renewable technology, likes to cast the development of wind and solar power as potential economic drivers and frequently asks technical questions at briefings. \""One of the last questions I remember him asking me was in a meeting with scientists and we're talking about natural gas,"" said Heather Zichal, who until November was Obama's top adviser on climate change. ""He turns and asks, 'By the way, do we have an accurate accounting of the life cycle of GHG (greenhouse gas) and do we need to worry about methane emissions?' It's not unusual for him to ask weedy, technical questions."" \Still, the president and the White House have kept an eye on the politics of an issue that remains low on the priority list for most voters. He's careful to talk about rising costs of extreme weather events and natural disasters as a way of driving the climate change issue home, rather than ice caps and polar bears. \Last Saturday, in his weekly radio address for example, Obama focused on the health risks of climate change. He said the new rule would ""cut down on carbon pollution, smog and soot that threaten the health of the most vulnerable Americans, including children and the elderly."" \Throughout much of Obama's first term, the climate change debate roiled the White House. Obama helped Democrats in the House pass a cap-and-trade bill to create a market-based system to drive down emissions, but the effort stalled in the Senate while the White House juggled its other major priority -- passing an overhaul of health care. \Some former officials say the administration quickly turned to a regulatory approach, but the speed is a subject of debate. While the economy cratered, pushing any measures that might be viewed as a job-killer was a risk the White House wanted to avoid as the re-election campaign drew closer. \While the White House moved ahead with plans to increase fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, ozone regulation was put on hold and a rule regulating coal ash stalled. \""I would say there was a period of early activity and then, as with many regulatory matters in the administration, there was a period when that all went dark,"" said Lisa Heinzerling, a former top climate policy adviser at the EPA who left the administration in 2010. \Among those delayed plans was regulation of greenhouse gases from power plants. The EPA announced in 2010 that it intended to regulate coal-fired power plants, as well as oil refineries. Under the timeline set, the agency would have issued final rules for both by November 2012. The deadline came and went. \Immediately after his re-election, the president declared his intention to make climate change a priority, aides say. He included the issue in his second inaugural speech. \The White House and advocates believe this moment is right. The natural gas boom has helped drive the transition away from coal, and the economy has improved. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy has been working closely with utilities and other stakeholders. \The public appears to support the rules. Two-thirds of Americans support increased regulation on power plants, even if the cost of electricity rises, according to a poll conducted in April by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. \And Obama and his party may have learned more lessons on how to manage and package their plans. Obama will frame the issue as a matter of public health, clean air and a government agency doing its work. He'll conduct interviews Monday with the American Lung Association and other health groups. \Few dispute the recent momentum behind the issue. \""He has made this issue a centerpiece of this term,"" said Frances Beinecke, president of the National Resources Defense Council. \""I've heard a real commitment and passion on the issue. He's putting his eggs in this basket. Now his challenge is delivering it."" \---------- \khennessey@tribune.com\Credit: By Kathleen Hennessey, Tribune Washington Bureau"
42," Juan Molina can no longer wait for the nation's green movement to come to his doorstep, which is one house away from the ""diesel death zone"" of Interstate Highway 710.\ The smog from trucks traveling to the nearby seaport is just too much, and it's one reason that he, his pregnant wife and their two small boys are moving.\ ""There's too much pollution, especially by the freeway, and it affects the kids more than us,"" said Molina, 25, a construction worker.\ Frequently the trendsetter, California is providing the nation's most aggressive law yet in response to a growing belief, advanced by an international study this month, that mankind and its pollutants are making the planet warmer.\ With Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger taking a lead role against traditional interests in his party, California will impose restrictions on just about every business to reduce carbon emissions under a law that took effect in January. Other states in the West as well as New England are devising measures, but none has passed a law as groundbreaking as the Golden State's, experts and officials said.\ ""California has taken the lead in actually establishing a law to do it,"" said Chris Field, director of the department of global ecology at the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University. ""I think one of the goals of the California legislature and governor was to come up with an initiative that was tougher than anybody else's, and they want the bragging rights of having the strongest climate policy.""\ As the 12th-largest emitter of carbon in the world and responsible for 10 percent of carbon dioxide nationally, California has a record of leading the way on reducing emissions, particularly from vehicle tailpipes. In 2002, California passed tougher standards on automakers for greenhouse gases, and at least 10 other states are seeking to adopt those standards, officials said.\ In Illinois, a new committee on greenhouse gases impaneled by Gov. Rod Blagojevich is to meet for the first time this week and will look at California's newest law as a model.\ Next month, California regulators will meet with industry leaders to put together an early action plan that ultimately will lead to reductions of carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2020--equal to the level of 1990.\ The stakes are high, as the California Chamber of Commerce last year called the law a ""job killer"" that ""discourages economic growth with little or no proven environmental benefit.""\ Businesses are battling to ensure that California will implement the new law under a marketlike system in which pollution permits could be bought and sold--something that Schwarzenegger favors. What they fear is that legislators favor direct regulation. A system must be decided upon by January.\ If other states don't follow California's emission laws, businesses may go to those states--and take their emissions with them. ""There would be no net benefit to the environment,"" said Vince Sollitto of the California chamber.\ Others believe a national green movement is in the making under California's overarching Global Warming Solutions Act--a much broader attack than the state's past landmark measures of constraining only automakers.\ ""Anecdotally it appears that there is a movement,"" said Mark Bernstein, visiting instructor of political science at the University of Southern California. ""You just see lots of companies taking action and reducing energy use and reducing emissions.""\ California is hardly alone in responding to global warming. Other states and local governments, including Chicago's, have adopted their own measures as officials in Washington remain deadlocked on a federal solution.\ Among particular interest to Illinois is Schwarzenegger's preference for the ""cap-and-trade"" structure, in which businesses create a value for reducing pollution by trading their permits to pollute, officials said.\ Whether a company would be forced to close because its carbon footprint exceeds standards is unclear, experts say.\ ""Let's say you and I own competing power plants,"" said California Air Resources Board spokesman Jerry Martin. ""I got an old, dirty, coal-powered plant that puts out a lot of emissions. You got a brand- new power plant run by compressed natural gas and it's much more efficient.\ ""I can approach your company and buy your credits from you. You can sell your credits on the open market or you can save those credits because you're going to build more and you're going to pollute more,"" Martin said, illustrating the cap-and-trade model.\ That paradigm is active in the Kyoto protocol, the international global warming treaty that President Bush opposes, as well as at the Chicago Climate Exchange. That exchange, founded in 2002 as the world's first, is a voluntary but legally binding group of U.S. businesses and local and state governments that trade permits to pollute. The city of Chicago and state of Illinois are members.\ At a minimum, the California model of forcing all industries to reduce carbon emissions is inspiring Illinois officials.\ ""We're definitely moving down that path, and we're the first Midwestern state to do it,"" said Illinois EPA Director Douglas Scott, who leads the state's new 35-member greenhouse gas advisory committee.\ Whatever Illinois decides, it could touch every citizen and business in the state, much as California's law does, with an expectation of greater cost to everyone, Scott said. For example, residents might have to buy curliecue fluorescent light bulbs for their homes, which cost three to four times more than incandescent bulbs but are energy savers, he said.\ ""You start with the premise that if we don't do anything, it's absolutely going to touch everyone in the state because of the dangers in greenhouse gases: the temperature increases and the different diseases that can occur because particular viruses can thrive when it's warmer--to floods and storms and the ability to get an insurer,"" Scott said.\ - - -\ Official: Heat to be on Chicago\ If global warming continues, Chicago will change dramatically by 2095, a city official says.\ It'll be hotter and dryer. Summers will be like those in Dallas now.\ Most trees won't survive, so the city is considering planting new types, said Sadhu Johnston, the city's environment commissioner.\ Storms will be larger yet fewer, with annual precipitation remaining steady.\ Neighborhoods may be viewed differently. Some, like Goose Island, will be ""a hot spot"" in the ""urban heat island"" that Chicago has become, Johnston said. Black surfaces, from pavements to roofs, mark such spots.\ Solutions include the more than 2.5 million square feet of ""green roofs"" in the city, more than the rest of the country combined, and more solar panels and cleaner buses.\ --Michael Martinez\ ----------\ mjmartinez@tribune.com"

Both units were retired onFeb. 13, 1998. Importantly, nuclear reactors do not emit carbon dioxideby contributing to global warming mania.\Given president-elect Barack Obamas announced cap and trade policyto cut carbon emissions by a whopping 80 percent by 2020, it would beeconomic suicide for this nation not to invest in more nuclear power.\Was it really necessary to shutter Zions dual-reactor nuclearplant? Recently I spoke with David Hollein, formerly the WestinghouseProject Engineer for all the Commonwealth Nuclear Plants built byWestinghouse and General Electric. Mr. Hollein believes that there wasno need to shutter the two operating Zion Nuclear Plants. Some steamgenerator tubes were found leaking in both Zion Nuclear Plants, but thetubes were closed and the plants ran without jeopardizing theemployees, citizens or the environment.\ComEd noted that the cost of replacing the steam generators wouldhave amounted to $435 million, but that the investment would not havepaid off given the expiration in 2013 of the two unit plant operatinglicenses. According to Hollein, older plants can be made safe andupdated through routine maintenance to extend the life of the plant.\It is time for citizens in northern Illinois to become involved bycalling their state representatives and senators to demand answers.Refusing to build or use existing nuclear plants here in Illinois andacross this nation could result in a loss of this countrys standard ofliving.\Nancy J.

44,"Regarding Obama, singer puts it best\Having listened to the State of the Union address, I am reminded of a song from Jimmy Buffett called ""Youll Never Work in This Business Again."" As far as I am concerned, our current president should never be president again.\This song encapsulates his administration. He hasnt a clue and never has. He was elected due to his rock star image. Unfortunately, there is no substance to his image. He is simply an arrogant academic, and unfortunately there are many in our society these days. These are individuals who want to tell us how to run every aspect of our life with never having met a payroll or a budget.\Finally, the citizens of this nation have risen up and said ""no"" to these arrogant academics. What a refreshing statement that is. We need to flush all the arrogant academics down the toilet and get rid of them once and for all and let common sense and capitalism direct the future of our nation, which has made it the greatest nation in the history of the world in the shortest period of time.\If you want to hear these philosophical statements put to music, I suggest you buy the Jimmy Buffett CD if it is still produced. I believe it was recorded in 1990 by MCA Recording, produced by Micheultlet & Elliott Scheiner. Jimmy Buffetts CD encapsulates the Barack Obama administration. Enjoy the music. As Buffett says, America is ""Cheeseburger in Paradise.""\Steven R. Heuberger\Libertyville\Why unemployment is not getting better\Here are a few statistics that should scare all of us. According to a recent poll, 78 percent of business leaders believe President Obama is anti-business and 81 percent of business leaders have no or little confidence in Obamas ability to manage our economy.\Why does that matter? Those business leaders are the ones who invest in business and create the jobs that we all need. And right now, they are holding back their investments and they are not hiring because they believe Obama will increase their taxes and make it harder for them to make a profit.\Right now Obama and his team are slamming business leaders and bankers as fat cats. They are piling on new taxes and talking about dramatically increasing the cost of doing business in the United States with cap and trade, which will increase energy costs for everyone. Business leaders are standing on the sidelines because they may have to move more manufacturing to China or India, which will not impose cap-and-trade taxes. And those business leaders will not add jobs if they think the current health care bill will pass, increasing their costs.\It may be popular to slam business leaders, but they are simply reacting logically to the environment they are forced to deal with. If they get it wrong, they can go out of business and lose their investments. Maybe President Obama should consider reality for a change and look for ways to work with business leaders to create a positive business environment which will create jobs, not alienate them and kill jobs. You think?\Randy Rossi\Grayslake\Health care plan\backed by elitists\Politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, have long taken ""We the people"" for granted. An elitist mentality presupposes that we are incapable of understanding key issues and making informed decisions on our welfare. With only 40 percent of voters supporting the proposed health care legislation, the Democratic Party seems hellbent on passing legislation that is neither popular nor financially sound.\The Republican Party and a majority of the Democratic Party have been excluded from closed-door negotiations conducted with a select group of elitist politicians. Key votes have been bought with taxpayer money, a policy that undermines our Constitution. Not only have we been excluded but also the congressional members duly elected by the voters. This runs contrary to the transparency we were promised.\When we seek to raise our voices through tea parties and town hall meetings, a right guaranteed under the First Amendment of our Constitution, we are labeled as bigots and extremists. The arrogant, condescending mindset of Washington has outraged Democrats, Republicans and independents alike. The Declaration of Independence states that governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, a concept that our politicians have failed to comprehend.\Ray Cziczo\Antioch\Plan could leave\retirees out in cold\On Christmas Eve the U.S. Senate slid through its own version of the health care reform bill. The bill fails to protect the earned postretirement health care benefits of tens of millions of American retirees like me. Unjustly, this legislation goes a step further in the wrong direction by actually financially penalizing corporations that do the right thing by continuing to provide retiree prescription drug benefits they promised to their former workers.\This process is being done behind closed doors versus going through the normal conference process, which means retirees will again get left behind. This appears to be an effort to pass health are reform regardless of its impact on the public. These secret negotiations should offend everyone, not just retirees, who will once again be the biggest losers in this whole debate.\I spent 24 years working for Abbott Laboratories as a fire chief. Arent my lifelong dedication and the wages I contributed over many decades in exchange for retirement health care coverage worth protecting? There are 18.5 million American retirees in the same boat as me who took less in wages and less vacation over decades so their employer could sock those funds away to pay for our health care benefits in retirement. If the Senate version of the health care reform bill is mandating that it be stripped from us, we deserve answers now from our senators on Capitol Hill.\The Senates health reform bill (HR 3590 As Amended) lacks provisions of the original House of Representatives bill (HR 3962), which includes key protections contained within another vital bill, The Emergency Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act (HR 1322). HR 1322 prohibits employers from making postretirement cuts or eliminating the earned health benefits of people after they retired. In the amended Senate legislation, it requires a change in the tax status of payments for retiree health benefits that would negatively impact many companies earnings statements and encourage them to actually drop drug benefits for millions of retirees, instead of keeping it in place.\Many leading corporations including Boeing, John Deere, MetLife, Xerox as well as the AFL-CIO have complained loudly about this and say they intend to lobby against the Senate action. The anti-retiree and anti-baby boomer legislation that passed the Senate just as Santa mounted his sled was nothing more than a lump of coal in the stockings of millions of older Americans. It encourages, and in some cases will force, corporations to reduce benefits.\Ironically those of us who have already earned health benefits by making sacrifices during our working years now have to fight our own elected officials. Lets be clear, none of us is asking for a handout, just a guarantee that the new federal health care reform bill treat us fairly and not cancel the benefits we earned over a lifetime.\Paul Groh\Grayslake"
45,"Schools need best, diverse teachers\After changing careers in 2003 to become a teacher, I believed what a lot of people said about finding a job as a teacher in grades K-5. People said that there was a teacher shortage, and with a teaching staff at any elementary school averaging more than 92 percent female, a man with a teaching certificate, a masters degree in education and a diverse background would have no problem getting interviews.\Well, what a shock it has been since 2003. I have substitute taught in Arlington Heights, Barrington, Schaumburg, Bensenville and Carpentersville, while learning Spanish to become bilingual certified in the near future.\Many districts overwhelmingly hire females at the K-5 level and most often recent college graduates, whom they can hire at a lower wage because of their lack of experience and education. This is at the expense of allowing students a chance to learn from more qualified teachers with more diverse backgrounds and teaching styles.\Many students over the years have said that I have been the first and only male teacher that they have had since they have been at school. There are men out there who want to be full-time teachers, and all Im asking is that we men have an equal a shot at interviewing for and obtaining full-time teaching positions as the overwhelmingly female candidates have. Help from current teachers and principals would be great. But getting a tenured teacher and principal at the elementary level to help, when they can keep silent and not do anything, is hard to overcome.\I believe that many school districts, including the ones that I have mentioned, need to finally show proof that they are trying their best to hire the most qualified and diverse teaching staffs, and hearing from the public would not be a bad idea.\Mike Baker\Schaumburg\Services are part\of abortion debate\Nat Hentoff was right on in his recent column regarding common ground on abortion. He quotes Tennessee Congressman Lincoln Davis as saying, ""Its not about pro-life or pro-choice. Its about what we can do to bring a reduction to abortion."" People have to realize that women are often forced into choosing abortion because they have nowhere else to turn. Fortunately, there are caring, safe and compassionate places, like The Society for the Preservation of Human Dignity, that emphasize alternatives to abortion.\Founded in 1971, PHD has built a solid reputation in the community as a pregnancy counseling center providing women and families with comprehensive services focused on pregnancy and parenting experience through the first three years of a childs life. Most women, by the time they come to PHD, have made the decision to parent their baby and are coming for support services that empower women to make healthy choices for them and their children.\PHD maintains a nonjudgmental and caring attitude throughout a womans pregnancy journey. In addition to counseling, PHD therapists help women struggling with grief and loss related to the death of child through trauma, stillbirth, miscarriage, post-abortion and post adoption. Postpartum depression, anxiety and general parenting and family concerns are also addressed. PHD also offers basic necessities including baby food, clothing, formula and diapers through its Baby and Maternity Closet to remove some of the stress from a womans life so she can focus on more important issues. Additional community resources are also provided.\The bottom line? Knowledge is power. When women and families know whats available to them, only then can they make the best decisions. As such, PHD will continue to be an alternative to abortion, providing hope, opportunities and options in a supportive and caring environment. Now thats common ground.\Catherine Vincus\Executive Director\PHD Palatine\Standing in defense of government\Ronald Reagan was famous for saying, ""Government isnt the solution; government is the problem."" I prefer to rephrase that as, ""Representative government isnt the solution, representative government is the problem."" Down with representative government?\For as long as I can remember Republicans have been bad-mouthing our government.\In a representative democracy government isnt ""they,"" government is ""we."" If there is something wrong with our government it is the fault of we the people. We need to take ownership of our government. We should not refer to ""the government"" as though it were some third party both incompetent and malicious. We should refer to ""my government"" or ""our government.""\The policies followed and actions taken by government at all levels federal state or local are done by people we have elected, if we have bothered to vote at all.\It is up to the citizens of a country to decide what functions are to be done by government, business or nonprofits or charities. On the governmental level we need to decide what should be done by federal, state and local governments. Problems should be handled by the lowest level of government that can handle them. To declare that every action performed by federal, state or local government is ""socialism"" detracts from rational discussion.\Many call for less government. Less compared to what? They oppose ""big government."" Again, big compared to what? Governments, like businesses, need to be ""right sized."" They need to be of the size needed to perform successfully the functions that we the citizens have decided to have them perform. Programs we want should be fully funded. Fully fund them or drop them.\Most governmental functions arent performed poorly, theyre done very well. But government isnt perfect. Nothing is.\Kent Kirkwood\Mount Prospect\Energy laws are\unreasonable taxation\For about 100 years the United States has built most industries around the use of oil and its products. Now the government wants to instantly change that reliance. ""We must wean our country off foreign oil."" That statement sounds wonderful because some of the oil-producing countries dont like us at all.\If we are going to wean ourselves off foreign oil then we should be looking to our own resources. Drilling for oil in the Gulf and off the coasts and in Alaska would reduce our foreign dependence drastically. It would ensure our national security until new technologies become dependable and affordable.\A little common sense would conclude that the United States alone cant improve the environment if other world powers dont do the same. China was a good example when preparing for the last Olympic Games. It stopped all polluting industries for over a month. The sun began to shine in Beijing. After the Games were finished, China restarted those industries and lost sight of the sun again. Lately it has been buying oil-drilling rights all over the world including in the Gulf of Mexico. Does this sound like a country committed to a clean environment?\Saving the environment is the reason given for using less fossil fuel. NASA recently stated than man has no effect on the climate. Sun spot activities are to blame for weather changes.\To keep us from using fossil fuels politicians will vote on ""cap and trade"" bill. It will be a huge tax on energy that will cause a 50- to 100-percent rise in utility bills plus the cost of any purchases made. Who profits from this? The government, green technologies and politicians like Nancy Pelosi who invested in these energy stocks.\It appears the taxpayers will be attacked again by unreasonable taxation without representation.\Wayne Oras Sr.\Schaumburg\This is such\a sad day . . .\I opened the Daily Herald and as I always do ... went right to the back page of the sports.

46,"After eight years of disappointment, frustration and legal wrangling with the Bush administration, environmental groups think Barack Obama could be the nation's greenest president.\On issues as varied as climate change, toxic chemicals and the Great Lakes, Obama promotes an ambitious agenda that would advance green initiatives and reverse polluter-friendly rules and executive orders from President Bush and his aides.\Unlike Al Gore, who wrote a best-selling book about the environment but rarely mentioned the subject when he ran for president, Obama often embraced green issues on the campaign trail and has continued to do so since becoming president-elect.\Some of his promises could be muted by the troubled economy. But for months Obama's transition team has been quietly studying new environmental policies that could be adopted quickly, as well as Clinton-era initiatives that could be revived.\Obama also has pledged to listen more closely to scientific advisers and environmental experts, whose advice the Bush administration frequently ignored or overruled.\""I think we are in store for something new,"" said William Reilly, who led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President George H.W. Bush. ""His pledge to follow the science will be reassuring to a lot of people, including those who fear the regulators are going to run amok.""\In a videotaped address Tuesday to a bipartisan group of governors, Obama said his plans to revive the economy include incentives for new jobs tied to cleaner sources of energy and more fuel-efficient automobiles, which also could benefit the environment.\One of the new president's first actions likely will be to reverse the Bush administration's decision to block California and 17 other states from regulating greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and trucks. The initiative would force automakers to build more fuel-sipping vehicles and is seen as a major step toward weaning the nation off imported oil.\Reversing Bush's policy also could create momentum for Obama's proposal to cap emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, and let power plants, factories and other polluters trade the right to emit within the limit.\""Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all,"" Obama told the governors. ""Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response. The stakes are too high; the consequences too serious.""\Under the first President Bush, Reilly oversaw the creation of a similar system, known as cap-and-trade, that significantly reduced acid rain pollution from power plants. The current president vowed during his 2000 campaign to set up a trading scheme for carbon dioxide but reneged after taking office.\Since then the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases to climate change has grown stronger, and several reports from the Bush administration have blamed the problem on human activities, mostly the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels. But the administration repeatedly has declined to act, even after the U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant the EPA should regulate.\Before the election, Obama said he supported a declaration that carbon emissions are endangering human welfare, a policy some of his advisers contend would connect energy and environment issues to an economic recovery.\""We've suffered through an administration that wasn't smart about using green energy to kick-start the economy,"" said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago. ""But the president-elect knows that retooling the auto industry and creating more green jobs is good for the economy and good for the environment.""\Learner, a longtime Obama adviser, is among the candidates for a top environmental job in the new administration. Other possibilities include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founder of the Waterkeeper Alliance; former Sierra Club president Lisa Renstrom; Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, and Kathleen McGinty, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.\Whoever is chosen will face protracted battles in Congress about climate change legislation. Since measures outlined by Obama and by Republican presidential candidate John McCain would affect virtually every part of the economy, business interests already are angling for provisions that would benefit specific industries.\On water issues, activists who focus on the Great Lakes are optimistic that the Obama administration will push for more money to clean up contaminated sites, restore coastal wetlands and improve fisheries. Three years ago, the Bush administration outlined a $20 billion plan to restore and protect the world's largest source of freshwater, but it later withdrew support.\As a U.S. senator, Obama introduced or backed several measures to clean up the lakes, and his presidential chief of staff, Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, has been a leading voice in Congress on Great Lakes issues.\Almost every proposed rule change and every environmental bill will be subjected to intense debate and compromise, which likely will open Obama's administration to sharp criticism from all sides -- including from the environmental groups that backed his campaign.\""There are so many thorny issues on their agenda,"" said Mary Gade, a Bush appointee who ran the EPA's regional office in Chicago before the Bush administration ousted her over a pollution dispute. ""But that job just doesn't allow you to be extreme.""\- - -\Obama's environmental promises\Climate change: Cap greenhouse gas emissions and set a target of reducing them by 80 percent by 2050. Let polluters trade the right to emit within the limit.\Air pollution: Toughen smog and soot standards.

Our slow economy can't pick up speed if it's hobbled by paralyzing government policies.
\
Various experts, some political and some not, keep predicting that economic recovery is just around the corner.
\
But then along come new unemployment figures that show even more people are out of work.
\
It happened again this week when the U.S. Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate is up again, this time to 9.5 percent, the highest it's been since 1983.
\
Circumstances, of course, do get better. Back in 1983, then-President Ronald Reagan and Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker were trying to break the back of inflation as a means of reviving the U.S. economy. Interest rates and unemployment both were too high. But Reagan and Volcker eventually succeeded, and by 1984 a strong economic recovery was under way.
\
For now, at least, there's not much positive news on the economic front. Obama administration spokesmen have resorted to citing as good news the fact that the unemployment rate didn't go higher than 9.5 percent, as some expected.
\
The gloomy news has some people in Congress and the administration speculating about the need for another economic stimulus bill, the third. Former President George W. Bush pushed an economic stimulus package through Congress during his final year in office, and President Obama pushed a second stimulus bill through during his first months in office.
\
But there's not much sign the economy has been stimulated. While personal savings figures are up, there hasn't been much sign of the kind of broad investment that is needed to spur hiring and generate economic activity.
\
Maybe that's because politicians at the federal and state levels keep talking about the need for tax increases. Raising taxes is a sure-fire way to stunt an economic recovery, and if that's what people see on the horizon they won't be much inclined to take the economic risks necessary to jolt the economy.
\
On top of potential tax increases, the U.S. House of Representatives recently threw another wet blanket on the economy by narrowly passing cap-and-trade legislation that is designed to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the environment. It may or may not have the intended effect, but critics say the legislation also will increase the energy costs of families and businesses and force even more people out of work.
\
So it seems that the government is working at cross-purposes here, hoping for an economic recovery while promoting policies that will further slow the economy. Members of the U.S. Senate ought to think about that when they take up the cap-and-trade bill.
\
The U.S. economy is in a hole, and people are hurting. Let's try to get out of it before pursuing complicated and expensive legislation no one can afford.

48,"Half a billion government dollars went out the door Tuesday for energy and wind projects, and not a penny of it landed in Illinois.\Before any Illinoisans storm to a town hall meeting and shout at Energy Secretary Steven Chu, please know this: Illinois will eventually get its money. Iowa too.\Even though the 12 grants totaling $502 million were awarded Tuesday to companies in only eight Western and Eastern states, companies in an additional 29 states have applied for the remaining $2.5 billion in available funds. And that's just in the program designed to promote installation of alternative-energy equipment that immediately will go into service.\Other energy programs, with similarly huge buckets of cash, are aimed at promoting high-tech experimentation. One targets $4.5 billion toward development of a ""smart grid"" that can cut demand for power and save transmission costs. Another encourages $1 billion in subsidies that, it is hoped, should spur some $8 billion of lending toward research into breakthrough technologies.\It is not news that, as part of the government stimulus package, Uncle Sam has many billions to give, lend or invest. Since the economy went into acute crisis a year ago, we have seen how federal money can be both wasted and well spent.\Much of the bank bailout money was wasted, for example. For the investment in General Motors and Chrysler, it is too soon to tell. ""Cash for clunkers"" was so popular that Congress tripled the size of the program -- though its long-term impact on the car industry is not yet clear.\The most high-profile programs have been mostly ad hoc in nature. The energy credits announced Tuesday are of a lower-profile, but equally high-impact sort: Carefully planned and executed, with a long-term aim toward transforming entire sectors of the economy.\This is the way the federal stimulus program, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is supposed to work: The energy-related aspects of the stimulus program are supposed to do more than double duty.\In fact, that is what should happen with programs such as the energy credits announced this week. They reduce our reliance on foreign oil, they cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases, they spur basic and applied research, they create jobs.\""We are encouraged by the breadth of technology in the applications. It highlights the range of technologies that is available today,"" said Matt Rogers, the Energy Department official responsible for implementing the department's role in the recovery act.\The projects approved Tuesday have created 2,000 jobs, according to forms filed by the recipients. More careful study of the jobs' impact, according to reliable academic methods, is planned once implementation gets further down the road, Rogers said.\The impact is not just domestic, either. The stimulus package's energy programs should help the U.S. secure a positive result out of the global climate summit meeting scheduled for Copenhagen in December.\Because the U.S. never implemented the Kyoto climate treaty, political leaders preparing for the Copenhagen meeting are skeptical of any professed U.S. commitment to reducing greenhouse gases.\Recent political events in the U.S. have fueled such skepticism. The health-care debate has stalled the Obama administration's efforts to pass a new cap-and-trade policy into law. And it is unlikely the Copenhagen summit can deliver a successor to Kyoto if the U.S. does not have major climate legislation in place beforehand.\With countries such as China and India eager to criticize U.S. emissions policies, the Obama administration needs any tool it can use to say the U.S. is getting serious about cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and related gases.\""Other countries are looking to the U.S.,"" Rogers said. ""This is a way to get down the learning curve on technologies that, in a cap-and-trade environment, would be quite valuable.""\Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, believes even small investments in alternative energy can help divert the U.S. from more than a century of oil-centric thinking. ""We're masters at incentivizing fossil fuel development,"" Beinecke said. ""We need to move toward investments that create energy efficiency and renewable fuels.""\Half a billion dollars is no big deal against the backdrop of a $787 billion stimulus package, the loss of manufacturing jobs, global climate change and the U.S. need for energy independence. Take a closer look, though, and it's impressive how far a relatively small energy investment can reach.\----------\dgreising@tribune.com"
49,"A small, bipartisan group of senators, after months of closed-door negotiations, is set to unveil an energy and climate bill Monday that will test President Barack Obama's ability to deliver on yet another major policy commitment -- and the nation's readiness to address a problem with far-reaching implications for the economy and the environment.\The bill, crafted by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., with industry groups and environmentalists, seeks to spur ""clean energy"" production and reduce the heat-trapping gas emissions that contribute to global warming, all without hurting consumers.\But those are complex, sometimes conflicting goals, and hammering out compromises that can win congressional approval may be an even tougher test of Obama's political skills than the health care overhaul or Wall Street regulation -- especially since the climate bill is unlikely to get unanimous Democratic support in the Senate and figures to need a significant number of Republican votes to pass.\Still, drafters said they will unveil the bill with significant industry support, including endorsements from General Electric, at least three oil companies and several large electric utilities that rely on coal.\Kerry said that ""major business is going to stand up with us.""\""What I'm confident of is that we are putting out a bill that can transform America's economy and add millions of jobs, increase national security and put America back into competition with China,"" he said, adding: ""It's got the ability to attract 60 votes.""\At its core, the proposed climate legislation would mandate steps to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. It would implement a ""cap and trade"" system for power plants and, eventually, factories, with strict curbs on the types of trading that would be allowed.\In a last-minute switch, the bill would require oil companies to obtain emissions permits. The negotiators scrapped plans to impose what would have amounted to a new tax on gasoline, a provision favored by several oil companies but which many senators and the White House feared would damage the bill in the eyes of voters.\Even so, the bill as written would likely raise fuel costs.\The legislation would immediately send two-thirds of the revenues from emissions permit sales directly back to consumers as refunds on their utility bills, Kerry said, and eventually refund nearly all the proceeds to consumers, in an effort to blunt energy cost increases. Small sums would be dedicated to reducing the federal budget deficit, investing in energy research and financing international climate change efforts.\The bill includes several efforts to win support from Republicans and business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, including incentives for new nuclear power plants, expanded offshore oil drilling, restrictions on state and federal power to enforce other environmental laws and sweeteners for Rust Belt manufacturers.\Many of those provisions anger environmentalists, while the emissions limits draw opposition from many business groups, Republicans and even some moderate Democrats.\Yet in contrast with earlier expectations, analysts say the bill could ultimately succeed in some form, especially if a half-dozen fence-sitting Republicans can be won over.\""Kerry and his colleagues are trying to figure out a fine line where they keep everybody on board,"" said David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington.\Interviews on Friday suggested the bill will need to evolve toward the right in order to lock down GOP support from a target list that includes Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, George LeMieux of Florida and George Voinovich of Ohio.\Critics of climate legislation have long argued that emissions limits would raise energy costs and cripple the economy. Several of them said this week that it appeared the Senate bill made only cosmetic changes to a House bill which they derisively dubbed ""cap and tax.""\Dan Holler of the free-market Heritage Foundation said the Senate plan appeared to keep the framework of the House bill and add only ""fluff to disguise the fact that they're going to raise energy prices.""\Both sides expect to launch a bruising public relations battle this week, with proponents arguing that the bill would boost national security, reduce oil imports and create jobs.\""It's really going to be a question of who controls the first several days of messaging on this,"" said Roger Ballentine, who runs Green Strategies Inc. in Washington.\Industry groups such as the Chamber and the American Petroleum Institute, which could finance vast ad campaigns to defeat the bill, held off judgment on Friday. ""Silence is a good thing,"" Ballentine said.\- - -\Clean vs. cost\PRO: The bill would cut heat-trapping gas emissions that contribute to global warming and give money to consumers as refunds on their utility bills, supporters say.\CON: Emissions limits would raise energy costs and hurt the economy, critics say.\-----------\jtankersley@tribune.com\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, Tribune Newspapers"
50,"Cap-and-trade bill a huge power grab\Luckily for us, the Environment and Public Works Committee thwarted an effort by the Senate to push through a bill by Kerry-Boxer on the damaging cap-and-trade legislation being pushed by the current administration.\According to the Congressional Budget Office and The Heritage Foundation reports, this bill would cost a family of four around $3,000 per year, cost 2.5 million jobs by 2035 and produce a cumulative Gross Domestic Product loss of $9.4 trillion between 2012 and 2035.\The Environmental Protection Agency and Kerry-Boxer say that it will only cost between $80 and $111 dollars per year but their numbers don't add up.\According to this bill, they are relying on doubling the number of nuclear power plants, which would mean building another 100 plants even though they never put that number in their bill.\The problem with this is that it also gives the government more power over the private sector. But just as with oil, coal and natural gas, the less government intervention the better.\This is nothing more than a power grab and huge tax increase put upon the American taxpayer, not to mention a lucrative business opportunity for Al Gore.\What they don't tell you is that temperature does not follow CO2, CO2 follows temperature. And, by the way, Debbie Halvorson voted for this bill and I can tell you first hand she knew not what she voted for. Don't take my word for it, check it out!\Thomas Morgan\Bloomington\Unit 5 redistricting makes things harder\I think the new Unit 5 redistricting plan needs revision. \Part of the plan affects so few people. The new redistricting will send about 30 students each year from Chiddix Junior High to Normal West while all others from Chiddix will be sent to Normal Community. From Parkside Junior High, about 20 students will go to Normal Community while all other students from Parkside will go to Normal West. \This plan is unfair. It is splitting up people. It is making friends say goodbye and is making people start all over. It is going to be extremely hard for those who are being sent to the opposite school from most of the other students from their junior high. \Starting high school is hard enough, now they have to start at a new school knowing only a small group of other students. \This topic is very close to me. I am one of the students who is affected by this new plan and some of my friends are, too. Because of this plan next year, I have to say goodbye to many of my friends because they will be at one school and I will be at the other. \This plan affects everyone, friends saying goodbye and students starting over.

It was described by Paul Swiech on the front page of the Oct. 28 Pantagraph. \I was impressed that the 200 people in the Bone Student Center were far more peaceful than the overflow crowd that I witnessed at a health care town hall sponsored by Rep. Tim Johnson at the Normal Public Library in early September. What a difference! \After Wendell Potter gave a very interesting and informative talk, several people calmly lined up at a microphone and asked questions. A three-member panel quietly assembled and discussed local issues with Mr. Potter. Then more people calmly asked more questions. All in all, it was the best health care forum I've ever attended.\At some point, Mr. Potter suggested several questions one could ask if one were confronted by a person who was opposed to a public option in a health care bill. Unfortunately, I was unable to write those questions down and I don't remember them. Could someone out there help me?\Also, in the Nov. 1 Pantagraph, the letter from Dr. Gill on Page D6 and ""A look at Democrats' health care plans"" and Dr. Nord's ""A physician's-eye view of health-care debate"" on Page D7 are all a good read. \Bob Warfield\Bloomington\Opppose music that insults women\All you have to do in this country to hear a rude and disrespectful comment towards women is turn on the radio. Many radio stations feature songs that degrade women and insult everything they have worked for over the years. \I am, indeed, proud to be an American. However, being part of a country that loves music in which it sends inappropriate messages about women is something to be ashamed of. \Radio stations may play ""clean"" versions of songs that only exclude cuss words, yet it still does not cover up the hurtful and terrible messages that the songs convey. \Some artists who perform this type of music include Lil Wayne, Akon and many more. These messages lead guys to think that they are superior to females - not to mention the fact that young girls who listen to these songs are also affected. They shall soon perceive that their gender is inferior to males and that women shouldn't be policewomen or judges or business owners, like they are today. \I urge the public to stand up to these insults to women and make a difference. If we change the subject of music many Americans listen to, we could be a better nation and a nation that can be looked up to by countries that mistreat women.\Kate Rich\Normal"
51," The list of President Bush's environmental misdeeds is long, activists allege: Proposing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, unleashing record numbers of snowmobiles into Yellowstone National Park and easing logging rules in the national forests, to name a few.\ Recently, environmentalists added another charge--gutting clean air standards.\ But unlike the other controversies, which are relatively easy to understand, the long-running clean air debate is filled with statistics, dense scientific calculations and wild invective.\ If you didn't know better, you'd think that air quality in much of this country is getting a lot worse.\ It's not, generally.\ However--and this is a big however--it could be improving faster.\ That is the core of the debate. And if President Bush is trying to portray himself as friendly to the environment, then the new rules quietly issued late on a recent Friday afternoon by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are not likely to help him achieve that goal.\ The new rules dictate how much pollution industrial plants such as refineries, manufacturing facilities and paper plants can churn into the air before triggering requirements for new pollution- control devices. Still more new rules--for a bevy of old, coal- fired power plants that have attracted much of the environmentalists' ire--are due next year. There's no doubt that the new rules favor smokestack industries, including many companies that are big contributors to Republican campaign causes. Those industries are rejoicing.\ Some of the new rules make sense. Some don't. Overall, the rules- -actually they are revisions of old rules commonly known as ""new source review"" or NSR--give companies more latitude to make changes without triggering further federal demands to clean up. That doesn't necessarily mean that companies will release more pollutants. It just means some of the changes could be exploited to do just that.\ Truth be told, NSR is a simple idea from the 1970s that has become ridiculously complicated in practice.\ It was a bargain struck between regulators and plant operators after the Clean Air Act of 1970 was passed. That act mandated strict new air pollution controls on power plants and other sources of pollution. But the plant operators argued that it would be too expensive to clean up the old pollution-belching plants. They'll be obsolete soon, they said, and closed. So hundreds of plants were grandfathered in, with one provision: If operators made major changes that increased pollution significantly (a ""new source""), they'd be forced to install new pollution controls.\ Years passed and nothing happened. Most of the plants kept running, and belching tons of pollution into the air. Finally, in 1999, two decades after the agreement, federal prosecutors sued 51 plants around the country, including one in Downstate Illinois, accusing them of flouting the NSR law by undertaking major modifications that produced more pollution without installing new controls. (Even though federal officials vow to pursue that lawsuit, the revised rules for power plants that are due next year could seriously undercut that lawsuit.)\ The NSR controversy won't be over any time soon. Several northeastern states, where prevailing winds push much of the pollution churned up in the Midwest, are planning to file suit to challenge the new rules for industrial plants.\ And some of the rules deserve to be tossed out. The most egregious: a new, potentially more forgiving limit set for some polluting factories before NSR is triggered. Instead of setting those limits based on the most recent pollution levels, the new rules allow some companies to pick out the worst two years in a decade, and use those as their new threshold.\ Eric Schaeffer, former director of the office of regulatory enforcement for EPA, warned that applying just that new rule would have allowed increased emissions of a single pollutant--nitrogen oxide--by some 124 tons a year at industrial facilities in Joliet and in Crawfordsville, Ind.\ All is not bleak however. There is a potential solution to the clean air debate that both sides, miraculously, agree upon. It's called ""cap and trade"" and it's been working on a limited basis for more than a decade.\ Here's how: Federal officials set a national limit or ""cap"" for emissions of certain pollutants--right now it's set for 9 million tons of sulfur dioxide, for example. Then the EPA tells each company that operates power plants or other significant sources of that pollution what they can emit. If a company's emissions fall below the cap yearly, then that company earns credits that it can ""trade""- -that is, sell--to other companies on the open market, or save for the future. Companies that exceed their limits are forced to buy those credits.\ Since 1990, the system has helped reduce sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, by 32 percent.\ Earlier this year, the Bush administration announced an expanded cap-and-trade program that would cover more pollutants in its ""Clear Skies"" initiative, legislation that would curb emissions of several dangerous pollutants. So far, that bill has gone nowhere in Congress.\ But now the Republicans are in control. There's some question about whether the caps proposed in the Clean Skies bill are restrictive enough, and there will be debate over how fast those caps are tightened on polluters. That's healthy. The caps need to be restrictive enough to shut down the worst polluters sooner--and move the rest toward either cleaning up or shutting down.\ Yes, that comes at a cost to companies and the consumers who buy their products. But simply loosening pollution standards on industry is shortsighted.\ Right now, Bush should also be pushing his agenda for cleaner air. He should realize that clean air is not a Republican or Democratic issue but rather a popular one. The president ignores that at his political peril."
52,"Sente, May are part of the status quo\Recently I saw an attractive mailer sent out by incumbent state Democrat Rep. Carol Sente of the 59th District in which she vowed to clean house by fighting corruption, ethics violations and wasteful spending, despite being selected by Democrats to replace Kathy Rigg because of her loyalty to the Democrat Party.\What caught my attention was Sente's push for the development of green technologies which she claims will create jobs and lessen our dependence on foreign oil.\Rep. Karen May, Democrat incumbent in the 58th District, not unlike Carol Sente and fellow Democrats in Springfield, is likewise a committed supporter of wind and solar power.\There was not a word of protest from either Reps. Sente or May when Exelon recently made the decision to waste the Zion Dual Nuclear Plant with its massive 2,100 megawatts of energy, even though I informed Karen May -- as a member of the House Environment and Energy Committee -- numerous times over this past summer about the pending decision and asked for some action on her part.\Consider these facts:\* Solar power costs four times more to produce than electricity generated by conventional means.\* Due to intermittent, variability, and unpredictability, wind farms must be backed up with conventional forms of electricity. A recent MIT study indicates that land-based wind energy will actually increase global temperatures.\* Many qualified scientists believe there are huge amounts of oil here in America and that it is retrievable and affordable to use. Oil is created in the earth's magma.\* Nuclear energy provides the biggest bang for the buck; it is a green, safe and reliable form of energy. The Navy has fueled its ships with nuclear power for decades without incident.\While Illinois and the rest of the nation are attempting to curtail the use of fossil fuels and have put nuclear power on hold, the whole world is powering up with nuclear!\Illinois is ill-served by Reps. Sente and May, who place wind and solar power over that of fossil fuels and nuclear. Both wind and solar fail miserably as viable sources of power. Their popularity is due to substantial state and federal subsidies given to investors.\Republican challengers Dan Sugue and Lauren Turelli understand that coal, oil and nuclear power are all essential to keep industry in Illinois in order to create jobs, to spur economic growth and to lift Illinois from its dismal rank of 48th in economic performance and 44th in economic outlook.\Additionally, Sugue and Turelli are committed to changing the state's culture of corruption, controlling excessive spending, and creating jobs. Most importantly, neither are beholden to the Democrat House Speaker Michael Madigan!\As Carol Sente votes with Speaker Madigan 84 percent of the time, while Karen May has an 87 percent voting record, have Sente and May suddenly experienced an epiphany? Will they really buck their own party by voting against corruption and excessive spending?\The choice should be an easy one.

53," The perils of climate change are attracting much attention these days, with a popular award-winning documentary on the subject, a UN panel emphasizing the dangers and widespread agreement among scientists that global warming presents a potentially catastrophic threat.\ The concern has prompted a flurry of legislative activity on Capitol Hill, with four major bills, soon to be five, vying for support and votes, and some measure appearing likely to pass. But it remains unclear how strong it will be, how far lawmakers are willing to go in restricting U.S. industry, and whether President Bush might veto a bill.\ The documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" spearheaded by former Vice President Al Gore, focused attention more clearly on the issue, especially after it won two Oscars last month, but it is not the only catalyst. In the last month, a United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a study determining that the world's temperature is rising and declaring with 90 percent certainty that human activity is the cause.\ Nearly a dozen energy companies have joined with leading environmental groups to form the United States Climate Action Partnership and have begun lobbying the federal government to institute strict standards for emissions reduction.\ Meanwhile, in the absence of binding national standards, many states, on their own or in regional consortia, have adopted laws to regulate emissions. Individual cities have even imposed regulations.\ ""Things are moving right now at an incredibly quick pace,"" said Antonia Herzog, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. ""I think the people in Congress who matter accept that global warming is a fact and are now trying to figure out how to address it in a responsible manner.""\ However, turning that political potential into a nationwide law may take time, despite pledges from Senate leaders to address the issue and promises from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to bring a bill up for a vote on the House floor by the summer. Although U.S. industry is increasingly on board, there are competing proposals for how to tackle the problem.\ ""It's going to be very complicated, with a huge amount of political infighting,"" said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank which opposes legislative efforts to combat global warming. ""We think we have a very good opportunity to stymie everything so that nothing will emerge.""\ Building consensus\ Although interest in global warming is increasing, enacting emissions controls has proved a sluggish enterprise at best; there has not been a new, overarching law on the subject since the Clean Air Act of 1990. Today the challenge is building consensus in a Congress with global warming naysayers.\ There appears to be at least a basis for dialogue, however, as all the bills propose a ""declining cap-and-trade"" system. Under that approach, an overall emissions limit would be established for a subset of polluters. Companies could then engage in trade, that is-- bidding, buying or selling permits--so each could continue to operate profitably while the overall level of pollutants would go down. Over time, as the cap is lowered, permits would decrease in value or be removed from circulation.\ ""People are coalescing around that as the broad approach, though there are differences on the particulars,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. ""There's some sense in the business community and in Congress that this is a tried- and-true approach.""\ It's a tack that was used successfully to limit acid rain- causing emissions under the Clean Air Act.\ ""When given a clear goal and an opportunity for markets to develop the technology to meet the goal, we've always met them,"" said Mark MacLeod, special projects director for Environmental Defense, an advocacy group. ""There's no reason to expect we couldn't achieve the goal this time.""\ Goals different\ The goals, however, differ from proposal to proposal. A bill offered by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I- Vt.) would aggressively reduce emissions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. At the other end of the spectrum, an as-yet- unintroduced plan from Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) ties emissions reduction to gross domestic product and does not guarantee any reduction in emissions.\ Because it's unlikely that any one bill will make it through unchanged, most observers are not expressly advocating any single approach.\ There is much more than just an emissions cap to discuss, as each bill also brings its own priorities for research. A proposal by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) includes controversial provisions for advancing nuclear technologies, while one from Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) focuses on small businesses. Several reward firms for taking early action to curb emissions.\ Some also see this as an opportunity to change the nation's energy habits more broadly.\ ""If we begin to tap not just energy efficiency, but solar power, wind energy, biofuels . . . we can make huge changes to cleaning up the environment, and in the process create millions of high-paying jobs,"" Sanders said.\ Some businesses seem willing to accept regulation in exchange for the promise of a foothold in the growing market for clean technologies. General Electric, a member of USCAP, earned about 7 percent of its 2006 revenue from so-called ecomagination projects-- wind turbines, improved-efficiency jet engines and other clean technologies.\ But too many incentives can corrupt the process, say those who oppose Congress legislating a global warming solution.\ ""A lot of people have figured out that if cap-and-trade is set up in the right way, they can make a lot of money,"" said Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\ He speculated that big businesses calling for climate change laws were eyeing quick profits from government subsidies for clean technologies and Wall Street transaction payoffs, rather than making a bona fide environmental investment.\ - - -\ Some provisions in Senate bills\ - A system employing limits, or caps, on pollutants and the purchase and sale of emissions credits by entities that exceed (buyers) and stay below (sellers) the caps\ - An oversight bureau for the sale or distribution and exchange of such credits\ - Fines for companies that exceed limits on greenhouse gas emissions\ - Tax credits for plug-in hybrid cars\ - Federal grants for clean-energy research and development\ - Aid to small businesses that lower greenhouse emissions\ - Clean-technology assistance to developing countries\ ----------\ kdemirjian@tribune.com\ Credit: By Karoun Demirjian, Washington Bureau"
54," Mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants is increasing nationwide, even as the Bush administration touts an overall decline in toxic chemicals released by industry into the environment.\ Though total mercury emissions decreased less than 2 percent from 2003 to 2004, the amount blown into the air by power plants increased 4 percent, a Tribune analysis of newly released federal data shows.\ Coal plants in 28 states, including Illinois, put more mercury into the air during 2004 than the year before, offsetting lower amounts of the hazardous metal from plants elsewhere.\ The increase is of particular concern in states like Illinois that rely heavily on coal to generate electricity, environmental groups say, because mercury tends to fall back to earth close to its source, and it takes only a small amount to contaminate waterways.\ Mercury becomes more dangerous as it moves up the food chain from fish to people. A recent federal study estimated that 410,000 babies are born each year at risk for mercury poisoning because of high levels in their mothers' bodies.\ Levels of the pollutant are high enough across the nation that 44 states advise people--especially women of childbearing age and young children--to avoid or limit eating certain types of fish.\ The increase in mercury from power plants comes as regulators and interest groups fiercely debate proposals that would limit emissions from utilities, the leading source of the metal, for the first time.\ Illinois and a handful of other states are pushing rules that would be more stringent than the Bush administration's proposal, which could give utilities at least another decade to install mercury controls.\ The administration also wants to give utilities the ability to buy the right to keep releasing mercury at some coal plants as long as emissions go down nationally over time--a system known as ""cap and trade.""\ Top officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency focused on the downward trend in all industrial pollution reported to the Toxics Release Inventory, an annual assessment of chemicals released into the nation's air, water and land.\ Total pollution reported to the EPA's inventory dropped by 4 percent from 2003 to 2004, the latest year for which figures are available. The overall decline in airborne mercury was due mostly to a large drop in emissions from cement kilns.\ The report ""demonstrates that economic growth and effective environmental protection can go hand in hand,"" said Linda Travers, acting chief of the EPA's Office of Environmental Information.\ Mercury is one of the last toxic substances released by power plants to be targeted for limits by environmental regulations. It has become a persistent problem even as levels of other airborne pollutants released by utilities drop, mostly because those chemicals are subject to federal standards.\ Coal plants generally are operating at higher capacity than before to meet increased demand for electricity. But though mercury emissions increased, emissions of two regulated pollutants, sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxide, a key ingredient in urban smog, still decreased from 2003 to 2004.\ ""This shows the Clean Air Act works when you enforce it,"" said Bruce Nilles, senior Midwest representative for the Sierra Club. ""When you don't, industry continues to increase pollution.""\ There are several explanations for why mercury emissions went up or down in various states.\ In Illinois, where about half the state's electricity comes from coal plants, most utilities have switched from coal mined within the state to sources in Wyoming and other Western states.\ Western coal is less expensive and contains lower amounts of sulfur, which is important for utilities facing federal requirements to reduce sulfur dioxide pollution.\ But the coal generally contains more mercury and generates less heat, meaning power plants have to burn more of it to produce the same amount of electricity.\ As a result, airborne mercury levels in Illinois jumped 28 percent from 1999 to 2002, the period when state power plants began to switch aggressively to Western coal, according to an analysis by the Illinois EPA.\ Top federal officials say the Illinois situation illustrates how their plan would let market forces decide how and where to best curb mercury emissions.\ ""We feel the flexibility of a cap and trade system is the best approach,"" said Jason Burnett, a senior policy adviser in the U.S. EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. ""It will allow companies to respond to changing economic conditions within a certain limit.""\ Heightened awareness about the dangers of mercury exposure has led politicians in Illinois and several other states to propose their own limits on emissions from power plants.\ Gov. Rod Blagojevich is pushing state rules that would give coal plants in Illinois three years to reduce mercury pollution by 90 percent.\ Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm recently moved to force coal plants in her state to make similar reductions by 2015. Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Georgia also are considering state rules.\ Utilities contend the proposals would be too costly and provide few if any health benefits. They back the national proposal, which would give the industry until at least 2017 to cut emissions by 70 percent and let companies trade the right to pollute.\ ""You would be creating a financial incentive to have the largest reductions from the largest sources of mercury,"" said Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a utility trade group.\ A similar trading system has cut sulfur dioxide pollution over the last decade. But many scientists and public health experts think it shouldn't be used for mercury, which is far more toxic and accumulates in humans and wildlife.\ The U.S. EPA's own estimates have identified the Chicago area as a ""hot spot"" where relatively large amounts of mercury fall back to earth. Agency scientists also found that nearly two-thirds of the pollutant comes from sources within Illinois.\ ""This is why the federal rule is way too little, way too late,"" said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center. ""We should be taking strong steps to ensure Illinois utilities aren't able to continue creating mercury hot spots in our state's rivers and lakes.""\ - - -\ Mercury pollution from power plants on the rise\ Coal plants in 2004 emitted more mercury pollution than the year before, a Tribune analysis of new federal data shows.

55,"The signs are there:\Fix is in for 2012\If you think the Iranian election was rigged or if you are wondering how Minnesota ended up with more votes than voters in heavily Democratic areas, well, hold on to your seats, you aint seen nothin yet.\Obama is already setting up the mechanism to ensure his victory in the 2012 presidential election. He has given $2 billion to ACORN (the organization that manages to come up with more votes for Democrats than voters), he is putting his people in charge of the census in order to skew the population counts to favor Democrats and, scariest of all, he wants to grant amnesty to illegal aliens in hopes that they will vote for him.\The 2012 election is not that far away. Since Obama is already planning to rig the election to favor himself, it is not too early for us to do all we can to make sure he does not get away with it.\Our country made a huge mistake in the last election. Lets do all we can to correct our blunder in the next election.\Norman E. Janowicz\Spring Grove\Fix malpractice law,\fix health care\The House of Representatives, the same House that gave us the onerous cap and trade carbon emissions bill, has now passed a health care reform bill that will only add insult to injury to U.S. taxpayers. The main funding of this bill is to come from surtaxes on the wealthiest individuals who are already paying more than 40 percent of all income taxes. Add the yet-undetermined tax of cap and trade, and in some instances state income tax increases are you listening taxpayers of Illinois? the top marginal rate could exceed 55 percent for the ""wealthiest"" among us.\Among those ""wealthiest"" are the small business owners who are responsible for 70 percent of all jobs created in the U.S. and who pay their taxes as regular, individual or joint filers. No fancy corporate lawyers or tax departments help these job creators figure out how to avoid paying taxes.\Congress and the Obama administration have gone after private insurance companies, hospital groups, doctors organizations and big pharmaceutical companies to wring out savings to help pay for covering the 48 million uninsured in this country, plus cutting Medicaid and Medicare programs. One curious group left out of all cost cutting and tax increasing is lawyers.\There is no argument that throughout our medical community all health care currently undertaken is done defensively to mitigate the chances of being sued for malpractice. Redundant tests, office visits and medical procedures are all done not to ensure patients receive the best care possible but to ensure no one associated with that care ends up in court.\We have bankruptcy judges that handle the smallest cases to those in the multimillion- if not billion-dollar cases without jury trials. Those judges are appointed based on their expertise in finance and the business world. If a person or business can be absolved of his debts by one judge, why cant a single judge make similar judgments on the viability of a persons claim against the medical industry?\If every facet of medical care is under the microscope and is being targeted for cost savings and/or tax increases its only fair that the biggest obstacle to true health care reform, the tort bar, come under the same microscope.\Steve Sarich\Grayslake\Arizona sheriff\has the right idea\I read in the Daily Herald the Illinois budget is unbalanced and will require cuts in spending to make up the difference. Among plans to reduce spending is an early release of prisoners. On the same day I read a woman on probation for a 2007 DUI rammed into a home through a garage and into the kitchen, an incident that could have killed the woman in the home. On the next page I read a man was charged with his seventh DUI. Yes, his seventh! He had been sentenced to six years in prison on a DUI in 2007 but released on parole. This is only 2009! Yes, he only served two years and had four years left to serve on his sentence. This man should never have been out of prison, let alone on the streets again ready to kill someone.\Our courts are already doing early release of rape, robbery and assault criminals, saying they have to because the prisons are full. Our legislators say we have to because of the cost. Well I ask you, have any of you heard of Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizonas Maricopa County?\Joe believes inmates shouldnt live on taxpayer money and enjoy things that many taxpayers cant even afford, but Joe doesnt let them out early, nor should we. In the early 1990s Joe started a highly successful ""tent city jail"" in the desert. Joe cut costs of keeping inmates.\Complaining one day about the tents when the temperature went over 100, one of the inmates said ""it feels like a furnace in here."" Joe told all of the inmates that it was 120 degrees in Iraq and our soldiers are in full uniform living in tents, and they didnt even commit any crimes so shut your mouths.\Maybe Illinoiss climate doesnt allow prison tents, but maybe our legislators could think outside the box for a change and contract with Joe to take our inmates. The heck with the ACLU on this issue! We dont need an early release, we need Joe.\Leo A. Dietrich\Lake Villa\Nuclear power is sensible way to go\If legislators like 10th District Congressman Mark Kirk are really concerned about reducing our dependence on foreign oil in favor of green technology, why is there so little discussion about nuclear power?\Nuclear plants are the lowest cost and safest electricity generator, hands down, in addition to being green.\To generate the same amount of energy with wind as an average-sized nuclear plant 1,000 megawatts you would need 270 square miles filled with wind turbines. By contrast, a nuclear facility fits on less than 1 square mile.\Currently, a dual-reactor power plant built by ComEd in 1973 stands idle in Zion. Initially some steam generator tubes were found leaking, but the tubes were closed off and the facility continued to run without jeopardizing the employees, the area citizens or the environment. The steam generators could have been replaced for $435 million, but instead ComEd decided to prematurely shutter and close the facility in January 1998.\David Hollein, a resident of Barrington Hills, formerly the Westinghouse project engineer for all the Commonwealth nuclear plants built by Westinghouse and General Electric, and who was intimately involved with the design of the nuclear units at the Zion dual reactor site, has for years (like a lone voice in the wilderness) been trying to alert legislators and citizens to the vast treasure of energy that remains shuttered at Zions dual nuclear reactor site and has been demanding a second look.\Repeated overtures made to local legislators here in Lake County, especially to Republican state Rep. JoAnn Osmond and Democratic state Sen. Michael Bond, have all been ignored.\It is folly to believe that wind turbines and solar panels can replace coal and oil. More, not less, energy will be needed in years to come. Nuclear is the only sensible way to go.\Nancy J. Thorner\Lake Bluff"
56,"Epic battles over health care, climate change and financial regulation have been a boon for the lobbying industry, which spent a record $3.47 billion talking to the White House, federal agencies and Congress last year, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. That's a 140 percent increase from the $1.44 billion spent in 1998. Lobbying by major Chicago-area companies reflects their interest in decisions being made in Washington. Based on records compiled by the center at OpenSecrets.org, here is a look at some recent activity. This spending does not include political contributions or activities performed by industry associations on a company's behalf.\Allstate Corp.\The insurance lobby is among the most well-funded in Washington. At Allstate, lobbying expenditures have increased 450 percent in a decade. The industry continues to fend off proposals to weaken or eliminate an antitrust exemption that allows the sharing of data on accidents and injuries to set rates.\The strongest repeal effort came in 2007 amid post-Hurricane Katrina anger, hence the spike in the chart. Allstate's position is that it has enough data to set rates on its own, so it's OK with giving up the antitrust exemption.\But that's only if a patchwork of state regulations is replaced with national standards that some say would be more lax. The shop is led by Dean Pappas.\Total lobbying spending\2000-2009\2009: $3,850,000\2009 top lobbying issues\The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires lobbyists to file a quarterly report detailing its lobbying activities; the reports are organized by general issue areas.

It also was the second-largest recipient of federal contracts in fiscal year 2009 ($20.1 billion).\And it is willing to go far to protect those dollars.

Exelon's staple, nuclear power, doesn't emit greenhouse gases, so cap-and-trade would give Exelon a boost over its coalburning rivals. But Exelon's overall expenditures pale in comparison to those of its chief opponents, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In 2009, the chamber spent $144.5 million*, the most of any individual lobbying entity in the nation and a nearly 60 percent increase from 2008; Exxon finished second at $27.4 million.\Total lobbying spending\2000-2009\2009: $4,573,000\2009 top lobbying issues\The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires lobbyists to file a quarterly report detailing its lobbying activities; the reports are organized by general issue areas.

57,"As the first anniversary of Barack Obama's presidency rolls around, a fresh wave of polling shows his approval ratings have dropped amid deep public anxiety about unemployment. Much as they say they like Obama personally, people express unhappiness with his handling of the economy and health care.\Obama's advisers are plotting ways to revive his political prospects and rebuild the unique coalition that propelled him into office on Jan. 20, 2009. But the overriding question for 2010 is: Can he rebound?\It won't be easy. Here are some of his options as he moves past the one-year mark, and their potential strengths and weaknesses:\What Obama cannot do\1. Coast on his charisma. In the 2008 election campaign, Obama-mania was rampant. The story of a young, handsome, smart black candidate who hadn't spent years marinating in partisan Washington stirred many Americans. Obama used the public's fascination with him to maximum effect.\But his charisma was centered on his personal charm, stirring rhetoric and the oft-repeated promise to replace the bitterly partisan stalemate in Washington with a more civil, cooperative, forward-focused administration.\Now the political chemistry is dramatically different: The lingering economic crisis has produced unemployment, home foreclosures and lost savings on a scale not seen in many Americans' lifetimes. And Obama's sagging poll numbers show that voters today care less about a president's dreams for the future than about his understanding and empathy for their pain and insecurity in the present.\As Democratic pollster Peter Hart put it in an interview: ""He needs to feel the hurt and feel what's happening in the country.""\2. Load up the 2010 agenda. Obama kicked off his presidency with the legislative equivalent of an avalanche -- complex and controversial proposals for everything from overhauling health care and combating climate change to reformulating immigration policy and shifting the nation's economic focus to advanced technology and green jobs.\The result is likely to be passage of historic health care legislation, but congressional Democrats are exhausted and voters are angry at the perceived lack of attention to their most pressing problems, including jobs.\Obama must limit his commitments and pursue a more stripped-down, targeted agenda in his sophomore year, Democratic politicians and strategists said. Health care proved an untimely detour -- and the White House can't afford another one, some said.\""The timing was very bad for it (health care) because of all the angst out there,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\Thinning the agenda is risky, though. Latinos want a comprehensive immigration overhaul, a promise Obama has already delayed a year. He has also vowed to toughen regulation of the financial sector and curb global warming through a ""cap-and-trade"" system that would limit harmful emissions -- but also raise prices.\""If U.S. unemployment stays at 10 percent he can get three more Nobel Prizes and he'll be a one-term president,"" said former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.. ""The need to create jobs is the overwhelming economic and social imperative. If you're not seeing job growth in the 300,000-400,000-a-month range, forget cap-and-trade.""\3. Keep courting Republicans. It was supposed to be a post-partisan presidency and Obama gave it a go. He invited Republicans to the White House for a Super Bowl party last year and spent months chasing after a handful of GOP votes on health care and the stimulus -- with little to show for an effort that irritated some of his supporters.\The oppositional stance from the Republicans suggests that investing more time in this project, particularly in an election year, is a lost cause. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist, said: ""Rather than work to placate and accommodate the Republicans, he just needs to defeat them.""\What Obama can do\1. Use legislation for political advantage. A potent weapon for Obama and the Democrats is the legislative calendar. They control it. Obama on Thursday rolled out his ""financial crisis responsibility fee,"" a tax on large financial institutions, most of which collected federal bailout money. Whatever else, the bill is a means of dividing the two parties and energizing the Democratic base by invoking the unpopular Wall Street bailout.\Obama, speaking from the White House on Thursday, employed some of the sharpest populist rhetoric he has used to date: ""We want our money back, and we're going to get it.""\2. Draw upon his personal credibility. The polling is worrisome for Obama, but there are bright spots. For one thing, most people respect him. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed that by a margin of 56-37 percent, voters believe Obama is ""honest and trustworthy.""\Overall, support among independents -- a major part of Obama's winning coalition in 2008 -- has trailed off. Even so, 64 percent of independents say they think Obama has strong leadership qualities, compared with 33 percent who do not.\As his supporters see it, these are promising signs. It was inevitable that Obama's job approval ratings would suffer amid such economic distress, they argue.\""You don't have to be a political genius to know that in this environment, it's very hard to maintain very high poll numbers. We're the governing party,"" said White House senior adviser David Axelrod.\""We didn't create the mess that we're in, but we're the responsible party now and that brings some heat down on us.""\But the fact that Americans still admire Obama is something he can try to build upon, his supporters say.\""With the hand of cards he was dealt, no president would have high approval ratings,"" said Lanny Davis, who was White House counsel in the Clinton administration. ""But people still like him. The likeability factor is going to be the source of Barack Obama's strength.""\3. Capitalize on successes overseas. Obama faces no shortage of challenges abroad: Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan to name a few. But as evidenced by his Nobel Peace Prize, he has made strides in improving the image of the United States through a more cooperative, multilateral approach.\Obama visited more than 20 countries in his first year, a presidential record. He is well positioned to capitalize on the good will and personal relationships he is building abroad.\""I think Americans love seeing their president leading the free world. We want to be respected, and we know we need more allies and fewer enemies,"" Begala said.\""Americans are tired of their troops bearing the lion's share of the global burden because of the Bush go-it-alone policy. So the more Obama is seen as leading the world, the better.""\- - -\Barack Obama's report card\On Jan. 20, Barack Obama was sworn in and began his historic presidency, facing immense challenges but riding a tide of hope for success. A year later, here's what he has done and left undone -- and where he has deferred.\Actions completed\Children's health care: In February, Obama signed legislation to expand publicly funded health insurance for children. His predecessor, President George W. Bush, had blocked similar measures. The bill aimed to provide government-subsidized insurance to 4 million mostly low-income children, reducing the number of uninsured children by half, and was funded primarily by an increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.\Afghanistan: After an extensive review of American war strategy, Obama this winter ordered 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan with the charge of reversing the Taliban's momentum and stabilizing the government -- and, ultimately, with eradicating al-Qaida havens along the border with Pakistan. Deployment begins this year with a target date to begin withdrawal in the summer of 2011.\Economic stimulus: Obama signed a $787 billion stimulus bill into law just weeks after taking office, aiming to ease the recession. The White House says the initiative has saved jobs and staved off an even deeper recession.\Supreme Court: Obama put the first Hispanic justice on the high court when his team won confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor last year. Confirmed by a vote of 68-31, the Yale Law School graduate became the third woman to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice.\High on the to-do list\Health overhaul: Obama helped guide a major overhaul of the nation's health care system through the House and Senate, an unprecedented achievement. He is trying to negotiate a final version with congressional leaders, though a Republican victory in Tuesday's special Senate election in Massachusetts would present significant new hurdles.\Improving the intelligence system: The failed al-Qaida attempt to down a Northwest Airlines plane on Christmas Day revealed gaps in the system for detecting and preventing terrorist plots. A full-scale review showed the need for numerous improvements, and also provided a reminder of the potential for great disaster.\Job creation: While the White House points to economic growth and other signs of recovery, including a slowdown in the loss of jobs, Republicans are talking instead about the staggering number of people still out of work. The White House is proposing additional steps to create jobs and will have new initiatives in the future.\International engagement: Many analysts credit Obama -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year -- with changing the U.S. image abroad by emphasizing multilateralism and collaboration. But he still has to translate good will into achievement on a range of vexing subjects, including stopping the nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, diminishing conflict in the Middle East and improving tenuous relations with Russia, China and the Islamic world.\Items deferred\Guantanamo closure: Ordering shutdown of the military prison in Cuba was one of the first things Obama did last January, but emptying the prison has proved harder than expected. New worries about al-Qaida activity on the Arabian Peninsula inspired the U.S. to halt the flow of Yemeni detainees to their home country, further complicating the plan to empty and shutter the detention center.\Immigration: As a candidate, Obama supported creating a pathway to citizenship for many of the nation's illegal immigrants. But he has yet to push for legislation to overhaul immigration laws.\Gays in the military: Obama's promise to repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy governing gays and lesbians in the armed forces is on hold while the White House and lawmakers work to build support for its repeal.\-------------\cparsons@tribune.com\pnicholas@tribune.com\Credit: By Peter Nicholas, Tribune Newspapers"
58," Thanks for a terrific Special Olympics year\ On June 21, I had the distinct pleasure of representing all of Illinois Law Enforcement at the opening ceremonies of the Special Olympics summer games in Bloomington/Normal.\ What made this year so special was that I was able to present a check for $1 million to these true sports enthusiasts.\ Those of you who have known me through the years, know that I have been involved with the Law Enforcement Torch Run for over 15 years now, and when I was asked to take over the program five years ago, one of the many goals which we, as a state committee, set down was to not only raise awareness for the more than 18,000 athletes which we serve, but to also reach this million dollar goal.\ What an accomplishment for the law enforcement community. What makes it even more commendable is that the individuals who helped make this goal a reality did so through volunteering their own time. Some plunged into Lake Michigan with us on a very cold, snowy day in March in Lake Bluff and many conducted community fund- raising events and others ran for several hundred miles throughout Illinois, always carrying the Flame of Hope with its flame burning brightly.\ While there will always continue to be criticism of the law enforcement profession, it is my hope, that for a least one brief moment, communities throughout Illinois will take ownership of and acknowledge the efforts of their law enforcement officers for this magnificent accomplishment. These officers and other members of law enforcement related fields freely give of their time, year-in and year-out to make this goal a reality.\ I would especially like to thank three particular groups of individuals. First, everyone who has participated this year throughout Kane County and the Fox Valley area. I am very proud to say that every law enforcement group in Kane County participated in our efforts.\ Next, to the residents and business community of East Dundee, who were responsible for over $20,000 this year. Yours and the village boards' continued support is very much appreciated by our police department.\ Finally, to the now more than 19,000 athletes we so proudly support. Your pride, enthusiasm and honest effort has brought out the best in every one of us. Keep up your smiles and love of life through your participation in sporting events, your are true ambassadors for what sports is really all about, effort.\ Ignacio ""Joe"" Pena\ Police chief\ East Dundee\ Hear another view of terror war on July 24\ Hans Von Sponeck will be coming to McHenry County College on July 24 at 7 p.m. to help us all understand the current situation in Iraq better. He is the former United Nations Humanitarian Co- Coordinator for Iraq.\ Sept. 11. Our president has said we are at war. I would not be a good American if I did not allow myself to have questions regarding a military campaign against Iraq.\ Saddam Hussein is our enemy. I do have humanitarian concerns about the people, the civilians who suffer, especially the young children. This is a country where one in seven children die before they reach the age of 5. Economic sanctions have worsened the plight of these citizens.\ Many have asked for a separation between the economic and military sanctions including Kuwait recently at the Arab summit in Beirut. Could there be a connection between this type of policy and terrorism against the United States?\ How can we prevent terrorism without acknowledging the motivation of terrorists? How do we change the mindset that is breeding the violence? How many understand the complexities of the Middle East?\ I invite you to hear von Sponeck, stretch your thinking to include humanitarian issues when viewing our ""war"" on terrorism. Who is to say what is right in the face of suffering, especially our own, but how do we begin to view a solution? We cannot eradicate terrorism, we can only displace when and where it occurs.\ We must view the motivations, and the reason for the hate that drives the terrorists, while being ever diligent to protect what rights we value in this country.\ While there is an ever-increasing focus on faith, faith-based initiatives, I am hard pressed to discover what faith allows the starvation of women and children.\ Sheila Luecht\ Crystal Lake\ May freedom of choice rule November ballot\ The run for state offices this year is very strange. Rod Blagojevich, the Democrat, has about three times as much money in his campaign fund as does the Republican, Illinois General Attorney Jim Ryan. That's the opposite of normal.\ Illinois House leader Lee Daniels has resigned his position as head of the Illinois Republican Party because of allegations that his staff illegally worked on campaigning for Republican candidates while being paid for the state. That's what you'd normally expect to hear about Chicago Democrats.\ In previous years, we'd expected Chicago Democrats to be indicted for corrupt political practices. Now, it's all corrupt Republicans. Thanks to Operation Safe Roads, Republican Gov. George Ryan may have doomed all Republican candidates who are marginal winners.\ Former (reformed?) Republican Illinois Rep. Cal Skinner of Crystal Lake has filed as the Libertarian candidate for governor. The Libertarian candidate for lieutenant governor is Taxpayers United of Illinois head Jim Tobin. The Republican Party is trying to have them removed from the November ballot..\ Hopefully, the Republicans won't use state workers this time to remove third-party candidates from the ballot. Oddly, the Republican Party has always considered the Libertarians to be a major threat. Hopefully, freedom of choice will prevail, and the Libertarian slate will be on the November ballot in Illinois.\ Gerry Walsh\ Crystal Lake\ Bush, GOP take care of friends at our cost\ It is really great that Doug Hoeft is anti-smoking, a known and documented health risk. However, I wish he would apply the same or greater amount of effort on the over all problem of air pollution.\ He could start by lobbying against his own party's effort to undermine the current clean air laws in thus country.\ The Canadian based North American Commission For Environment Cooperation estimates that the next five years, will see 2,000 new power plants mostly in the United States. Most of them will run on cheap but high-polluting soft coal.\ The proposal to deregulate this industry historically decreases money spent of energy conservation and pollution controls. The funds allotted to this ""clean air"" approach was cut from $2.4 billion in 1995 to $1.4 billion in 1999.\ It is estimated that the NAFTA countries use of energy will increase as follows: Mexico, 66 percent; U.S., 21percent; and Canada, 14 percent.\ This trend only serves to increase vast areas of pollution designated as Superfund sites. The Superfund bill passed in 1980, but due to a Republican-controlled Congress, the tax to fund these cleanups was eliminated.\ The original fund usually contained around $4 billion, but now has less than $25 million. Each site requires $200 million to clean. The Bush administration has decided that the tax was too burdensome so when funds run out, the taxpayer will foot the bill, not the polluters. In the meantime more sites are being created.\ The Clean Air Act has been watered down by a squabbling Congress, which has destroyed much of its effectiveness. Some EPA officials have resigned in disgust as the department's own ominous figures have been dismissed by the Bush administration.\ The EPA's attempts to enforcement regulations were even backed by the Justice Department, which has found that the ""applications of Clean Air regulations were correct.""\ The head of the EPA, who was roundly criticized for her reputation when appointed, has been publicly rebuked by her own boss, George Bush.\ In March, the American Medical Association reported a strong link between lung cancer and the fine particles in air pollution caused by power plants.\ The Bush administration has come up with its own plan, called ""Clear Skies."" It is just another pretty and misleading title. It does little to reduce the particulates that cause lung cancer and emphysema.\ The plan adopts the current ""cap and trade"" methods dreamed up by the previous Bush adminitration. That is, you are given a limit to which you may pollute. If you have extra credits, then you can sell them to someone else who can't meet their limit. The plan delivers only a fraction of what it promises at a slower rate.\ According to the Natural Resources Defense Council and others, ""compared to current law, the Bush plan allows three times more toxic mercury emissions, 50 percent more toxic sulfur (this makes acid rain) and thousands of times more smog-forming nitrogen oxide.\ The administration would delay compliance with even these weak standards by up to a decade longer. Cap and trade may reduce pollutants overall, but local problems will be severe, except at the Bush ranch.\ The EPA plan basically limits sulfur dioxide emissions to two million tons a year by 2010. The Bush plan is a gift to the power polluters.\ Generally, it shifts costs from polluters to the everyday taxpayers in the form of medical bills so George's friends can contaminate as they please.\ Raleigh Sutton\ Elgin\ God doesn't care about nationalistic debates\ I am deeply troubled by the uproar over the court's ruling on the Pledge of Allegiance, especially the xenophobia and hostility from people like Terry Tubb and Jim Vane (Daily Herald, July 12).\ They make peculiar but often-repeated arguments that the Founding Fathers would never stand for such a ruling or that anybody who makes the personal choice not to say the words ""under God"" in the pledge are somehow anti-American and should be kicked out of this country. (Or as Tubb puts it, ""his"" country.)\ People like Tubb cry for more national unity and think the way to achieve unity is by making others conform to their own beliefs (as if ""mouthing the words"" to an oath ordering faith in God tied with country will somehow accomplish that).\ He tells us how proud he is that his preschool son recites the pledge on demand. I wonder, if his son ever decided one day not to recite the pledge, would he practice what he preaches and kick his own son out of the country?\ Some people use small excerpts from the Constitution as justification for requiring God to be embedded in our government. By that same argument, we should bring back slavery, because it was allowed in the Constitution and the Founding Fathers practiced it as well.\ It flabbergasts me that many people in America still equate God with nationalism or politics. Despotic nations - throughout history and today - use religion to convince their citizens of ""divine rule"" or a ""mandate from heaven"" - that the government has authority from God to do as it sees fit on not just its own citizens, but those of other countries as well.\ People like to say that God created man in his own image, but man seems to create God in their own nation's image. This misguided patriotism doesn't just serve as an extension of their religion; it becomes a religion unto itself.\ As an Army veteran who does happen to believe in a God and who did recite the pledge in elementary school, I can attest that faith in God is not a prerequisite to allegiance to one's country.\ True patriotism comes from the heart, not the mouthing of words under pressure or coercion from others. Not reciting the pledge doesn't make you any less of an American, just like reciting the pledge doesn't make you a good American.\ Anybody can say the pledge, including Osama Bin Laden. It doesn't make you a good American. (Timothy McVeigh probably recited the pledge in school, too. Did that make him a good American?)\ Our great fault as Americans today is we continue to place religious significance on things of our own human creation. I don't believe God cares about being named on our money, what team wins the Super Bowl, which political party to vote for and what flag you pledge allegiance to. You shouldn't, either.\ I would say to people like Tubb: If you really want to be proud of your kids, wait for them to say the pledge because they volunteer to on their own. They will really understand what it means to be an American, and maybe you will as well.\ Grant Crowell\ Carpentersville\ Liberals and lawyers are costing us dearly\ Ever wondered who came up with the liberal philosophy? It's not hard to figure out ... it's lawyers! By promoting and legislating liberal laws, they have given themselves more power and, therefore, a greater need.\ Without liberalism, everyone would have to follow the same laws with the same punishment. Just look at a few absurd examples: You spill hot coffee on yourself, and someone else is at fault. You come into the country illegally; the government is supposed leave you food and water. We want to protect our borders from terrorists and we can't even profile the very people who want to destroy us. Our judges (ex-lawyers) want to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. For what? For one dope who doesn't want to believe?\ Are we becoming a nation ruled by the few for the few!\ A company files bankruptcy, and who suffers? The suppliers, the employees, the stockholders and eventually the economy! But that doesn't matter; lawyers still make their money whether they win or lose. So the only time it is really beneficial for a lawyer to win a case is if it is so far left or out of line that they eventually will be chosen for the next absurd case and charge more. Doesn't matter about right or wrong, good or evil, or even if justice is being served, just as long as they line their pockets. I wonder what will happen once the lawyers sue all the big corporations out of business. I guess they will just have to sue each other, and guess what? We will still be stuck with the bill!\ It's time we make lawyers accountable just like accountants and everyone else! If a lawyer takes on a case and loses, he (or she) should have to pay! For wasting our time and money.\ G. Frost\ Barrington"

Why is gas so high? The prices of $1.50/gallon gas and $40/barrel oil worked for everyone, including the oil companies, in 2011, and the world has more supply than ever in history.
\
The reasons are basic: The Obama administration didn't approve the Keystone pipeline, clean coal research in Mattoon, drilling in the Gulf or Alaska or new nuclear plants. It approved the now-bankrupt Solyndra (losing more than $535 million), new environmental regulations on coal plants, tried to pass cap and trade and supported Brazilian oil development.
\
Those actions signaled oil companies that they could charge whatever they wanted. President Obama himself said the reason for these actions was to promote ""clean fuel"" and save the environment.
\
University of Illinois Professor Don Wuebbles has repeated the same mantra: ""Scientific evidence clearly indicates that not only is our climate changing in the U.S. and worldwide but that human activities are playing a major role in bringing about the observed changes."" Of course, reality is totally different: 25,000 American scientists say ""there is no human-caused global warming.""
\
The father of global warming Gala theory, scientist James Lovelock, said his own predictions (and Al Gore's) were incorrect and that ""the problem is we don't know what the climate is doing."" Other examples of incorrect data observation abound.
\
Yes, the climate is changing. It has for hundreds of thousands of years. It is run by the sun, oceans and volcanoes, and we don't know how. We all want clean air and a livable environment. Common sense and science say developing the U.S.'s national resources now won't hurt them but will save us billions at the pump and create thousands of new American jobs.

60,"
This is not the way the race in the 13th Congressional District was supposed to end.
\
A year ago, it appeared that the contest in the newly drawn congressional district, which covers Champaign-Urbana and vast areas of central Illinois southwest to Edwardsville, would feature two former state representatives -- U.S. Rep. Tim Johnson, R-Urbana, and Jay Hoffman, a onetime Democratic floor leader in the Illinois House from Collinsville.
\
Both have dropped out of the race, Hoffman leaving long before the March 20 primary election and Johnson shortly after it.
\
They've been replaced by three candidates, none of whom has won an election before:
\
-- Republican Rodney Davis, who was appointed the candidate by GOP county chairmen in the district.
\
-- Democrat David Gill, who defeated the party-backed candidate by 163 votes.
\
-- And independent John Hartman, who had to collect more than 5,000 signatures to get on the ballot.
\
The campaign thus far has been marked by negative television ads, more than $3.5 million in spending by super PACs and other outside groups, and a scarcity of debates among the candidates. Two of the candidates -- Davis and Gill -- finally had their first face-to-face public meeting last week at Illinois State University; Hartman wasn't invited.
\
But all three candidates did complete candidate questionnaires from The News-Gazette. Those responses, as well as remarks made at last week's debate, are the basis for these position statements on various issues. For more complete responses, and the answers to more questions from the questionnaire, see the online version of this story at www.news-gazette.com.
\
Health care
\
Davis: ""Obamacare must not only be repealed, but also replaced with a comprehensive plan that keeps the vital patient-doctor relationship in place and encourages innovative solutions to address our nation's health care needs,"" he said.
\
Any new program, he said, should include tort reform, insurance pools that cross state lines, coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and a provision allowing children to stay on a parent's insurance until age 26.
\
Gill: Says he would not have voted for Obamacare but supports it now, although he prefers ""a program that's still to be devised.""
\
His program, he said, would be similar to Medicare for everyone.
\
""It's a tax-based program that doesn't involve an increase in people's taxes; in fact, it involves a decrease in the effective surtax they pay today,"" Gill said. ""Whether they know it or not, they're throwing 20 to 40 percent of their health care budget away to fund private health insurance, their profiteering and their marketing. It's money that they ought to have back in their pockets.""
\
Hartman: ""Given today's gridlock, if we repeal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we will probably end up with nothing, and that would be a setback to the estimated 32 million people who will gain coverage under it. Not surprisingly, the facts tell us that Americans without health insurance are sicker and die younger than those of us with health insurance. So I would not vote for its outright appeal, but would seek to improve its flaws,"" Hartman said.
\
Like Gill, he points to Medicare as an efficient, cost-effective program.
\
""For example, we know that Medicare's administrative overhead draws 3.6 cents from every health care dollar it processes. The Canadian system's administrative overhead draws less than 2 cents. The private insurers in the U.S. draw out 11.7 cents per dollar,"" he said. ""The New England Journal of Medicine reported a few years back that our entangled bureaucracy cost the average American $1,059 per year, compared to $307 for the single-payer system in Canada.""
\
Federal budget
\
Davis: ""We must cut federal spending and live within the means of our current annual federal revenue. I do not support raising taxes to achieve a balanced budget, and I do not believe we have a revenue problem' as some have espoused. We must enact policies which encourage private job creation to stimulate the economy. A robust economy, in combination with a restrained federal budget, will put us on the path to balancing our books and starting to pay down our national debt.""
\
Gill: ""I'm someone who believes that we need spending cuts and revenue increases, with those revenue increases coming in the form of having the millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share once again in this country. And making sure that corporations pay their fair share, rather than having a large number of corporations that currently pay zero or even a negative effective tax rate.""
\
""I think certainly we ought to have spending cuts as well. It's a matter of priorities. We have a priorities problem in this country. I think that the defense budget need not be so bloated as it is. I'm somebody who thinks we ought to be getting out of Afghanistan now, rather than somewhere down the road. I'm someone who has long said that we ought not be giving subsidies to the fossil fuel companies like Exxon-Mobil. It's difficult to make that kind of change when you've got a Congress that has a lot of guys who take checks from Exxon-Mobil.""
\
Hartman: ""The polarization of the two major parties and the hesitancy of party members to break with their perceived party orthodoxy have kept us from making progress. As an independent, I do not have this problem, and there are multiple budget plans that I could support, and these happen to be the plans that offer the best chances of passage. Though I can provide constructive criticism of the plans, taken in total, I would support the Simpson-Bowles plan, the Domenici-Rivlin plan and the Senate's Gang of Six outline plan. The deficiencies in these plans are not nearly as bad as the danger of ever larger deficits. The Simpson-Bowles commission estimates that backdoor spending in the tax code costs us $1 trillion per year, and most of us agree this is the best, and easiest, place to start.
\
""The percentage of deficit reduction coming from spending cuts and tax revenues vary somewhat between the plans. It seems reasonable to me that spending cuts could account for 55 percent of deficit reduction and tax increases 45 percent, but I am willing to support plans that vary from this significantly because I realize compromise is needed.""
\
China
\
Davis:""While Illinois and the 13th District rely greatly on grain, machinery and transportation exports to China, we must defend the economic interests of the United States, especially when dealing with China. I'm supportive of engaging China on trade policies which allow our businesses to flourish, but we must pay close attention to their currency as it continues to appreciate.""
\
Gill: ""We need to be forceful and be strong in terms of standing up against China when they are manipulating their currency. I think we need to ask ourselves why they should continue to have Most Favored Nation status when they are manipulating their currency. On the other hand, I think there are some wonderful partnerships to be developed within China in terms of our ability to market our products overseas, when you make sure they are not manipulating their currency and they are acting as a fair trading partner.""
\
Hartman: ""The exchange of ideas in the information age and a belief in the appeal of democracy as a natural force inherent to humanity should give us reason to think that China will move toward a more democratic society. We know that democracy has its advocates in China today. There may well be bumps coming in our relationship, but we need to keep a long-term perspective and use wisdom to recognize that it could scarcely be in our interests to enter any war with China.""
\
Immigration
\
Davis: We must first continue to do to more to secure our borders to stem the flow of illegal immigrants. Increased border patrols, finishing border fences and continuing our vigilance through enforcement are keys to controlling the number of illegal immigrants coming to the United States. We must ensure employers are capable of quickly and accurately verifying the eligibility of those who they are hiring. We also must ensure that government benefits do not serve as an enticement for immigrants to illegally enter the United States.
\
""Any path to citizenship for those here illegally must not be a path which places them before others who are going through the process legally.""
\
Gill: ""The last time we reviewed this in any comprehensive sort of way was in the mid-1980s under President Reagan. I tip my cap to him for his ability to look at the big picture and address the wide variety of items that are needed when you talk about this. The opposition has been very intransigent in stating that they won't do anything other than securing our borders. That's a necessary part of it, but it's also important to state that we will deal effectively with the businesses that hire the undocumented workers, and I think that, realistically, we can't deport 12 million people. I think you have to acknowledge that and develop some process where they get to the back of the line and pay whatever fine. I'm not talking about criminals, people who have committed a crime while here. Those people should be deported, but I think there should be some pathway to citizenship, particularly for the young people.""
\
Hartman: ""We need to give an objective group of economists the task of determining the employment needs of our economy, from the high-tech employees integral to our software giants to the agricultural employees helping to provide our fruits and vegetables. We should then base the number of immigrants on our economic needs along with a due respect for our nation's identity and heritage of welcoming others.
\
""Once our immigration targets are set, we need to enforce the rule of law on both employers and employees. It behooves us all to be a nation that respects the law, and we have had inexcusably lax enforcement of our existing immigration laws. Once the new targets are set, the law should be enforced vigorously, and employers as well as illegal immigrants should pay a stiff price for transgressions, including prison terms for employers or deportation for illegally entering.""
\
Climate change
\
Davis:""Many factors contribute to changes in climate, both man-made and natural. Regardless of your views on global warming, we should all agree that reducing our dependence on foreign oil and cutting air pollution without doing economic harm to our citizens will benefit our national security, environment and public health.""
\
Gill: ""Global climate change is occurring, and we ignore it at great risk to our grandchildren and their children. I believe that we should invest ourselves as fully as possible in reducing our carbon footprint and involving ourselves in the alternative energy sources that I mentioned earlier. It's not something that can be put off any longer. We've already crossed that mark where irreversible change is starting to take place. The costs associated with ignoring it dwarf any cost in facing up to it now.""
\
Hartman:""If our leading scientific institutions are telling us that there is likely to be harm to others from our actions, we need to change course. We need to change our behavior to act as if others mattered.
\
""The most market-friendly manner that meets our responsibilities is a cap-and-trade system. Cap and trade has the ability to work for climate-changing emissions just as it did successfully with acid rain in the northeast U.S. However, climate change is a global problem, and while we need to implement policies ourselves as the world's leading nation, we need to also do everything within our powers to convince others of the facts of climate change and the moral obligations springing from them.""
\
Abortion
\
Davis:""I am pro-life but recognize the exceptions of rape, incest and life of the mother. I do not believe that taxpayer dollars should be used to finance abortions, outside of rape, incest or life of the mother.""
\
Gill:""I am a pro-choice candidate. I think that a woman's body is hers to make decisions with regards to. It's her body and her health, and that should be respected. The Hyde Amendment has been in place since the mid-1970s, and to be frank, traveling the district and talking with thousands of people, I'm not hearing anybody calling for the Hyde Amendment to be done away with. It's not my intention to go to Washington and work toward doing away with the Hyde Amendment.""
\
Hartman: ""My position on abortion is that the government should be as small as possible, and we should have confidence in the people to use their conscience to do what is best. I support Roe v. Wade. I am not yet decided on whether or not to support the so-called Hyde Amendment.""
\
Marriage amendment
\
Davis: ""I would support a constitutional amendment defining marriage as only between one man and one woman.""
\
Gill: Said he would oppose the amendment.
\
Hartman:""We do not need a constitutional amendment to define marriage as only between a man and a woman.""

61,"In mid-spring, when the prospect of a global warming bill passing Congress seemed like an Al Gore pipe dream, President Barack Obama invited Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., to the Oval Office. ""He realized that this was a very tough bill to get through,"" Waxman remembers.\Waxman found the new president perfectly ready to accept the only strategy that offered hope of success: sitting down with each group affected by the bill and trading concessions for support.\That strategy yielded a narrow victory in the House in Friday. The question is, did Obama, Waxman and other supporters give away so much that the benefits to the environment ended up being slim to none -- especially since the bill now goes to the even less sympathetic Senate?\""There's a point at which you've got to ask yourself: 'What are we doing here? What's the point?'"" said Elaine Kamarck, a former Clinton administration official and adviser to then-Vice President Gore.\So far, most major environmental groups are sticking with Obama. Most groups made the calculation that, in sum, the bill was worth moving, said Emily Figdor of Environment America.\""We think there's a lot of problems in the bill,"" she said, but ""we need to take that first step. We're so long overdue.""\If the bill makes it to the president's desk, says its co-author, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., ""We will have fundamentally changed our relationship with energy and how it's generated in this country.""\Even before Obama was inaugurated, Markey and Waxman had begun meeting with industry, farm groups and others.\The goal of the bill they were drafting, embraced by Obama, was to ratchet down U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through a system of tradable emissions permits.\It would set strict energy efficiency standards and a national requirement for renewable electricity use.\Against that background, Waxman, Markey and Obama's representatives found that one thing made interest groups receptive: The Democrats were willing to deal.\To attract House Agriculture Committee chairman Collin Peterson of Minnesota and other Farm Belt representatives, Waxman and Markey agreed to sweeteners for farmers and other biofuel producers.\Then there was coal.\The critical question concerned the cap-and-trade permits. Hundreds of billions of dollars were at stake. Coal and manufacturing groups wanted them handed out free, at least in the early years.\Waxman and Markey agreed. ""That was an essential compromise,"" Waxman said. ""It would be very disruptive to the economy had we not recognized that certain regions of the country were heavily dependent on coal.""\Not everyone yielded, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute.\But a host of companies and utilities touted the bill, including Nike, Starbucks, Exelon, Symantec and PG&E, a coalition that House Democrats said was invaluable.\""Many of the folks who are supporting the bill now from the private sector, that I know, said they didn't think they'd be here today,"" said Rep. Melissa Bean of Illinois, a centrist Democrat who voted for the bill.\Environmentalists watched the deals go down with varying cases of nerves. Greenpeace labeled the final bill ""a victory for coal industry lobbyists.""\Still, some of the largest conservation groups said the bill was a testament to Waxman, Markey, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Obama.\""They know what price the political market will bear,"" said Dan Weiss, an environmental advocate at the liberal Center for American Progress.\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, Tribune Newspapers"
62,"President Barack Obama's landmark energy and global warming bill squeaked through the House only after the White House made dozens of concessions to coal, manufacturing and other interests.\But now, as the battle moves to the Senate, Obama faces demands for even more concessions -- including pressure to open up the nation's coastline to offshore oil and gas drilling.\The Senate will also take up a series of controversial issues that were glossed over or omitted from the House bill. Among them: giving the government sweeping new powers to overcome local objections and approve thousands of miles of new transmission lines to carry electric power to coastal cities from wind turbines in the Upper Midwest and solar power generators in the Southwest.\Aware of the challenge, Obama has repeatedly called attention to the House achievement last week and urged the Senate to keep up the momentum.\""My expectation is that the Senate is going to move forward,"" he said in an interview last Sunday. ""There are going to be a series of tough negotiations. But I think the ability of the House to move forward is going to be a prod for the Senate toward action.""\Even so, with Republicans already forming a near-solid phalanx of opposition and many Democrats concerned about the impact of sections of the bill on their constituents, the prospect is for a long, slow legislative slog.\Senate leaders say they will benefit from lessons learned from the way House leaders built their majority, and from the failure of a global warming bill on the Senate floor last year. Chief among them: the need to cut specific deals to ease the impact of new emissions restrictions -- which could translate into higher costs for businesses and rising prices for consumers -- in particular parts of the country.\""We need to absolutely work this bill one-on-one,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who leads the Environment and Public Works Committee that is drafting emissions limits central to the bill, ""because everybody's got different passions about it, different feelings about it, different hopes about it, different fears about it.""\Making those deals is harder in the Senate than in the House, some analysts say.\""In the House, you can move blocks of votes,"" said Daniel Weiss, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress who works on global warming issues. ""In the Senate, it's hand-to-hand combat.""\While the climate bill is likely to be hundreds of pages long, it boils down to an attempt to start weaning the U.S. economy away from dependence on fossil fuels.\The centerpiece is the so-called cap-and-trade system, which would set limits on carbon dioxide and other emissions that scientists say are a major factor in global warming. The allowed level of such emissions would decline over time and major polluters, such as power plants and factories, would be required to obtain permits to cover their emissions as a spur to reducing pollution.\The original idea was that the government would sell the permits, but the House voted to give many away to ease the economic impact.\The bill is also likely to include a variety of provisions designed to encourage development of new energy sources, including wind and solar power. Among these: financial and legal provisions to speed construction of new transmission lines to move power from the remote deserts and plains where it's easily produced to coastal cities where it's needed.\The quest for new energy sources is expected to reopen the politically explosive issue of offshore drilling as well.\Looming over all the provisions is the cost -- a focal point of Republican attacks.\""The public is especially wary of passing this during a major recession, and public skepticism is growing about the man-made climate fears,"" said Marc Morano, a former Republican on the Senate environment committee who edits the global-warming-skeptic Web site ClimateDepot.com.\Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them control 60 Senate seats. But more than a dozen have expressed concerns over costs. They include Democrats from industry-heavy Ohio and Michigan, coal-dependent Indiana and oil-rich Louisiana.\Only a few Republicans appear open to emissions limits, notably two moderates from Maine -- Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe -- and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who championed emissions limits in his presidential campaign, though McCain has expressed reservations about the House bill.\And Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" last Sunday if he could see any version of the House bill passing the Senate, replied: ""I don't think putting clamps on our economy when you know the Chinese and the Indians are not going to do it is a good idea.""\Legislative logistics and turf battles could also muddy the Senate process.\---------\jtankersley@tribune.com\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, Tribune Newspapers"
63,"Environment suffers from bad decisions\Tragically, our government lives by the golden rule: Those with the gold make the rules.\Both presidents, Republican George W. Bush (Katrina) and Democrat Barack Obama (BP oil spill) contributed to irreparable damage to the global environment.\Their elections were financed by the large corporations for the benefit of ""the golden parachute"" executives (obscene monetary rewards) rather than the general public.\These failures have reinforced two disastrous possibilities: a quick suicide by nuclear weapons or a slow suicide through global warming. Fortunately, there is a third option summarized in an ancient Chinese proverb: ""Out of tiny drops of rain mighty oceans grow.""\Famed environmental scientist Rene Dubos said, ""Think globally; act locally.""\Will the committed and the unselfish demonstrate what Dubos recommended with his emphasis on a more compassionate care of Mother Earth constructed on a foundation of individual and community initiatives boldly challenging the status quo?\The objectives are a sustainable quality of life, wiser management of natures resources and total commitment to wildlife preservation.\In the final analysis, we must create an environmentally benign system of human and wildlife living.\John Steinke\Lindenhurst\Wasting Zion source of energy is foolish\Unless there is intervention soon, Zions dual nuclear facility, capable of producing 2,100 megawatts of power, will be foolishly wasted.\Exelon Corp., which owns and operates six other nuclear plants in Illinois, has until November to cancel its contract with Energy Solutions out of Iowa for decommissioning.\Restarting the Zion Nuclear Power Station could potentially save Illinois citizens billions of dollars and massively reduce carbon emissions, in addition to the following benefits:\* Lower electricity prices for consumers by hundreds of millions of dollars.\* Create hundreds of permanent jobs operating the plant and raise significant tax revenues for Zion and Illinois.\* Displace the CO2 output equivalent of perhaps eight coal power generation plants with emission-free power.\* Satisfy the states desire for additional emission-free power generation quickly, at perhaps 30 percent of the cost and many times the reliability of other renewable options, while using none of the thousands of acres needed for wind and solar facilities.\* The citizens of Illinois and the government would otherwise spend billions to subsidize and build immensely more expensive and less efficient wind and power facilities to meet its clean emissions goals.\Many have argued restarting Zion would be too costly. Estimates range from $400 million to Exelons more pessimistic estimate of $2 billion. This argument is not credible when compared to the estimated $14 billion cost of building the new Georgia plant of equal capacity where the federal government is guaranteeing part of the debt.\Zions licenses do expire in 2013, but plant licenses are routinely extended for 20 years or more.\Since the people of Illinois have already fully paid for the Zion plant in prior rates additionally, a $1 billion decommissioning fund is being held by Exelon restarting the Zion dual nuclear plant is the only sensible thing to do.\If you feel your electricity rates are too high, and who doesnt, contact your legislators with this message: The Zion plant must be saved and not wasted.\Nancy J. Thorner\Lake Bluff\Congress must\extend Bush tax cuts\While the eyes of most Americans focus on the excruciating environmental disaster in the Gulf, there is an economic catastrophe looming on the horizon attracting but scant attention.\The Bush tax cuts are due to automatically expire. Consider that the consensus of opinion among economists, regardless of their individual political ideology, is that raising taxes during a recession would impede recovery and could lead to devastating outcomes such as accelerated deflation and double-dip recession.\Even the patron saint of liberal economists, John Maynard Keynes, in his famous open letter to FDR supported government expenditures but admonished that it should be financed ""by loans and not by taxing present incomes.""\Common sense tells us that during economic downturns entrepreneurs who take risks to grow business and employ people should be encouraged and motivated by lower tax rates. Lower rates that at the same time would put more money in consumers pockets pumping up their purchasing power.\The Bush tax cuts, after the devastating 9/11 attack, led to a boom era of a record high stock market and historically low unemployment, are due to expire at the end of this year. The public cost implications are broad and severe. For starters, personal rates will go up, as will capital gains, estate taxes return, and stock dividend rates skyrocket.\Contrary to Obama apologists parsing the definition of ""increase"", doing nothing would be a massive tax increase. Add to that new Obamacare costs, possible cap-and-trade fees, and every conceivable increase in local and state taxes. We will have a world of hurt coming our way.\It doesnt take a rocket scientist to foresee dire consequences. As it is, the equivalent of one, Arthur Laffer, Ph.D., the architect behind the ""Reagan Boom,"" states flatly that if Bush tax cuts are not extended, ""The economy will collapse in 2011.""\Yet the Obama administrations lust for taxpayer dollars has no bounds. They only reluctantly consider even piecemeal tax relief.\We the people need help. I call upon Congress, specifically Melissa Bean and Bill Foster who have shown themselves tethered to Nancy Pelosis purse strings, to stand up for their constituents and demand legislation extending across-the-board Bush tax cuts.\Andrew Ertmanis\Libertyville\Facts about illegal immigration\This is in response to a June 20 letter, which criticized a previous letters author for being ""misguided"" and ""ignoring the facts"" about illegal immigration.\The writer claims illegal immigrants take part in food stamp programs while they are also getting paid under the table, thereby not paying FICA and other taxes.\In reality, illegals get paid under the table because they lack Social Security numbers and other documentation, which would preclude them from applying for food stamps.\He then claims illegals receive $3,000 each in federal tax refunds. How can someone who doesnt have documentation or pay taxes even file a return, let alone get a refund?\The writer correctly notes most illegals are good people, but he fails to realize that the only reason illegals dont pay all the taxes other Americans do is they dont want to risk deportation.\Illegals do want to be Americans and abide by every law, they just dont want to leave their adoptive nation.\Philip Procento\Vernon Hills"
64," The temperature is rising on mercury.\ In Washington and state capitals across the country, the shiny, slippery substance that has filled thermometers and cavities for generations is coming under increasingly tough regulations aimed at reducing the public's exposure to a useful but dangerous material that can damage the brain and nervous system.\ Measures either on the books or under consideration call for reducing the amount of mercury used in thermometers and other consumer products, cutting mercury emissions by coal-fired power plants, and requiring automobile recyclers to remove mercury light switches from old cars.\ ""We're phasing out mercury usage practically daily,"" said Michael Bender, director of the Mercury Policy Project, an environmental group in Montpelier, Vt.\ But while efforts to reduce the amount of new mercury that enters the environment pick up steam, scientists and regulators also are studying how former sources of mercury pollution, such as the defunct hat factories of this northwest Connecticut town, still pose a threat.\ From hats to fish\ Danbury was once the hat-making capital of the world, its factories turning out more than 5 million hats a year in the late 19th Century. The factories are long gone, but the mercury that was used extensively to turn beaver and rabbit fur into felt remains in the sediment of the Still River, a narrow stream where the factories dumped wastewater for more than 150 years.\ During floods and hurricanes, the sediment is washed into the larger Housatonic River, which empties into Long Island Sound. Fish, lobsters and other marine life that live in the sound pick up some of the mercury, to be passed on to the people who eat them.\ ""We're looking at the pollution heritage of an industry that's been gone for half a century, but the pollution is still making its way into Long Island Sound,"" said Johan Varekamp, a Wesleyan University earth sciences professor who discovered the connection between Danbury's hat factories and the high levels of mercury at the mouth of the Housatonic.\ Mercury levels in coastal waters are more than just a matter of local concern. Consumption of fish and shellfish has skyrocketed nationwide as Americans have become more concerned about the fat and cholesterol associated with red meat.\ Worried about mercury levels in fish, the Food and Drug Administration last year warned women who were pregnant or who planned to become pregnant against eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, the species with the highest contamination rates. The FDA is studying a wider range of species to determine their exposure levels.\ Similarly, elevated mercury counts in Great Lakes fish was one factor that led Illinois and other states that ring the lakes to advise children, pregnant women and nursing mothers to limit or eliminate their intake of certain types of fish, such as large salmon and trout. Fetuses, infants and children under age 7 are especially vulnerable to mercury's toxic effects on the nervous system.\ Along with such pollutants as PCBs and dioxins, ""mercury is in the top five, maybe the top three,"" said Margaret Wooster, executive director of Great Lakes United, a coalition of environmental groups. ""For persistence in the environment, mercury scores tops. For health effects, mercury scores tops. And it's still being released.""\ Emitted from coal plants, cars\ The largest sources of new mercury emissions are power plants that burn coal, which contains trace amounts of mercury. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that power plants emit about 48 tons of the pollutant annually. Rain and other precipitation carries airborne mercury to the ground, where it washes into rivers and lakes and eventually is absorbed by fish.\ Under the Bush administration's ""Clear Skies"" proposal introduced in Congress in July, producers of mercury emissions would be subject to a cap-and-trade system of incentives to curb such emissions; a similar system resulted in a steep decline in levels of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain.\ The Bush proposal would cut mercury emissions 69 percent by 2018, according to the EPA.\ Automakers have been phasing out the use of mercury light switches since 1997 and will cease using them by the end of the year, said Charles Territo of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.\ Although new models will no longer contain mercury, existing cars still pose a significant environmental threat, Wooster said. After old cars are crushed for recycling, they are melted in electric-arc furnaces, where the mercury they contain is emitted into the atmosphere.\ Auto recyclers in some areas, such as New York's Westchester County, are required to remove the mercury switches before cars are crushed, but Great Lakes United and other environmental groups favor Maine's new technique. In April, Maine enacted the nation's first law requiring automobile manufacturers to invest in efforts to remove mercury switches from old cars and take back the mercury.\ Last week, the automakers alliance sued Maine in federal court there, seeking to have the law thrown out. ""This law places undue costs on doing business in Maine,"" Territo said.\ But even if all mercury use were to cease immediately, it would take 15 to 50 years for mercury levels to fall to safe levels in fish, said Bender of the Mercury Policy Project. That's because of the backlog of mercury in places like Danbury's Still River.\ ""There is no easy way to get rid of it,"" said Varekamp, the Wesleyan University scientist. ""So we know during the next hurricane or flood, more of it is going to come into Long Island Sound."""
65,"Curbing global-warming pollution in Illinois might start with a ban on Thomas Edison's incandescent light bulb.\Gov. Rod Blagojevich is mulling plans to rid the state of traditional, energy-wasting lights as part of a sweeping package of policy changes intended to cut greenhouse gases by 25 percent by 2020, the same target set by California and bipartisan measures pending in Congress.\A panel of experts assembled by the governor concluded that meeting the ambitious goal also would require cleaner cars and trucks, more energy-efficient building codes and appliances, lower-carbon fuels and scores of wind turbines to generate pollution-free electricity.\But as Blagojevich vows to join a growing number of states taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases in the absence of federal action, Illinois also plans to increase its reliance on coal-fired power plants, the nation's leading source of pollution linked to global warming.\In a sign of the coal industry's political clout, Blagojevich and his aides say that Illinois can build at least five conventional coal plants and still manage to cut the state's emissions of heat-trapping pollution back to 1990 levels. That gamble -- critics describe it as more of a disastrous folly -- depends on several assumptions about how a carbon-constrained state would look in the next decade.\Some of Illinois' aging, inefficient coal plants would have to be scuttled. Others would need to generate considerably less electricity than they do today. Most new sources of energy would be required to store carbon dioxide instead of releasing it into the atmosphere -- something industry leaders think is feasible but too expensive to be practical, at least for now.\Many climate scientists and policymakers think that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to surge, the results could include widespread weather shifts, coastal flooding, prolonged droughts and deadly heat waves. Already, there are signs that changes in the Earth's climate could disrupt agriculture and speed up the extinction of plants and animals.\Legislative tension a challenge\States, cities and corporations throughout the nation are trying to figure out how to slow down or reverse those potentially devastating changes. But Blagojevich, who has developed an increasingly combative relationship with the General Assembly, will face a daunting challenge trying to sell legislators on a global warming plan.\To succeed, the governor will need to persuade skeptical business interests to back policies that could hurt older, entrenched industries but that are projected to create jobs and economic development related to cleaner energy, factories and products.\""What we've come up with is far from crazy,"" said Doug Scott, director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, who led the panel that drafted the recommendations. ""It's doable and can not only benefit the environment, but the economy as well.""\If Illinois does nothing, the state's greenhouse gas emissions are expected to increase to 312 million tons annually in 2020, according to the EPA. The goal is to change the way businesses and households operate and cut that amount to 231 million tons.\Requiring automakers to sell more fuel-efficient cars and trucks in Illinois would eliminate about 9 million tons of greenhouse gases. Banning incandescent light bulbs in favor of compact fluorescent lamps or other types of energy-sipping lights would shave another 7 million tons.\Building just one large conventional coal plant, though, would add 12 million tons.\""Important choices need to be made, but there are so many competing interests at stake,"" said Henry Henderson, a former Chicago environment commissioner who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""From where I stand, we shouldn't continue to rely on 19th Century technology that digs us into an even deeper hole.""\Industries are working to thwart any state action, which they contend would wreck the Illinois economy and drive factories and power plants out of the state. If anything, they prefer national policies that would spread the burden and lower the cost of reducing emissions.\Opponents point out that Illinois is responsible for only a fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions.\They've repeatedly expressed doubts that one state can make a difference.\""The scenario Illinois is envisioning is far too rosy,"" said Matt Most, director of environmental policy for Midwest Generation, owner of six coal plants that represent the state's largest source of carbon dioxide. ""We're sitting above vast, affordable reserves of coal. Going it alone would result in a massive displacement of existing coal plants and drive up the cost of energy.""\Under the recommendations drafted by Blagojevich's panel, the biggest savings would come from a new program that would cap the amount of carbon dioxide produced by the state's coal-fired power plants and large factories.\Industries would buy credits that allow them to continue polluting as long as the overall target is met.\Officials hopeful about credits\The proposal Blagojevich is considering envisions Illinois linking to an emerging larger market in which polluters could buy credits from cleaner sources in other states. It is patterned after a similar system that has reduced sulfur dioxide pollution from power plants.\State officials contend the program, known as cap-and-trade, would encourage investment in green energy projects, including methods that aim to keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by pumping it deep underground into brine-soaked sandstone.\They assume most new coal plants will be built with that technology, called carbon sequestration, even though questions remain about its economic viability and reliability.\However, five new power plants already permitted by the Illinois EPA would burn coal in roughly the same way as ones built during the 1950s and '60s.\Those old, inefficient coal plants now provide about half of the state's electricity. They also emitted more than 105 million tons of carbon dioxide last year, according to federal records. Only five states had power plants that released more.\To meet the state's target, energy companies likely would need to buy a significant chunk of greenhouse-gas credits or scrap some of their units. Some might follow the example set by the municipal utility in Springfield, which is building a new coal plant and also buying enough wind energy to power the Illinois Capitol and other state office buildings.\Springfield's utility will end up producing 25 percent less carbon dioxide than it does now, equivalent to taking more than 100,000 cars off the road.\Ron Burke, associate director of the Illinois EPA, noted that other steps already are being taken that would help meet the governor's goal.\As part of another deal that will cut mercury and smog-forming pollution, Midwest Generation and other companies have agreed to shut down some of their coal plants. Also, recent legislation signed by Blagojevich will give a huge boost to energy-efficiency programs and require energy companies to purchase a quarter of their electricity from wind turbines and other carbon-free sources by 2025.\""Nobody thought we could do that, either, but we did,"" said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center. ""If the federal government won't act, we need to step in and do something about global warming.""\- - -\At a glance\What: Gov. Rod Blagojevich wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Illinois by 25 percent by 2020.\When: The governor is considering sweeping policy changes to meet the goal. Legislation and rules changes are expected by early next year.\Advantages: Political momentum to change is building in states and municipalities across the country. Congress is debating a national solution that would require state action.\Obstacles: Business interests think a state-only plan could damage the economy. The politically embattled Blagojevich may not have the clout to pass aggressive global-warming legislation.\----------\mhawthorne@tribune.com\Credit: By Michael Hawthorne, Tribune staff reporter"

Have you noticed something hinky about the anti-David Gill ads overrunning the television and radio waves of late? They are formulaic, damn any Democrat running in any state, not just Illinois. They are snide and demeaning and stink of Karl Rove.

Big money has purchased these ads at the direction of Rove with the obvious goal to elect a rubber stamping group willing to completely overtake Congress, to undo citizen protections and to pass legislation friendly to corporations and those with extreme wealth.
\
If Romney is elected and Congress has no checks and balances and a Supreme Court is padded with more conservative judges, the Hunger Games will not be fiction but a fact.

Remember what Grover Norquist, Rove's main stooge, said about Mitt Romney during a summit sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, a front group started by oil billionaire David Koch of Koch Industries:
\
""All we have to do is replace Obama. ... We are not auditioning for a fearless leader. We don't need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. ... We just need a president to sign this stuff. ... Pick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become president of the United States. ... His job is to be captain of the team, to sign the legislation that has already been prepared.""

67,"Law professor Geoffrey Stone's best Barack Obama story has gotten better with age, acquiring an extra measure of ironic punch with Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's antic tumble from power. Stone was dean of the University of Chicago Law School back in 1992 when its faculty was trying to recruit the sleek and all-around stellar Harvard Law student who had once worked as a community organizer on the city's South Side. Sniffing out Obama's plan to return to Chicago after graduation, Stone and Douglas Baird, who was chairman of the faculty appointments committee, cooked up a plan of their own: They created a faculty fellowship slot custom-tailored for Obama and then invited him to apply for it. When Obama visited the campus for his initial interview, he spent a few minutes outside Stone's office chatting with Stone's secretary, Charlotte Maffia.\""Barack was sufficiently polished and graceful and self-possessed then, at age 26, that my secretary immediately saw that this was a person who had a real political persona,"" Stone recalls. ""It was partly a kind of magnetism, partly a kind of grace, a sense of his own presence. You couldn't mistake that you were with somebody who thought they were somebody -- not in a bad way, but in a compelling way.\""And after he left, my secretary turned to me and said, 'He's going to be governor of Illinois someday.' ""\That, of course, was back before the governor's job in Illinois became a slippery slope to federal prison.\At times it can seem that everyone at the University of Chicago has a favorite Obama story. Certainly, the young constitutional law professor made a big impression on colleagues and students during his 12 years at the university, but the university also left its impression on him. Obama's stunning ascent can leave the impression that he was divinely ordained to be president. But how his historic presidency plays out will be shaped in large part by the lessons learned and the friendships forged during his tenure at the school. Those lessons and friendships now loom especially large as President Obama and his team of advisers, many of them from the University of Chicago, gather in the White House and attempt to reinvent the U.S. economy.\The law school, along with the university's Nobel-laden economics department and Chicago Booth School of Business (six laureates currently on their combined faculties), is part of what is broadly known as the Chicago School of Economics -- an unofficial and somewhat ambiguous label that means different things to different people. Understanding how the Chicago School sees the world -- and this is by no means a settled or static proposition -- serves as a good guide to how Obama sees the task ahead.\In general, the Chicago School is all about the free market. For those of us who wouldn't recognize a Keynesian if one jumped up and smacked us with an invisible hand, it is enough to know that the Chicago School stands for an unshakable belief that the best results are achieved when the government steps aside and allows the market to function unburdened by regulation. The most celebrated propagator of this doctrine and the Chicago School's high priest was, of course, Milton Friedman, who taught at the university from 1932 to 1977. The missionary zeal of Friedman and his ""Chicago Boys"" helped launch the Reagan Revolution in this country, the Thatcher Revolution in Britain and the radical makeover of several former Soviet Bloc economies in Eastern and Central Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. There also were a few somewhat less successful applications of Friedman's economic ""shock treatment"" in Latin America.\Naturally, the Chicago School has its critics, including many at the University of Chicago. Last year, when members of the economics, law and business faculties proposed naming a new economics research institute after Friedman, it drew yelps of protest from liberals who inhabit other quarters of the university. Bruce Lincoln, a professor of religion, complained that the university was trying to install a right-wing think tank on campus. Others argued that Friedman's free-market ideology had hurt more than it helped in the developing world and that the Nobel laureate's ill-advised association with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was an embarrassment to the university. Despite the objections, the Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics opened for business last summer.\Certainly, the current economic crackup, which Obama has blamed largely on the greed-fueled deregulation of American financial markets, has dimmed the luster of Friedman and the Chicago School brand. Naomi Klein, the best-selling critic of capitalism and corporate globalization, castigates the Chicago School as ""a fundamentalist faith"" that functions as a closed loop for true believers and that exploits poor people. She also argues that ""authoritarian conditions are required for the implementation of its true vision."" Most non-Marxist economists would agree that this is an oversimplification.\""It provides a sound bite for people who don't know better,"" says Baird, the law school dean who brought Obama to the university.\Baird is a compact man who speaks in measured words. He teaches contracts, bankruptcy law and corporate reorganization, and he actually knows what a credit default swap is.\""No one in this building has ever thought that free markets meant markets without regulations. Everyone in Chicago has always assumed that markets have structures and those structures involve regulation. Everyone in Chicago has always assumed the government has a role to play in enforcing contracts and preventing fraud,"" he tells me.\Richard Thaler, a behavioral economist on the business school faculty, argues that the Chicago School's core belief in the power of the market remains steadfast, but that its thinking has evolved.\""What has wilted -- and 2008 puts the final nail in the coffin -- is the idea that completely unregulated markets always lead to the best possible outcome. Nobody can maintain that position anymore. I don't know what Milton Friedman would have to say about this, but you can't blame the current crisis on too much government regulation,"" he says.\""The new thinking of the Chicago School -- and this is clearly reflected in Obama -- is transparency and oversight; transparency and oversight as opposed to deregulation.""\Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein, who is frequently described as Obama's closest friend on the law faculty, co-wrote a book last year called ""Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness."" In it, they put forth the idea that by shrewdly shaping the context in which individuals make decisions -- something they call ""choice architecture"" -- the government can help individuals eat better, plan wisely for their retirements and avoid polarizing arguments on issues as diverse as gay marriage and motorcycle helmet laws. The book and its ideas were quickly embraced by Britain's Conservative Party as a possible successor doctrine to Thatcherism. (It should be noted that these days Britain's Conservatives are considerably to the left of their Republican counterparts in the U.S.) Thaler and Sunstein call their approach ""libertarian paternalism,"" which may explain why the book has attracted less notice here. But that may change. Many of its Chicago School ideas were echoed by Obama during the presidential campaign and could soon become the playbook for his administration's economic policy. And Obama recently tapped Sunstein to be his regulatory czar, an obscure but potentially influential job.\Obama's own views on the market are hardly a mystery.\""Look, I'm a pro-growth, free-market guy,"" he declared on CNBC last June. ""I love the market.""\After 12 years at the University of Chicago, it could only be thus. Obama accepted the fellowship offer from Stone and Baird and came to the law school 1992. He was assigned a small office on the fifth floor of the law library, and it was there that he wrote his memoir, ""Dreams from My Father."" He later moved to a larger office on the fifth floor (that office has since been lost to a building renovation) and was given the rank of senior lecturer. His constitutional law classes were enormously popular with students.\The University of Chicago's Hyde Park campus, with its neo-Gothic spires and leafy walkways, is a rarefied universe unto itself -- in Chicago, but not quite of Chicago. It is an island whose shores are lapped by some of the meanest poverty in America. Obama, who worked as a community organizer about a dozen miles away in the South Side communities of Roseland and Altgeld Gardens, was always more aware of this than most.\When Obama was elected to the state senate in 1996, he adjusted his teaching schedule so that his classes were on Mondays and Fridays. This enabled him to spend the middle of the week in Springfield when the legislature was in session. He also was an associate with Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a law firm specializing in civil rights litigation.\""Barack was a lawyer and a politician, and that was his day job, no question about it,"" says Stone. ""His relationship with the law school was important, but it was not central to him or us.""\Baird acknowledges that Obama's political ambitions were always first and foremost, but he puts the law school years in a different light:\""The story people haven't talked about -- in part because Barack didn't want to tell it; it was not to his political advantage -- is that he spent a large part of his adult life in this building teaching. Between '96 and 2004, his principal job was at the University of Chicago Law School. The part-time job was the state legislature.\""His base of operations was here; his office was here; his secretary was here, and his benefits were coming from the University of Chicago. This was definitely a day job,"" says Baird.\Springfield may have been the place where Obama smoked cigars, played poker and learned the rough-and-tumble ways of Illinois politics, but Hyde Park is where the future president developed the intellectual tools for his life's work.\Thaler describes his faculty colleague as a prolific reader and a ""sponge for information.""\""He's as wonky as Bill Clinton, and Clinton was supposed to be the wonkiest president of all time,"" he says.\Thaler recalled taking part in a conference call with Obama early in the presidential campaign. The subject was savings and Social Security. ""We were asked to write a policy paper and I remember we drafted something with a lot of pretty arcane minutia. And two days later his people get back to us and say, 'Barack knows all this stuff, tell us something new.' ""\Even though the law school job was part-time, Obama taught close to a full course load. But teaching is not what the Chicago School is about. What matters here is hatching the Next Big Idea, and often these new ideas are auditioned at what has become one of the Chicago School's most hallowed institutions: the workshop. There are scores of these workshops each year. Generally open only to the economics community, they are where Nobel laureates, junior faculty or those from other universities hoping for appointment to the Chicago faculty come to present and defend what is expected to be cutting-edge thinking of the highest order. The cross-examination can be merciless. A European academic who recently attended a workshop was taken aback by what he described as the ""intellectual bloodthirstiness"" of the session.\But Obama skipped the workshops and, to Richard Epstein, this is a disappointment. Epstein, an expert on corporate law at the university and a formidable inquisitor, says the workshops are valuable because they guard against intellectual complacency.\""I've got a term -- I call it intellectual glaucoma, narrowing your vision. For most people it's almost imperceptible, but what happens is if you keep working in the same niche, the niche gets deeper, you don't see over the edges and you start getting tunnel vision.""\The workshops, says Epstein, are ""our anti-glaucoma medicine.""\""You have to sit there and listen to papers good and bad on every kind of discipline . . . and then you have to ask questions about things you don't know about -- just to make sure the forces of glaucoma don't take hold. And Obama never did that,"" he says.\Indeed, Obama made clear from the start of his employment at the university that he would not be spending time in workshops. ""That was always the deal,"" says Baird, who notes that Obama absorbed the unique culture of the Chicago School in other ways.\""What he did for a large part of his adult life was be in a room with really smart people with really divergent views, talking about really controversial issues,"" says Baird. ""And his job was not to persuade people to vote for him, but rather to make these discussions as rich and thoughtful as possible.""\Obama wrote about the experience in his second book, ""The Audacity of Hope."" ""I loved the law school classroom: the stripped-down nature of it, the high-wire act of standing in front of a room at the beginning of each class with just blackboard and chalk, the students taking the measure of me, some intent or apprehensive, others demonstrative in their boredom . . . ""\It was in this environment that Obama refined his ability to extract the essence of an argument and to balance competing and sometimes contradictory ideas.\Baird, the corporate law expert, recalls a number of lively discussions with Obama, whose specialty is workers rights.\""A lot of times when you are talking to people on the left side of the spectrum about these issues, there is no give-back. But with him, he always understood both sides. He understood that problems are hard and you have to think about intelligent ways to solve them. It was in his DNA.""\This tells us something about Obama's likely style of governance. What about the substance? The answer lies in Obama's own words, his writing, and in the people he has chosen to surround himself with.\The substance of Bill Clinton's presidency was shaped by his associates from Yale Law School (including wife Hillary) and friendships forged during his Oxford year as a Rhodes Scholar. John F. Kennedy's administration bore the imprint of Harvard's ""Best and Brightest."" Franklin D. Roosevelt's early ""Brain Trust"" consisted of a cadre of trusted Columbia University law professors. If anything, Obama is even more closely tied to the University of Chicago community and its distinctive culture than his predecessors were to their favorite schools.\Obama's wife, Michelle (Princeton '85 and Harvard Law '88), was an associate dean at the university and later served as a University of Chicago Medical Center vice president. The couple's former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, has a graduate degree from the Divinity School.\David Axelrod, Obama's top political adviser, is a University of Chicago graduate, and Valerie Jarrett, another senior adviser, was a university trustee. Sunstein and Austan Goolsbee, who will serve as chief economist for the newly created President's Economic Recovery Board, are friends from the faculty, as is Elena Kagan (now dean of Harvard Law School), Obama's choice for solicitor general and a likely candidate for the next Supreme Court vacancy. White House associate counsel Susan Sher is a former university medical center vice president and Christina Tchen, White House director of public liaison, served on the medical center's board. Lisa Brown, a White House staff secretary, is a law school graduate, and Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who attended the U. of C.'s Lab School, served on the visiting committee of the university's School of Social Service Administration.\The list goes on, but it should not be overlooked that Obama has drawn from a diverse universe of talent, including many veterans from the Clinton administration, to assemble his own team of the best and brightest. In Obama's world, the Chicago crowd plays a central role, but not an exclusive one.\The relatively young University of Chicago is a uniquely Midwestern institution. Founded by Baptists with money put up by John D. Rockefeller, it is a working meritocracy where pragmatism is prized. At the same time, it is an elite institution, but as people here like to say, familial pedigree won't get you into the place and it won't get you out. The brainy undergraduates who come to the U. of C. still lament it as ""the place where fun goes to die,"" but they depart with a world-class education.\""This is a very powerful place in terms of its capacity to socialize and acculturate people into what I would call our tribal myths and customs,"" says John Boyer, a historian and Dean of the College at the University of Chicago. ""And that's OK as long as you don't take the myths too seriously. And I suspect Obama's not going to take the myths too seriously.""\After the candidate himself, Axelrod, who served as the Obama campaign's chief strategist, is the person most responsible for Obama's nearly flawless run for the presidency.\With a desk just outside the Oval Office, he will have the president's ear on a daily basis, but the early months of the new administration are almost certainly going to be dominated by the economic crisis, and Goolsbee and Sunstein (along with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and senior economic advisers Lawrence Summers, Paul Volcker and Christina Romer) will play critical roles.\Baird describes Goolsbee and Sunstein as ""University of Chicago Democrats -- at least in the sense that they are committed to the idea of government taking an important role in a lot of different issues, from voting rights to environmental law.""\Baird sees Sunstein's role -- his official title is administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs -- as one with vast potential for leaving a lasting Chicago imprint.\""Given that the person setting the regulatory agenda for the next administration is a Chicago person through and through -- it means there's going to be a very heavy Chicago hand,"" he says. ""And it's magnified by the fact that Cass and the president have been friends for a long time. There's also the fact that Obama's own way of thinking about these issues has been influenced by Cass.""\In an interview with the Wall Street Journal last year, Sunstein described Obama as ""very attuned to the virtue of free markets and the risks of free-market regulation -- he's not an old-style Democrat who's excited about regulations"" for the sake of regulation. (Sunstein initially agreed to be interviewed for this article, but begged off after Obama tapped him for the regulatory job.)\A prolific writer and innovative thinker who brings a rock star buzz to the most wonkish of policy debates, Sunstein has on some occasions characterized his friend in the Oval Office as a University of Chicago Democrat; on other occasions, as a University of Chicago Progressive.\The two are not same. And Obama appears to be a little of both. The dichotomy is apparent in his writing. His first book, ""Dreams from My Father,"" was written in that tiny office when he arrived at the university and before he had had much of an opportunity to be drawn into its culture. This is Obama the former community organizer, a man-of-the-people progressive, someone much closer to the University of Chicago's Saul Alinsky wing than the university's Milton Friedman faction. He was, he wrote at the time, imbued with ""confidence in the populist impulse and working-class solidarity . . . (a) faith that if you just clear away the politicians and media and bureaucrats and give everybody a seat at the table, then ordinary people could find common ground.""\A decade later, Obama published his second book, ""The Audacity of Hope,"" a political manifesto whose intellectual framework is pure Chicago School.\""Reagan's central insight -- that the welfare state had grown complacent and bureaucratic, with Democratic policymakers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie -- contained a good deal of truth,"" wrote the junior senator from Illinois and by then dyed-in-the-wool University of Chicago Democrat. (Is the term an oxymoron? Thaler, Sunstein's co-author, thinks not. Of the Chicago School's supposedly right-leaning faculty, he says, ""I'm pretty sure that more than half voted for Obama."")\What Thaler calls the new Chicago School of thinking defines Obama's approach on several of his signature issues.\Health care, for instance. At first glance, Obama's health care plan has a Chinese menu feel to it. Too many choices, too many compromises. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton -- she was the acknowledged expert on health care -- offered a classic liberal's prescription: a massive overhaul of the entire system and mandated universal health care. Obama's plan, by contrast, avoids mandates. It is designed to accommodate market realities and individual preferences. It is a study in behavioral economics -- a Chicago School specialty -- using Thaler's and Sunstein's notion of ""choice architecture"" to gently nudge the country toward something close to universal health care. Not surprisingly, the broad outlines of this kind of plan can be found in their book, ""Nudge.""\Obama's market-based approach to the environment and global warming also bears a strong Chicago School imprint. Little wonder. ""Global warming was on our radar screen long before it was on radar screens elsewhere,"" says Baird. ""Cass was on this issue very early and Cass was always talking to Obama."" Obama favors a cap-and-trade system to curb greenhouse gas emissions. An enthusiastic explanation of how this works can be found -- again, not surprisingly -- in the book:\""In such systems those who pollute are given (or sold) 'rights' to pollute in certain amounts (the 'cap') and these rights are then traded in the market. Most specialists believe that such incentive-based systems as these should usually displace command-and-control regulation. We agree. Incentive-based approaches are more efficient and more effective, and they also increase freedom of choice.""\Sunstein defended Obama in a spirited campus debate with law school colleague Richard Epstein during last fall's campaign. The debate's title: ""Should Conservatives Vote for Obama?""\What was tricky for Sunstein was to explain how Obama, the Chicago School free-trade guy, finished his brief career in the U.S. Senate with the most liberal voting record of any sitting member, according to the National Journal's rankings.\""Obama had a very liberal voting record,"" Sunstein acknowledges. ""This surprises me and, to some extent, dismays me because I know him as someone who is independent of mind, someone who is idiosyncratic."" He blamed the ""mismatch"" on the particular set of issues that happened to come up for a vote during the 2007 session. The future regulation czar then proffered a provocative prediction: ""As Nixon went to China, Obama will go to deregulation.""\Epstein still isn't buying it. A libertarian who describes Obama as a business friend and neighbor, Epstein says Obama won the presidency, in part, ""because of his ability to control his emotions and his opinions when he was in the debates with John McCain.""\""[McCain] could scarcely keep himself under control. And there was Obama -- absolutely self-possessed. Not only when he spoke, but when he didn't speak. Self-control like that is almost a super-human quality,"" he says.\According to Epstein, Obama's temperament and training as a law professor can make him difficult to read. Obama, he says, is very good at listening respectfully and articulating all sides of an issue, but usually only as the lead-in to adopting a predictably liberal position. He describes his former colleague as an unreconstructed New Dealer who ""has never met a mandate that he would vote against.""\So whatever free-market truth and wisdom Obama may have absorbed during his years on the University of Chicago campus, Epstein doubts we will be seeing much of it in the new Obama administration.\""Obama comes from the tradition that thinks you can get your way on social justice and economic issues without affecting productivity very much -- and that's simply living in a dream world,"" he says. Obama and his economics team ""are very smart, but the problem is these high-IQ guys always think they can square the circle; they always believe they can beat the system with a cleverer system, and they always fail.""\Over the next four years President Obama is likely to have at least one and perhaps as many as three Supreme Court vacancies to fill. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, or Justice John Paul Stevens, who turns 89 next month and is the court's oldest member, might be the first to step down. A Chicagoan who was appointed by President Gerald Ford, Stevens has emerged over time as one of the stalwarts of the court's liberal faction. But Stevens, who received his undergraduate education at the University of Chicago and taught briefly at the law school, argues that it isn't he who has changed -- it's the court, which has moved steadily to the right with each successive appointment over the last three decades.\Stone, the former law school dean who became one of Obama's closest friends on the faculty and who today teaches constitutional law, says he hopes Obama will appoint a true liberal -- someone in the mold of Thurgood Marshall or William Brennan -- to correct the imbalance. Stone's argument is that the court needs both conservative and liberal voices. Absent one or the other, it is ""flying on one wing,"" he says.\But he doubts Obama, ever the consensus-seeking centrist, will follow his advice.\""I think Barack is much more likely to be interested in a certain kind of diversity on the court than he is in the distinction between a liberal and what I would call a moderate liberal. I think he will probably want to appoint a woman, a black, a Hispanic at some point or other during his term,"" Stone says. ""I also think that as a constitutional lawyer and as someone who respects courts, he will really want to appoint someone who is extremely able.""\Even if Stone is correct, there's a good chance Obama's pick will still have a Chicago connection. Three names that appear on almost every shortlist of possible nominee are Sunstein, Kagan and U.S. Appeals Court Judge Diane Wood. Wood is a senior lecturer at the law school, while Kagan, the nominee for solicitor general, spent 12 years on the law school faculty before going to Harvard Law in 2003.\Like others on the law school faculty, Baird has his favorite Obama story, a moment that when viewed in the rearview mirror seems to have foretold the future.\It occurred during the runup to the 2002 Illinois gubernatorial race, when a potential candidate (""Not Rod Blagojevich,"" says Baird) asked Baird for his support.\Baird consulted with Abner Mikva, the former congressman, federal judge, Obama mentor and Democratic Party stalwart who was also a member of the faculty.\""And Ab says, 'Nah, don't support him; he's gonna lose.'\""The next day I asked Barack and Barack says, 'Three things: The first thing you should know is that I am not running for governor this time' -- and then he looks me straight in the eye and says -- 'but if I did run for governor I would expect you to support me. The second thing you should know is that this person is going to lose, so if you support his campaign you are signing up for a losing cause. And the third thing you should know is that he's the best person in the field.'\""The reason this has stuck with me is because of the contrast between Ab Mikva and Barack, two very gifted politicians,"" says Baird. ""They are both pragmatic, but Barack is more nuanced and his idealism is tinged with a touch of realism. And there was always this incredible self-confidence about who he is and what he is about.""\Reflecting back on the skinny law school student he recruited in 1992 and the polished leader who stood on the step of the U.S. Capitol two months ago and delivered his inaugural address, Baird says the thing about Obama is that he has always run true to form, a man with an imperturbable inner gyroscope who knows where he wants to lead.\""Obviously, the voice darkens and gets deeper with time,"" he says, ""but the cadences are the same.""\- - -\David Axelrod\Top political adviser and campaign mastermind\Cass Sunstein\Obama's regulatory czar and best friend on law school faculty\Michelle Obama\Wife and closest adviser\Valerie Jarrett\Longtime friend and adviser to Barack and Michelle Obama\Austan Goolsbee\Senior economic adviser and U. of C. whiz kid\Geoffrey Stone\Law prof who was dean when Obama started at U. of C.\Richard Thaler\U. of C. economist, co-author with Cass Sunstein on ""Nudge""\Elena Kagan\Faculty friend and short-listed for next Supreme Court vacancy\Richard Epstein\U. of C. colleague, voted for Obama in the primary but not the general election\Arne Duncan\Basketball buddy and education secretary\Rev.

68,"Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent. Britains intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.\So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.\The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. Remember diplomat George Kennans axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table? The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations.\At Copenhagen activists will face two stubborn facts the two most populous nations. On Oct. 21, China, the worlds leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth together they account for 26 percent of emissions jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the worlds population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades. Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations.\Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from a federal requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel. When constituents interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""\In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change. For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement people eating locally grown foods from small farms actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.\Although the political and media drumbeat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry.\They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!""\In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes. As this years Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed half the average of the last 50 years and none has hit the United States."
69,"CORRECTION: Additional material published March 2, 2005: CORRECTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS. In a letter to the editor on Feb. 21, Jeff Holmstead, assistant administrator, Office of Air and Radiation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, stated that President Bush's ""Clear Skies proposal has been endorsed by the National Governors Association, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Conference of Black Mayors."" These organizations support federal passage of multipollutant legislation. They haven't specifically endorsed Clear Skies.\ This letter is in response to ""Hard ride ahead; Clear Skies plan is anything but clean"" (Perspective, Feb. 13), by Thomas William Heyck (who teaches British history at Northwestern University) and Josef J. Barton (associate professor of American history and director of the Chicago Field Studies Program at Northwestern). Heyck and Barton's piece makes a number of claims about the president's Clear Skies proposal and the current Clean Air Act that are flat-out inaccurate.\ Here are the facts:\ The president's Clear Skies proposal, if passed, will reduce air pollution from U.S. power plants by about 70 percent from today's levels--an unprecedented level of pollution reduction. It will require the power sector to invest about $50 billion to reduce air pollution-- by far the largest single investment ever made to improve air quality in this country.\ The Environmental Protection Agency projects that the pollution reductions mandated by Clear Skies will prevent the premature deaths of more than 10,000 people each year when fully implemented.\ The assertion that Clear Skies would be weaker than the current Clean Air Act is just not true. Clear Skies is designed not just to deliver unprecedented emissions reductions but to do so without significantly affecting electricity prices. The mandatory, market- based cap and trade program for power generators builds upon the existing Clean Air Act to better coordinate control of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury, and facilitate the achievement of critical health and environmental goals.\ The president's Clear Skies proposal has been endorsed by the National Governors Association, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Conference of Black Mayors. These organizations understand the need for a strong national program.\ Our shared goal is cleaner air and improved health. Working together we can continue not only to protect the environment, we can do it faster and cheaper."
70,"Rivals split on estate tax:\Senate candidates Alexi Giannoulias and Mark Kirk are divided over inheritance taxes. Giannoulias told Illinois agriculture leaders Wednesday that he supports keeping the estate tax -- or ""death tax,"" as critics call it. But the Chicago Democrat said he would exempt family farms worth less than $10 million. Kirk opposes the estate tax. He accuses Giannoulias of trying to have it both ways by backing the tax but trying to shield farmers. The Highland Park Republican says if the estate tax is bad for family farms, then it's bad for other family businesses. Kirk also defended his reversal on ""cap and trade"" environmental legislation, which he once supported and now opposes. He told farm leaders that he now thinks the bill would be bad for Illinois jobs.\Winnetka man sent to prison:\A Winnetka man has been sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison in connection with millions of dollars in fraud. Prosecutors said 51-year-old Steven Green was sentenced Wednesday after pleading guilty to one count of wire fraud. Green also was ordered to pay more than $3.3 million in restitution and to forfeit nearly $2 million and a Range Rover. Green, according to prosecutors, directed investors' money into bank accounts and used the funds to pay for personal expenses, like restaurant tabs and travel. The money was meant to be put into an escrow account and then invested. Green was ordered to begin serving his sentence Oct. 26.\Children burned by chemical:\Authorities said a 13-year-old boy in Chicago faces charges for throwing a caustic substance on two other children and burning them. The boy was ordered held in custody Wednesday while the victims -- a 10-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl -- were listed in good condition at a Chicago children's hospital burn unit. Cook County state's attorney's office spokesman Andy Conklin said the boy poured the liquid Tuesday from a container labeled ""poison"" onto the two other children from a building's porch. Conklin said the boy and girl were burned on their heads, torsos and arms. The boy's mother said her son thought he was pouring water. He is charged with aggravated battery causing great bodily harm, aggravated battery using a deadly weapon and heinous battery.\Ex-city inspector sentenced:\A former inspector with Chicago's Department of Environment has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to bribery charges. Michael Cease's sentence also includes two years of supervised release following his prison time. Cease pleaded guilty in May to federal program bribery. Cease, 40, told a property owner in September that asbestos had been found in one of his buildings. Authorities said Cease asked for $600 in exchange for false documents showing it had been removed, and another $550 to avoid a city violation. Cease has been ordered to begin his sentence Oct. 25."

72,"The worst wildfire season in Washington state history could be particularly devastating to the people who have lived here between the Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountains since long before the region became part of the United States.\Like other communities in the rural hills and valleys here, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation -- 12 tribes forced onto a reservation in 1872 -- are fighting to protect their lives, homes and businesses. \Yet while most are battling to confine the blaze to the wildlands outside their communities, for the tribes, the vast, drought-stricken forests are almost equally precious -- and not just because they regard the natural world as sacred. \While reservation forests provide habitat for wildlife and canopies beneath which traditional foods like huckleberries grow, trees also mean money. \For decades, the Colville have managed nearly half of their 1.4-million-acre reservation for commercial timber harvest, paying for almost a fourth of the tribe's $45 million annual budget. \This year, another timber revenue stream emerged: carbon credits, sold to oil giant BP to allow it to qualify under California's expanding cap-and-trade climate program, which allows companies to make up for some of their greenhouse gas emissions by paying to help maintain forests. \This year, the tribe was expecting to sell credits on about 480,000 acres of timber, allowing their forest to act as a remote carbon storage bank for California. They were completing an inventory of how much carbon forests would store. Then the reservation began burning. \""Obviously, this will have a big impact on what that footprint is now,"" said Cody Desautel, the land and property director for the tribes. \Desautel and many others say the kind of wildfires blazing across Washington in recent weeks are bigger, hotter and last longer than those in the past -- scorching the soil so deeply in some cases that regeneration may take longer than usual. \Not only will this year's fire cut into timber harvests, its ferocity raises questions about how reliable Western forests may be as natural carbon storage banks. \Carbon credits are controversial, with some environmental groups saying they allow polluters to essentially pay their way to respectability instead of being required to develop more environmentally friendly practices. \Others say credits, however imperfect, can be part of the solution -- providing some good for the environment while also helping some of the poorest people in a region, such as the Colville tribes. \""That's kind of what the carbon credits do -- they pay you to continue managing the way you're managing,"" Desautel said. ""The tribe has the option to go out and cut as much of this timber as they want, but they will pay us to keep it at the current levels."" \The more immediate question for the tribes in recent weeks has been how to respond to the fire. \Most of the risk to reservation timber came from the North Star fire, the second largest of the fires burning in the state. As of Wednesday, it had burned 170,000 acres. \Tribal leaders have asked firefighters first to protect lives and property, then to try to preserve valuable timber stands. \Desautel said doing so may require fighting the fire more slowly in places deeper in the forests. Once everything stops burning, the tribes will assess the damage and see what survived and how many of the burned trees it can still harvest. \----------\wyardley@tribpub.com\Credit: By William Yardley, Tribune Newspapers"
73,"Former Vice President Al Gore on Friday called on SXSW attendees to punish climate-change deniers, saying politicians should pay a price for rejecting ""accepted science.""\Gore said smart investors are moving away from companies tied to fossil fuels and toward companies investing in alternative energy. \""We need to put a price on carbon to accelerate these market trends,"" Gore said, referring to a proposed federal cap-and-trade system that would penalize companies that exceeded their carbon-emission limits. ""And in order to do that, we need to put a price on denial in politics."" \SXSW Interactive brings together designers, developers, investors, entrepreneurs and politicians for several days of talk about technology, innovation and the future.

Lee as director of the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office. Lee is the first woman to hold the job. \Pritzker used the swearing in to highlight the need for more women in technology. \""This is a very special moment,"" she said. She added in an interview after the event that she wanted the tech-heavy SXSW crowd ""to see that one of their own is here."" \In an hourlong question-and-answer session, Pritzker said she aimed to make the Commerce Department more responsive to business. \""We are basically a service business, and you are our customer, the private sector,"" she said, pointing to the audience. \Gore, who has made climate change an overriding theme since he lost to George W.

74,"Most people don't remember ObamaCare's notorious Section 1233, mandating government payments for end-of-life counseling. It aroused so much anxiety as a possible first slippery step on the road to state-mandated late-life rationing that the Senate never included it in the final health care law.\Well, it's back, by administrative fiat. A month ago, Medicare issued a regulation providing for end-of-life counseling during annual wellness visits. It was all nicely buried amid the simultaneous release of hundreds of new Medicare rules. \Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., author of Section 1233, was delighted. ""Mr. Blumenauer's office celebrated 'a quiet victory,' but urged supporters not to crow about it,"" reports The New York Times. Deathly quiet. In early November, his office sent an e-mail plea to supporters: ""We would ask that you not broadcast this accomplishment out to any of your lists ... e-mails can too easily be forwarded."" They had been lucky that ""thus far, it seems that no press or blogs have discovered it. ... The longer this (regulation) goes unnoticed, the better our chances of keeping it."" \So much for Democratic transparency and for their repeated claim that the more people learn what is in the health care law, the more they will like it. Turns out ignorance is the Democrats' best hope. \And regulation is their perfect vehicle, so much quieter than legislation. Consider two other regulatory usurpations in just the last few days: \On Dec. 23, the Interior Department issued Secretarial Order 3310 reversing a 2003 decision and giving itself the authority to designate public lands as ""wild lands."" A clever twofer: (1) a bureaucratic power grab -- for seven years up through Dec. 22, wilderness designation had been the exclusive province of Congress, and (2) a leftward lurch -- more land to be ""protected"" from such nefarious uses as domestic oil exploration in a country disastrously dependent on foreign sources. \The very same day, President Barack Obama's Environmental Protection Agency declared that in 2011 it would begin drawing up anti-carbon regulations on oil refineries and power plants, another power grab effectively enacting what Congress had firmly rejected when presented as cap-and-trade legislation. \For an Obama bureaucrat, however, the will of Congress is a mere speed bump. Hence, this regulatory trifecta, each one moving smartly left and nicely clarifying what the spirit of bipartisan compromise that Obama heralded in his post-lame-duck Dec. 22 news conference was really about: a shift to the center for public consumption and political appearance only. \On that day, Obama finally embraced the tax-cut compromise he had initially excoriated, but only to avoid forfeiting its obvious political benefit -- its appeal to independent voters who demand bipartisanship and are the key to Obama's re-election. But make no mistake: He hated the deal. \Obama's heart lies left. For those fooled into thinking otherwise by the new Obama of Dec. 22, his administration's defiantly liberal regulatory moves on the environment, energy and health care should disabuse even the most beguiled. \Because Obama needs to appear to reclaim the center, he will stage his ideological fights in yawn-inducing regulatory hearings rather than in the dramatic spotlight of congressional debate. How better to impose a liberal agenda on a center-right nation? It's Obama's only way forward during the next two years. He will never get past the half-Republican 112th what he could not get past the overwhelmingly Democratic 111th. He doesn't have the votes, and he surely doesn't want the publicity. \Obama knows he has only so many years to change the country. In his first two, he achieved much: the first stimulus, ObamaCare and financial regulation. For the next two, however, the Republican House will prevent any repetition of that. Obama's agenda will therefore have to be advanced by the more subterranean means of rule by regulation. \But this must simultaneously be mixed with ostentatious displays of legislative bipartisanship (e.g., the lame-duck tax-cut deal) in order to pull off the (apparent) centrist repositioning required for re-election. This, in turn, would grant Obama four more years when, freed from the need for pretense, he can reassert himself ideologically and complete the social-democratic transformation -- begun Jan. 20, 2009; derailed Nov. 2, 2010 -- that is the mission of his presidency. \----------\letters@charleskrauthammer.com"
75,"QUALITIES OF LIFE: HEALTH\ The more scientists learn about mercury's toxic effect on the human body, the less they want it lingering around. In recent years, the silvery substance has been hastily removed from thermometers, tooth fillings and most (but not all) vaccines. State Rep. Karen May (D-Highland Park) is working to get mercury out of the convenience lights in cars.\ So why is mercury still permitted in the air?\ Emissions from coal-fired power plants, the source of 41 percent of mercury pollution, inevitably end up in waterways and the muscles of fish.\ When pregnant women eat the contaminated fish, the mercury can permanently damage the brain and nervous system of an unborn child.\ Recognizing the health risks, the federal government took a feeble step in the right direction by issuing a rule in March that would, for the first time, reduce the amount of mercury that power plants can spew into the air.\ In the short term, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new standards require a 21 percent reduction by 2010.\ But two years ago, the EPA had a tougher plan in place, one that would have done far more to protect the health of fetuses. Power plants would have been required to limit pollutants by as much as 90 percent by 2008. Instead, the Bush administration shamelessly gutted the early proposal and replaced it with a cap and trade system that allows companies to buy the right to keep polluting.\ The new ""standards"" are so pathetic that a consortium of pediatricians and public health advocates last week called for Illinois to adopt state regulations that are stronger than the federal requirements.\ The group, which includes the Environmental Law & Policy Center and the Illinois chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, also wants Illinois to prohibit out-of-state trading of mercury credits, a practice that can allow mercury ""hot spots"" to remain in communities.\ Mercury, a naturally occurring metal, is hazardous to human health after certain kinds of bacteria in the environment convert it to a form called methyl mercury. It typically enters the body when we eat fish and is found in high concentrations in predatory sea creatures such as tuna (sorry, Charlie), swordfish, king mackerel and shark.\ One of every six pregnant women has mercury levels high enough to threaten fetal development, according to the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\ The EPA estimates that more than 300,000 newborns in the U.S. each year may have increased risk of learning disabilities and lower IQs due to mercury exposure in utero. Methyl mercury can also be passed to children through breast milk.\ Giving up seafood is not the answer. Fish is an excellent source of protein and has less saturated fat than meat and poultry. A study published last week in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that high levels of fish consumption are associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.\ Fatty, cold-water fish are a tremendous source of omega-3, an important fatty acid that reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. Omega-3 also can enhance brain development, which is why pregnant women especially need it in the third trimester. Sardines, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, Chinook salmon and anchovies have the highest levels of brain-boosting omega-3, which also is found in lesser amounts in nuts, soy, canola and flaxseed oil.\ So far, only six states have adopted new standards to reduce mercury pollution (or are in the process), and Illinois is not one of them. Until everyone gets on board, the only way out of this nutritional Catch-22 is to make informed choices about your seafood.\ One step is to keep track of the type and amount of fish you consume and calculate the possible mercury exposure with an online tool found at www.gotmercury.org.\ It also helps to know which fish have high levels of contaminants. In Illinois, methyl mercury fish advisories apply to all predator fish--all species of black bass (largemouth, smallmouth and spotted), striped bass, white bass, hybrid striped bass, walleye, sauger, saugeye, flathead catfish, muskellunge and northern pike--in all bodies of water.\ Pregnant women, women of childbearing age and children should not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish.\ Instead, try no more than 12 ounces per week of cooked fish, including shellfish, canned fish (including tuna) or smaller ocean fish. (A typical serving is 3 to 6 ounces.)\ Finally, remember that white albacore tuna is not just more expensive but also has more mercury contamination than chunk light.\ ----------\ E-mail Julie Deardorff at jdeardorff@tribune.com.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the president's directive through his Climate Action Plan, issued a rule on Sept. 20 that will kill the future for coal and raise costs for electricity in the future.
\
EPA's rule limits the release of carbon-dioxide at any new coal power plant. In reality, the rule is a ban on constructing new coal-fired power plants, as there is no technology commercially available and capable of meeting the standards set.
\
For those who say use carbon capture and sequestration, there is no full-scale power plant that is currently utilizing this technology. While some are under construction, that doesn't mean it will be successful. Plus, the cost of such technology is tremendous.
\
We understand that the climate changes. Temperatures rise and fall over time and even minor changes can have great effects, as evidenced in Greenland. (Shimkus visited Greenland in 2008.) And we owe it to future generations to ensure that our environment is safe and clean.
\
Yet unilateral, job-killing proposals like this rule, or cap and trade, do nothing more than increase the cost of doing business in America and reduce our competitiveness in the global economy.
\
Even if the United States reduces its carbon emissions, many other nations around the globe will continue to increase their rate of emissions, and the United States will face the harsh economic effects of this rule alone.
\
In fact, carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. actually decreased last year by 3.8 percent. This represents the lowest levels since the mid-1990s. At the same time, carbon dioxide emissions around the world increased last year to the highest levels ever on record.
\
So while we are doing our part, the world is falling behind. This rule will penalize consumers by jeopardizing energy reliability and increasing utility costs to families and businesses across Illinois.
\
What are the real effects of this rule? Forget about new coal-fired power plants being built. Thus, forget about new coal mines being opened. The effects could eventually include the closing of both existing power plants and coal mines -- putting thousands of workers out of their jobs, including many right here in Illinois.
\
Additionally, without the reasonably priced base load electricity generated by coal-fired power plants, the president and EPA want us to move toward renewable power.
\
While wind and solar are increasing the amount of electricity they generate, they are reliant on factors that do not permit them to be considered for our base load needs.
\
Luckily, natural gas is booming -- no thanks to the president and EPA. Our efforts in Congress have been to keep EPA out of regulating fracking. We hope the future remains bright for natural gas, but that doesn't mean we should shove coal aside.
\
What happens when cheaper and more reliable electricity generation is removed from our nation's power fleet? Higher prices and more brownouts. Is that what you want to see happen? We don't.
\
And once they think we've forgotten about this rule, next year comes the whopper -- a rule restricting carbon emissions from existing plants, which sets a dangerous path for America resulting in an over-reliance on a single fuel source for our electricity generation.
\
We promise to continue to fight the implementation of this rule and future anti-coal rules through legislative and funding means to ensure we have a true all-of-the-above national energy policy.

77,"After criticism from environmental groups, Sen. Mark Kirk said Thursday that climate change is real and human activity contributes to it.\The Illinois Republican issued a statement after Environment & Energy Daily reported Thursday on remarks Kirk made a day earlier to one of its reporters. According to E&E Daily, Kirk said climate change isn't caused by industrial greenhouse gas emissions, but its report did not quote him directly on that point. \E&E Daily did quote Kirk as saying that ""political correctness took over climate science."" \It also quoted Kirk as saying: ""We had the previous warming period, which was called global optimum, and the best way to talk about that is when (Leif Eriksson) went west from his home, he discovered a land mass that he called Greenland, because it was. And that was called the global optimum, because the planet was much warmer. By calling Greenland 'green land,' we know that the climate has been changing pretty regularly within recorded memory."" \Eriksson was an 11th-century explorer widely held to have been the first European to reach North America, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. His father, Erik Thorvaldson, founded the first European settlement on Greenland, Britannica says. \Climate change is a hot issue as the Senate is poised for votes beginning Monday on the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline. The White House says it will veto the measure, if passed. \Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, sought Thursday to amend the pipeline legislation with a ""sense of Congress"" resolution saying climate change is real and caused by human activity and already has caused ""devastating problems."" \His amendment was offered at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee meeting and was tabled, said Jeff Frank, his press secretary. Kirk is not on the committee. \Kirk's spokeswoman, Danielle Varallo, did not respond to a Tribune question on whether Kirk was quoted accurately by E&E Daily. She said, however, the report did ""not accurately reflect his position."" She also issued a statement to the Tribune in which Kirk said: ""Climate change is real, and human beings definitely play a role. As I have said since 2010, I will not support a carbon tax or similar attempts which hurt the Illinois or American economy."" \E&E reporter Nick Juliano said Thursday he quoted Kirk correctly and Kirk's office had not asked for a correction. \After the story was published, Henry Henderson, Midwest director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Kirk's statements were ""bewildering"" and an ""about-face"" from his previous statements. \Henderson said carbon pollution from the energy, transportation and industrial sectors fuels climate change, which triggers more asthma attacks and respiratory disease, worsens air quality and contributes to extreme weather. \The Environmental Law & Policy Center said Kirk's comments to E&E were ""disappointing."" It said it would work with Illinois scientists and business leaders to brief the senator on the ""realities of climate change."" \Kirk, while in the House, supported a ""cap-and-trade"" proposal to control greenhouse gas emissions but changed his stance when he ran for the Senate in 2010. \----------\kskiba@tribpub.com \Twitter @KatherineSkiba\Credit: By Katherine Skiba, Tribune reporter"
78,"Last month, a draft memo surfaced from the Department of Homeland Security suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency. Most disturbing was the stated rationale. This was being proposed ""in the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform."" In other words, because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, they will legislate it themselves.\Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate. Administrators administer the law, they don't change it. That's the legislators' job.\When questioned, the White House played down the toxic memo, leaving the impression that it was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland Security. But the administration is engaged in an even more significant power play elsewhere.\A 2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they threaten human health and the environment. The Obama EPA made precisely that finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The Washington Post, sending ""a message to Congress.""\It was not a terribly subtle message: Enact cap-and-trade legislation -- taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based energy -- or the EPA will do so unilaterally. As Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch noted, such a finding ""is likely to help light a fire under Congress to get moving.""\Well, Congress didn't. Despite the ""regulatory cudgel"" (to again quote the Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly refused to acquiesce.\Good for the Senate. But what to do when the executive is passively aggressive rather than actively so? Take border security. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., reports that President Barack Obama told him about pressure from his political left and its concern that if the border is secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform (i.e., amnesty). Indeed, Homeland Security's abandonment of the ""virtual fence"" on the southern border, combined with its lack of interest in completing the real fence, gives the impression that serious border enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican quid pro quo on comprehensive reform.\But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for legislative favors. It is, as the administration argued in court in the Arizona case, the federal executive's constitutional responsibility. Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. Nonexecution is a dereliction of duty.\This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal government or to Democrats. In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has just issued a ruling allowing police to ask about one's immigration status when stopped for some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment.\Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect. If police latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to expand, that's an issue for the legislature, not the executive.\How did we get here? I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.) The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned the heads of the country's nine largest banks and informed them that henceforth the federal government was their business partner. The banks were under no legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal government, when crossed, to cause you trouble. They complied.\So did BP when Obama summoned its top executives to the White House to demand a $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages. Existing law capped damages at $75 million. BP, like the banks, understood the power of the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was.\Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was) and still be troubled by how we got there. Everyone wants energy in the executive (as Alexander Hamilton called it). But not lawlessness. In the modern welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That's bad enough. But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the separation of powers. Such constraints on your life must first be approved by both houses of Congress.\That's called the consent of the governed. The constitutional order is meant to subject you to the will of the people's representatives, not to the whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking bureaucrat.\----------\letters@charleskrauthammer.com\Credit: By Charles Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist based in Washington: Washington Post Writers Group"
79,"WASHINGTON Democrats steered the House toward more aggressivelytackling global warming and other environmental problems Thursday,toppling veteran Michigan Rep. John Dingell, a staunch supporter ofDetroit automakers, from an important energy panel in favor ofCalifornia liberal Rep. Henry Waxman.\The switch could help President-elect Barack Obama on Capitol Hillwith one of his favored issues: trying to curb global warming bylimiting greenhouse gas emissions. But Waxmans combative stance onclimate change and other issues also could alienate Republicans andmoderate Democrats, making it harder to get the bipartisan supportObama will need.\Waxman is an avid environmentalist and booster of health careprograms and a home-state ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Hedefeated Dingell on a 137-122 vote in the Democratic Party caucus,capping a bruising fight.\The Energy and Commerce panel is one of the most important Housecommittees.\, with sweeping jurisdiction over energy, the environment, consumerprotection, telecommunications and health care programs such asMedicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program.\Dingell has been the top Democrat on the panel for 28 years and isan old-school supporter of Detroits carmakers and other big industriessuch as electric utilities. His bitter battles with Waxman over cleanair issues date to the 80s and were recently revived as Waxmancomplained that the committee has been too slow to address globalwarming.\Dingell comes from an era of autocratic committee chairmen and hashad to adapt to a House in which power is consolidated around Pelosi,who has clashed with him in the past. Pelosi did not publicly takesides in the new vote, but her support of Waxman was well known andplayed a role in the strong tally.\Last year, in a move that undercut Dingells power on the globalwarming issue, she created a special panel led by Massachusetts Rep.Edward Markey to make the case for bigger reductions in greenhousegases. Waxman was the candidate of change in a year dominated by thattheme. He likened the first years of the Obama administration to aonce-in-a-generation opportunity to get things done in Washington.\""The argument we made was that we needed a change for the committeeto have the leadership that will work with this administration andmembers in both the House and the Senate in order to get importantissues passed in health care, environmental protection, in energypolicy,"" Waxman said after the vote.\Waxman, 69, has a lengthy congressional resume of aggressiveinvestigations and legislative action.\Dingells reputation for putting Detroits auto interests above allelse didnt help his campaign to keep his job especially asautomakers seeking a bailout have been taking a public relationspounding on Capitol Hill.\His defenders said he had done nothing to deserve being dumped,pointing to a long list of accomplishments and the panels busyworkload over the past two years, including successfully enacting anenergy bill that would raise automobile fuel economy standards to 35miles per gallon by 2020.\Driving Waxmans bid was the issue of global warming, a top issuefor Obama. Waxman is expected to move legislation with tougheremissions standards than Dingell would have.\Environmentalists say Dingell has acted too slowly on globalwarming. A bill he released last month was a poke in the eye to Waxmanand Pelosi, D-Calif., since it would prevent states, includingCalifornia, from setting tougher auto emissions standards than thefederal government.\""Waxmans victory is a breath of fresh air of clean air. It was astunning defeat for the corporate lobbyists on K Street,"" said FrankODonnell, president of Clean Air Watch. ""It shows that a majority ofthe House Democrats are ready to work with the incoming Obamaadministration on effective global warming legislation.""\Still, taking on global warming will be anything but a cakewalk. Acontroversial ""cap and trade"" mechanism in which permits are sold istantamount to a huge tax on carbon dioxide emissions and will faceresistance from coal state Democrats and moderate party members tosay nothing of Republicans.\""This decision sends a troubling signal from a majority that haspromised to govern from the center,"" said House GOP leader John Boehnerof Ohio. ""They moved away from Chairman Dingell because he is committedto approaching energy and environmental issues in a manner thatprotects American jobs.""\Bill Kovacs, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, saidDingell brought a balanced and methodical approach to environmentalpolicy and sought the input of the regulated industries.\Its the difference of ""one trying to keep everyone in the systemand one knowing exactly where they want to go and how they are going toget there,"" Kovacs said.\Associated Press writer Dina Cappiello contributed to this report."
80,"Just before his speech Wednesday to the American Society of News Editors, word emerged that the Republican presidential front-runner would not allow photographers to get closer than 150 feet while he spoke.\The journalists protested, noting that President Barack Obama, speaking to the same group Tuesday in the same ballroom at the Marriott Wardman Park, allowed photographers to shoot just a few feet from him, but the Romney campaign rejected the appeal. \""I shot the Springsteen concert and I was closer than this,"" grumbled one veteran photographer, looking through his 600 mm lens, a type more commonly used at football games. \The juxtaposition -- up-close Obama and stand-back Mitt Romney -- was an apt beginning to the presidential campaign. By all accounts (except, perhaps, Rick Santorum's), Romney's primary wins on Tuesday made his nomination virtually certain, which makes this week the unofficial beginning of the general election race. Obama's and Romney's speeches to the editors' gathering on successive days gave a preview of their divergent campaign styles. \Obama spoke to the group for exactly an hour and was relatively loose, making jokes about the Romney campaign's Etch A Sketch episode and the moment his own private exchange with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was caught by an open microphone. Romney spoke for half that time, reading a slashing assault on the president from a teleprompter. When he went off script, during the Q&A session after the speech, he kept returning to the needs of corporate America. \Asked to critique Obama's speech, Romney uttered the phrase ""I saw an article in The Wall Street Journal just a couple days ago..."" Asked why he is polling 18 points behind Obama among women, Romney went on a screed about business reaction to Obamacare, financial regulations, cap-and-trade proposals and labor decisions. ""The economy is simply the addition of all the businesses in America,"" Romney told the editors -- an echo of his earlier claim that ""corporations are people."" \The performance, though stiff, was certainly not Romney's worst. For the first time, he could safely turn his attention away from his Republican rivals, allowing him to tear into the president for the bulk of his speech. \Obama will ""state his true position only after the election is over,"" Romney alleged, and he is ""setting up a straw man to distract us from his record."" Obama ""delayed the recovery and he made it anemic,"" enacted ""the mother of all earmarks,"" is ""apologizing for America abroad"" and gave money to ""his friends and campaign contributors at companies like Solyndra."" \The barrage was extensive: ""trillion-dollar deficit ... largest tax increase in history ... end Medicare as we know it ... inaction on entitlements ... hide-and-seek campaign."" Taunted Romney: ""It almost makes one long for the days when the president simply led from behind."" \It's potentially a strong line of attack, and some of the accusations have the virtue of being true. But it's not clear whether voters will notice that substance through Romney's unsettling style. \Romney took the stage to a Sousa march and immediately tried out a few standard-issue jokes. He said he and his campaign press corps have ""aired our dirty laundry together, sometimes literally as well as figuratively."" He made light of his eligibility for Medicare. He recalled LBJ's line that if he were to walk on water, the headline would be ""President can't swim."" He even trotted out Yogi Berra: ""Forecasting is very difficult, especially when it involves the future."" All met with weak laughter. \He further warmed up his audience by complaining about the use of anonymous sources. When asked about a ""shield law"" for confidential sources, Romney demurred: ""I'd want to hear from -- from people in the industry."" \Deferring to industry is a Romney trademark. Even his thoughts on his gender gap in the polls came straight from the boardroom. \""Almost every measure that the president has taken made it harder for small business to decide to grow in America or big business to stay here,"" he said, vowing to create ""the best environment for business in the world -- small business, big business, entrepreneurs, innovators, job creators of all kinds."" He continued his answer on the gender gap by quoting the Coca-Cola chief's views on China. \The candidate is clearly aware of his style deficit, because he closed with a wish for November that ""our choice will not be one of party or personality."" \And if the campaign is about personality? To paraphrase Yogi Berra, Romney will be an overwhelming underdog. \----------\danamilbank@washpost.com"
81,"Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. Well spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of ObamaCare, financial reform and a near trillion-dollar stimulus that will significantly transform the country. But spent nonetheless. There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural.\That's why, as I suggested last week, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next two-and-a-half years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress in January.\Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda.\That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses. It is still possible for the gaffe-happy Republicans to blow it. When the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee publicly apologizes to the corporation that unleashed the worst oil spill in American history, you know the Republicans are capable of just about anything.\But assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-on reforms are dead.\Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring). They could then vote for anything -- including measures they today shun as the midterms approach and their seats are threatened -- because they would have nothing to lose. They would be unemployed. And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.\As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session. Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes, and climate-change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.\Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden. Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission, which reports by Dec. 1.\And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress -- but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.\It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply.\Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through a health-care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber -- something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.\How then to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress? Bring the issue up now -- applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day. Every current member should be publicly asked: In the event you lose in November do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?\The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow. Call me naive, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.\----------\letters@charleskrauthammer.com\Credit: By Charles Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist based in Washington: Washington Post Writers Group"

84,"
CHAMPAIGN - Sitting in his office on the fourth floor of the new Business Instructional Facility at the University of Illinois, Don Fullerton is literally surrounded by energy investment opportunities.
\
Fullerton and Brian Youngberg, senior energy and utility analyst for Edward Jones in St. Louis, agree that the long-term outlook for energy investments is good.
\
Fullerton, a professor of finance at the Business College and Institute of Government and Public Affairs, said the building includes several ""green"" technologies, such as lights that automatically turn off when nobody is in the office and windows with built-in shades to make the building more energy-efficient.
\
There is a ""green"" roof with plants, gravel and dirt over a waterproof membrane to provide insulation, resulting in lower heating and air-conditioning costs. And solar panels also adorn the roof.
\
Those kinds of innovations will pay off in the future in reduced energy costs, as well as being more friendly to the environment, Fullerton said.
\
The new UI Business College building even has showers for men and women.
\
""Folks can bike to work and shower,"" Fullerton said. ""You have to be a little imaginative.""
\
Fullerton, who is also director of the National Bureau of Economic Research program on environmental and energy economics, said renewable energy is, in the long run, part of the solution to both environmental and economic concerns associated with fossil fuels.
\
For the short term, the recession and national economy have reduced the energy demands for both the consumer and industry, Fullerton said. But, as the economy climbs back up, those energy demands will increase.
\
""The slow-down is general and is going to affect all sectors. It will discourage investments of all sorts, for the short run,"" he said. ""On the other hand, later investments will pick up, generally, but I expect it to pick up, specifically, in energy efficiency and alternative energy.""
\
That raises thousands of possibilities for so-called ""green"" investors, he said.
\
Fullerton said global warming is a real problem caused by oil, coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels causing emissions of carbon dioxide. Nations, companies, families and individuals have to plan to use less fossil fuels, he said.
\
One way to ensure that shift is to enact a ""cap and trade"" program like the one in Europe, he said.
\
President-elect Barack Obama campaigned on a proposed limit on total tons of carbon dioxide emissions linked to permits based on prior emissions, similar to the European model. Total emissions for any electric plant or manufacturer would be no more than 90 percent of last year's total emissions and ratchet down each year thereafter, Fullerton said.
\
One key to the program is that companies are allowed to trade, or buy and sell from their own emissions cap. In Europe, those permits became a valuable commodity in themselves, selling in the range of 20 to 30 euros per ton of carbon dioxide emissions.
\
Under Obama's proposal, however, the U.S. government would sell those permits instead of handing them out. Thus, the federal government would retain the profits, which could be used to reduce the deficit or cut taxes.
\
The restrictions on fossil fuels will raise the costs of gasoline, electricity and manufactured goods. But that means both industry and consumers will have incentives to rely more on alternative energy solutions, like solar power, wind power or nuclear power, Fullerton said.
\
""That's what's going to drive alternative energy investments, not government spending,"" he said. Youngberg said the Obama administration is expected to focus on renewable energy to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels.
\
""Over the long term, renewable energy is part of the solution,"" Youngberg said. ""Renewable energy is one of the growth areas in the energy sector.""
\
However, oil is still going to be a dominant business for decades, he said.
\
""In general, I'm positive for the long-term outlook for energy and utility stocks,"" Youngberg said.
\
While the short-term outlook has some uncertainty, Youngberg thinks energy and utility stocks have attractive values, currently, and offer attractive dividends.
\
He said Edward Jones recommends investing in a mutual fund or exchange traded fund that focuses on renewable energy. With such a fund, there will be diversity.
\
For those buying individual energy stocks, the company also recommends that people own shares in a couple of large, diversified companies, which are more stable and better able to handle fluctuations.

85,"Trump and GM \General Motors has announced that a number of assembly plants are being closed in the U.S. in order to facilitate restructuring and cost savings. President Donald Trump has berated GM for actions that will put big numbers in the unemployment lines.\I really don't think the president should dictate how GM runs its business. If GM makes a product the public doesn't buy, so be it.\What I find interesting is that we hear nothing from the influential United Auto Workers union and its primary benefactors, the Democratic Party.\Where is the voice of Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer or our own beloved Dick Durbin? The Democratic Party has been and probably always will be supporting the rights of union workers. Where are the teachers union, the electricians or the longshoremen? Should they not side with the assembly linemen and women who are being shown the door?\GM says it will still manufacture cars in China. Really! Kind of resembles the proverbial knife in the back. Come on Durbin, Pelosi, Schumer and all you Dems who have benefited from union support. Speak up. No, you will all just sit back and blame Trump because no one is buying a new Impala.\-- Don Lass, Oswego \\Globe is warming\The National Climate Assessment should serve as a wake-up call for all of us to take positive action on what will be the defining issue of our generation. Let's put aside attempts by fossil fuel interests to ""reframe the discussion."" Let's examine this issue honestly and without flinching. The Trump administration report was vetted by 13 government agencies and makes it clear that failure to act meaningfully will cost our economy dearly and lead to painful struggles and suffering, even here in the Midwest.\Let's look for solutions that reduce climate impacts while rebuilding our economy in a just and fair way by incentivizing 21st century solutions. Many economists are calling for a price on carbon using mechanisms like fee and dividend. Why not pursue this in a way that works best for society, by putting money in our pockets?\-- Jeff Gahris, Wheaton \\Suburbanites can help\""Climate report a warning to Midwest"" (Nov. 25) details the challenges the Midwest will face as temperatures rise. They include declines in agricultural productivity, more frequent and severe storms and diminished air quality, which will adversely impact those with respiratory ailments.\The suburbs have a role to play in slowing climate change. People in the suburbs must give up their perfect green lawns. These lawns are not sustainable and the weed killers needed to maintain them have been targeted as culprits in both human health and overall insect declines.\Suburbanites must embrace diversified lawns that contain different types of plants but require less water, less mowing, and have less impact our environment. Plant trees or native perennials in every empty spot you see. Encourage your local schools and municipalities to do the same. These places have vast campuses that are covered in grass. As long as they are not being used as ball fields, plant trees to provide shade and food for animals and help clean the air.\Municipalities must lead the way and provide resources to the people in their communities to help them become resilient to the changing climate.\-- Cathy O'Shea, Prospect Heights \\Follow the money\Your editorial ""Climate Change is a Midwest crisis in the making"" (Nov. 27) moves the discussion forward. Solving this crisis is about protecting our economy.\""Members of Congress can take the lead to re-establish priorities including reducing carbon emissions from coal plants and vehicles,"" the editorial says.\Wall Street is gathering the political will to shift its goals toward long-term instead of short-term gains. Main Street and rural voters are coming to understand that everybody's health and survival are at stake.\Three main policy choices match the scale of this giant problem: pricing carbon; cap and trade; or regulation. A best first step is a revenue-neutral carbon fee and rebate/dividend put forth by Citizens Climate Lobby -- because it stands a chance in our current Congress.

86,"My magic wand is on the fritz, otherwise wed have a big, new federal program to free America from its dependence on oil. Like other environmentalists, Im sad that the calamity in the Gulf of Mexico hasnt spurred Washington to more vigorously promote Americas exit from this curse.\The fault may lie with President Obamas timidity, a public scared by major new government programs or fossil-fuel interests flashing their campaign dough. Probably its all three, but the bottom line is this: An all-out effort to unchain America from hydrocarbons is essential to national security, a healthy environment and economic prosperity in the 21st century. But its not politically possible.\And so we must look at whats passable. Fortunately, theres one piece to the escape strategy that business leaders, military brass and the buying public all like and would create jobs. Most importantly, it has bipartisan support in Congress.\We speak of electric cars, specifically the ""Electric Vehicle Deployment Act of 2010."" The bills goal is to electrify half of Americas cars and trucks within 20 years. That, its backers say, would cut Americas dependence on petroleum by a third. Similar legislation is before the House.\The Senate bill would name at least five communities to be models for electric-vehicle transportation. They would build stations where motorists could recharge their cars batteries. Residents would be offered a $10,000 tax credit to buy electric cars. And the federal government would put $1.5 billion into research for improving electric-car technology.\Electric cars dont appear to be a very hard sell to those who would buy them. The first all-electric model, the Nissan Leaf, will hit the U.S. market at the end of the year. (The batteries will be made in Smyrna, Tenn.) But you wont be able to just pick one up, because the years production is already sold out. More than two-thirds of the 19,000 preorders are from the United States.\The Chevy Volt will reach showrooms around that time. Its battery range of 40 miles is considerably smaller than the Nissan Leafs 100 miles, but the Volt has a small gasoline engine to keep the car going if a recharging station is not handy.\More than 75 percent of Americans commute 40 miles or less a day. That means most could plug in their Volts at the end of the day and drive off fully charged in the morning.\Being both an environmentalist and a fan of high automotive performance can be awkward. But carmakers are learning to put zoom into their fuel-efficient models. The Ford Fusion Hybrid, for example, gets 41 miles per gallon in the city, but can pull away from a stoplight at a respectable pace. ""Sustainable mobility solutions"" need not be as boring as they sound.\What about the source of the electric power? Although an all-electric vehicle puts out zero emissions, that is probably not true of the plant that provides the electricity. While California has moved its mix of electricity sources toward clean, renewable energy, other parts of America are still highly dependent on dirty, coal-powered plants.\However, electric cars cut global warming pollution even where coal supplies the power, according to a study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. Thats because cars plugged in overnight employ unused capacity in the current electric system.\So let the brawl over cap and trade proceed. Outside of the oil business, most everyone seems enthusiastic about accelerating a move toward electric cars. Nothing should stop Congress from revving up the process. Right?"
87,"By the time he died last month, Russell Train was largely forgotten. Most Americans didn't know that, as The New York Times' obituary said, he helped shape ""the world's first comprehensive program for scrubbing the skies and waters of pollution, ensuring the survival of ecologically significant plants and animals, and safeguarding citizens from exposure to toxic chemicals.""\Here's the really surprising part: Train was a Republican. He served as the first chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality under one Republican president, Richard Nixon, and as head of the Environmental Protection Agency under another, Gerald Ford. After that he ran the U.S. affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund. \Back then, believe it or not, there was no conflict between being a Republican (or a conservative) and favoring environmental protection. Nixon signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, one of the most vital anti-pollution measures ever, as well as the Endangered Species Act, which aimed at preventing the extinction of birds, animals and other living things. \""Clean air, clean water, open spaces -- these should once again be the birthright of every American,"" Nixon said unabashedly. \But today, ""Republican environmentalist"" is an oxymoron. During his presidential campaign, Newt Gingrich called for abolishing the EPA. Rick Santorum decried a ""reign of environmental terror."" Michele Bachmann vowed that in her administration, ""the EPA will have doors locked and lights turned off."" \The 2012 party platform says federal agencies should ""properly and correctly apply environmental laws and regulations, always in support of economic development, job creation and American prosperity and leadership"" -- not, you will notice, safeguarding human health or protecting the planet. \In his convention speech, Mitt Romney got in line with GOP dogma. ""President (Barack) Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet,"" he noted with a look of disbelief, evoking jeers and laughter. ""My promise"" -- long pause -- ""is to help you and your family."" You and your family, after all, have nothing to gain from environmental protections. \This radical shift has come about only in recent years, precipitated in part by climate change. Faced with the specter of a planet heating up from the burning of fossil fuels, conservatives have taken refuge in obstinate denial. Their eagerness to latch on to any sliver of evidence casting doubt on the phenomenon makes it plain: Nothing can change their minds. \They no longer see the environment as a realm in which Republicans can and should offer tightly focused, science-based solutions that balance vital interests such as human health and economic growth. They see it as an arena where the only option is to dismantle regulations. \It was not always that way. President George H.W. Bush, who promised to be ""the environmental president,"" supported a revision of the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution, curb acid rain and protect the ozone layer. \In 2008, John McCain proposed a cap-and-trade system to combat global warming, warning that ""time is short and the dangers are great."" Today, no candidate taking that position could possibly be nominated. \William Reilly, who ran the EPA under the first President Bush, sounded despairing notes when I called him to ask about the shift in his party. \As co-chair of the commission that investigated the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, he was abused by House Republicans when he testified on the need for better regulation of offshore drilling. ""The level of vitriol was such that I was surprised,"" Reilly said. \The public might not be. Environmental concerns are not the reason Romney is trailing in the polls, but they're not helping. A recent The Economist/YouGov poll found that on this issue, independent voters trust Obama over his challenger by a whopping margin of 49 percent to 19 percent. \Republicans once performed the valuable task of insisting that alleged environmental harms be proved, not merely assumed, and that solutions be market-friendly, carefully tailored and cost-effective. The give-and-take between them and Democrats yielded better remedies. \Today, they have only one response to any environmental concerns, which resembles what Mark Twain said about a cat that sits on a hot stove lid: ""She will never sit down on a hot lid again -- and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore."" \----------\Steve Chapman is a member of the Tribune's editorial board and blogs at chicagotribune.com/chapman. \schapman@tribune.com \Twitter @SteveChapman13\Credit: By Steve Chapman, a member of the Tribune's editorial board"
88,"One of the most important events of our lifetimes may have just transpired. A federal agency has decided that it has the power to regulate everything, including the air you breathe.\Nominally, the Environmental Protection Agency's announcement Friday only applies to new-car emissions. But pretty much everyone agrees that the ruling opens the door to regulating, well, everything.\According to the EPA, greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide -- the gas you exhale -- as well as methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. It is literally impossible to imagine a significant economic or human activity that does not involve the production of one of these gases. Don't think just of the gas and electricity bills. Cow flatulence is a serious concern of the EPA's already. What next? Perhaps an EPA mandarin will pick up a copy of ""The Greenpeace Guide to Environmentally Friendly Sex"" and go after the root causes of global warming.\Whether global warming is a crisis that warrants immediate, drastic action (I don't think it does), and whether such wholesale measures would be an economic calamity (they would be), the EPA's decision should be disturbing to people who believe in democratic, constitutional government.\Two years ago, the Supreme Court -- the least democratic branch of our formal government -- decided in Massachusetts vs. EPA that the agency could regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. With this judicial green light, the EPA has launched its power grab over all that burns, breathes, burps, flies, drives and passes gas.\Yes, the head of the EPA reports to the president, which gives some patina of democratic accountability. Except the EPA is supposed to be politically autonomous, doing what it thinks best according to what President Barack Obama calls ""sound science."" So the government bureaucracy is on its way to strong-arming the economy in ways Congress never imagined when it passed the Clean Air Act in 1970. Or the president has suddenly gained sweeping new powers over American life, in ways never imagined by Congress or the founders, and despite the fact that these new powers were never put before the voters.\This is not a sudden development. Vast swaths of the state have been on autopilot for years, effectively immune to democratic influence. The Federal Reserve, particularly of late, has been acting like the fourth branch of government. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, without congressional, presidential or court approval, has been committing trillions of dollars to fix the financial crisis. That may be warranted; only time will tell. But there's still something troubling about an institution so immune to democratic control.\In 2002, Congress created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It covers its expenses by taxing all publicly traded corporations. It alone determines the amount to tax, without approval of the White House or, more important, Congress, which, according to the Constitution, has the sole authority to levy taxes: ""All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives"" (Article 1, Section 7).\In 1999, the Federal Communications Commission raised the so-called Gore tax on long-distance phone calls by 73 percent without seeking congressional approval. Lord knows what the EPA could collect by extorting ""climate criminals.""\In fairness, the Obama administration and congressional Democrats reportedly don't want to cede authority to the EPA. Rather, they want to use the threat of an EPA takeover -- and its presumably draconian impositions on business -- to force reluctant moderate Democratic and Republican members of Congress to sign on to the president's cap-and-trade scheme (itself an enormous energy tax).\California's Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has said as much: ""EPA, through its scientists, has given us a warning that global warming pollution is a clear, present and future danger to America's families. If Congress does not act to pass legislation, then I will call on the EPA to take all steps authorized by law to protect our families.""\Translation: Either you vote our way or we'll render voting meaningless.\Other Democrats are delighted by the EPA decision because it allows them to have their pre- ferred policy -- carbon regulation -- without actually having to vote for it.\Either way, it doesn't sound like these folks take their oaths of office very seriously.\----------\JonahsColumn@aol.com\Credit: By Jonah Goldberg, an editor at National Review Online: Tribune Media Services"
89,"You hear a lot of flattering but unverifiable numbers and predictions attached to the Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. (It'll be like removing 166 million cars from the highway! The health savings will far outstrip the cost!)\But if you focus on one scary fact -- climate change is happening -- you come around quickly to the idea that this new energy blueprint is sound, if imperfect. \The rules, released Monday by the Environmental Protection Agency, set limits for the first time on greenhouse gas emissions from power generating stations. The overall goal: to cut carbon pollutants from the power sector 32 percent below their 2005 level. \Power plants, which produce electricity, are the targets here because most burn coal or natural gas and they contribute one-third of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions. These fossil fuels (especially coal) are dirty and dangerous. Trapped in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases raise the globe's temperature and wreak havoc with the environment. Shrinking ice caps, rising seas, more flooding, more intense heat waves -- these phenomena are happening now. The question is whether we can band together as a planet in time to reverse the effects. \A momentary pause: Just in writing the preceding paragraph, we entered the frustrating realm of citing unverifiable numbers and predictions to argue for the EPA action on global warming. We'd prefer to know with more certainty what the risks are to the planet and what the economic costs and benefits of aggressive action will be. But we can't know for certain. We can only combine science and common sense and say the right path is to clean up industrialization's awful mess in the skies and present future generations with a healthier Earth. \The EPA regulations, tweaked a bit from a draft version released last year, take a strong step in that direction. The rules also set down a crucial marker for the U.S. to use in negotiations to reach a U.N. deal in Paris in December to reduce global greenhouse gases. Chinese President Xi Jinping, at a November summit meeting with Obama, pledged for the first time to cap China's emissions, though relying on some squishy math. The more seriously the U.S. acts, the more likely other polluting nations like China and India will do the same in Paris. \The heart of the EPA plan is to shift power plants from burning so much coal to using cleaner sources, including natural gas, wind and solar energy. Coal generates about 40 percent of the nation's electricity, while wind and solar together chip in 5 percent. By 2030, according to the plan, coal would drop to 27 percent, below the renewables at 28 percent. Natural gas, which burns more cleanly than coal, would remain a big part of the mix. \The how-tos for this don't come down from on high, which is good. Individual states will each receive a goal for reducing emissions. They will sketch out plans by 2018 and start meeting reductions in 2022. This gives Illinois a chance to make some decisions for its own benefit, though we know coal won't and shouldn't be a big part of the answer. It's just too dirty. \The EPA says the plan will cost utility companies billions -- expenses they'll likely pass along to ratepayers. The EPA includes some important guidelines and incentives, including an emissions trading system that would allow power plants or states to team up to buy and sell carbon allowances. That's exciting because cap-and-trade encourages cooperation by acknowledging the obvious: All 50 states, and the entire world, share one atmosphere. \Another positive wrinkle doesn't go far enough: The plan acknowledges the role of nuclear energy, which emits zero carbons, by allowing several states with nuclear plants under construction to include them in their plans. But the EPA guidelines don't change the overall game for nukes, which are safe and should be an expanding part of the U.S. energy mix. \Two basic assumptions among many warrant consideration: The country was already moving in the right direction by recognizing that burning coal is an old habit we need to quit. Energy companies are investing in new technology and, led by California and others, seem ready to embrace investment in renewables. The new rules ""will act like an accelerant,"" Ted Craver, CEO of the parent of Southern California Edison, told The Wall Street Journal. ""Now all the states will have to grapple with the need to reduce carbon emissions."" \Which isn't a guarantee that the plan will be enacted as rolled out Monday. The coal industry will argue forcefully, and with some merit, that the administration's reach exceeds its legal grasp. We'll see how federal courts rule. \Nor is this initiative divorced from politics. It's part of President Barack Obama's effort to burnish his legacy, so congressional Republicans won't be kind. They'll also accuse the administration of kowtowing to the same environmental hard-liners who have kept the administration -- mistakenly, we think -- from approving the Keystone XL pipeline project. And critics of several stripes will ask hard questions about the dollar costs and climate benefits of overhauling how this nation produces electricity. \One way or another, though, America has to diminish its reliance on coal. The quality of our future on this planet hangs in the balance."
90,"Despite the rarity of an open-seat U.S. Senate contest fanning partisan and intraparty battling, the Democratic and Republican contenders for the job agree on some of the important issues in the Feb. 2 primary -- including how to fill future vacancies in the Senate.\Democrats and Republicans alike say it should be up to the voters to fill Senate vacancies through a special election, as is done for congressional vacancies, to avoid future controversies like those that surrounded former Gov. Rod Blagojevich's appointment of Roland Burris when Sen. Barack Obama left for the White House.\And in the first of a series of responses to the Tribune on issues in the race, the major contenders also said job creation and economic development would be their priority should they win their party's Feb. 2 primary nomination and go on to win the seat in November.\All of the candidates are seeking nomination for the seat now held by Burris, D-Ill., who last month was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee for providing ""incorrect, inconsistent, misleading or incomplete information"" in how he got the job. He is not seeking election.\Following Blagojevich's corruption arrest, Democratic leaders initially called for a special election to fill the seat, but backed down amid concerns of losing a critical vote necessary for dominance in the Senate.\""Our recent appointment process unfortunately enhanced Illinois' reputation as a state too often short on ethics and long on corruption,"" said former Chicago inspector general David Hoffman, a Democrat. ""We the people of Illinois (were) deprived of our right to select our senator through a corrupt selection process conducted by a governor who now stands trial for conspiring to sell/trade this very Senate seat.""\Patrick Hughes, a conservative Republican businessman from Hinsdale, noted that a special election could be expensive, ""but it does not outweigh the importance of having honestly elected leaders who are working for the people who put them in office and not for their own personal gain or the personal gain of other elected officials.""\With the state's unemployment rate at 10.5 percent in October, candidates in both political parties also are keeping an eye on the tried-and-true focus on pocketbook issues in trying to woo voters. The candidates say they will work on restoring Illinois' economy and ways to create jobs as their top priority in Washington.\First-term state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, a Democrat, has proposed a ""payroll tax holiday"" for low- and middle-income workers and a tax credit for small businesses that create jobs.\Democrat Cheryle Jackson, a former head of the Chicago Urban League, said that if the nation would ""end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" more money could be devoted to job creation and other issues.\Chicago attorney Jacob Meister, a Democrat, said he's ""both impressed and disgusted"" by the dozens of wind farms being developed in the state, representing the ""promise of green technologies"" but also the importing of the materials needed to create them.\Mark Kirk, a five-term North Shore Republican congressman, said that in addition to supporting efforts to spur job creation, he would ""oppose attempts to raise federal taxes"" on families ""or impose crippling regulations"" on small-business owners. Hughes contended efforts to reduce the size of the federal government, and concurrent federal spending, would help spur jobs, while real estate broker Robert Zadek of Rockford backs a federal flat tax to control government spending and revenues.\Republican Kathleen Thomas, a former school board member from Springfield, said she viewed opposition to the effort to regulate carbon emissions through a system of cap-and-trade credits as her top state priority, contending it ""would give us the single-largest tax increase"" in history without protecting the environment.\There was a wide divergence of opinion on the issue of congressional earmarks -- funding or tax credits given to specific projects that are sought by lawmakers or awarded by leadership to rank-and-file members.\Most Democrats called for stricter oversight of the process to ensure the worthiness of a project. But Aurora businessman Corey Dabney said he would actively seek them to ""fight for resources for the people of Illinois"" and Robert Marshall, a Burr Ridge physician and frequent candidate, said he did not ""consider earmarks as a negative or bad problem.""\Republican responses ranged from more regulation of earmarks to seeking an outright ban on them in favor of increased federal funds to be used at the discretion of the states.\Kirk said he was the only member of the House Appropriations Committee ""to reject Washington's corrupt system of earmarking"" and has proposed a ban on political donations made by lobbyists, employees or political action committees involved in the earmark process.\Two Republicans, retired downstate circuit judge Don Lowery of Golconda and frequent candidate Andy Martin of Chicago each likened the use of special interest earmarks as ""bribes"" used by congressional leaders and voiced opposition to them.\A dozen of the 14 Senate contenders currently listed for the primary responded to the Tribune.

91," Nearly a year after he rejected an international treaty on global warming, President Bush on Thursday will unveil a substitute plan that places a premium on protecting U.S. businesses while encouraging a reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 10 years.\ Bush's plan would tie environmental protection to economic activity so limits on emissions would be measured against the size of America's gross domestic product. Such an approach would tighten pollution controls as the economy grows but would decrease them when the economy stumbles.\ To be outlined in a speech at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the president's plan also would use a ""cap-and-trade"" approach that sets limits on the amount of pollution each business is allowed to emit. The plan would allow heavy polluters to buy pollution credits from companies with lower emissions.\ Bush is releasing his plan two days before he is to travel to Japan, where officials have been waiting since March to hear how the president plans to address greenhouse emissions after rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international environmental treaty drafted in 1997 and signed by 178 other nations.\ The Bush plan, which came under fire from environmental groups on Wednesday, will propose a Clean Skies Act that would require power plants to cut their emissions of three of the worst pollutants-- nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides and mercury. Bush, however, is breaking his campaign promise to regulate a fourth greenhouse gas emitted by power plants, carbon dioxide.\ Bush's budget proposal for 2003 includes $4.5 billion for activities related to reducing global warming, including tax credits for renewable energy resources.\ The administration argues that Bush's market-based approach will encourage businesses to invest in clean-air technologies but save those companies about $1 billion a year in costs associated with requirements in the Kyoto Protocol, a charge that probably would have been passed on to consumers.\ Bush will describe his plan as ""a new environmental path for America, which will benefit the entire world,"" according to an advanced text of his speech.\ It is a plan that is ""based on the common-sense idea that sustainable economic growth is the key to environmental progress because it is growth that provides the resources for investment in clean technologies,"" according to the text.\ The administration claims in documents related to Bush's environmental plan that the Kyoto treaty would require ""making drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that would put millions of Americans out of work and undermine our ability to make long-term investments in clean energy.""\ White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Wednesday that the Kyoto treaty would have punished American businesses while placing far less stringent restrictions on developing nations, including China and India.\ ""The president is very concerned about the effect Kyoto would have on America's workers, on American jobs and on the American economy,"" Fleischer said. ""If that were to go into effect, it would have a screeching-halt effect on the economy, and people would lose their jobs as a result.""\ Environmental groups said Bush's plan and his reliance on voluntary actions by American business would not reduce greenhouse emissions as much as the Kyoto Protocol. That treaty would require the United States, which emits more global warming gases than any other nation, to reduce those emissions by 5.2 percent over the next two years--a compromise from the 15 percent European nations wanted to impose on the U.S.\ On Wednesday, environmental groups already were preparing to go to war against Bush's plan, some details of which were highlighted last week in a report from Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.\ Dan Becker, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, said the plan to tie reductions in greenhouse gases to economic activity would be ""nibbling around the edges"" of the issue.\ ""This is a series of voluntary steps that are linked to the health of the economy in a way that makes America a fair-weather friend of the global climate,"" Becker said. ""When the economy is booming, we'll do something modest. When it isn't, we'll dump global warming over the side.""\ Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust said Bush's plan would actually roll back environmental protections in the U.S., allowing businesses to emit more greenhouse gases than current environmental laws would have allowed over the next 10 years.\ ""In other words, however the Bush administration spins it, its plan would mean more pollution than under the current Clean Air Act,"" O'Donnell said. ""It will also mean more burning of coal than under current law, an aspect of the plan that almost guarantees more heat- trapping greenhouse gas emissions than if current law were vigorously enforced.""\ Reached after months of intense debate among Cabinet officers and other senior advisers, the White House plan will seek to improve the environment ""without putting the economy at risk,"" the report said.\ The president's plan calls for the gradual decrease of U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, rather than adopting strict reductions in emissions as required by the Kyoto treaty.\ For example, if the country's gross domestic product were to increase next year by 3 percent, the goal would be to voluntarily hold the rate of growth of carbon emissions to 1 percent, according to sources familiar with the plan.\ According to the White House, that approach would cut greenhouse gas emissions from an estimated 183 metric tons per million dollars of gross domestic product in 2002, to 151 metric tons per million dollars of GDP by 2012, an 18 percent reduction in ""greenhouse gas intensity.""\ ""The uncertainty surrounding the science of climate change suggests that some modesty is in order,"" the report states. ""We need to recognize that it makes sense to discuss slowing emission growth before trying to stop and eventually reverse it."""
92,"Da ""Yoopers"" up dere in da U.P., Michigan's Upper Peninsula, have hit it big with inclusion of their nickname in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. The moniker for residents of the Lake Superior region known for a distinctive manner of speaking and its Scandinavian roots was among 150 new words announced Monday by the company. The update of the Collegiate's 11th edition has pleased Yooper Steve Parks, the prosecutor in Delta County, Michigan, who pushed for more than a decade to have the word recognized. ""People up here, we really do have our own identity and our own culture,"" hes said. ""We're a really hardy bunch. We love the land, we love the lakes, we love hunting, we love fishing. You have to be very resilient to live up here."" -- AP\But really? Is Yooper as recognizable as, say, the Yankees of New England? Peter Sokolowski, a lexicographer and editor at large for Merriam-Webster, insists it has crossed from regional to more general usage.\""Plus, it's just a really colorful word,"" he said.\Many of the other new words and terms stem from digital life and social media -- spoiler alert, hashtag, selfie and tweep -- while others are food driven, including pho and turducken, a boneless chicken stuffed into a boneless duck stuffed into a boneless turkey.\Such is the Yooper culture that it has its own band, ""Da Yoopers."" They rely on the dialect, usually for parodies that include ""Smeltin' USA."" And Jeff Daniels symbolizes the highest Yooper profile in film with his star turn in ""Escanaba in da Moonlight,"" out in 2001 and so named for the Delta County seat.\Climate change and the environment did not go unnoticed, with the addition of cap and trade, a system that limits the amount of carbon emissions companies can produce but allows them to buy extra emissions from others.\Fracking also made it into the update, which has already shipped to retailers. So did e-waste and freegan, one who scavenges for free food in store and restaurant trash bins as a way to reduce consumption of resources.\""It's a young word, from 2006,"" Sokolowski said of freegan. ""It's one of the youngest in this list. This kind of environmentalism was a Lone Ranger type of activity before but has taken off.""\Merriam-Webster relies on a network of observers who track down word usage in everything from newspapers to soup can labels. Three or four senior editors make the final cut.\While an early reference to Yooper can be traced to 1975, in an Upper Peninsula newspaper, it had a ""break-out"" moment in The New York Times four years ago, along with other mainstream media outlets, Sokolowski said.\""This word is fun to say and has a fun origin, from U.P. It's just the kind of word that many people are likely to hear and remember -- and look up in the dictionary,"" he said, noting the distinctive dialect of turning ""th"" into a ""d"" sound for da Yoopers.\As for social media, well, that term is already in the dictionary, but social networking wasn't. Adding the latter was ""just taking care of business,"" said Sokolowski, a word nerd and Twitter lover with nearly 11,000 followers.\So how does he feel about Oxford Dictionaries making selfie a star last year, when the British company named it word of the year? Did Merriam-Webster wait too long to jump on the selfie bandwagon?\""No, not at all. One of the most important things we have to watch is the trendiness of language, so we don't want to put a word in that will then have to come out,"" Sokolowski said. ""We want to make sure a word is here to stay.""\Selfie, that thing with the smartphone that Ellen DeGeneres did at the Academy Awards, has now spawned shelfies, which are photos people put up on social media to show off their books and how they have arranged them. And we now have stealthies, those sneaky little phone pictures masquerading as selfies when the taker actually snaps what's behind him or her instead.\Other new words in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate, along with the lookup database at Merriam-Webster.com:\Catfish (not the fish but the person who takes on a false online identity, a la the phantom girlfriend of football pro Manti Te'o); poutine, a French Canadian snack or side dish of french fries covered with brown gravy and cheese curds; steampunk, a literary genre with dress-up followers that mashes up 19th-century Victorian or Edwardian societies with steam-powered technology; unfriend, which joins defriend; and hot spot, a place where Wi-Fi is available.\And still more: crowdfunding, big data, baby bump, digital divide, dubstep, fangirl and gasification, the process of adding gamelike elements to something to encourage participation."
93,"Take a closer look\at these issues\There are many troubling issues, and common sense is nowhere to be found.\* Politicians want to stop relying on foreign oil. Sounds great, but they refuse to drill our own oil and currently have no available energy source as a substitute. China is buying up oil leases all over the world and will become one of those sources of foreign oil.\* Everyone wants health-care reform. Again a good idea, but why copy systems that arent working? Universal health care will strain the system and doctors will be in short supply, earning less than before.\* ""We will save or create 150,000 jobs."" That sounded good, but its muted by the fact that over 3.6 million people have lost jobs in the last 13 months and no change is in sight.\* Cap and trade is a fossil fuel tax on industries to save the environment. As with any additional business costs, these will be passed on to the consumers.\* Politicians spent trillions bailing out banks and the auto industry. Are the taxpayers going to be given dividends on shares they now own or get big discounts on a new car?\* Politicians want to tax soda because it makes our children fat. A recent study by the World Health Organization stated the cause of obesity is overeating. Are politicians really interested in your health or just the revenue the tax brings?\* Another good sounding idea, wind turbines. Didnt Ted Kennedy argue that turbines would ruin the pristine vistas off the coast of his state that he couldnt even see? Farmland must not be pristine vistas.\* Solar panels are ruining the ecosystems of some western states. That comes from the concerned greenies.\These are but a few questions that the mainstream media appears afraid to confront.\Wayne Oras Sr.\Schaumburg\Tie term limits\to performance\There has been talk of term limits applied universally in Illinois. There is another solution that will change the Illinois government for good and only affect those who are not serving the citizens of Illinois.\Each elected office has a list of responsibilities already defined for that job. This list would be used to determine if the person in that office is doing the job. For the past few years the citizens of Illinois have been held hostage during the budget approval processes. Here is how the term limits would work related to those responsibilities.\If budget is late and you are the chairman of the committee who is responsible for creating a budget, then your term limit has been reached for the chair of that committee.\If you are on the budget committee and have poor attendance at the committee meetings, then your term limit has been reached as a member of that committee.\In general, if you had a responsibility that missed the deadline, then your term limit has been reached for that position or office.\Many of these responsibilities are already documented in the current laws and can be applied to both political parties equally. The incumbents position on the ballot is secured by their job performance. In my mind the citizens of Illinois paid some of our elected officials to do a poor job and this needs to stop. It is more than the money.\Companies who do business in the state of Illinois need to have confidence that the elected officials are going to do their job accurately and on time.\Jim Ray\Arlington Heights\Choice of words shows bias in media\Anti-abortion vs. pro-choice ... which sounds more positive? Why did the Supreme Court nominee state the issue this way? Why not pro-life and pro-abortion or make them equal terms such as pro-life and pro-choice?\Most of the media does the same, Why do they slant the news toward the abortion side? Why not the adoption side? The president says he wants more adoptions. Why not support him and talk it up in the press and make it known that to these moms-to-be, adoptive parents are waiting. Illinois, the presidents home state, has 18,000 people waiting for a baby, many will take one of any race.\Ed Smetana\Arlington Heights\Where is the outrage over big bonuses?\If the government wants to restore confidence in the markets and the economy they have to start throwing more CEOs and board of directors and chief financial officers into jail. Its their fault these companies are in a mess and need government assistance, yet they continue getting bonuses instead of jail time. Remember Arthur Anderson and Enron? Something should have been done to protect the investor, employees, taxpayers and the general public a long time ago. Where is the outrage of the Republicans since they are usually the party of fiscal responsibility? Maybe its because most CEOs, board of directors, and chief financial officers are Republicans?\Glenn Taras\Rolling Meadows\Attacks on nominee wont help GOP\Karl Rove should go back into his cave. Karl Rove is on a mission to discredit Sonia Sotomayor, President Barack Obamas nominee to the United States Supreme Court. He used secondhand, anonymous comments to brand her in as a ""school marm."" He also described her as intellectually deficient, though she graduated in the top of her class at Princeton and was editor of the Yale Law Review.\Interesting, coming from a man who dropped out of college. When pressed on her accomplishments, he said that a lot of idiots graduate from Ivy League schools. (Could he have been referring to his previous boss, George W. Bush?)\Incredulous observers surmise that Republicans are playing to their base at last count less than 25 percent of voters.\With his recent comments, Karl Rove has alienated both women and Hispanics. Other Republicans chimed in on the difficulty in pronouncing her name and branding her as a ""reverse racist"" for saying that a Hispanic would bring a fresh and useful point of view to the Supreme Court.\If it takes such herculean measures to keep their ever-shrinking ""base,"" how can Republicans come even close in the next election? Are they counting on a very small voter turnout?\Karen Wagner\Rolling Meadows\Thanks Bulls, Hawks for exciting seasons\I think its time to send our appreciation to both the Bulls and the Blackhawks for outstanding seasons and all the excitement getting into the playoffs and how well they represented our city. Thats the spirit and energy we all experienced in the past at the Chicago Stadium and now across the street. Thanks players, coaches, management and support staff.

94,"In June, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a defender of the coal industry, and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a champion of the environment, decided to set aside differences and learn about how climate change affects each other's state.\Which is why one bright October morning, Manchin stood with Whitehouse on a trawler in Rhode Island Sound as fishermen and marine scientists explained how in 30 years, the fish have left where they are supposed to be, some species such as lobster have grown rarer, and the seas have turned more dangerous. \Friendly and relaxed, Manchin asked a few questions. But anyone expecting him to interpret the damage to Rhode Island as a mandate for federal action on climate change would be mistaken. He moved, instead, to defend coal. \""There is no doubt that 7 billion people have impacted our world's climate,"" Manchin said, relying on a narrative he has used in Washington as well as that day in Rhode Island. ""We have a responsibility. But no one is going to stop using fossil (fuels) for a long time."" \In today's Congress, historically unproductive and stocked with recipients of donations from fossil fuel industries, this cultural exchange between two Democrats counts as progress on climate change. It came about in part so Manchin could simply tell other senators wary of federal intervention that climate change is real. \""I didn't invite Sen. Manchin here expecting him to have an epiphany and become a greenie and go to the next climate march,"" Whitehouse said. ""He has very, very good relations with some of the most conservative members of the Senate who think climate change is a conspiracy."" \If Manchin said that the damage from climate change isn't imaginary, Whitehouse said, ""some of them might listen to him."" \While success on Capitol Hill is measured in such small doses, countries including the U.S. are pushing to forge an international emissions agreement by late 2015 to slow climate change and avert its worst effects. There are more heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere than ever in recorded history, \So far, the Obama administration has aggressively used existing authority to address climate change, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's moves to raise vehicles' gas mileage and cut power plant emissions. But many economists and climate experts contend bolder steps, such as a carbon tax, are needed to make the deepest emissions cuts, and those steps need congressional action. \""The president and his team, we're squeezing everything we can out of that authority,"" said Todd Stern, the administration's chief climate negotiator, during a speech at Yale University last week. ""But you can't go far enough unless you get new legislative action, and Congress is gridlocked on these things right now."" \Manchin gained notoriety during the 2010 midterm elections with an ad in which he shot the Democrats' cap-and-trade bill because it was ""bad for West Virginia."" Although Manchin does not deny the existence of man-made climate change, he is reluctant to curtail it, West Virginia political analysts say. \""You are talking about Kentucky, West Virginia, and people mining coal for two, three, four generations, and nothing else is there and people don't see that anything else is possible,"" said Jeremy Richardson, senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, whose family has mined coal in West Virginia for three generations. ""Coal mining is very much an identity, and successful action on climate change means we have to create new opportunities in the coal fields."" \Whitehouse's visit to West Virginia on Wednesday will focus on how miners have been affected by the shrinking demand for Appalachian coal, driven mostly by mechanization, and more recently, by cheap natural gas and environmental rules. A bipartisan bill has been introduced in the House to protect miners from the economic effects of lower coal use, and Whitehouse's staff is exploring the issue too. \Manchin made millions of dollars as a coal broker before entering politics, and his investments are now in a blind trust. But at a seaside bar that has lost much of its beachfront to erosion and rising sea levels, he said, ""I'm trying to learn so I can say I've been on the front lines"" of climate change. \Rhode Island is losing ground to the Atlantic. The senators stopped by a tide gauge in Newport that has measured sea level since 1930. The tide rose 1 inch per decade until about 25 years ago, when the rate increased about 40 percent to 1.4 inches a decade. The state has lost about 150 to 250 feet of shoreline in the last 65 years. \Communities such as the blue-collar village of Roy Carpenter's Beach have picked up their cottages and moved inland, after storms dragged roads, homes and parking lots into the sea. \""I just want them to understand how important this place is to us,"" said Christa Thoresen, as Manchin and Whitehouse toured the cottages still on the shore's edge, ""and how much we have to lose to climate change."" \For Manchin, the coal industry advocate, the highlight of the trip appeared to be BioProcess Algae. The company operates a project in Iowa that takes heat-trapping carbon dioxide from an ethanol plant and uses it to grow algae, which is then used as animal feed. Whitehouse plans to talk to the EPA about including such options in its power plant greenhouse gas rules. \By using carbon dioxide as an algae feedstock, the technology would be a way to keep coal plants alive. \An enthusiastic Manchin invited the company's leaders to West Virginia to meet with power plant operators. Bounding to his car to head to the next stop, Manchin glanced back at the BioProcess building and said with a wide smile, ""This is what it's all about."" \---------\nbanerjee@tribune.com\Credit: By Neela Banerjee, Tribune Washington Bureau"
95,"An anti-Kirk vote\My son has been in the military since 1989, and he is currently deployed to South Korea. He was at the Pentagon when it was hit.\People we have talked with who are in the military cannot believe anyone would lie about his or her military career.\In my opinion, a person who would lie about his or her military career is one you cannot trust. My vote is an anti-Kirk vote.\-- Kay McCollom, Western Springs\Kids' future\I have voted for Mark Kirk for the U.S. Senate because I am a grandfather of seven, and my grandchildren deserve a future of opportunity, not debt and big government.\-- Jon Hagstrom, Clarendon Hills\Moral bankruptcy\It is a sad commentary on the level of media bias and the moral bankruptcy of our society that the exaggeration by Mark Kirk of his otherwise stellar military career is seen by some as morally equivalent to Alexi Giannoulias' lies about his role in his family's failed bank making loans to convicted mobsters when he was a loan officer there. I can only support Kirk.\-- Stanley G. Hallaron, DeKalb\Character flaw\The campaign has been too much about Alexi Giannoulias' family's bank and Mark Kirk's misrepresented military record. The real scandal is Kirk voting for cap and trade to control greenhouse gases to prevent climate change then flip-flopping to please the flat-Earth wing of the GOP. This shows a real character flaw on a matter of great importance to the future of our children. Giannoulias will work to preserve jobs and the environment.\-- Albert Ettinger, Chicago\Inconsistent Kirk\I have watched Mark Kirk as my congressman for years. He consistently said one thing and did another. Kirk said he was a moderate and voted almost always with President George W. Bush. When he was exposed for his lies, I was relieved that the voters would finally realize what a phony he is. Let's get Kirk out of Washington.\-- Paula Castleton, Highland Park\Nation's welfare\I will vote for Alexi Giannoulias. Mark Kirk's actual record is underwhelming. More important, his party has threatened the health and welfare of the nation by opposing every initiative brought forth by the president. If Barack Obama's presidency fails, it will be the Republicans' fault. It will be, in fact, a betrayal of patriotism and a betrayal of the traditional virtues of the Republican Party. More Republicans in the Senate will mean more gridlock, more negative thinking and fewer positive solutions. Kirk is a proud member of the naysayers. Giannoulias gives every indication of being his own man, but a man who will put the nation's welfare first.\He may not be the finest candidate ever put before the voters of Illinois, but he will do the job with honor.\-- Herbert J. Hedstrom, Elgin\Sympathy for Alexi\I had actually considered voting for Mark Kirk way back when he first declared. He was a moderate with a record I could support. However, many things have changed, including his positions -- they have become far more right-wing. I am not wholeheartedly for Alexi Giannoulias, but the strident ads attacking Bright Start have made me more sympathetic: my bank (a major Chicago institution of thus-far-unimpeachable reputation) has lost a great deal of my money, too, in funds that it controlled. Many people have suffered that fate.\And why would I want to put any Republicans back in office? They got us into this mess and they have not done a single positive thing that I can think of to help get us back on track.\-- Bindy Bitterman, Chicago\Lack of honesty\As a veteran I cannot abide your endorsement for the Senate. In all honesty, how could Mark Kirk ""misremember"" getting shot at? I remember every time I got shot at. Commissioned officers, unlike politicians, are held to a much higher standard of conduct and honesty. In my opinion, he betrayed that trust.\-- James R. Creed, Chicago\Country first\I am voting to for Mark Kirk. We need someone in the U.S. Senate who understands the military and intelligence information. I may disagree with many of his positions, but I put my country first. Keeping the country safe is far more important than any other issue out there.\-- Elizabeth Clarke, Lake Forest\No new ideas\Alexi Giannoulias is the best candidate for junior senator for Illinois. He supports President Barack Obama's plan to get this country out of the ditch. Eight years of poor leadership by the Republicans have put the county into a deep hole. We need to give Obama our support so that he can get the country on the right track. The Republican Party has no new ideas.\-- John Copeland, Chicago\Support our troops\As Americans, we continue to ask our brave young men and women, who serve in our military, to defend our freedom.\I feel that it is our duty to give them our support in every way possible. As the father of a daughter serving in the U.S. Air Force, I want our fighting forces to have at their disposal the best of what the United States has to offer in terms of supplies, equipment and maintenance.\I also feel that they should have the backing and respect of our leaders in Washington.\We as voters in Illinois have the opportunity to elect Mark Kirk, a Naval Reserve intelligence officer who has shown his support for our troops and will make sure that they are prepared and supplied to carry out their mission.\-- William Wykes, Yorkville\Better resume\If credentials, experience and qualifications matter when applying for a job, Mark Kirk's resume trumps that of Alexi Giannoulias by a mile.\Forget the negative campaigning on both sides.\Forget that each candidate has made a faux pas or two.\Strictly on competency and non-ideological grounds, Kirk gets the job.\-- Jeff Warner, Lake Forest\Lack of qualification\The sad reality of the contest for the Illinois Senate seat is lack of qualification any of the candidates for that office, which, perhaps, explains why they would rather slam each other than offer proposals to remedy the ills of the country.\So on Election Day, I will hold my nose and vote for Alexi Giannoulias if only to prevent the reactionaries now dominating the GOP from gaining yet another potential obstructionist vote.\-- J.

96,"Who among us hasn't spent date night fighting over the merits of a renewed cap-and-trade act?\You haven't? Yeah, neither have we. But that doesn't mean politics haven't been seeping into our relationships in ways big and small, especially in an election year as divisive and colorful as this one. \A ""Single in America"" study of more than 5,000 U.S. singles age 21 to 65 looked at, among other things, the role of political leanings in dating and found that voting habits are frequently reflected in our love lives -- in the type of partners we seek out and how we conduct ourselves within those partnerships. \While only 17 percent of men and 20 percent of women said a partner with the same party affiliations is a ""must-have,"" the findings suggest singles may do some self-selecting that falls along party lines, even if unintentionally. \Self-described liberal Democrats, for example, place the highest priority on finding a partner who ""treats them with respect,"" ""has a sense of humor"" and ""is comfortable with sexuality,"" according to the study, which was sponsored by Match.com and conducted by biological anthropologist Helen Fisher and relationship therapist Laura Berman. Republicans' top priorities are ""shares the same values,"" ""has the same view on money"" and ""is the same religion."" \Democratic men consider it a turn-on ""if a date is opinionated."" Self-described conservative Republican men consider it a turn-on ""if a date dresses conservatively"" and a turnoff ""if a date has many guy friends,"" while moderate Republican men consider it a turn-on ""if a date is career-driven."" \Deep-seated beliefs \""If you look at brain chemistry research, there are a lot of both nature and nurture underpinnings to one's political viewpoints,"" Berman says. ""If you're raised in a certain environment, taught certain things, lived in a certain community, maybe you tend to be more of a rebel or risk taker, maybe you tend to be more conservative."" \In other words, our political views, at some point, blend together to become our world views. \Which is partly why, say relationship experts, it's next to impossible to keep politics out of the picture -- ""even if you're not sitting down and saying, 'What are your views on abortion, contraception and gun rights?' "" says Judith Kuriansky, a psychologist on the faculty of Columbia University Teachers College and author of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Dating"" (Alpha). ""Political discussions have bled into people's dating lives in such a big way -- where they stand on the economy, taxes, Social Security, social services."" \Kuriansky attributes the seepage to a dating population that's older and more politically aware than ever, but also to the general economic malaise gripping much of the nation. \""Across all ages and relationships, more people than ever are sitting in counseling discussing what's happening in the world and where the world is going,"" she says. ""The life stresses have created a real psychological depression about the economy, about the future and about the present."" \It's the economy, sweetheart \Indeed, singles in the study listed the economy as the No. 1 source of stress in their lives. (Though 60 percent said it hasn't changed their dating habits and 40 percent said they would date someone who was unemployed.) \""People are so aware of how much money they have now, how much they're going to have later and what kind of life they are able to have,"" Kuriansky says. ""Money is so much in the forefront of people's minds. \""You can barely find a kid from the middle class who's not worried about having enough money to date and marry and still pay off his college debt."" \Perhaps a single president could provide a welcome distraction from the economic malaise: Eighty-seven to 94 percent of all political groups are ""open to having a single president,"" while 79 percent of conservative Republicans and 91 percent of liberal Democrats are open to him or her dating while in office. \How about a president who's dating while married in office? \Not so fast. Eighty-seven percent of men and 91 percent of women said there are ""no acceptable excuses"" for infidelity in a political candidate. In their own lives, 62 percent of men and 80 percent of women say sexual fidelity in a relationship is a must-have. \""It's much easier to hold others to ideals that we don't hold ourselves to,"" Berman says. ""And with politicians, it's not so much that he cheated per se, as much as that he's capable of cheating and lying and dishonesty and deceptions. And we don't want to think that about our country's leaders."" \The takeaway from all of this? \""The way you affiliate yourself does lead to a lot more than how you vote,"" Kuriansky says. ""It affects your social views and ideas on more than just the hot-button issues that create problems for people."" \Ultimately, though, she'd like to see couples use politicians as a bad example of how to conduct relationships. \""We see what's happening in Congress, where the members can't even cross the aisle,"" she says. ""And our divisions are getting worse than ever."" \Better for all parties -- political and otherwise -- to seek some middle ground. \""You'll have a harder time walking down the aisle,"" she laughs, ""if you never learn to cross the aisle."" \- - - \More from the singles study \Roughly 43 percent of Americans older than 18 are single, according to the Census Bureau. The second ""Single in America"" study asked 5,000 of them, ages 21 to 65, about a wide range of topics. The study was commissioned in conjunction with sex and relationship expert Laura Berman and biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, chief scientific adviser for Match.com. Some highlights: \* A majority of singles admitted to having a one-night stand, with 66 percent of libertarians, 65 percent of liberal Democrats and 49 percent of conservative Republicans owning up to the experience. \* Forty-six percent of singles say their political views have not changed in the last 10 years. \* Gays and lesbians are about equally likely as heterosexual singles to seek a partner who has a similar level of education (29 percent of heterosexuals, 23 percent of gay men and 31 percent of lesbians); has a successful career (33 percent of heterosexuals, 30 percent of gays, 28 percent of lesbians); is physically attractive (73 percent of heterosexuals, 75 percent of gays, 70 percent of lesbians); has a sense of humor (83 percent of heterosexuals, 82 percent of gays, 89 percent of lesbians); and who is confident and self-assured (74 percent of heterosexuals, 73 percent of gays, and 73 percent of lesbians). \* Thirty-three percent of men and 43 percent of women have fallen in love with someone they didn't initially find attractive. \-- H.S.\Credit: By Heidi Stevens, Tribune Newspapers"

Quinn that demanding no fare increases if seniors making above poverty level lose their free ride is just plain stupid.\If public transportation is to be held accountable for holding the line on revenue while facing increased expenses, why isnt the larger body, the state government, held to the same level of accountability?\The free rides were a political ploy of Rod Blagojevich, and he is gone.\I am beginning to believe that maybe sending every one of you to the unemployment line the next time you are up for election is the only way to get any common sense and backbone in Springfield.\David Krein\Schaumburg\Were sick of excuses on property taxes\I just got my homeowners tax bill today and just about hit the ceiling. It went up $944. If the politicians dont think Im angry they better think again. They have an excuse for when the taxes go up when the values of the homes are up, and now they have excuses when the home values are way down from the recession.\This goes beyond a slap in the face. The people in the Chicago area better start waking up and start throwing out all the politicians that are in office now to show them their appreciation for the biggest tax increase ever. Yes, thats what I plan on doing, I intend on voting all you thieves out of office. First its Stroger that shafts us and now the rest of the politicians shaft us. For Halloween we got the trick.\Larry Maurer\Mount Prospect\Fox News isnt really\giving you the news\Newscasters and print journalists by definition gather and report the news. Analysts are supposed to offer their informed opinion on a given subject. Commentators and editors propound a given theory, or augment news or topics of interest with their views on the subject.\Talk radio and televised talking heads spouting personal opinions and/or unfounded hearsay should be considered entertainment in the same vein as The National Enquirer.\A true news organization informs the reader/listener with facts. It asks revealing questions. It doesnt make news, nor make up news stories by innuendo, implication, exclusion or actual altering and rewriting of quotes via subtraction or addition. Nor does a true news organization fund, promote or advertise any factions activities in the name of making news.\True news organizations use editorials or commentators stating the viewpoint of the management of a given outlet; these comments are identified as op-eds or commentaries, dont masquerade as news and show a slanted view only if they identify themselves as adherents upfront.\They are not considered journalists or reporters if all they do is issue opinions of their funders or backers as verified facts without research, evidence nor actual sources to cite their reported ""news.""\Fox News broadcasts virtually no news, just commentary and innuendo; it is neither fair nor balanced in its reporting of anything to do with the president nor his adherents. It has sponsored both on air, and financially, activities such as tea parties, death squad protests and carrying arms to political event.\Admittedly there are muckrakers on all sides of the political divide, but when MSNBC cites facts, they have researchers and professional analysts to back them up; theyre equal-opportunity whistle-blowers. Knowledge is supposed to be power, but being told what to think by Fox news and their ilk frequently proves that many Americans are unencumbered by the thought process.\Ronda Scott-Marak\Wheeling\Whose interests are banks representing?\Lets see if we can make some sense out of the present big banking mess. The biggest banks that public money has saved from financial ruin and, therefore, according to the powers that be, prevented a meltdown of our capital markets and those around the globe, are still engaging in shady risk behavior with billions if not trillions of taxpayer bailout dollars.\These banks are still operating in so-called ""dark pools"" (legal but nontransparent, secretive markets for the privileged class), or investing public money in what their risk management teams believe to be values abroad.\So, they get money from the Federal Reserve at zero percent interest and lend it out to companies overseas at much higher rates to help those companies sustain and create jobs.\Obviously, this is exactly what the current administration wants these banks to do for our country, but they choose not to, arguing their need for higher capital requirements. Then, after paying back TARP money, these big bankers reward traders and themselves with billions in bonus money.\What a great way of doing business. Privatize profits, socialize losses.\And then, as a nice topper to this private wealth created with public money, they use millions to ""lobby"" Congress to influence any financial reform. They lobbied to get rid of financial regulations, such as the Glass-Steagall Act, a move which helped create big banks, and they will lobby with your money to keep their dream machine going.\No wonder a lot of folks question the patriotism of a big banker these days. They are engaging in legalized larceny.\The question now is whether those in this administration and those in Congress represent the interests of the big bank cartel or the public, who are reaching for their pitchforks.\Thomas McGrath\Arlington Heights\Jobs will grow when liberals are booted\So we hear the news that the jobless rate in this country has now passed 10 percent.\Under this administration and their extremely liberal policies, there will be no end to job losses. It is not the role of government to make jobs. It is the role of government to institute policies and create an environment for businesses to prosper and create wealth.\As that process begins, companies will grow and expand their businesses and create the jobs we need. Under this administration, the job-creating machine has been essentially turned off, perhaps as a deliberate strike against capitalism itself.\Weve seen a portion of the $787 billion stimulus create a few jobs at an average cost of $242,000 per job. So now were talking about another stimulus plan? A cap and trade bill? A health care plan that will now cost north of $1.2 trillion?\Seriously, who comes up with these ideas?\Why does this administration want to keep kicking the American people while were down? How will we ever pay for all these ideas? Tax cuts work, thats been proven over and over again, but since thats a conservative virtue, well, that idea is certainly off the table.\I think the jobless rate will finally begin to correct itself when most of the self-righteous liberal incumbents lose their jobs next fall.\Dan OMalley\Bartlett\Reaction is testament to quality parenting\I just want comment on the grace and class of Garrard McClendon and his family in response to the murder of their parents. Within days of the murder and without the suspects having yet been apprehended, Garrards composed expression of forgiveness to the murder suspects was a remarkable gesture.\His brother, explaining that he was not yet ready to express forgiveness, resonated with the same class as Garrard. Not a hint of the rage that they both must surely have felt.\I cant imagine a finer testament to the character and loving parentage of their mother and father than these men embody. I know through them that their parents were truly great people.\Tom Roberts Jr.\Elk Grove Village"

We are teetering on the precipice of a national economic disaster. I want to help move this great nation away from that edge and protect our children from a lifetime of financial burden.\2. Economic growth and job creation.\3. Health care. Real health care reform that will expand access and increase affordability without creating a new trillion dollar federal bureaucracy.\Dawson: 1. Economy. The increasing debt created by growing deficits is putting our country in an unsustainable financial position that will bankrupt our country.\2. Job creation. I support policies and legislation that provide an environment for economic growth, provide incentive for investment and increases the number of jobs in Illinois and the USA.\3. Smaller government. Shrink the government. The federal government is responsible for our countrys rule of law, military defense, infrastructure, monetary system, social security and Medicare/Medicaid. All other functions should be managed by the private sector or managed by the states.\Geissler: 1. The federal government needs to focus on what it can do to put Americans back to work. Fifteen million people are unemployed right now, and the federal government has done nothing to make sure they have more opportunity. The federal stimulus package awarded pork barrel projects, an unproductive cap-and-trade bill, and unwarranted intrusion into health care. These are all paid for by higher taxes and less\opportunity.\We need less taxes, which I propose can be done by a 20 percent reduction of the corporate income tax and $2,500 tax credit for any job created. These policies encourage private expansion, which is what our economy needs. Right now, government expansion is crowding out the opportunity for people to find work.\2. Among the thousands of pages of bills in the current Do Everything Congress, we have yet to see something that even resembles a government that believes in transparency or accountability.\House Speaker Nancy Pelosi constantly decries the greed of corporate America, but then spends thousands of dollars on flowers for her office. Melissa Bean attempts to be a congresswoman for the people of the 8th District, but she cant bring back the health care bill to those same people and doesnt even live in the 8th Congressional. Transparency begins with the federal government stepping up, which is why I believe we need an audit of all federal programs. If it doesnt generate the impact its intended, Congress should immediately cut the program.\3. Melissa Bean recently voted for a bill that would allow the federal government to break up successful companies if theyre deemed a threat to the American economy. I say we begin with breaking up the federal government for doing that exact thing.\Our federal debt is trillions, dangerously high if we expect our country to continue on for generations past our own. Worse, we have a government that believes more in its own choice for our lives than what we may choose ourselves. Government is too big, and its now gotten so big its starting to fail. The stimulus package failed to deliver. Health care promises to become more costly than promised and will tax businesses that create American jobs.\Jacobs: 1. A proper health care system. There has to be a better solution to providing health care for all Americans without continuing to line the pockets of our ""not for profit"" health care providers.\2. Fixing Social Security. I would present a bill returning Social Security to the Independent Trust Fund as it was before being moved to the General Fund. I would also make it possible for those who contributed to the fund and later on retired from ""government"" jobs to get their full benefits, not the current 50 percent. Also, no person who did not contribute to the fund can draw from it.\3. With our high unemployment figures, the current administration, Congress and labor organizations should work together aggressively to keep more manufacturing jobs here in the United States instead of letting our companies ""outsource"" to foreign nations. Lets return the MADE IN THE U.S.A. logo to its rightful place of prominence in manufacturing.\Rodriguez: 1. Economy. Job creation.\2. Government spending, reducing the debt and deficit.\3. Health care reform.\Walsh: 1. The most urgent priority for our nation today is halting and reversing the unprecedented explosion in government spending. I will fight to cut spending, reduce taxes and return to a balanced budget. Residents of the 8th Congressional District will benefit most from my efforts to lower taxes and eliminate the crushing debt that is being passed onto our kids and grandkids.\2. Entitlement reform. Medicare and Social Security are both well-loved but ill-conceived programs. As our population ages and retirees live longer, beneficiaries are putting increased strains on those paying into the system far beyond anything that was originally anticipated.\The unfunded liabilities of both programs dwarf the official national debt, and unless some changes are made, these programs will soon gobble up our countrys capacity to spend on anything else.\The problem, of course, is that special interest groups have prevented any meaningful reform of either of these programs and both parties pillory political opponents who even propose any changes. Ill try to avoid that trap here.\These issues can only be solved when members of both parties recognize the magnitude of the problem and agree to work in a bipartisan way to address them. I think that time is near, but events playing out in Congress demonstrate that we are not there yet. The Presidents health care proposals effectively perpetuate the Ponzi scheme-like character that epitomizes both Social Security and Medicare.\Ultimately, the answer will require some mechanism for individuals to set aside a portion of their own income for their own retirement and health care. Only when individuals have some responsibility for their own well-being will we be able to get a handle on skyrocketing costs.\In the meantime, we must guarantee benefits to those already in these programs or nearing retirement. Eventually, younger workers will need a new program to replace these existing entitlements.\3. Additionally, I will provide federal leadership to extend Route 53 into Lake County. This project has been on the drawing board for over 40 years and government inaction has saddled residents of Lake and McHenry counties with some of the longest commute times in the nation. We need some Congressional leadership to move this public need forward."
99,"
Two years ago just about this time, the U.S. economy was on the verge of collapse.
\
When the housing bubble burst, the contagion spread. Soon, the banking industry was in a shambles, prompting Congress to craft a financial bailout package. The economy went into a deep recession, unemployment went up and two U.S. auto companies filed for bankruptcy.
\
That was then. Where are we now? To get a handle on our financial picture, The News-Gazette has periodically interviewed four local economic sages - academics J. Fred Giertz, Jim Heins and David Ikenberry along with local real estate investor Dan Hamelberg - to get their insight into how things are going.
\
Last time he was interviewed, J. Fred Giertz was lauding the restoration of stability to the banking system but expressing concerns that President Obama's ambitious legislative agenda - national health care, cap and trade - would retard an economic recovery.
\
Giertz, an economics professor, predicted that the recession would end but that recovery would be slow and painful. Today, he said that he's optimistic ""in the long term"" but that short-term improvements in the economy will come ""painfully slow.""
\
""We're going up instead of down,"" Giertz said, citing a decline in the unemployment rate from double-digit levels to under 10 percent. Just as the economy is better now than it was two years ago, he said, it will continue to improve. He predicted it ""will be years before"" the economy booms.
\
Giertz said his biggest concern is that the country's long-term national debt has increased at an unsustainable rate. Citing the financial woes of Social Security and Medicare plus the huge expense of Obama's new national health care plan, he said ""we got substantial work ahead of us"" to get those problems under control.
\
Some have predicted the economy will fall back into recession, and Giertz noted that the national mood seems to shift quickly from optimism to pessimism and back again. But he foresees continued improvement while reminding that the economy was so low it has much ground to recover.
\
A year ago, Jim Heins, a professor emeritus of economics, forecast a slow recovery but expressed concerns that an explosion of government spending and a dramatic increase in the money supply was laying the groundwork for the return of inflation.
\
But after taking a look at reports from the Federal Reserve System, Heins said he's changed his mind.
\
""Not only is there not going to be inflation (an increase in prices), there may well be deflation (a decrease in prices),"" he said.
\
That, he said, will put a stop to any continued recovery in the economy.
\
""I'm negative,"" Heins said. ""I don't see much improvement in the economy in the months or the year ahead.""
\
Heins' prediction may seem counter-intuitive to those who see the federal government engaged in massive stimulus spending that has resulted in trillion-dollar-plus deficits. But he said his opinion is ""based on my observation that the money supply is growing at an abnormally slow rate, and it has been for the past 18 months.""
\
Heins said it's been his and others' opinion for many years that an annual 5 percent increase in the money supply by the Federal Reserve keeps the economy growing without inflation. So he was surprised to see that the Fed has tightened the reins.
\
""It does not need to be that way,"" he said.
\
Heins' other concern is the massive national debt that is being piled up. As a general principle, Heins said, he does not object to deficit spending but that spending deficits by the Obama administration have become so mammoth ""it's just something that cannot go on forever.""
\
Given those problems, Heins said ""there's going to be a period of slow growth and even slower investment.""
\
No highfalutin academic theories for Dan Hamelberg. The Champaign real estate investor makes his judgments about economic conditions based on how they affect his business, and he's pleased with what he sees.
\
""Our business is fine,"" Hamelberg said.
\
He said that his local rental housing properties are filled and that his commercial real estate at the Old Farm shopping center in Champaign is full but that sales are a little slow at his latest real estate development, Liberty on the Lake in southwest Champaign.
\
""We expected that,"" Hamelberg said of the residential development.
\
The first 200-lot phase of the development has sold nearly half its lots over the past four years. Ultimately, Hamelberg expects the fully developed 500-lot project to sell out.
\
""It's going to be nice when it grows up,"" he said.
\
Hamelberg is cheered by the low interest rates, urging those who can to refinance their home mortgages. But he noted that not everyone can refinance because declines in housing values have left some people with ""loans higher than the value"" of their house.
\
He's also planning for the future, laying the groundwork for commercial and residential development on the First Street corridor in Champaign near Stoughton Street. He estimated that is two years away.
\
Nationally, Hamelberg that said he's concerned government spending deficits could lead to inflation but that he feels good about the Champaign-Urbana economy even in spite of state financial woes that have left the University of Illinois short of funding.
\
""Champaign-Urbana does better than other communities,"" he said.
\
If you want to know where you are, David Ikenberry, an associate dean in the University of Illinois College of Business, said, you have to understand where you have been.
\
Two years ago, he said, the U.S was in a ""calamitous economic environment that was nothing we had ever seen before."" Considered in that context, Ikenberry said, he feels pretty good about the current state of the economy.
\
He said the banking system has stabilized, consumers are paying off their debts, corporations are increasing their profits.
\
""For me, that is a positive. We are recovering. We are just not recovering at a very fast pace,"" he said.
\
Ikenberry said that the business sector still remains so traumatized from the near-collapse of the banking system and the overall economy that it's reluctant to commit itself to increased investment and hiring.
\
Ikenberry noted the tremendous spending that the federal government injected into the economy, first the money spent to rescue the banks, then the bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler and, finally, the $700 billion-plus stimulus program. He said that the banks are racing to repay the government debt and that the auto companies also have repaid a portion of the loans.
\
But he said government spending remains an economic problem that is turning into a political issue.
\
""I think our political leaders are beginning to understand that,"" Ikenberry said.
\
A year ago, Ikenberry said, he was concerned that massive deficit spending by the federal government would spark inflation but that has not happened.
\
""We don't see any sign of that,"" he said. ""That's consistent with the slow gradual jobs recovery.""

100,"Mayor Richard M. Daley's greening of Chicago has been good for the city's image and good for Daley politically. When the city looks good, so does the mayor.\But look beyond the tourist-friendly facade of median planters on Michigan Avenue and the much-publicized green roof atop City Hall and you run into some troubling numbers: Chicago has just 29 buildings and projects that bear the equivalent of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval from the U.S. Green Building Council, the Washington-based non-profit that sets the standards for what is officially considered green.\While that is more than any other American city except Seattle and Portland, Ore., it nonetheless represents a tiny fraction of Chicago's total of more than 500,000 buildings. More broadly, it is a sign that the fledging green movement has mountains to climb before it achieves broad acceptance, notwithstanding such triumphs as the awarding of this year's Nobel Peace Prize to former Vice President Al Gore for his role in drawing the world's attention to global warming.\""The awareness is huge, but we haven't become mainstream yet by any means,"" Chicago-based architect and green design consultant Helen Kessler said by cell phone last week, a plight she personified as she drove her hybrid Toyota Prius to a meeting amid DuPage County's auto-dependent sprawl.\Indeed, some thinkers argue the emphasis on what they call the ""widgets"" of the green movement -- green buildings, green cars and green lightbulbs -- masks deeper issues that ultimately go back to the hotly debated, much-larger phenomenon of sprawl.\""As sustainability grows up and we begin to define what we mean by it, this whole idea that you can have a green building with a whopping large parking lot that everybody drives to is not sustainable,"" said Chicago architect Doug Farr, author of the soon-to-be-published book, ""Sustainable Urbanism: Urban Design with Nature.""\To be sure, some respected academics such as University of Illinois at Chicago architectural historian Robert Bruegmann argue low-density development is a singular achievement because it provides millions of people with the mobility, privacy and choice only the rich could once afford.\To which Farr replies: ""You can couch it in terms of choice -- like people choose to smoke.""\Such arguments are sure to be heard in the coming weeks as Chicago becomes a center of the global conversation about global warming. Starting Saturday, the 16-day Chicago Humanities Festival will devote itself to ""global environmental and ecological disruption."" Then, from Nov. 7-9, more than 20,000 people from around the world are expected to attend a convention and trade show called GreenBuild at the new McCormick Place West Building, which conveniently happens to be one of Chicago's 29 certified green buildings.\While television typically presents images of factories spewing clouds of pollution into the air or cars belching fumes from their tail pipes, those are hardly the only culprits responsible for melting polar ice and other symptoms of global warming. According to the Clinton Climate Initiative, an effort to reduce global warming led by former President Bill Clinton, cities pour about three-quarters of all greenhouse gases into the world's atmosphere even though they occupy only 2 percent of its land mass.\With Daley's leadership -- the mayor has famously declared that he wants to make Chicago ""the greenest city in America"" -- Chicago is among the cities on the front lines of this battle.\During his 18-year tenure, the city has planted half a million trees, built more than 80 miles of landscaped medians, and built or negotiated 2 million square feet of green roofs -- more than all other American cities combined. It has a thriving, walkable downtown and a broad range of green public buildings, from schools to police stations to homeless shelters. Even if it is too early to conclude whether such measures have done anything to reduce global warming, they clearly have uplifted the public realm and the spirit of some of the city's most disadvantaged people.\Consider the tale of Ernest Gladney, 49, who once shared a room with two other men in a West Side homeless shelter. Now he has a place of his own -- a modest apartment in the Helmut Jahn-designed single-room occupancy building near Cabrini-Green. The shiny, bread loaf-shaped structure is a green building, with twirling wind turbines on its roof.\""I'm starting to live,"" Gladney said recently. ""I'm starting to know what the grass smells like, what the air smells like. You can breathe."" In his old neighborhood, he said, the air smelled of burnt alcohol and lighter fluids -- the scent of people doing drugs. Now his apartment is filled with plants. ""I like to walk past and look at the outside and say, 'That's my house,'"" Gladney said.\Despite such heartwarming stories, Daley's environmental record is hardly spotless.\The decline of the Chicago Transit Authority on the mayor's watch and the prospect of ""doomsday"" transit cuts threatens to put thousands of riders back in their cars, where they would clog highways and pollute the air. And the Tribune reported in July that the city's emissions of pollution have soared since 2001. However, officials of the Chicago Climate Exchange, the financial exchange that aims to reduce greenhouse gases through a complex system known as ""cap and trade,"" maintain that the city is meeting its emission reduction requirements.\Still, even Sadu Johnston, Daley's deputy chief of staff and former commissioner of the Department of the Environment, acknowledges that the city's share of buildings winning LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification from the U.S. Green Building Council remains relatively small and that the city must broaden its efforts, in part by focusing on the greening of existing buildings.\A good example is Exelon Corp.'s revamp of 10 floors in the clothespin-shaped Chase Tower at 10 S. Dearborn St. The crisp, clean-lined project, shaped by ISI interior designers, places office cubicles, not private offices, along windows, where there are drop-dead views of Lake Michigan and the downtown skyline. The cubicles have glass partitions that let natural light shine through without blocking views. An advanced air-filtering system and the use of low-emitting materials, such as corn polymer carpet, improve air-quality. Employees say they have fewer colds and allergies, according to a company spokeswoman. The project received a platinum rating, the highest LEED standard.\The premium for the green measures was 5 percent, but the project has already reduced electricity consumption by half compared with the previous offices occupied by Exelon and is expected to pay for itself in five years based on energy savings alone, according to Exelon senior vice president Ruth Ann Gillis.\Asked if managers minded losing their offices along the windows, Gillis replied: ""I still have a killer view. We have redefined what a perk is.""\Redefining the habits that have led to global warming may not come so easily, though Kessler, the sustainable building consultant, said her business has doubled in the last year, a trend she credits in part to Gore's Academy Award-winning movie ""An Inconvenient Truth."" Among her clients: the Jewish Reconstructionist Congregation of Evanston, which, she said, wants to become the first synagogue in the world to achieve a LEED platinum rating.\""They view it partly as what it says in the Torah,"" she said.\""You mean,"" I asked, ""the 11th Commandment -- Thou Shalt Be Green""?\No, she said, ""Thou Shalt Take Care of the Earth.""\----------\bkamin@tribune.com\This story is an adapted version of an article by Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin, ""Chicago, My Kind of Green,"" that appears in the October issue of GreenSource magazine, a McGraw-Hill publication devoted to sustainable design.\Credit: By Blair Kamin, Tribune architecture critic"
101,"WASHINGTON Standing before the nation on a ""day of reckoning,"" President Barack Obama summoned politicians and public alike Tuesday night to forge a path out of the worst economic disaster in a quarter-century by embracing shared sacrifice and costly new endeavors to improve health care, schools and the environment.\""The time to take charge of our future is here,"" Obama declared in his first address to a joint session of Congress, watched by millions of worried Americans on television and the Internet.\Adding words of reassurance, he said, ""Tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.""\Obama had to wade his way into a chamber packed with lawmakers eager to welcome the nations first black president into a Capitol built by slaves. His 52-minute speech was interrupted 61 times by applause.\To deal with the current economic crisis, deepening each day, the president said more money would be needed to rescue troubled banks beyond the $700 billion already committed last year. He said he knows that bailout billions for banks are unpopular ""I promise you, I get it,"" he said but he also insisted\it was the only way to get credit moving again to households and businesses, the lifeblood of the American economy.\Along with aid for banks, he also called on Congress to move quickly on legislation to overhaul regulations on the nations financial markets.\""I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary,"" Obama said. ""Because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession.""\With U.S. automakers struggling for survival, Obama also said he would allow neither their demise nor ""their own bad practices"" to be rewarded. ""I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it,"" he said.\Thinking longer-term, Obama said in a speech lacking many specifics that both political parties must give up favored programs while uniting behind his campaign promises to help the millions without health insurance, build better schools and move the nation to more efficient fuel use. He skipped the traditional litany of new programs common in such speeches but spoke on broad generalities about goals and themes that formed the backbone of his presidential campaign.\Just five weeks after his inauguration, Obama addressed an ebullient Democratic congressional majority and an embattled but reinvigorated GOP minority as well as anxious viewers at home. Despite the nations economic worries and the failure so far of his effort to draw support for his plans from more than a handful of Republican lawmakers, Obama enjoys strong approval ratings across the nation.\Bobby Jindal, Louisianas young, charismatic governor who is considered a potential 2012 presidential candidate, was chosen to deliver the televised GOP response. He exhorted fellow Republicans to be Obamas ""strongest partners"" when they agree with him. But he signaled that wont happen much, calling the $787 billion stimulus package ""irresponsible.""\""The way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of Washington politicians,"" Jindal said. ""Who among us would ask our children for a loan, so we could spend money we do not have, on things we do not need?""\Still, mindful of the publics optimism about Obamas leadership, Jindal, as well as other Republicans, took care to focus criticism primarily on Congress Democratic leaders, not on the president.\Before the speech, Wall Street was in a better mood than it had been in for days: Stocks were up after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the recession might end this year.\But Obama spoke as bad economic news continued to pile up, felt all too keenly in U.S. homes and businesses. Some 3.6 million jobs have disappeared in the recession that ranks as the biggest job destroyer in the post-World War II period. Americans have lost trillions of dollars in retirement, college and savings accounts, with the stock market falling nearly half from its peak of 16 months ago.\New polls some with Obamas public support rising and others with it dropping show that the political climate can be as precarious as the economic one. So Obama reached for both candor and can-do, blending the kind of grim honesty that has become his trademark since taking office with a greater emphasis on optimism.\""The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation,"" he said.\The central argument of his speech was that his still-unfolding economic revival plan has room for even demands a broader agenda. This is the big chore of his young presidency, and Obamas hope was that he can begin to persuade the country the longer-term items on his presidential agenda are as important to the nations economic well-being as unchoking credit and turning around unemployment numbers. ""The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care, the schools that arent preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit,"" Obama said.\He urged lawmakers to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change by creating a cap-and-trade system of limits and pollution allowances. And he said the budget he is sending to Congress on Thursday will call for $15 billion a year in federal spending to spur development of environmentally friendly but so far cost-ineffective energy sources such as wind and solar, biofuels, clean coal and more fuel-efficient vehicles.\He said his budget request also will create new incentives for teacher performance and support for innovative education programs. He asked every American to commit to completing a year or more of higher education or career training.\In contrast to many State of the Union addresses by George W. Bush, Obama did not emphasize foreign policy. He touched on his intention to chart new strategies in Iraq and Afghanistan and to forge a new image for the U.S. around the world even as he keeps up the fight against terrorism.\With the economy dominant, Obama said the mess was one he inherited. ""We have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity, where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter or the next election,"" he said.\Nonetheless, he aimed to show he is tackling the situation with both urgency and strict oversight for how the staggering sums are being spent. The massive stimulus plan, an overhaul of the financial sector bailout, and a $275 billion rescue for struggling homeowners are already in place, and more is likely on the way, Obama said.\Even as Washington pours money into the economic recovery, Obama said the budget deficit, at $1.3 trillion and ballooning, must be brought under control.\He promised he would slash it by half by the end of his term in 2013, mostly by ending U.S. combat in Iraq and eliminating some of Bushs tax cuts for the wealthy. He said his budget officials have identified a total of $2 trillion in savings over the next 10 years, also including ending education programs ""that dont work"" and payments to large agribusinesses ""that dont need them,"" eliminating wasteful no-bid contracts in Iraq and spending on weapons systems no longer needed in the post-Cold War era, and rooting out waste in Medicare.\""Everyone in this chamber, Democrats and Republicans, will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars,"" he said. ""And that includes me.""\He touted his decision to end the practice of leaving Iraq and Afghanistan war spending out of the main budget. ""For seven years, we have been a nation at war. No longer will we hide its price,"" Obama said.\Speech: Banks likely to need more funding"

Franke Lecture: Peter Singer""\Northwestern University School of Law\Meting out climate-change justice among nations is an ethical issue, not just a legal, political or economic one, Singer told a packed house of about 700 at Northwestern University School of Law.\The Princeton University philosopher believes that the rights of all sentient beings, including animals, be given equal consideration. He proposed a cap-and-trade system in which nations would be assigned quotas for greenhouse-gas emissions on a per-capita basis.\Such a regime would favor the most-populous nations, China and India. The U.S. would be so far above its quota that it would have to trade for or buy quota ""credits"" from others.\The system would be costly to the U.S., but Singer claimed that this nation is morally obliged to lead efforts to prevent climate change, given its culpability for the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\--Charles Storch\Saturday\""Wisconsin Death Trip""\Columbia College Chicago\One of the most striking books of the 1970s, ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" is Michael Lesy's unsettling patchwork of 19th Century photographs and newspaper stories about madness, suicide, murder and disease. Although centered on the isolated town of Black River Falls, the book, Lesy said, is about all of the upper Midwest. Indeed, he said, so many people died from epidemics, bad weather and economic hardship -- in ""a holocaust without Jews"" -- that ""it cast a pall over the land and over the people of the land.""\An audience member contended he shouldn't compare those deaths to the Holocaust in Europe. But Lesy, who described himself as ""a New York Jew,"" noted, ""I lost much of my family in World War II. They all went up the chimneys."" In fact, he said that, while working on the book, he wondered why he was able to deal with such depressing material and decided that it was because ""I have a personal acquaintance with darkness.""\--Patrick T. Reardon\""In Conversation: Philip Pullman"" and ""Bookstalk""\Chicago Public Library, Harold Washington Library Center\After Pullman waxed poetic about the influence of William Blake's ""Songs of Innocence"" and ""Songs of Experience"" on his work, Pullman himself got a song.\In fact, it was a song in search of a question, bellowed in a Native American cadence by an audience member during the question-and-answer session. It began: ""When you open a book, do the pages ever burn?"" and ended asking whether Pullman ever feared telling the truths that set his readers free?\Pullman, author of young adult fantasy series ""His Dark Materials,"" answered that although he doesn't always enjoy the physical process of writing, he felt a certain responsibility to describe the values he believed in, namely ""passion, courage, individual freedom and courtesy.""\""The Golden Compass,"" the first book of Pullman's series, has been adapted by Hollywood for a film starring Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman, slated for release in December. Trailers and cast interviews played as the capacity crowd of approximately 250 filed into the room -- more than 90 percent of them adult fans. The film, like his books, has already caused a predictable ""fuss,"" Pullman says, for its perceived critique on religion.\""I don't want to say what this means or that means,"" he said, guided by the principle that once a book is released, interpretation becomes a democratic, individual ritual.\But, he added that organized religion ""is at its best when it's furthest from power"" -- when it's fighting for the poor, the hungry and the oppressed.\However, when religions have power to execute people, to send armies into war, Pullman said, when it ""tells us what to read and what to think -- that's when religion is at its worst.""\A few yards away, down the hall, at ""Bookstalk,"" the first annual Moonbeam Children's Book Awards were being handed out -- though the Pullman event vacuumed most adults and children from the floor. Slightly more than a dozen adults and three children lingered in the basement of the Harold Washington Library.\Still, Minnesota author Karen Pavlicin was content to read selections of her Moonbeam-winner ""Perch, Mrs. Sackets, and Crow's Nest"" to her son Alexander, 8, and two other pint-size children of attending authors.\""It's a nice atmosphere they're trying to foster,"" Pavlicin said. ""It's a chance for authors to get to know one another, and for our children to meet.""\But for the second event in a row, the big kids (read: adults) overshadowed events aimed at young kids -- but the latter were too polite to mention it.\--Robert K. Elder\Sunday\""The Waste Land""\The Museum of Contemporary Art\More than three-quarters of a century after its publication, T.S. Eliot's ""The Waste Land"" retains its power to shock and enthrall, confuse and amaze.\Hearing the poem read by four actors under the direction of Bernard Sahlins was akin to watching a kaleidoscopic film roller-coasting through the guilts and dreads of the 20th Century -- indeed, of all centuries. Rats crept, bells tolled, bones rattled.\Afterward, Sahlins told the audience that he viewed ""The Waste Land"" as a linguistic version of Cubism. ""It's an Odyssey, and it's Ulysses encountering a lot of different perils and dilemmas,"" he said, adding, ""That whole poem deals with coming to terms with your destiny, with your religion and ultimately with your death.""\Richard Christiansen, the Tribune's former chief critic, noted that, after Virginia Woolf heard Eliot read the poem, she wrote in her diary: ""He sang it and chanted it, rhythmed it. ... What connects it together, I'm not so sure. ... One was left, however, with some strong emotion.""\--Patrick T. Reardon\Credit: By Patrick T.

104,"Global-warming pollution from Midwest oil refineries is expected to soar by as much as 40 percent during the next decade, a dramatic increase that runs counter to regional and national efforts to curb heat-trapping gases.\Expansion plans at the BP refinery in Whiting would boost the facility's greenhouse-gas emissions to 5.8 million tons a year, the company told the Tribune. That would be equivalent to adding 320,000 cars to the nation's highways.\While greenhouse gases from the tailpipes of cars get the most attention, the refineries that keep cars and trucks running also contribute to global warming. Fuel must be burned to make gasoline from oil, generating carbon-dioxide pollution.\The huge increases in greenhouse gases are a largely hidden consequence of an industrywide trend to buy more Canadian crude. Vast reserves of tar-soaked clay and sand lying under the swampy forests of northern Alberta are seen as a profitable and reliable source of oil, but the heavy petroleum requires more energy to process.\Other oil companies declined to discuss projected increases in global-warming pollution, but researchers have calculated that refining the Canadian petroleum produces 15 percent to 40 percent more carbon dioxide emissions than conventional oil.\With no greenhouse-gas regulations in place, the companies face no costs for the extra pollution they will churn into the atmosphere.\""This is a glaring example of how our energy policy and climate policy are at cross purposes,"" said Judi Greenwald, director of innovative solutions at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. ""Companies are making decisions that really don't make sense on a national level when you fail to take climate change into account.""\The industry's move toward heavy petroleum comes as oil companies aggressively promote their investments in renewable energy and involvement in efforts to fight global warming.\More than two dozen large corporations, including BP and ConocoPhillips, pledged last year to slow and eventually reverse the rapid growth in pollution that is heating up the planet. Yet BP, ConocoPhillips and other oil companies have not addressed emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in refinery air permits pending before federal and state environmental agencies.\Government officials, for their part, have largely ignored questions about how massive refinery projects in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio could affect greenhouse-gas emissions. The Midwest already is responsible for a fourth of the nation's output, according to industry estimates and academic researchers.\So far, BP is the only oil company willing to discuss the projected increase in carbon-dioxide emissions from its move to process Canadian crude.\""We're trying to provide a secure, reliable source of fuel for the region,"" said Bill Gerwing, manager of regulatory affairs for BP America. ""It's a game that everyone is getting into.""\In the past decade, BP has tried to set itself apart from industry rivals with environmentally friendly advertising that re-brands its corporate initials as ""Beyond Petroleum"" rather than British Petroleum.\A recent BP ad touts attempts to supply ""cleaner energy to homes and businesses across the country.""\BP and ConocoPhillips also are among a group of large corporations that last year called for ""strong national legislation to require significant reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions.""\""We take climate change very, very seriously,"" said Gerwing. ""And we are willing to pay for our emissions with offsets. We've built those costs into every one of our projects.""\But because the government does not regulate greenhouse gases, there is no way to ensure oil companies keep such pledges or to encourage them to cut back on emissions.\Global-warming pollution isn't mentioned in a proposed air permit for BP's Whiting refinery, which is being expanded to process more Canadian oil. By contrast, BP's attempt last summer to increase the amount of pollutants the refinery puts into Lake Michigan was outlined in a water permit required under the federal Clean Water Act. BP later backed down after a deluge of protests prompted by Tribune stories.\Throughout the Midwest, refinery projects are moving forward as politicians debate whether global-warming pollution should be limited for the first time. The discussion is driven by mounting evidence that continued increases in greenhouse-gas emissions could result in weather changes.\Leading presidential candidates in both parties back a system that would cap carbon-dioxide emissions and let companies trade the right to keep polluting.\Under legislation proposed in Congress, large polluters would need to buy allowances from cleaner sources to remain below the national limit on emissions.\States also are taking action. In November, the governors of six Midwest states vowed to set up their own regional trading program, similar to one already in place in the Northeast.\With oil prices soaring, many leading climate scientists and environmental groups are calling for action that would offset the financial incentives to process heavy Canadian crude. They want a national policy that takes the price of carbon emissions into account.\""If carbon isn't considered in these huge investments, we are going to be stuck with a tremendous burden,"" said Henry Henderson, a former Chicago environment commissioner who now heads the Natural Resources Defense Council's Midwest office.\A cap-and-trade system is one way to do that. Another is setting standards that require greater reliance on low-carbon fuels.\A California initiative considers all greenhouse gases produced during fuel production, from pollution released as oil is pumped from the ground to the exhaust from tailpipes.\A national version of that standard would mean oil companies could still make fuels derived from the oil sands, but they would have to balance the higher emissions with lower-carbon products, said Alex Farrell, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley.\The incentive also could prod oil companies to find ways to make the refining process more energy-efficient.\""The climate change problem isn't going away and is just going to get worse,"" Farrell said. ""Developing the oil sands isn't going to help.""\Illinois is among a dozen states considering a low-carbon fuel standard.\Gov. Rod Blagojevich has set a goal of cutting greenhouse gases in Illinois by 25 percent by 2020.\Yet the state failed to address global-warming pollution in a draft air permit it gave ConocoPhillips to convert its Wood River refinery in Downstate Roxana to process Canadian oil. Nor is the issue part of the discussions about refinery projects in other Midwest states.\Most state environmental officials contend they can't act unless Congress provides explicit authority to regulate global-warming pollution.\The exception is California, where Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown pressured ConocoPhillips to offset its carbon-dioxide emissions and make a refinery expansion carbon-neutral.\""If ConocoPhillips can do this in California, they and the other oil companies can do it in Illinois and every other state,"" said Howard Learner, president of the Environmental Law and Policy Center. ""They should be cleaning up now rather than later.""\----------\mhawthorne@tribune.com\Credit: By Michael Hawthorne, TRIBUNE REPORTER"
105,"Suits pressed, briefcases in hand, four freshman lawmakers will arrive for their first day on the job at 2 E. Capitol St. in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.\The four Illinois lawmakers will together represent the largest influx of suburban Republicans to the House of Representatives in nearly two decades.\While new Congressmen Joe Walsh, Robert Dold, Randy Hultgren and Adam Kinzinger will together join the chamber's new Republican majority, the four men's political leanings are as diverse as the suburbs they call home.\The nonprofit veteran, business owner, lawyer and Air Force pilot represent various points on the conservative spectrum from tea partyer to mainline Republican to social moderate.\Over the next two years, they'll distinguish themselves by the votes they cast, the committees they join, the campaign promises they keep and perhaps break and the alliances they forge.\Here's what to watch for. Meet the ""new class.""\Joe Walsh: 8th District\Vitals: North Shore native, McHenry resident, 49-year-old father of five. Divorced, and since remarried. Worked in the nonprofit sector and taught history at Oakton Community College before joining a Chicago investment group.\Background: Walsh's 2010 campaign as a tea party candidate represents a significant departure from his past platforms. In 1996, campaigning against 9th District Democratic Rep. Sidney Yates, Walsh billed himself as a social liberal who supported abortion rights and gun control. Now, he advocates for banning abortion in all cases and supports concealed carry laws. Walsh also supports Arizona's\controversial immigration law and a constitutional ban on same sex marriage.\Walsh campaigned on a platform of fiscal conservatism. At the same time, he defended his own financial troubles as ""a few isolated dings,"" not a worrisome pattern. Walsh's Evanston condominium was foreclosed on last year, and court records show he had state and federal liens for failing to pay his income taxes in their entirety in the 1990s and taxes on an education trust fund in the 1980s.\After Walsh won a six-way primary in February, national Republicans made it clear they didn't believe he could defeat three-term Democratic incumbent Melissa Bean.\Yet that's just what he did, with the help of a strong grass-roots effort, defeating the Barrington Democrat by 291 votes. What his campaign lacked in money, it made up for in manpower.\Brings to the table: A strong grass-roots following, charisma, the enthusiastic backing of numerous suburban tea party groups. Walsh has several out-of-the-box ideas on cost-cutting in federal government, including eliminating the departments of Education and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. In late December, he announced he landed three committee assignments named to the Homeland Security, Small Business, and Oversight and Government Reform committees.\What to watch for: Will his leadership isolate him from others in the party or garner national attention?\Robert Dold: 10th District\Vitals: Kenilworth business owner, 41 years old. Married, three children.\Background: Growing up in Winnetka, graduating from New Trier High School, and now renting his parents' Kenilworth home, Dold has a deep understanding of the North suburban 10th Congressional District.\While he has no elected experience, Dold spent several years working in Washington, D.C. for Vice President Dan Quayle and the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign, then on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\Named a Republican ""young gun"" one of the next generation of conservative leaders Dold has received considerable attention from party bigwigs.\In the race against Democrat Dan Seals for the 10th District seat this fall, he received the endorsement of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.\Brings to the table: A continuation, both in policy and approach, of the way his predecessor, five-term Republican Congressman Mark Steven Kirk of Highland Park, led the district.\Like Kirk, Dold portrays himself as a fiscal conservative and social moderate in the independent North suburban 10th District. Dold says he's focused on reviving the economy and tackling the spiraling national debt. He supports stem-cell research, limits on gun ownership, and abortion rights in some instances. Since Kirk moved to the Senate Nov. 29 to fill the remainder of President Barack Obama's expiring Senate term, Kirk and Dold have been working closely together, as Dold puts it, ""to make sure there is no hiccup in either the district or in the Washington, D.C., office.""\What to watch for: How will Dold continue the 10th District's legacy of ""thoughtful, independent leadership"" demonstrated by both former Rep. John Porter and Kirk? Dold, who landed a plum assignment on the House Financial Services Committee, has promised he's willing to reach across the aisle, and work toward bipartisan solutions.\Randy Hultgren: 14th District\Vitals: Elected while serving as Illinois state senator, a lawyer and investment adviser. Before that, Hultgren was a state representative from 1999-2007, and active in DuPage County politics. The married father of four of St. Charles is 44 years old.\Brings to the table: As a Milton Township precinct committeeman, DuPage County Board member, lawmaker and now a congressman, Hultgren has followed Wheaton Republican Peter Roskam into just about every level of politics he's ever achieved.\Elected to House Speaker Dennis Hastert's former seat, Hultgren is considered an up-and-coming ""young gun"" by Republicans. He has stressed that Congress has not reversed the recession as quickly as it should have and calls for Washington to operate in a more bipartisan way.\Hultgren, who has never served in an environment where Republicans have control of leadership, is less of a centrist than his predecessor, Democrat Bill Foster, who voted against every budget offered by his party and sided with the GOP on cap-and-trade limits. On social issues, Hultgren opposes stem-cell research and abortion rights.\Still, Hultgren brings political savvy and a strong conservative background to the district that re-elected Hastert for 10 terms.\What to watch for: With Roskam now elevated to Republican Deputy Whip, Hultgren, in turn, may find himself in the spotlight. The 14th District, which stretches west from Wheaton to the Iowa border, is one of the most diverse districts in the suburbs, with both rural and urban pockets. Where will Aurora and Elgin end up on Hultgren's political to-do list given their Democratic-leaning political voting history? Will he try to court their votes for re-election or will he rely on the district's conservative voters to back him?\Adam Kinzinger: 11th District\Vitals: At 32 years old, Kinzinger is the youngest person to hold office in the 11th District in more than 60 years, since 32-year-old former Chicago Bears playerChester Chesney was elected in 1948.\Breaking age records and making headlines is nothing new for the Manteno resident and Air Force pilot.\As a sophomore at Illinois State University, Kinzinger was elected to the McLean County Board, beating out a much older, experienced candidate. This fall, he leapfrogged from that position to defeat Democratic incumbent Deborah Halvorson 57 percent to 43 percent in the South suburban swing district, which includes a portion of Will County on the north, that supported Obama and Halvorson by strong margins in 2008.\Outside of politics, Kinzinger was hailed as a hero in 2007 for rescuing a young mother who had been stabbed in downtown Milwaukee.\Brings to the table: Like Dold and Hultgren, Kinzinger is part of the party's ""young guns"" program. He's young, energetic, and backed by tea partyers, even getting a nod from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin this fall.\Kinzinger, recently named to the Energy and Commerce committee, made energy a focal point in his campaign, pitching a plan for advancing nuclear production at home and focusing on energy independence. His district boasts three power plants.\Kinzinger also has pledged to reform Washington. Yet, shortly after his election, he held a ""debt retirement dinner"" with lobbyists and corporate representatives.\What to watch for: One of just four newly elected lawmakers tapped to serve on the GOP's transition team, Kinzinger has the potential to be a rising star, helping guide his party in its new relationship with the growing tea party. Will he steer clear of corporate interests and hold true to his promise of reform?\* Daily Herald staff writer Jim Fuller contributed to this report."
106,"CORRECTION: This story contains corrected material, published Jan. 16, 2017.\He first achieved national renown with a speech hailing bipartisanship, but will leave the White House with the widest partisan gap in approval ever recorded.\He spent much of his presidency singing the praises of cooperation across party lines, but nearly all his major accomplishments resulted from party-line votes or executive actions. \And if Republicans accused him of paying too much attention to Democratic interests, allies blamed him for neglecting his party. Democrats lost a dozen governorships and hundreds of state legislative seats, as well as control of Congress, during his tenure. \President Barack Obama leaves office with job approval ratings comparable to the final marks for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. But unlike them, Obama's support is overwhelmingly party based. \Eight in ten Democrats on average approved of Obama's work over the last eight years while only about one in eight Republicans did so. Now nearly nine in ten Democrats and six in ten independents, but only about one in seven Republicans, give him positive marks, according to polling by the non-partisan Pew Research Center. \That's disheartening for the leader who was hailed at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, when he was a little-known Illinois state legislator running for the U.S. Senate, when he declared ""there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America."" \Last January, in his final State of the Union address, Obama cited the increase in partisanship during his presidency as among his greatest regrets. \In an interview with the Washington Bureau several weeks later, Obama said he still believed in bipartisanship, but that he had decided early it could not be his top priority. \""Bipartisanship is not a virtue if we don't do anything, and we just leave problems unsolved,"" Obama said. ""Bipartisanship is a virtue if we, both sides, (say) 'Look, we have a problem. We may differ on how we solve it, but let's sit down and negotiate.' And there's never been an issue in Washington that I haven't been willing to take a half loaf or a quarter loaf."" \As he saw it, he had tried again and again without success to divide the loaf, only to be met with what the White House saw as relentless opposition. \After all, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky famously said in 2010 that the ""single most important thing"" for the GOP was to make Obama a one-term president, a goal hardly conducive to compromise. \""When you can't get a negotiating partner across the table who is going to agree to anything, then you have to make a decision,"" Obama said about the fight over the 2010 Affordable Care Act. ""Do I just drop it? Or ... do you say, 'Wow, I've got millions of people out there who don't have health insurance and I need to go forward' ""? \""At that point then, it was just a majority muscle move,"" he added. \Republican leaders claim Obama never offered half a loaf or anything like it. They say he didn't have the legislative experience to cut deals or was too aloof to engage in the fine art of wining and dining lawmakers to his side. \""Almost without exception, President Obama begins serious policy discussions by explaining why everyone else is wrong,"" McConnell wrote in his 2016 autobiography. \""The conversation would last as long as it took the President to feel satisfied that his soliloquy had outlined the issue well enough for me to understand,"" he wrote. ""Speaker Boehner famously put the phone on his desk and carried on a separate conversation during one of these exchanges with the President. I never put the phone down, but on one occasion, I did watch at least an inning of baseball."" \While both political parties blame the other for the widening partisan divide, the causes are not so simple. Leaders were caught in a dynamic that has emerged over decades. \In the 1960s and 1970s, the Democratic and Republican parties had broad coalitions of liberals, moderates and conservatives. Presidents could forge bipartisan consensus for major legislation, from civil rights to environmental protection. \But the ability to compromise weakened in the 1980s as Republicans grew more consistently conservative and Democrats more reliably liberal. \The divide widened under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, and worsened further under Obama. \Greater levels of education, the advent of social media, greater racial diversity, increased income inequality, and changes in the economy probably all played a role. \To the extent that Obama and Republicans in Congress have aggravated the gap, the two sides have very different explanations. \As Obama tells it, the story begins early in his first term as he rode to Capitol Hill in the presidential limousine. He was going to meet with Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, then the House minority leader, to discuss ways to stimulate the economy to avert a depression after the housing market collapse at the end of the Bush administration. \Obama said he had phoned Boehner and asked to ""come up to your caucus and talk."" \""As I'm driving over, he puts out a press release saying, 'We're against it,' "" Obama told friends later, referring to the alert he saw on an aide's Blackberry. \""We hadn't talked to anybody yet!"" \Dozens of interviews with Obama aides and the president himself suggest that the limousine story, which he told and retold over the years, deeply colored his thinking about his GOP adversaries. \Boehner's team has a different memory of the incident. \They say it wasn't their intransigence that started the gridlock of the last eight years but Obama's initial approach to them. \They say he made clear that the Democratic majority in Congress, led by the newly-elected Democratic president, would push through a economic stimulus bill with or without Republican support. \Obama's handling of the stimulus bill was ""the original sin"" of his young administration, ""setting the course of partisanship and confrontation,"" former Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. \""There's an argument to be made that the history of the Obama presidency would have been very different if he had insisted on bipartisan discussions and input on the stimulus bill,"" Steel said. \In the end, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus was formally known, passed Congress with three Republican votes in the Senate and none in the House. \Mutual recriminations only worsened later that year when the administration and Congress negotiated over Obama's proposed health care reform law. \On that, the two sides again share a story but give it different interpretations. \For months, White House and Senate staffs shuttled up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, chasing potential compromises but finding none. \Eager to break the impasse, Obama invited Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the senior member of the GOP minority on a key committee, and several other lawmakers to the Oval Office for a session he thought could clear the way (this sentence as published has been corrected in this text). \He set up the meeting the way he had learned from Republicans in the Illinois Senate: No public arrival. No parade before reporters. Just a few aides and officials in the room. \Grassley, with his low-key manners and graying hair, looked like the negotiating partners of Obama's past. Like Obama, he had done deals across party lines before. \It was early August. They sat in the Oval Office, Obama cross-legged in an arm chair, Grassley leaning back on a beige couch. \Can we make this idea work, or that one? Obama asked, working his way down the list. Is there another way you want to do it? Would he be willing to vote with the Democrats? \After a pause, according to a White House witness, the senator leaned toward the president and looked him in the eye. \""You know what, Mr. President?"" he said, ""I've got to admit -- there's no change that allows me to vote for this thing."" \Obama and top advisers told that story often later. To them, it marked the moment they realized the Republicans were not prepared to consider the president's top domestic priority. \The moment symbolized something else for Grassley: Obama had started with a Democratic plan -- government-based health care coverage -- and was willing to tweak it only to pick up enough Republicans to allow the White House to claim it had bipartisan support. \Grassley said he wouldn't play that game. ""I said to the president, 'That's not bipartisanship,' "" he recalled. \For Obama, who believed in universal health care ? or something close to it -- the issue was simple. What was the point of winning the White House if you couldn't help people as you'd promised? \The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, passed in early 2010 without a single Republican vote. The party-line dispute contributed to the Democrats' heavy losses in midterm elections later that year, giving Republicans control of the House. Republicans gained control of the Senate in 2014. (This paragraph as published has been corrected in this text.) \After that, the stalemate was set. \Republicans argued that the Obama was trying to ram his political agenda -- including cap-and-trade legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and an overhaul of immigration laws -- down their throats. \After bitter debate, the climate change bill was passed by the House but was never brought to a vote in the Senate, where it died. In 2013, the opposite occurred for immigration reform. It narrowly passed the Senate, but died without a vote in the House. \After that, Obama increasingly used executive authority to order rule changes for the environment, immigration, unemployment and other issues. That means President-elect Trump can reverse or amend many of them as soon as he takes office. \Jim Manley, a former top aide to then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said Republicans still remember Obama's boast to GOP leaders in the Oval office in 2009. ""Elections have consequences,"" the new president told them. \""They've never forgotten that,"" Manley said. \---------- \christi.parsons@latimes.com\Credit: By Christi Parsons and Lisa Mascaro, Washington Bureau"
107,"Abortion and birth control\Obama: Supports access to abortion. Health care law requires contraceptives to be available for free for women enrolled in workplace health plans, including access to the morning-after pill, which does not terminate a pregnancy but is considered tantamount to an abortion pill by some religious conservatives. Supported requiring girls 16 and under to get a prescription for the morning-after pill, available without a prescription for older women.\Romney: Opposes access to abortion except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the woman's life. Previously supported access. Says state law should guide abortion rights, and Roe v. Wade should be reversed by a future Supreme Court ruling. But says Roe v. Wade is law of the land until that happens and should not be challenged by federal legislation seeking to overturn abortion rights affirmed by that court decision. ""So I would live within the law, within the Constitution as I understand it, without creating a constitutional crisis. But I do believe Roe v. Wade should be reversed to allow states to make that decision."" Said he would eliminate federal aid to Planned Parenthood.\Debt\Obama: Failed in pledge to cut the deficit ""we inherited"" by half by the end of his first term. The deficit when he took office was $1.2 trillion, and the $800 billion stimulus bill Obama signed soon afterward increased the shortfall to more than $1.4 trillion. The deficit for the recently completed 2012 budget year registered at $1.2 trillion, marking the fourth consecutive year of trillion-dollar-plus red ink. Now promises to cut projected deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, a goal that will require Congress to raise the capital gains tax, boost taxes on households earning more than $250,000 a year and impose a minimum 30 percent tax on incomes above $1 million. The target also assumes a reduction in the amount of interest the government must pay on its debt and incorporates $1 trillion in cuts already signed into law. Nation's debt surpassed $16 trillion this year. Federal spending is estimated at 23.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, up from about 20 percent in the previous administration, and is forecast to decline to 21.8 percent by 2016.\Romney: Promises to cut $500 billion per year from the federal budget by 2016 to bring spending below 20 percent of the U.S. economy and to balance it by 2020, but vital specifics are lacking. At the same time would increase military spending, reverse $716 billion in Medicare cuts and cut taxes. Defended 2008 bailout of financial institutions as a necessary step to avoid the system's collapse, opposed the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler. Stayed silent on the debt-ceiling deal during its negotiation, only announcing his opposition to the final agreement shortly before lawmakers voted on it. Instead, endorsed GOP ""cut, cap and balance"" bill that had no chance of enactment. Favors constitutional balanced budget amendment. Proposes 10 percent cut in federal workforce, elimination of $1.6 billion in Amtrak subsidies and cuts of $600 million in support for the arts and broadcasting.\Economy\Obama: Term marked by a deep recession that began in previous administration and officially ended within six months, and gradual recovery with persistently high jobless rates of above 8 percent until the last two months of the campaign. Mixed jobs report for October showed unemployment rising to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent in September, but strong hiring as more people started looking for work. Obama responded to the recession with a roughly $800 billion stimulus plan that nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated cut the unemployment rate by up to 1.8 percentage points. Continued implementation of Wall Street and auto industry bailouts begun under George W. Bush. Proposes tax breaks for U.S. manufacturers producing domestically or repatriating jobs from abroad and tax penalties for U.S. companies outsourcing jobs. Won approval of South Korea, Panama and Colombia free-trade pacts begun under previous administration, completing the biggest round of trade liberalization since the North American Free Trade Agreement and other pacts went into effect in the 1990s.\Romney: Favors lower taxes, less regulation, balanced budget, more trade deals to spur growth. Would replace jobless benefits with unemployment savings accounts. Proposes replacing certain provisions of the law toughening financial industry regulations after the meltdown in that sector. Proposes changing the law tightening accounting corporate regulations to ease requirements for mid-sized companies. ""We don't want to tell the world that Republicans are against all regulation. No, regulation is necessary to make a free market work. But it has to be updated and modern.""\Education\Obama: Has approved waivers freeing states from the most onerous requirements of the Bush-era No Child Left Behind law with their agreement to improve how they prepare and evaluate students. ""Race to the Top"" grant competition has rewarded winning states with billions of dollars for pursuing education policies Obama supports. Won approval for a college tuition tax credit worth up to $10,000 over four years and more money for Pell Grants for low-income college students. Wants Congress to agree to reduce federal aid to colleges that go too far in raising tuition. Average tuition at four-year public colleges surged 26 percent in his term, by $1,800 to $8,655, as states cut aid, but federal grants and tax credits sheltered students from most of the increase, leaving them paying only $570 more.\Romney: Supported the federal accountability standards of No Child Left Behind law. In 2007, said he was wrong earlier in career when he wanted the Education Department shut because he came to see the value of the federal government in ""holding down the interests of the teachers unions"" and putting kids and parents first. Has said the student testing, charter-school incentives and teacher evaluation standards of Obama's ""Race to the Top"" competition ""make sense"" although the federal government should have less control of education. Says increases in federal student aid encourage tuition to go up, too. Wants to see private lenders return to the federal student loan program.\Energy and Environment\Obama: Ordered temporary moratorium on deep-water drilling after the massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but U.S. produced more oil in 2010 than it has since 2003 and all forms of energy production have increased under Obama. Approved drilling plan in Arctic Ocean opposed by environmentalists. Proposes Congress give oil market regulators more power to control price manipulation by speculators and stiffer fines for doing so. Sets goal of cutting oil imports by half by 2020.\Achieved historic increases in fuel economy standards for automobiles that will save money at the pump while raising the cost of new vehicles. Achieved first regulations on heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming and on toxic mercury pollution from power plants. The rules on mercury could force dozens of older coal-fired plants to shut or spend billions to upgrade. Spent heavily on green energy and has embraced nuclear power as a clean source.\Failed to persuade a Democratic Congress to pass limits he promised on carbon emissions. Shelved plan to toughen health standards on lung-damaging smog. Rejected Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada but supports fast-track approval of a segment of it. Proposes ending subsidies to oil industry but has failed to persuade Congress to do so.\Romney: Pledges U.S. will become independent of energy sources outside of North America by 2020, through more aggressive exploitation of domestic oil, gas, coal and other resources and quick approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. Supports opening the Atlantic and Pacific outer continental shelves to drilling, as well as Western lands, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore Alaska. He also has proposed reducing obstacles to coal, natural gas and nuclear energy development. Proposes accelerating drilling permits in areas where exploration has already been approved for developers with good safety records.\Says green power has yet to become viable and the causes of climate change are unknown. Proposes to remove carbon dioxide from list of pollutants controlled by Clean Air Act and amend clean water and air laws to ensure the cost of complying with regulations is balanced against environmental benefit. Says cap and trade would ""rocket energy prices.""\Gay Rights\Obama: Supports legal recognition of same-sex marriage, a matter decided by states. Opposed that recognition in 2008 presidential campaign -- and in 2004 Senate campaign -- while supporting the extension of legal rights and benefits to same-sex couples in civil unions. Achieved repeal of the military ban on openly gay service members. Has not achieved repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages and affirms the right of states to refuse to recognize such marriages. Administration has ceased defending the law in court, but it remains on the books. Directed government to require all hospitals that get Medicare and Medicaid financing to grant visitation privileges to gay and lesbian partners of patients. But has declined to issue an executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating against gay employees, holding out instead for congressional action to extend such protection to workers in all sectors. In 1996 Illinois state Senate campaign, stated: ""I favor legalizing same-sex marriages,"" a position he later abandoned at the federal level and now embraces again. ""I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" he said.\Romney: Opposes legal recognition of same-sex marriage and says it should be banned with a constitutional amendment, not left to states. ""Marriage is not an activity that goes on within the walls of a state."" Also opposes civil unions ""if they are identical to marriage other than by name,"" but says states should be left to decide what rights and benefits should be allowed under those unions. Says certain domestic partnership benefits -- largely unspecified -- as well as hospital visitation rights are appropriate but ""others are not."" Says he would not seek to restore the ban on openly gay military members. Asserted in 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor that ""all citizens deserve equal rights, regardless of sexual preference,"" in tune with statements years earlier as a Senate candidate that equality for gays and lesbians should be a ""mainstream concern."" But did not explicitly support marriage recognition and, as governor, opposed same-sex marriage when courts legalized it in Massachusetts. ""My view is that marriage itself is between a man and a woman.""\Health care\Obama: Achieved landmark overhaul putting U.S. on path to universal coverage now that Supreme Court has upheld the law's mandate for almost everyone to obtain insurance. Under the law, insurers will be banned from denying coverage to people with pre-existing illness, tax credits for middle-income people will subsidize premiums, people without work-based insurance will have access to new markets and small business gets help for offering insurance. Millions of low-income uninsured are to be reached through expansion of Medicaid with hefty subsidies to states, but Supreme Court limited federal power to penalize states that want to opt out of the expansion. Law's biggest changes start in 2014. ""Nobody is going to go broke just because they get sick. And Americans will no longer be denied or dropped by their insurance companies just when they need care the most. That's what change is.""\Health care law improves Medicare benefits, adding better coverage for seniors with high prescription costs as well as removing co-pays for a set of preventive benefits. It also cuts Medicare payments to hospitals and other providers by more than $700 billion over a decade. Those cuts are being used to provide health insurance to more working-age Americans, and the government also counts them as extending the life of the Medicare trust fund. Any future deficit-reduction deal, though, is likely to increase costs for middle-class and upper-income Medicare recipients, and Obama has indicated a willingness to consider increasing the eligibility from 65 to 67.\Romney: Promises to repeal Obama's health care law modeled largely after his universal health care achievement in Massachusetts because he says states, not Washington, should drive policy on the uninsured. Would expand individual tax-advantaged medical savings accounts and let the savings be used for insurance premiums as well as personal medical costs. Would let insurance be sold across state lines to expand options, and restrict malpractice awards to restrain health care costs. Says he would protect people with pre-existing conditions, though his plan only does so for those who maintain continuous coverage, not a major change from federal protections in effect before Obama's health care overhaul.\On Medicare, would introduce ""generous"" but undetermined subsidies to help future retirees buy private insurance or join a government plan modeled on traditional Medicare. Gradually increase the eligibility age to 67. Repealing Obama's health care law would roll back improved benefits for seniors unless Congress acts to protect them. It also would reverse Obama's Medicare cuts to hospitals and other providers. This would have the unintended consequence of hastening the insolvency of Medicare's trust fund. Would turn Medicaid program over to the states as a block grant.\Immigration\Obama: Issued directive in June that immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children be exempted from deportation and granted work permits if they apply, a step that could benefit 800,000 to 1.4 million. ""It's a temporary measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while offering some justice to these young people."" Took the step after failing to deliver on a promised immigration overhaul, with the defeat of legislation that would have created a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants enrolled in college or enlisted in the armed forces. Says he is still committed to it. Government has deported a record number of illegal immigrants under Obama, nearly 400,000 in each of the last three years.\Romney: Favors U.S.-Mexico border fence, opposes education benefits to illegal immigrants. Opposes offering legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college but would do so for those who serve in the armed forces. Would establish a national immigration-status verification system for employers and punish them if they hire noncitizens who do not prove their authorized status. The government's existing E-Verify system is voluntary. Proposes more visas for holders of advanced degrees in math, science and engineering who have U.S. job offers and would award permanent residency to foreign students who graduate from U.S. schools with a degree in those fields. Would end caps on visas for spouses and minor children of legal immigrants. Would honor work permits granted to illegal immigrants under Obama's policy of protecting those who came as children, but not accept new applicants. Promises to put a comprehensive immigration plan into place before those permits expire.\Social Security\Obama: Has not proposed a comprehensive plan to address Social Security's long-term financial problems. During budget negotiations in 2011, proposed adopting a new measurement of inflation that would reduce annual increases in Social Security benefits. The proposal would reduce the long-term financing shortfall by about 25 percent, according to the Social Security actuaries.\Romney: Protect the status quo for people 55 and over but, for the next generation of retirees, raise the retirement age for full benefits by one or two years and reduce inflation increases in benefits for wealthier recipients.\Taxes\Obama: Wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and ensure they pay 30 percent of their income at minimum. Supports extending Bush-era tax cuts for everyone making under $200,000, or $250,000 for couples. But in 2010, agreed to a two-year extension of the lower rates for all. Wants to let the top two tax rates go back up 3 to 4 percentage points to 39.6 percent and 36 percent, and raise rates on capital gains and dividends for the wealthy. Health care law provides for tax on highest-value health insurance plans. Together with Congress, built a first-term record of significant tax cuts for families and business, some temporary.\Romney: Keep Bush-era tax cuts for all incomes and drop all tax rates further, by 20 percent, bringing the top rate, for example, down to 28 percent from 35 percent and the lowest rate to 8 percent instead of 10 percent. Curtail deductions, credits and exemptions for the wealthiest. End Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals, eliminate capital gains tax for families making below $200,000 and cut corporate tax to 25 percent from 35 percent.\Does not specify which tax breaks or programs he would curtail to help cover costs."

Poor George Bush. He's really been taking it from the commentators in Rio. The conventional wisdom is that his performance range at the Earth Summit was downright wicked, intransigent or inept.
\
For example, Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.), leader of the U.S. congressional delegation, says: ""The White House gave the impression of a Keystone Kops-type operation."" The same president who did such a good job in rallying support for the Persian Gulf war has been such a failure in building consensus on the environment, the critics marvel.
\
But Bush probably has charted what is more or less the proper course-again.
\
Certainly the fact that he didn't surrender to the sentimental chorus of good intentions that rose in Rio has made him a symbol of tough-minded resistance to the latest international fad.
\
It was Fidel Castro who received the lusty ovation from the throng, after all; Bush collected the boos.
\
Quite aside from the slogans-he was defending American jobs, he was defending American sovereignty-it was just plain caution and good sense that Bush displayed, and it probably will do him much more good than harm in the November election.
\
What hasn't been noted is that, behind the scenes, his administration has been quietly laying the basis for a concrete deal on global greenhouse gas emissions. With a little luck, it will lead within a year or two to serious international controls.
\
How so? Well, at the height of the highly public shadow-play in Brazil, Harvard economist Martin Feldstein called for adoption of a world carbon tax.
\
""The idea of a carbon tax levied by all of the major industrial countries may not be on the current agenda,"" Feldstein wrote in an article published on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, ""but it could turn out to be the most important result of the Earth Summit.""
\
No economic adviser is more closely associated with President Bush than Feldstein, who is best remembered for his falling-out in 1983 with President Ronald Reagan over the significance of the exploding deficit.
\
Feldstein was chief adviser to Bush in the 1988 campaign, then propelled his associates, including chief economic adviser Michael Boskin, into key jobs after the election. It is almost certain that Feldstein was speaking of matters on the president's mind.
\
A carbon tax, uniformly levied by the industrial nations, would be the financial engine of a system of tradable carbon dioxide emission permits, designed to keep global emissions at, say, 1990 levels by whatever methods cost the least. Nations that wanted to emit more greenhouse gases would pay those that emitted less; rich countries would pay poor countries to clean up the Earth.
\
Such a market-based system would constitute the relatively low-cost ""insurance"" against the more troubling possibilities of a warmer Earth that the most senior boards of specialists in the last few years have recommended buying.
\
Such a tax would hit oil and gas producers hardest, though it would hardly put most out of business; households would scarcely notice it. A study in the new Brookings Papers on Economic Activity estimates that such a tax would cost the U.S. economy barely half a percent of gross domestic product over the next 20 years.
\
A little background: It is well known how, in the days in which the agenda for the Rio meeting was being prepared, the U.S. persuaded the other industrial nations to abandon a showy agreement that would have been the greenhouse-gas equivalent of a balanced-budget amendment, a treaty requiring them to stabilize the emission of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels in the next 10 years, without specifying any way of doing it. The U.S. held out for a treaty without targets, saying all the while that a carbon tax was the right first step.
\
Somewhat less well known, in the U.S. at least, is the swivet into which the carbon tax threw the European Community in May, before the Rio meeting. First the EC's Executive Committee voted for a new tax on oil, gas and coal, starting at $3 a barrel and rising to $10 by century's end. This was no mere recommendation; it constituted draft legislation for the 12 member nations.
\
The politicians who run the EC prepared to go to Rio to set the world an example by levying a tax on Europe so long as the U.S. and Japan followed suit.
\
The EC's Executive Committee quickly found it couldn't make its bold initiative stick. Member nations were divided sharply on the measure, with Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark enthusiastically supporting it, and Spain, Portugal and Greece opposing it.
\
The committee thereupon withdrew the measure-and the EC's environmental commissioner stayed home from Rio to protest. The White House, which had argued to the Europeans that it was not a propitious moment to enact the tax, breathed a sigh of relied.
\
Welcome to the politics of the New World Order! As economist Feldstein notes, the European commissioners should have understood that no European parliament could enact such a major tax without an extensive national debate; once again, the bureaucrats got ahead of the politicians. But if the difficulty of passing such a measure was great in Europe, it could only be greater in the U.S., where the battle cry ""no new taxes"" evokes passions that run almost as high as the conviction that something should be done about greenhouse emissions.
\
It should have been obvious, Feldstein wrote, that ""the U.S. could contemplate such a massive tax increase only in the context of a general budget agreement and therefore that it could not be considered until after the election.""
\
Now this is an interesting glimpse of the thinking apparently going on at high levels in the Bush administration, even if it does come from a man without official portfolio.
\
It gives considerable insight into the pressures on the president in this three-way election year: a measure to help balance the U.S. budget and save the planet cannot be mentioned by the president in an election year, because of pressure from his right wing.
\
Nevertheless, behind the scenes, the administration team is systematically going after the carbon tax. Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly was baiting America's Group of 7 allies last week in Rio, telling them that the U.S. wants a ""prompt start"" on a climate change convention.
\
Such a meeting would, in effect, be the beginning of a new international regulatory agency, which would contemplate the emission monitoring, the distribution of emission rights and tax negotiating that is a necessary prelude to the great atmospheric cleanup.
\
In the end, the international environmental regulatory apparatus will resemble nothing so much as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the bare-bones, little-understood Geneva-based agency that for 40 years has overseen world trade.
\
The Bush administration is actively putting it together. The president isn't getting much credit for it in most of the simple-minded analysis that has been emanating from Rio, though. That is just another aspect of the greatly increased complexity of politics in the early days of the New World Order.
"
112,"Federal environmental policy often produces conflicting results. On one hand, the Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated a Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. On the other, Washington uses incentives and mandates to promote the use of ethanol in transportation fuel, even though environmental groups say ethanol is worse for the climate than gasoline.\Recently, the Bureau of Land Management decided to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota by vetoing a proposed nickel and copper mine that could have polluted it. Good enough. But government programs also can be harmful. ""Decades of fire suppression by the Forest Service have disrupted natural fire cycles and turned many western forests into tinderboxes waiting to burn,"" write Terry Anderson and Reed Watson of the Property and Environment Research Center in Bozeman, Mont. \Getting the entire federal government to push in the same direction is no easy task, given the many agencies that have a hand in environmental issues. Getting the right balance between sensible protection and wasteful folly is also hard. Add to that a new complexity: the widespread fear that Donald Trump will surrender America's public outdoors to extraction industries, big game hunters and private landholders. \Environmental groups such as those that work to protect and restore wolves, bears and other species are alarmed by some of the president-elect's appointees. ""How many threats to wildlife and the environment can Trump fit into one Cabinet?"" one leading group, Defenders of Wildlife, asks on its website. \And that's only one realm of concern. The incoming administration already has indicated it has some misplaced priorities. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, nominated to head the EPA, sued to block the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which limited emissions from power plants, and its regulations on methane, a potent greenhouse gas. All this fits with the president-elect's vow to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and end what he calls ""(President) Obama's war on coal."" \Because those EPA rules are already in place, the next administration can't simply scrap them. Undoing them would require it to go through a laborious process, followed by a protracted barrage of legal challenges. \Given the value of the regulations in moderating the long-term danger of global warming as well as protecting public health in the short term, we hope Trump decides not to reverse course. The shift away from coal has come about mostly because of its relatively high cost, not government dictates, and it's unrealistic to think he could -- or should -- turn it around. Climate change is not the sort of problem that will go away if the president ignores it. \There are, however, steps his administration could take to reduce regulatory costs in an environmentally smart way. Trump's pledge to expand oil and gas leasing on federal lands may help combat climate change by increasing the supply of natural gas, which emits far less carbon dioxide than coal. Federal fuel economy standards for cars and trucks -- a clumsy, inefficient method to cut gasoline consumption -- should be phased out. Congress and the EPA ought to stop pushing ethanol. Pruitt shares our dislike of the government's ethanol mandate, which -- mostly as a sop to farm state voters -- requires that refiners mix increasingly large percentages of biofuels into gasoline. \Trump also could embrace an option that would simultaneously benefit the environment and reduce costs to the taxpayer and the economy. It's an idea long favored by his nominee for secretary of state, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson: a carbon tax. \By raising the costs of fuels according to the damage they do, this remedy would use market forces to get the biggest bang for the buck. By creating tangible incentives, it would eliminate the need for the government's tangle of renewable-fuel subsidies, fuel economy requirements and gimmicks meant to alter how people behave. \Harvard's Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, has explained how proponents want ""to put a price on carbon and incentivize people to reduce carbon emissions through a variety of different channels, allowing individuals to figure out what's the best way to do that. Is it best to drive smaller cars? Is it best to carpool to work? Is it best to move closer to work? Is it best to commit to public transportation?"" \The funds collected could be used to cut other taxes -- corporate or individual -- so there is no change in the total tax burden. That would enhance the benefits to the overall economy even as it reduces the federal role in our lives. \Many presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, are remembered long after for their achievements in preserving and protecting air, water, wildlife and wild places. The incumbent has made some valuable contributions. Trump would be wise to focus not on dismantling Obama's legacy but on building his own."
113,"
URBANA -- An internal carbon tax for big energy users and a shorter timeline for reaching ""carbon neutrality"" are two possibilities outlined in a draft climate action plan for the University of Illinois.
\
The Urbana campus is updating its 2010 Illinois Climate Action Plan, created to fulfill its goal of becoming ""carbon neutral"" by 2050 -- emitting no net carbon emissions into the atmosphere. It committed to that goal when it signed the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment in 2008.
\
The new draft calls for a feasibility study in 2015-16 to see if the campus can become carbon neutral 15 years earlier, by 2035.
\
""The developments of the past five years in climate science, and the fact that we are already experiencing the troubling effects of climate change, provide a new sense of urgency for tackling the climate challenge,"" the draft says.
\
The campus will take comments through Sunday on the draft plan to allow the public to weigh in on the proposed goals, said co-author Ben McCall, associate director at the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment.
\
Like the 2010 plan, the new draft includes benchmark goals in areas such as energy, transportation and research, and steps to achieve them through conservation efforts, a move toward renewable energy, increased recycling and sustainable landscapes. Those steps include caps on campus growth, new building standards for construction and renovations, and reductions in waste headed to landfills.
\
The new draft is more detailed, with SMART -- ""specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound,"" -- objectives, said co-author Morgan Johnston, associate director of sustainability at UI Facilities and Services.
\
Some projects in the 2010 plan didn't work out, such as a controversial wind turbine, which was deemed too costly and opposed by Urbana neighbors.
\
But others have been more successful. A Campus Bike Center is thriving, a solar-energy installation is expected to come on line by next fall, and a pilot composting project at the Sustainable Student Farm turns 100 gallons of food waste per week into ""great fertile soil,"" Johnston said.
\
The campus has reduced its overall carbon footprint by 12.1 percent since the first Climate Action Plan, officials said.
\
The new draft calls for studying an internal tax on campus units to offset their carbon dioxide emissions, as 29 leading American corporations have started to do in anticipation of future carbon regulations.
\
Adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere imposes costs on the community in the form of climate change, increased severe-weather events and a rise in sea levels, the report said. Those costs are estimated at up to $61 per ton of carbon dioxide. Cornell University is considering a $20-to-$30-per-ton charge on utility bills.
\
Currently, there's no cost associated with carbon-dioxide emissions from the combustion of coal and gas at Abbott Power Plant, the report said.
\
""As a result, the campus has no economic incentive to shift towards renewable-energy sources (unless they happen to be less expensive). Having an internal price on carbon emissions would help to tip the balance in decision-making in favor of renewable energy, thereby helping to avoid future regulatory costs associated with emissions,"" the report said.
\
The money could be used to fund other projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it said.
\
Another addition in the plan is in the agricultural area -- converting 50 acres of the South Farms to ""agroforestry,"" essentially planting trees rather than crops, she said
\
The campus will never reduce its carbon emissions to zero, but it can offset them by taking steps like planting trees, which absorb carbon dioxide, she said.
\
Students and faculty at an international research university will always need to travel abroad, which produces airplane emissions, Johnston said.
\
""For those, it will be important to have sequestration that will pull it back out of the air,"" she said.
\
Starting last fall, six Sustainability Working Advisory Teams reviewed the 2010 goals and put together progress reports and recommendations. Their input was combined with comments from dozens of specialty faculty and staff to create the working draft. An iCAP working group approved it for review.
\
Ultimately, it has to be adopted by the campus Sustainability Council, which includes high-level administrators, and approved by Chancellor Phyllis Wise. The council meets on May 29.
\
Funding remains an ongoing issue. So far it's been developed ""project by project,"" Johnston said.
\
The Campus Bike Center was initially supported by the Student Sustainability Committee, which allocates student sustainability fee money, but it's now supported by direct campus funding, she said.
\
The cities of Champaign and Urbana and the C-U Mass Transit District joined the UI to fund the community Zipcar program.
\
And the campus has received about $12 million in energy-efficiency grants from the state and the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation.
\
The campus has earned several high-level awards for its work on sustainability from government and environmental groups. Awareness and participation has also grown tremendously, Johnston said, ""which really helps drive a culture of being good stewards of the environment and our resources.""

In a recent guest commentary, Urbana Alderman Charlie Smyth mentioned a carbon tax or tradable carbon credits would be good ways to reduce greenhouse emissions and better for raising revenue. I agree. But from talking with people, I have the impression that few know what these ideas mean.
\
It will cost everyone far more to let the environment degrade than to take simple steps to reduce carbon emissions, like using fluorescent bulbs and public transportation. However, real progress requires bigger shifts in energy use that only the government can organize.
\
A carbon tax is the simplest way to provide incentives to switch from carbon-dioxide-emitting technologies to less harmful ones. It would be based directly on the actual net environmental harm produced by different activities, and any way to reduce carbon emissions would be fairly rewarded. The revenues collected could be used to reduce income taxes.
\
Carbon taxes would be simple to collect because nearly all carbon emissions involve centralized points - like oil refineries or power plants - where the carbon flowing through can be measured.
\
Some countries use a ""cap and trade"" carbon credit system. Credits allowing institutions like power plants to emit carbon dioxide are issued, and then can be bought and sold on an open market. This provides incentives to reduce carbon use in order to sell credits.
\
One drawback of the standard cap-and-trade system is that it initially provides no incentives to reduce carbon emissions, and even rewards major polluters. The main advantage of the cap-and- trade system is political: It buys off the big polluters who otherwise tend to fight clean-air measures.
\
One way or another we have to get started on these changes soon. Now is the time to start.

115,"Kicking off her recent bus tour, Sarah Palin attended a motorcycle rally and took a deep breath. ""I love that smell of the emissions,"" she exulted.\Her comment reflected a common attitude in the Republican Party: Exhaust fumes are as American as apple pie. Cool kids don't need clean air. Arctic ice is overrated. \Republicans like Palin often compete to see who can sound most indifferent to the environment. So someone taking a different tack stands out. Mitt Romney got grief from Rush Limbaugh and others for saying, ""I believe the world is getting warmer, and I believe that humans have contributed to that."" \This is like noticing that bananas are yellow. Mainstream scientists have said the same thing for a long time. But the consensus has spread. \Bjorn Lomborg, a conservative hero for his 2001 book ""The Skeptical Environmentalist,"" now writes: ""We have long moved on from any mainstream disagreements about the science of climate change. The crucial, relevant conversation of today is about what to do about climate change."" \In their book ""Climate of Extremes,"" published by the libertarian Cato Institute, scientists Patrick Michaels and Robert Balling Jr. assail various plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But they admit: ""Humans are implicated in the planetary warming that began around 1975. Greenhouse gases are likely to be one cause, probably a considerable one ..."" \Most GOP candidates, however, don't care. Rick Santorum dismisses such claims as ""junk science."" Michele Bachmann derides the notion that carbon dioxide could be harmful. Tim Pawlenty's campaign declined to answer when asked if he agrees with Romney. \During last year's campaign, the National Journal reported, ""Of the 20 serious GOP Senate challengers who have taken a position, 19 have declared that the science of climate change is inconclusive or flat-out incorrect."" (The exception: Mark Kirk of Illinois.) \Conservatives fear liberals will use climate change to justify heavy-handed intrusive regulation and wasteful subsidies, and they are right to worry. But that's no excuse for pretending global warming is a myth or refusing to do anything about it. It's an argument for devising cost-effective, market-based remedies that minimize bureaucratic control. \If today's Republican attitude had prevailed four decades ago, Americans would not have such vital measures as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Then, many people worried that environmentalism would strangle economic growth and personal freedom. But both have flourished. \Conservatives once understood that corporations are not entitled to foul the environment, any more than individuals have the right to dump garbage in the street. \Barry Goldwater, the 1964 GOP presidential nominee, wrote, ""When pollution is found, it should be halted at the source, even if this requires stringent government action."" As governor of California, Ronald Reagan signed major environmental bills and called for ""all-out war against the debauching of the environment."" \But modern Republicans think the environment is big enough to take care of itself. They decried President Barack Obama's moratorium on new deepwater drilling, which was imposed to prevent a repeat of last year's catastrophic spill in the Gulf of Mexico. \The Bush administration gave a green light to mountaintop coal mining, which it admitted would bury more than 700 miles of rivers in debris. They see preventing pollution as an unaffordable luxury. \But that's intellectually untenable and politically dangerous. What's more, the GOP doesn't have to surrender its principles to confront environmental reality. There is plenty of room for disagreement, for instance, about how to combat global warming. \The method most congenial to personal and economic freedom is a carbon tax. Instead of putting the government behind favored forms of energy, as the administration likes to do, it would create strong incentives for people to find their own ways to reduce emissions. \It would achieve maximum benefits at minimum cost. It could be revenue-neutral, if the receipts were used to pay for other tax cuts. \A carbon tax is hardly a liberal idea. Among its proponents are Gregory Mankiw, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, John McCain's chief economist in his presidential campaign. But Republican politicians have no interest. \During hard economic times, that approach may work. But at some point, voters will conclude that global warming and other environmental problems demand solutions. And Republicans will be left wondering why they didn't come up with any. \----------\Steve Chapman is a member of the Tribune's editorial board and blogs at chicagotribune.com/chapman. \schapman@tribune.com \Twitter @SteveChapman13"
116,"Through tight marshaling of his supporters and delegates, Sanders waged a successful fight to produce the most liberal Democratic platform in a generation. The draft platform, produced this weekend at a meeting of Clinton and Sanders delegates in Orlando, Florida, still needs to be ratified at the Democratic National Convention. And there, delegates can make amendments and change provisions. But even with that caveat, this document represents a victory for Sanders and his backers, with planks that reflect the aims of his campaign.\What did he win? Included in the new platform is his call for a $15 per hour minimum wage, Social Security expansion, a carbon tax to price its impact on the environment, tough language on Wall Street reform and antitrust, opposition to the death penalty, and a ""reasoned pathway for future legalization"" of marijuana. \-- Jamelle Bouie, Slate \The argument that the Islamic State is about to lose because it cannot contest frontal attacks by the U.S.-led coalition provides a false sense of security. ... The group is already destabilizing the weak states in the neighborhood: Its mass-casualty attack in Baghdad shows that it can achieve political reverberations through isolated attacks that are carefully planned. \Policymakers are also failing to recognize that the Islamic State's regional and global operations support independent objectives beyond the defense of its core territory in Iraq and Syria. Its recent wave of attacks in Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon were not reactions to its territorial losses, nor even a recent expansion. ... If it can weaken these states, or even get them to focus on their domestic security at the expense of the wider fight against the Islamic State, then the coalitions threatening its core terrain would fizzle. \-- Jessica Lewis McFate and Christopher Kozak, Foreign Policy"
117,"Americans are increasingly concerned about the environment and the potential dangers of climate change, yet it has been difficult to agree on what can be done to help. One promising approach is to apply the principles of behavioral economics.\Behavioral economics is an exciting new field that combines standard economics with an understanding of human psychology. From the standpoint of behavioral economics, it is important to focus on both the economic and the psychological aspects of the climate change problem.\The economic aspect has to do with people's incentives.\Neither big companies nor individual consumers are required to pay their full share of the environmental costs they impose on everyone else. This is what economists call a ""tragedy of the commons."" It works like this:\Say you have a group of dairy farmers who share a pasture. Each dairy farmer has an incentive to add cows to his herd because he obtains the benefits of the additional cows while incurring only a fraction of the damage each cow does to the pasture. But collectively, the cows ruin the pasture.\Dairy farmers need to find some way to avoid this outcome, to act collectively to limit the number of cows. One way to do this is by charging a fee for every cow that grazes in the pasture. Eventually, the cost of adding a cow outweighs the benefit of the additional milk. The result is that all dairy farmers benefit by having a pasture that is not degraded.\Climate change could turn out to be the biggest tragedy of the commons in human history. We are all contributing to climate change, but like the dairy farmers, we do not bear our full share of the costs we impose on our neighbors.\If you scale back your greenhouse gas emissions, say by turning your thermostat down in the winter, you will save some money on your energy bill. But you do not receive an appropriate bonus for the benefits you contribute to the environment. Because so many others are failing to adjust their thermostats, you do not benefit from reducing climate change -- the global equivalent of protecting a lush, green pasture.\A key behavioral problem involves the limits of our attention. We are all busy, with many things to think about, and we can't attend to everything. As a result, we often live our lives on automatic pilot. We go with the flow, leave things as they are, except if something captures our attention. Then we jump.\In the environmental domain, we rarely get attention-grabbing information about the environmental consequences of our actions. The economic benefits of reduced energy use are also less visible and less immediate than they could be. If you alter your thermostat setting, you may have a vague sense that you will save some money. But the actual cost of heating or cooling your home becomes highly salient only when that bill comes due in a month or two.\Addressing the problem\To make progress on climate change, we need to address the problem's economic and behavioral aspects.\The economic solution, which we support, is to line up incentives properly by getting prices right. The method preferred by most knowledgeable experts is a carbon tax, the equivalent of charging the dairy farmers for each cow they add to the pasture. A carbon tax not only helps solve the climate change problem, it also can be a source of revenue that could be used to lower other taxes, improve education or solve other social problems.\But imposing such a tax would be politically difficult right now. Americans have gotten accustomed to ""cheap"" gasoline. So while we wait for the political climate to change, we can get started with more palatable steps.\Greater transparency is a good beginning: Big polluters should be required to disclose their activities. Disclosure requirements improve the operation of markets and government alike. Information can be a surprisingly strong motivator.\Success story\For example, one big success story for disclosure requirements is the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, enacted by Congress in 1986 in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in the Soviet Union. This law seemed to be merely a bookkeeping measure, requiring firms to report what pollutants they were releasing.\Yet without requiring companies to change their behavior, the law has had dramatic beneficial effects, spurring large reductions in toxic releases throughout the United States. A major reason is that environmental groups and the media have drawn attention to the worst offenders, producing a kind of ""environmental blacklist."" Companies hate being on that list.\In the spirit of this law, we suggest that the government immediately create a Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GGI), requiring disclosure by the most significant emitters. The GGI would permit people to see the various sources of greenhouse gases in the United States and to track changes over time. Interested groups, including the media, would draw attention to the largest emitters.\Helping households\But companies are not the only sources of greenhouse gases: Individuals are polluters too. To help households become more environmentally friendly, we should draw people's attention, each day, to how much energy they have used.\As with most things, the details matter immensely. Consider the inventive efforts of Southern California Edison.\Early attempts to notify people of their energy use with e-mails and text messages did no good. What worked was to give people something called an Ambient Orb, a little ball that glows red when people are using lots of energy, but green when their use is modest. In a period of weeks, users of the orb reduced their energy consumption during peak times by 40 percent!\In the same vein, a design firm, DIY Kyoto (based on the Kyoto Protocol, the international effort to control emissions of greenhouse gases), now sells the Wattson, a device that shows energy use. It even allows you to transmit the data to social networking Web sites such as Facebook, thus permitting comparisons with Wattson users elsewhere.\It's not clear how many of us actually want to make our energy use public, and we don't think it should be required. But if people want to get into a kind of competition to conserve more, who could object?\Making it eco-easy\Another promising direction for improving energy use is to make it easier for people to be good citizens while still on automatic pilot. Consider just one example. In some hotel rooms, guests are required to insert their room key card into a slot by the door to turn on the lights and air conditioning. When they leave the room and take their key, the lights and AC are automatically turned off. Wouldn't it be nice if your home were similarly equipped, so you could flip one switch as you leave home and turn out all the lights but not the clocks?\If we can find ways to make energy use visible, and make it easier to be good citizens without thinking too much about it, we'll encourage people to protect the environment without mandating anything at all. Sometimes, people just need a nudge.\----------\Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein teach at the University of Chicago.

118," While the question of global warming was settled years ago for all but a few holdouts in the scientific community, the landmark report delivered Friday by a global network of scientists created new certainties: Climate change will remain a potent force in politics, business and, of course, weather for generations to come.\ Drier conditions in the U.S. Southwest, more rainfall in the Pacific Northwest and New England, less snowpack in the Rocky Mountains, and an increased incidence of hurricanes or flooding along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines are among the weather patterns foreseen over the remainder of this century.\ The Midwest is one of the few regions of this country for which the impact of climate change remains uncertain. That's because a low- flying jetstream that carries moisture from the Gulf of Mexico tends to minimize other effects.\ The findings, by the United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for the first time declared a 90 percent certainty that human activity--chiefly the addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere--contributed to a rise in temperatures in the last 50 years.\ Even if governments would act immediately to force drastic cuts in greenhouse emissions, the gases already in the atmosphere will continue to raise temperatures through the rest of this century and beyond, the report states.\ With events such as Hurricane Katrina, recent heat waves in Europe, last week's heavy flooding in Indonesia and the floods last fall on the East Coast as backdrops, the report may serve as a watershed for politicians and business people and a public that is just starting to come to grips with the consequences of rising temperatures.\ ""The fact that the evidence keeps mounting has an effect on people's perceptions,"" said Linda Mearns, a lead author of the report who heads the study of society and the environment for the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""In the U.S., at least, since we haven't had a lot of clear leadership from the top, it has created more opportunity for grass-roots efforts.""\ One such example: mayors of Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and more than 300 other U.S. cities have committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\ Movement in U.S.\ With both houses of Congress in Democratic hands, hearings on Capitol Hill will take on a new urgency. That's an about-face since 2001, the last time the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report.\ This time around, committees in the House and Senate seem intent on taking up such issues as reducing gas emissions, both by promoting investment in so-called clean technologies and perhaps even by limiting, or ""capping,"" the amount of carbon dioxide that power companies, manufacturers and other industries may produce.\ The U.S. response will be watched closely in foreign capitals. Already, French President Jacques Chirac has threatened a ""carbon tax"" on imports from the U.S. if the American government does not sign the Kyoto climate treaty.\ Regardless of what happens in Washington, business already is moving. Huge losses arising from recent extreme weather is only the latest example of the ways in which climate change is creating new risks for businesses. Droughts, rising sea levels, health epidemics and other factors associated with global warming have affected businesses ranging from agricultural companies to airlines.\ The insurance industry, in particular, has sought to make businesses more aware of the effects of climate change.\ ""The entire insurance industry is figuring out how to commercialize global warming,"" said Peter Breitstone, chief executive of the environmental services group at Chicago-based insurer Aon Corp.\ Aon has formed teams in the U.S. and Europe to educate clients about risks associated with global warming. Other financial services companies have begun telling their clients about investments in companies likely to benefit from new, stricter environmental laws.\ Consulting firms are helping manufacturers identify ways in which companies that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases could earn energy credits with investments such as ecologically responsible landfills in South America.\ Carmakers have placed a new emphasis on developing dual-fuel cars, while BP and other oil companies have begun refashioning themselves as eco-friendly investors in ethanol and other newer sources of energy.\ Business and political activities likely will take on new urgency because the report was so unequivocal about effects of climate change. Warmer days and nights were declared ""virtually certain,"" while increased extreme heat and heavy rainfall were 90 percent certain.\ Opening salvo\ The report is only the opening step this year of the UN- commissioned study group that was formed in 1988 to assess the source of rising temperatures around the world. A report scheduled for April will consider how the weather changes affect plant and animal life, erosion, droughts and other impacts. A May treatise will discuss what actions governments might take.\ The IPCC includes scientists and government officials from 113 countries. To develop the report, the climate scientists ran massive computer programs broken down into 23 different modeling groups that enabled the researchers to cross-reference projections using historic data and climate conditions from around the globe.\ The data offered last week were more precise--and in some cases, less dramatic--than projections raised in 2001.\ The group predicted temperatures rising between 3.2 degrees and 7.1 degrees by the end of this century. Sea levels should rise between 7 and 23 inches, the report says.\ The results are fraught with scientific and political implications. Researchers who participated in the study insisted politics did not trump science, despite last-minute maneuvering over the final few weeks.\ ""The science doesn't get changed,"" said Richard Somerville, a lead author from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California.\ The data remained intact though the report is ""probably the most scrutinized, detailed document of its kind in history,"" he added.\ ----------\ dgreising@tribune.com"

The paragraph on national security in her webpage says: ""We need to aggressively respond against ISIS but without significant numbers of American troops in Syria and Iraq or elsewhere.""\She thinks this requires ""infantry in large numbers,"" but Arab countries can supply those men.\Really? A person who has not spent one day in the Army has an opinion on how to defeat ISIS. Obama, who is a complete dilatant of war, thinks his aggressive response; his inept air campaign will destroy ISIS. It won't.\Air campaigns are used to soften up an opponent in preparation for the land campaign. Ground troops have to be deployed to win wars. There are no wars that have been won with air only.\The idea of using Arab troops is equally worthless. Like Egypt is going to clear Syria of ISIS. Sure, they are probably massing troops now.\Obama screwed up by pulling troops out of Iraq and caused this mess. Now he has slowly trickled 6,000 back in. The right way is to send 100,000 back and launch an offensive to annihilate ISIS in Iraq and Syria. It would take four weeks once they are in place.\Trust me I know. I was in the offensive that destroyed the Iraqi Army in Kuwait in 1991 in four days, and also in Baghdad in 2007 when the Surge wiped out the insurgency in a few months.\People seeking office who don't serve in the military should refrain from forming opinions about military campaigning by themselves. The same goes for practicing medicine.\Harold Knudsen\Arlington Heights\Teacher preparation key in fighting bias\Recent news about a Yale University research study shows eye-opening results about implicit bias. The study found by tracking teachers' eye movements that preschool teachers (both African-American and Caucasian) tend to expect young African-American boys to misbehave.\As education professors at National Louis University who prepare budding early childhood educators, we believe it is important to keep in mind that early educators need support in understanding the family and community context of young children's lives, as this may relate to child behaviors, especially when the teacher and child are of a different race.\This is why we thread culturally relevant pedagogy through all of our coursework, supporting our teacher candidates through deep reflection focusing on both the academic and socio-emotional learning of young children.\In teacher preparation programs, it's important to develop new teachers' cultural competence as an important way to acknowledge the home and community culture of both our teacher candidates and the children they will soon be teaching.\We do this by integrating cultural experiences, values and understandings into the teaching and learning environment. Guiding our teacher candidates to examine their philosophies and belief systems about teaching and learning helps the candidates become self-aware, non-judgmental, and inclusive of the cultural diversity of their future students.\It is possible for preschool teachers to become aware of their biases in an attempt to conquer them if they understand the importance of knowing their children and families, create child-centered environments that respect diversity, and communicate high expectations for all young learners.\We also need ongoing professional development for all early educators that addresses cultural competence and anti-bias approaches to teaching to assure that the youngest among us grow in all areas of development.\High-quality teachers make a difference in the early years; the first five years last a lifetime.\Ayn Keneman\Wheeling"
120,"Fuel conservation\Columnist Steve Chapman writes that if cars got better gas mileage, it would not help reduce gas consumption because people would drive more, canceling out gains obtained from improved vehicles (""A wrong turn on fuel conservation,"" Commentary, July 22).\Not quite. If cars of the future had significantly better fuel economy of 25 percent or more over today's cars, there would be reduced gas consumption given that personal driving habits are affected by factors other than fuel availability alone. There are only so many hours in the day, and people have family, business and other obligations that limit time available to motor about.\The development of fuel-efficient cars is worth a try. Increased fuel efficiency in the 1980s and '90s improved gas mileage significantly over that delivered by cars of the '70s; there is no reason why that cannot be done again.\Hybrid technology can help achieve this goal. Some reports say hybrid cars can achieve 50 to 60 miles per gallon. Responsible federal policy would help spur development of this technology by setting significantly higher standards sooner rather than later.\President Jimmy Carter tried to spur the country to fuel conservation in the '70s, but no one was ready. With the potential for $5 per gallon at the pump staring us in the face and global warming threatening to destroy the environment, we should be more than ready now. The country cries for a more economically sensible and environmentally friendly energy policy.\Donald R. Sutherland\Glen Ellyn\Paying for gas\Regarding Steve Chapman's recent column ""A wrong turn on fuel conservation,"" I agree for the most part. However, he states, ""A carbon tax or a higher gasoline tax would encourage every motorist, not just those with new vehicles, to burn less fuel -- by taking the bus, carpooling, telecommuting, resorting to that free mode of transit known as walking, or buying a Prius.""\I disagree.\I think there is a significant number of auto owners out there who do not care one iota about the cost of fuel, and would be willing and able to pay any additional costs for fuel and would continue to use the gas-guzzlers.\Karl De Jonge\Morton Grove\Plug-in hybrids\A recent study by the Electric Power Research Institute together with the Natural Resources Defense Council concludes that plug-in hybrid automobiles could, by the year 2050, contribute greatly to reduction of greenhouse gases and oil consumption.\No doubt true, but there are a few bothersome details. The study estimates that plug-in hybrids would need a 60 percent market share to achieve the most ambitious goals.\Next, what is the ratio of urban vehicles to suburban and rural vehicles? I suspect that the number of urban vehicles, which do not have overnight access to an electric power source, is enormous.\Then we have the higher price of hybrids with their more limited carrying capacity plus expensive battery replacement.\Beyond all that, what about the power cost of daily recharging?\A plug-in hybrid owner may save on gasoline expense, but the increase in the electric bill could cause cardiac arrest.\James R. Schaefer\Mt. Prospect\Drunk-driving penalties\In light of the disregard for laws with so many accidents and killings by drunks, I propose the following draconian measures:\- Drivers who are arrested and test .8 or higher will have their vehicle impounded.\- Upon conviction, the vehicle will be crushed and returned to the drunk's place of residence. Car ownership is not an issue.\- All costs of towing, impounding and crushing will be paid by the drunk.\- There will be a $1,000 fine.\- All driving privileges will be revoked for life.\- Pictures of the drunk and the crushed vehicle will be published as an ad in three local and regional newspapers paid for by the drunk.\Larry Olson\Arlington Heights"

122,"The COVID-19 pandemic and recent climate disasters have hammered home the reality that nations are powerless to confront today's global challenges alone. These crises require unifying national leadership and global collaboration rooted in a recognition of the science. \Climate policy in America has stalled because of a misunderstanding of the threat, partisanship and disagreements on what to do. International climate agreements have failed because nations that do not reduce emissions are not penalized. Meanwhile, our climate is changing rapidly and as a result we are experiencing more intense natural disasters (or rather unnatural disasters because of our impact on the climate). But if the United States chooses to sit out climate policy, we not only risk careening into an irreversible climate crisis, we also yield enormous influence over the global policy agenda to other powers.\China is seizing that opportunity: President Xi Jinping recently announced that China intends to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. The United States can still step up. Our research shows that U.S. climate action could lead to global climate action even without an international climate agreement.\By combining domestic climate policy with climate-based foreign policy, the U.S. can mobilize coalitions toward climate action while rebuilding the global economy.\There are two key steps: First, pass a carbon tax and dividend bill that unifies national support around a common goal during a historically divisive time. Then, form a ""global climate compact"" of nations committed to reducing carbon emissions by penalizing inaction. This can be a new start where America brings nations together to collaboratively transition to a sustainable future.\Step one: The U.S. Congress would pass a carbon tax and dividend plan before the end of 2021, putting a price of $25 on every metric ton of CO2. The tax would be collected at the source (a petroleum well head or coal mine), causing the price of carbon-based products to increase slightly. Gasoline at the pump would cost about 25 cents more per gallon. The tax would increase each year until 2030.\The government would not spend the revenue, but return every cent, except tax collection costs, to adult citizens in equal amounts every quarter. For about two-thirds of Americans, the dividends would exceed the carbon taxes embedded in their purchases, providing them with a net cash bonus at a time when many are struggling. The poorest would receive close to three times more than what they pay in carbon taxes.\This plan pushes consumption away from fossil fuels, as consumers shift to lower- or zero-carbon substitutes. Rising demand for these products would unlock the creative power of inventors, researchers and industrialists to develop sustainable solutions for a livable climate.\This approach is equitable, would create jobs and protect the environment through a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery -- all without new government expenditures or expansion. Its simplicity would ensure transparency and prevent revenue from being diverted. While other policies are also needed, the carbon tax is the single most effective action the U.S. can take to move toward net-zero emissions by 2050.\Step two: A global climate compact would ensure that countries act jointly and aggressively to reduce carbon emissions. This approach is proposed by professor William Nordhaus of Yale Universityin his recent article in Foreign Affairs, ""The Club Approach."" He describes why the Kyoto protocol and Paris agreement have failed: Countries sign on, do little, incur few costs yet reap climate benefits from other countries' emission reductions.\Nordhaus demonstrates an alternative through his analysis. Countries determined to fight climate change would band together by placing an agreed minimum price on carbon along with penalty tariffs on countries that fail to do so. Free riding is no longer free. The compact would grow. By leading the global climate compact, the U.S. will ensure its economic competitiveness and technological dynamism while restoring collaboration and stability in a dividing world.\In ""The Strategic Case for U.S. Climate Leadership,"" George Shultz, James Baker and Ted Halstead argue that countries pioneering transformative carbon-replacing technology will become the world-leading technology powers and set the new rules of the game that will govern global trade. Carbon pricing mechanisms are emerging around the world and could end up penalizing U.S. inaction. If it does not lead, the U.S. may be compelled to follow the rules others make.\The window of opportunity for the U.S. to step up is rapidly narrowing. This plan calls for the U.S. to lead global climate policy and assist in uniting a divided world to protect our shared home.\----------\Roy Wehrle is emeritus professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Springfield; Don Wuebbles is the Harry E.

123,"When it comes to cutting carbon, what's old, it seems, is new again.\Exelon Corp. executives are using terms like ""cap and trade"" and ""carbon tax"" in describing how they think Illinois should lower its carbon footprint in anticipation of the Environmental Protection Agency's bid to cut greenhouse gases from power plants. \At its first public presentation to Illinois regulators last week, Exelon Corp.'s remarks were brief. \The Chicago-based parent company of Commonwealth Edison presented just three slides that explained how a more than $10-per-ton tax on carbon pollution could aid the company's financially flailing nuclear plants. \""There are a number of factors causing this -- which include low natural gas prices and wind subsidies -- but chief among them is the absence of market mechanisms to value the carbon-free nature of nuclear power,"" said Kathleen Barron, senior vice president of federal and regulatory affairs and wholesale market policy for Exelon. \Asked to clarify Exelon's position, Barron told the Tribune: ""It's not that different from the basic premise of cap and trade. There could be a carbon tax that just taxes the sources of pollution."" \If it sounds familiar, it should. \John Rowe, who retired in 2012 as Exelon's chief executive, spent much of his 28-year utility-running career pushing for legislation that would create a national market for carbon pollution. That effort flamed out in 2010. \Last week, Rowe, 69, told the Tribune we could be looking at Cap and Trade 2.0. ""These things don't really go away,"" Rowe said. ""Old wine gets put into new bottles."" \Many would like to see that old wine poured down the drain. \NRG Energy, which owns four coal plants in the state, has said that voluntarily switching inefficient coal-burning plants to natural gas, augmented by developing renewable energy such as wind and solar power and reducing energy consumption, will lower carbon pollution enough to meet mandates. \Environmental groups say money spent on energy projects should go toward renewables and energy efficiency, not ""technology that powered the past."" \For Rowe, the journey to see federal regulation of greenhouse gases began in the early 1990s, when he was president and chief executive of the New England Electric System. \""This must be a clarion call, not for more bureaucracy or regulation or unnecessary costs, but instead for American ingenuity and creativity, to produce the best and most energy-efficient technology,"" he said in 1993 at a climate conference in Washington. \In 2003, when then-U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sponsored ill-fated legislation that would have set up a national ""cap and trade"" market for carbon patterned after the 1990 system that limited sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain, Rowe told the Tribune that he thought the pollutants should be taxed, even if it meant increased costs for consumers. \""I think the climate change problem is real,"" he said. \By 2008, all three presidential contenders favored some form of cap and trade. A trading arrangement seemed so inevitable that Time magazine hailed Chicago Climate Exchange founder Richard Sandor as a hero of the environment for his foresight in founding an exchange for voluntary carbon trading. \The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap and trade system for power plant CO2 emissions, began auctioning emissions permits in 2008. \At the time, the total trading volume for carbon products worldwide was 2.7 billion metric tons valued at $60 billion. A U.S. cap and trade plan, experts said at the time, would triple that market. \By 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a cap and trade plan that would require companies to buy an allowance, or permit, which could be bought and sold for each ton of carbon emitted, priced at $13 to $20 per ton. \But by 2010, cap and trade had collapsed politically. It hit its high-water mark with House passage of the so-called Waxman-Markey bill. But in the wake of a national recession, the proposal couldn't escape its label as a ""jobs killer."" \Shortly thereafter, the Chicago Climate Exchange quietly ceased. Only those with mandated exchanges like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and California continue to trade in carbon. \But at least one proponent of the concept hasn't given up. \""I think when you take a state like Illinois, with all its attention deficit problems and revenue problems, a modest carbon tax would be a wonderful way to try to comply with the EPA rules,"" Rowe reiterated last week. He said the taxes generated could be used to fund education or pensions. \It stands to reason that Exelon would favor taxing carbon emissions. Its six nuclear plants in Illinois don't emit carbon, while such a tax would hit competitors whose plants burn coal and natural gas. \Exelon's nuclear plants, along with others, are struggling to compete. A carbon tax or cap and trade plan looks more like a lifeline. The EPA estimates that 6 percent of the 100 nuclear reactors in the United States are threatened with closing. \The EPA's aggressive goals of 30 percent greenhouse gas reductions from 2005 levels by 2030 give states like Illinois an incentive to keep Exelon's nuclear plants in the state open. \Exelon's Barron told regulators last week that about 43 percent of Exelon's nuclear generation is at risk. \The EPA's so-called carbon rule gives states any number of ways to comply with the proposed law. Illinois can choose to go it alone or team with other states on a regional approach. \That would buy Illinois more time and save the Midwest region an estimated $3 billion annually in compliance costs, according to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which controls the part of the electrical grid that includes most of Illinois. \Exelon said it supports a ""regional"" approach to cutting carbon, a major contributor to greenhouse gases and climate change, saying it believes it would be cheaper for consumers if states work together within their regional transmission organizations. \Barron said she envisions carbon taxes collected from sources of pollution and credited back to customers. That, she said, would help offset the inevitable expense that would come as coal plants shut down, switch to natural gas or pass along the costs associated with those taxes to consumers. \David Brown, senior vice president of federal government affairs at Exelon, said most of the utility sector would have preferred a national approach to the varied cap-and-tradelike plans that may arise out of the carbon rule. \He said he can imagine a ""slim"" chance the utility sector will join forces to return to Capitol Hill for legislation that beckons the return of a plan similar to Waxman-Markey. \The question remains -- is Illinois ready to return to the days of cap and trade? \Rowe said he expects that states won't be ready to jump on board just yet. Maybe they would, he said, five years from now. \""We can't help ourselves. We're America,"" he said. ""If there's an expensive way to solve the problem, we try that first."" \---------- \jwernau@tribune.com \Twitter @littlewern\Credit: By Julie Wernau, Tribune reporter"
124,"Climate challenge\Thanks to Steve Chapman for shining a light on presidential candidate Ted Cruz's rank dishonesty about climate change. \Too bad Cruz is not alone in his shameful disrespect for not only this nation's scientists, but also for the health, wealth and well-being of the nation's children, who would bear the debt of a climate out of control. Many of Cruz's fellow GOP candidates are similarly pandering to know-nothings and lobbyists who oppose sensible climate policy. \Fortunately, there are thoughtful conservatives who can see through the smoke and mirrors of the climate deniers. Recently, 11 congressional Republicans, including Illinois Rep. Robert Dold, signed onto a resolution that recognizes the reality of human-caused global warming and demands that Congress develop solutions. At the same time, a small group of Senate Republicans, including Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, formed a working group that proposes constructive action on climate change. \Chapman also calls for a revenue-neutral carbon tax as an equitable and efficient way to drive the transition away from fossil energy. The nonpartisan Citizens' Climate Lobby has been working quietly with lawmakers from both parties to build political will for a similar approach. We recommend taking all of the carbon fees collected from coal, oil and gas producers and routing it right back to taxpayers in the form of an equal per-capita ""carbon dividend."" A study commissioned by CCL found that in 20 years it would cut emissions by 52 percent while actually creating 2.8 million extra jobs, and two-thirds of American households would get more in dividends than they pay in higher energy prices. \Now that the U.S. and 195 other nations have signed an agreement for a brighter energy future, it's time to roll up our sleeves and work across party lines for a common-sense solution to the climate challenge. \-- Rick Knight, Brookfield \A fair debate \While Steve Chapman indicted Ted Cruz as a global warming denier, he mentioned ""an overwhelming scientific consensus that human activities are heating up Earth."" But last year The Wall Street Journal published a piece by meteorologist Roy Spencer about the 97-percent consensus myth. You can Google many other scientists who are skeptical of global warming. The real fraud is caused by those who talk about science as a consensus or vote. \Later in the article, Chapman states the solution to the problem: a carbon tax. As if the government won't waste that money as governments have squandered taxpayer funds at all levels. Just look at unfunded public-sector pension liabilities. \Chapman seems to feel that a waitress will be happy to pay higher energy prices and taxes all for a healthy planet 100 years from now. Yet even Secretary of State John Kerry recently stated that any cuts the U.S. makes in carbon emissions cannot offset those of China, India and other developing countries. \When people say the debate is over, they just want to shut up the opposing view. However, ""deniers"" do not want to ruin the planet. We would like to have a fair debate as to what steps to take for a better environment, not have a carbon tax shoved down our throats. \-- Ken Nelson, Chicago \A round of applause \I just want to thank the industrialists, Republicans and oil company executives for their efforts in climate denial. Your work bought the time needed for climate change to progress and develop measurable temperature and sea water level increases as well as for the physical and video confirmation of glacier and ice cap shrinkage. \I believe the recent agreement in Paris would not have been possible without your effort. \-- Gary Bellert, Sycamore \The two C's \It's interesting that Republicans believe in the two C's of ""concealed carry,"" but not the two C's of ""climate change."" \-- Dick Doub, Wilmette \---------- \For online exclusive letters go to www.chicagotribune.com/letters.

125,"It's been less than four months since California committed to getting all of its electricity from climate-friendly sources by 2045. But the idea is already catching on in other states. \At least nine governors taking their oaths of office this month, from Nevada to Michigan to New York, campaigned on 100 percent clean energy, or have endorsed the target since it was enshrined in California law.\The District of Columbia also set a 100 percent clean energy goal last month. So did Xcel Energy, a Minneapolis-based utility that serves 3.6 million electricity customers across eight Western and Midwestern states.\The policy's growing popularity is driven in part by market trends and technological advances that make it easier to envision a future in which fossil fuels are no longer burned for electricity.\But experts say California's passage of Senate Bill 100 is also playing a role.\""Sometimes other states don't want to admit that they're looking to California for leadership. But they really are,"" said Carla Frisch from the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado-based think tank that has worked with cities and states on energy policy.\As the world's fifth-largest economy, California wields enormous power to influence environmental policy nationally and even globally. The state's actions have reshaped how industries do business, changed people's habits and set the agenda for other states and countries.\Automakers have been forced to build fuel-efficient cars for decades because of California's authority to set tailpipe-emission rules stricter than those of the federal government.\The Golden State's aggressive policies can also prompt a backlash. In the four-plus years since California lawmakers voted to ban single-use plastic bags at most stores, nine states have passed laws blocking local governments from enacting such bans.\California's role as a global leader was front of mind of then-state Sen. Kevin de Leon as he crafted the 100 percent climate-friendly energy legislation. The Los Angeles Democrat had previously written a bill raising the state's clean energy target to 50 percent by 2030.\But within a few years, it had become clear the state could meet that goal far sooner than expected, without the massive economic disruption opponents had predicted.\""California has long shown the rest of the nation how to protect the environment while growing the economy,"" De Leon said. ""If California can do it, everyone else can.""\What's unique about 100 percent clean energy, supporters say, is that it's caught on with lawmakers and the public in a way other climate change policies haven't.\Many economists say a market-based tool that puts a price on planet-warming carbon emissions is the cheapest way to fight climate change. But even in places with broad support for climate action, it's been difficult to build support for those types of policies. Voters in Washington state overwhelmingly rejected a carbon tax in 2016 and again in 2018.\Adam Browning, executive director of the Oakland-based advocacy group Vote Solar, cited a common refrain among climate advocates -- that the only two problems with a carbon tax are ""carbon"" and ""tax."" Nobody likes taxes, and most people don't have strong feelings about carbon.\A 100 percent clean energy policy, is simple and focused on positive change, Browning said. Supporters can highlight the potential benefits of cleaner air, job creation and cutting-edge technologies.\""It's exciting to be a part of, it speaks to values, it speaks to solutions, and it speaks to things people like. And it has overwhelming bipartisan support,"" Browning said.\The concept didn't originate in California. Hawaii became the first state to pass a 100 percent clean energy mandate in 2015, and U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, introduced federal legislation to that effect in 2017. More than 100 cities have endorsed the concept, according to the Sierra Club, as have 150 major corporations that are part of the RE100 coalition.\But in the months since California passed its clean energy mandate, the idea has gained significant political momentum.\Voters in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin elected new governors in November who signed a pledge from the League of Conservation Voters to support 100 percent clean energy by 2050. In several states, the new governors mark a dramatic shift from their predecessors.\David Bookbinder, chief counsel for the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C., described the groundswell of support for 100 percent clean energy policies as a ""political trend"" first and foremost.\""These are all governors who are Democrats, and they're all trying to be progressive. And saying '100 percent renewables' is money in the bank as far as their base is concerned,"" Bookbinder said.\The Niskanen Center encourages politicians to support a carbon tax as an economically efficient way to reduce emissions.\Still, Bookbinder described the expanding support for 100 percent clean energy as a positive development in the fight against climate change. It shows that the public is beginning to take the problem seriously, he said, and that lawmakers see ""political mileage"" in committing to ambitious climate action.\For many of the newly elected governors, it's unclear exactly what flavor of ""100 percent clean energy"" they'll ultimately seek.\At the same time, goal-setting is the easy part. When it comes to eliminating fossil fuels from electricity, the devil will be in the details -- and other states will be looking to California to see if it's really possible.\The biggest issue California needs to work out: how to move beyond natural gas, the state's largest source of electricity.\Some ideas are already being put into practice, such as batteries that store solar power for nighttime use, geothermal plants that generate clean energy around the clock and time-varying electricity rates that encourage people to use energy at different times of day.\But it's not yet clear how those policies and technologies will fit together, or how quickly California can radically reduce its use of gas.\CAPTION: Photo: What's unique about 100 percent clean energy, supporters say, is it has caught on in a way other climate policies haven't.

126,"Climate change is a real, perilous phenomenon that the planet would be foolish to ignore. Given that, the vexing question has always been, how do we sensibly protect our environment without manacling our energy-driven economy? \Trouble is, this country has gravitated toward fuel economy standards for vehicles when a simpler, easier to administer option awaits. More on that in a moment.\President Donald Trump is gearing up a rollback of those fuel economy standards. By exactly how much isn't known yet, but this is a direct hit on former President Barack Obama's preferred method of cutting tailpipe emissions as one way to curtail global warming.\Obama's plan forced carmakers to, by 2025, ramp up the average fuel efficiency of new light trucks and cars to more than 50 miles per gallon in lab settings, or roughly 36 mpg in real-world driving. It brought the rest of the country in line with the tough fuel economy standards California enforces.\The Trump administration says the rollback will free carmakers from regulations that have kept them from producing more affordable vehicles. California, said Trump's Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, ""shouldn't and can't dictate to the rest of the country what these levels are going to be."" We often disagree with Pruitt, but here he has a point. If California wants to enforce tougher fuel efficiency standards, by all means, Sacramento, be our guest. But not as a mandate affecting drivers in Illinois and other states.\California won't surrender easily to Washington. It has the power to enforce stricter air pollution standards thanks to a special waiver granted under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Twelve other states adhere to California's stronger standards; taken together, California & Friends represent about a third of the nation's vehicle market. The state's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has said if the Trump administration tries to revoke California's waiver, his state will fight back. ""We're not looking to pick a fight with the Trump administration,"" Becerra says, ""but when they threaten our values, we're ready.""\It remains to be seen how Trump will handle the California conundrum. He could revoke California's waiver, which likely would yield a protracted court fight. If he takes no action, the waiver will expire in 2025. In the meantime, carmakers would have to choose between producing two distinct lines of cars to meet the different fuel standards -- the federal government's and California's -- or adhering to California's stricter standards. In a prepared statement Monday, the EPA said the California waiver ""is still being re-examined"" by the agency.\Because they're aimed more at manufacturers than at motorists, fuel efficiency standards are an inefficient means to reach a good end: less gasoline consumption.\Trump instead would be smart to embrace a different, smarter idea this page has advocated for some time:\A carbon tax imposed on fuel production would give consumers a choice: Want to save money and the environment? Fine, then consume less fuel than you do today. Prefer your gas-guzzling SUV? OK, but you'll pay more for every gallon. And if your state wants even more stringent efforts to depress fuel consumption -- are you listening, California? -- state lawmakers could add a state-based carbon levy to the federal tax.\Think about it this way: Fuel standards complicate life for automakers trying to appease government regulators as well as their own customers. A carbon tax puts the onus on drivers to conserve -- or pay.\CAPTION: Photo: (Customer pumps gas into his dual-tank pickup truck) GRANT HINDSLEY/AP"
127,"Just as John F. Kennedy set his sights on the moon, Al Gore is challenging the nation to produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind, sun and other Earth-friendly energy sources within 10 years, an audacious goal he hopes the next president will embrace.\The Nobel Prize-winning former vice president said fellow Democrat Barack Obama and Republican rival John McCain are ""way ahead"" of most politicians in the fight against global climate change.\Rising fuel costs, climate change and the national security threats posed by U.S. dependence on foreign oil are conspiring to create ""a new political environment"" that Gore said will sustain bold and expensive steps to wean the nation off fossil fuels.\""I have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one that's emerging now,"" Gore told The Associated Press in an interview previewing a speech on global warming he planned to give Thursday in Washington.\In his speech, Gore said some of the nation's biggest success stories have come from making commitments to goals well beyond the next election, citing the Marshall plan for rebuilding Europe, Social Security and the interstate highway system, in addition to putting a man on the moon.\""A political promise to do something 40 years from now is universally ignored because everyone knows that's meaningless,"" he said. ""Ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target.""\He said it also coincides with experts' predictions that unless dramatic changes to reduce global warming pollution are made within the next decade, ""our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis"" may be lost.\Gore said the single most important policy change would be placing a carbon tax on burning oil and coal.\The Alliance for Climate Protection, a bipartisan group he leads, estimates the cost of transforming the U.S. to clean electricity sources at $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion over 30 years in public and private money.\Called an alarmist by conservatives, Gore has made global warming his signature issue. He portrayed Thursday's speech as the latest and most important phase in his effort to build public opinion in favor of alternative fuels.\Gore knows politicians fear action unless voters are willing to sacrifice -- and demand new fuels.\""I hope to contribute to a new political environment in this country that will allow the next president to do what I think the next president is going to think is the right thing to do,"" Gore said. ""But the people have to play a part."" He compared his challenge to Kennedy's pledge in May 1961 to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade.\- - -\Lone Star power\Texas officials gave preliminary approval Thursday to the nation's largest wind-power project, a plan to build billions of dollars worth of new transmission lines to bring wind energy from gusty West Texas to urban areas.\Texas is already the national leader in wind power, and supporters say Thursday's move by the Public Utility Commission will make the Lone Star State a leader in moving energy to the urban areas to consume it. [ ap ]\- - -\Electric slide\Al Gore's proposal would represent a significant shift in where the U.S. gets its power.

128,"
URBANA -- New energy standards for building projects, fewer car trips and air travel, and the purchase of ""carbon offsets"" to meet emission goals are all part of the 2015 climate action plan at the University of Illinois.
\
The Urbana campus has updated its 2010 Illinois Climate Action Plan, created to fulfill the goal of becoming ""carbon neutral"" by 2050 -- emitting no net carbon emissions into the atmosphere. The campus committed to that goal when it signed the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment in 2008.
\
The 2015 version of the plan, released this week, calls for studying the feasibility of moving that goal up by 15 years, to 2035.
\
""The developments of the past five years in climate science, and the fact that we are already experiencing the troubling effects of climate change, provide a new sense of urgency for tackling the climate challenge,"" the report says.
\
Among its 47 objectives, the 2015 plan calls for:
\
-- Expanding the purchase of clean energy and explore moving to ""100 percent clean"" energy through the use of wind, solar and biofuels.
\
-- Lowering emissions from campus vehicles and possibly converting the fleet to renewable fuels.
\
-- Reducing air-travel emissions by 50 percent by 2025.
\
-- Incorporating the ""highest achievable energy standards"" for construction and renovation into campus standards by summer 2016.
\
-- Converting 50 acres of the South Farms to ""agroforest,"" essentially planting trees rather than crops.
\
-- Buying ""carbon offsets"" -- essentially paying for activities off campus that reduce carbon emissions, offsetting emissions from campus that can't be easily eliminated.
\
-- Studying the possibility of an internal carbon tax on individual campus units, to cover the costs to society of increased carbon emissions.
\
Like the 2010 plan, the new draft includes benchmark goals in areas such as energy, transportation and research, and steps to achieve them through conservation efforts, a move toward renewable energy, increased recycling and sustainable landscapes. The new draft is more detailed than the 2010 version, with specific objectives and deadlines.
\
""This new plan is ambitious, and it positions Illinois at the forefront of tackling the profound sustainability challenges that face humanity, including climate change and clean energy. We intend to serve as a model for campuses and communities across the world, while we also educate the next generation of sustainability leaders who can build on our campus' efforts,"" interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson said in the introduction.
\
While they require up-front investments, many of the solutions will save money in the long run, Wilson said.
\
""They are the right thing to do not only for our climate but also for the long-term financial sustainability of our campus,"" Wilson said.
\
""Given the uncertain fiscal situation of both our state and our university, we have a responsibility to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of such solutions. But we cannot afford to discard them. The costs of inaction are tremendous, as climate change threatens not only the environment but also the very future of our students,"" she said.
\
The 2010 plan has already led to a number of policy changes and results.
\
The Campus Bike Center promotes bicycle use and teaches owners how to repair their own bikes. A new solar-power installation is about to go online at First and Windsor. And the campus recently approved a policy saying it will not grow beyond its current footprint -- 21 million gross square feet of building space -- to hold down energy use.
\
""We have a lot of space on our campus that could be better utilized,"" said climate plan co-author Ben McCall, associate director at the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment.
\
The climate plan envisions cutting the UI's current energy demand at least in half by 2050.
\
The biggest impact will come from changes in energy generation and purchases, which accounts for 90 percent of the campus' carbon emissions, McCall said.
\
""What we have done really well as a campus so far has been conserving and conserving and conserving,"" he said, ""and making sure we do the best job we can to generate electricity and steam for the campus in reliable, safe and cost-effective ways.""
\
But the campus hasn't been as diligent about finding less carbon-intensive sources of energy, he said.
\
The campus is in negotiations with an Illinois vendor to buy an unspecified amount of wind power for the campus, McCall said. An earlier effort to install a wind turbine on campus was rejected because of the cost and objections from neighbors.
\
Under the plan, the goal is to produce 12,500 megawatt hours of solar electricity per year by 2020. The new solar farm is expected to provide about 7,800, and a rooftop solar project at the new Electrical and Computer Engineering Building and nearby parking garage will provide another 2,000, McCall said.
\
""There's still work to do,"" he said.
\
The campus also plans to buy its first ""carbon offsets"" by the summer of 2016.
\
""There's a recognition in this document that we're never going to be able to completely eliminate all carbon emissions,"" McCall said. ""We'd pay someone else to reduce theirs, and on the whole we have carbon neutrality.""
\
Under the carbon tax, campus units would charge themselves for carbon emissions, or use a ""shadow price"" as they make budget decisions to reflect the cost of emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, he said.
\
""A lot of our peer institutions are looking at this right now,"" McCall said.
\
The campus will present the new climate plan, and an update on its progress toward sustainability, from 1 to 4 p.m. Wednesday in Illini Room A at the Illini Union, 1401 W. Green St., U.
\
Also Wednesday, award-winning filmmaker Shalini Kantayya will share her new documentary ""Catching the Sun: The Race for the Clean Energy Future."" The film follows the lives of unemployed American workers training for jobs in the solar industry. The screening is scheduled for 5 p.m. at the National Soybean Research Center, Room 149. Afterward, Kantayya will talk about making the film and the conclusions it draws.ae

To-do list
\
Among other targets in the new Illinois Climate Action Plan:
\
* Decrease energy consumption 30 percent by 2020 through greater conservation efforts
\
* Reduce percentage of staff trips made using single-occupancy vehicles from the current 65 percent to 56 percent by 2020 and 45 percent by 2030
\
* Implement the Campus Bike Plan, with full implementation of new bikeway facilities by 2025, bike parking within 150 feet of every building in the core of campus by 2020, and bike rentals by 2020

129,"How is it possible that BP chief executive Tony Hayward hasnt been fired? At this point, how can anyone believe a word the man says? If he told me my mother loves me, Id want a second source.\Hayward has apologized for his one lapse of candor the now-famous whine that ""Id like my life back."" It must be a nice life indeed: According to Forbes, Haywards total compensation from BP in 2009 was about $4.6 million. The Louisiana fishermen whove been put out of work by the oil spill are accustomed to getting by on considerably less. In a Facebook posting, Hayward said his callous words ""dont represent how I feel about this tragedy, and certainly dont represent the hearts of the people of BP.""\Within hours, though, Haywards foot was firmly lodged in his mouth yet again. The effort to contain the oil and keep it away from the Gulf Coast has been ""very successful,"" he told the Financial Times. ""Considering how big this has been, very little has got away from us.""\This sunny assessment came as television networks broadcast images of oil-soaked Louisiana marshes, where hazmat-suited workers who said they were under orders from BP not to talk to the media, on pain of getting fired were trying to sop up the mess with what looked like rags, as if this were a gargantuan kitchen mishap. Scientists have not even begun to assess the potential long-term effects of the oil spill on human health, marine life and coastal ecology. Carol Browner, the presidents chief adviser on energy and the environment, said that the Deepwater Horizon incident is the worst environmental disaster in United States history.\Give yourself another pat on the back, Tony.\Haywards statements about the effort to plug the well have been consistently unreliable, and it hardly matters whether hes being deliberately misleading or just overly optimistic. The giant containment dome was going to work; it didnt. The second, much smaller containment dome would do the job; it was never even deployed. The ""top kill"" procedure was surely going to stop the flow, and early indications, according to Hayward, showed it was succeeding. Yet oil industry veterans such as T. Boone Pickens said the top kill was a long shot at best, and they were right.\And as for those giant underwater oil plumes that scientists keep discovering? Hayward denies they exist. His position is that of a philanderer caught in the act by an irate spouse: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?""\Since the explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig six weeks ago, BPs stock has lost more than a third of its value. Two ratings firms have downgraded the companys long-term debt, and estimates of what it will finally cost BP to stop the leak and clean up its mess range from $3 billion to $30 billion. All this happened on Haywards watch.\Somebody, please, give the man his life back.\But once thats done, lets turn our ire on the real villains. This exercise will require a mirror.\An accident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout was bound to happen sooner or later. There are nearly 4,000 oil rigs off the Gulf Coast, and those pumping most of the crude are in deep waters where, as we now know, state-of-the-art safety procedures are inadequate. President Obamas moratorium on deep-water drilling will last only long enough for some sort of technological Band-Aid to be devised. Then well crank up the drills once again.\We know that our dependence on oil is ultimately ruinous, yet we refuse to take measures a meaningful carbon tax, for example to ease it. Long after Tony Hayward answers for his sins, well be paying for our own.\How is it possible that BP chief executive Tony Hayward hasnt been fired? At this point, how can anyone believe a word the man says? If he told me my mother loves me, Id want a second source.\Hayward has apologized for his one lapse of candor the now-famous whine that ""Id like my life back.""

The effort to contain the oil and keep it away from the Gulf Coast has been ""very successful,"" he told the Financial Times. ""Considering how big this has been, very little has got away from us.""\This sunny assessment came as television networks broadcast images of oil-soaked Louisiana marshes, where hazmat-suited workers who said they were under orders from BP not to talk to the media, on pain of getting fired were trying to sop up the mess with what looked like rags, as if this were a gargantuan kitchen mishap. Scientists have not even begun to assess the potential long-term effects of the oil spill on human health, marine life and coastal ecology. Carol Browner, the presidents chief adviser on energy and the environment, said that the Deepwater Horizon incident is the worst environmental disaster in United States history.\Give yourself another pat on the back, Tony.\Haywards statements about the effort to plug the well have been consistently unreliable, and it hardly matters whether hes being deliberately misleading or just overly optimistic. The giant containment dome was going to work; it didnt. The second, much smaller containment dome would do the job; it was never even deployed. The ""top kill"" procedure was surely going to stop the flow, and early indications, according to Hayward, showed it was succeeding. Yet oil industry veterans such as T. Boone Pickens said the top kill was a long shot at best, and they were right.\And as for those giant underwater oil plumes that scientists keep discovering? Hayward denies they exist. His position is that of a philanderer caught in the act by an irate spouse: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?""\Since the explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig six weeks ago, BPs stock has lost more than a third of its value. Two ratings firms have downgraded the companys long-term debt, and estimates of what it will finally cost BP to stop the leak and clean up its mess range from $3 billion to $30 billion. All this happened on Haywards watch.\Somebody, please, give the man his life back.\But once thats done, lets turn our ire on the real villains. This exercise will require a mirror.\An accident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout was bound to happen sooner or later. There are nearly 4,000 oil rigs off the Gulf Coast, and those pumping most of the crude are in deep waters where, as we now know, state-of-the-art safety procedures are inadequate. President Obamas moratorium on deep-water drilling will last only long enough for some sort of technological Band-Aid to be devised. Then well crank up the drills once again.\We know that our dependence on oil is ultimately ruinous, yet we refuse to take measures a meaningful carbon tax, for example to ease it. Long after Tony Hayward answers for his sins, well be paying for our own."
130," Everybody talks about the IRS, but Texas Republican Congressman Bill Archer wants to do something about it. He wants to wipe it off the face of the earth.\ Archer, the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, vows to introduce legislation to abolish the IRS and replace the present system of taxing income with a tax on consumption and spending.\ ""We're not talking about tinkering with the system,"" said James Wilcox, Archer's spokesman. ""We're talking about a massive overhaul. The Ways and Means committee is currently reviewing ways to get rid of the current tax system and replace it with a fairer system.""\ Archer's plan may sound radical, but other tax reformers think it totally misses the point of tax reform.\ M. Jeff Hamond, director of fiscal policy research for Redefining Progress, says it's not fair to beat up IRS for what Congress does.\ ""It's Congress' fault,"" said Hamond, because Congress writes the mind-boggling tax laws that the IRS must enforce. ""Archer is trying to capitalize on people's hatred of the IRS.""\ For Hamond and others considering tax reform these days, the critical issue is what should be taxed.\ Hamond, whose private, non-partisan public policy institute is based in San Francisco, believes the U.S. should tax waste, not work.\ ""This is necessary because if you think of where the tax reform has gone for the last couple of decades, it pits labor against capital,"" he said.\ U.S. taxes fall heavily on work and investment, said Hamond, and the nation's economy needs both.\ ""You get less of what you tax and more of what you don't,"" Hamond pointed out. ""It makes sense to shift taxes off good things like work and innovation and onto what we want less of, like pollution and waste.""\ Hamond emphasizes that Redefining Progress is not an environmental group, but a public policy group exploring new ways to collect revenue.\ Carbon taxes, for example, would be pegged to the carbon content of fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas. Fuel prices would reflect the environmental impact of such fuel, with the highest tax rates for coal and the lowest for natural gas.\ Such a tax would fall heavily on the electric power generating industry. But it also would create powerful economic incentives to reduce air pollution emissions.\ ""We need to learn much more about how business would respond to this kind of policy"" of taxing wastes harmful to the environment, said Hamond.\ Scandinavia has carbon taxes, he pointed out, while Great Britain taxes landfills and Minnesota and Vermont are considering proposals for carbon or energy taxes to offset state property or payroll taxes.\ ""This is not an idea purely out from left field,"" he insisted. ""It is being tried around the world and in some states. It is clearly preferable to flat taxes and other taxes.""\ A flat, single-bracket income tax with no deductions or loopholes was a centerpiece of Malcolm Forbes Jr.'s run for the presidency.\ Though political candidates often promise tax cuts, Hamond noted that ""if you cut taxes on everybody, you have a huge revenue shortfall.""\ Another presidential contender, Ross Perot, also vowed to abolish IRS and to create a ""paperless"" tax system while increasing taxes on gasoline.\ Hamond sees such proposals as more of the same in the endless debate over tax simplification. Taxing waste and pollution, he believes, offers a new direction.\ ""It would reform the tax code to improve economic conditions while cleaning the environment, without a deficit,"" he said.\ Phasing in such a tax plan over the next five years could raise $190 billion that could be used to lighten the tax load on individuals and business.\ Some options: exempt the first $5,000 in payroll tax; reduce the corporate tax rate to 31 percent from 35 percent; reduce capital gains taxes.\ ""You could do all of these things simultaneously,"" said Hamond. ""$190 billion is a lot of money.""\ The tax on waste would not replace the present tax system, but displace 5 to 10 percent of it to ease the burden. Hamond calls this a ""revenue neutral"" approach.\ Hamond said this kind of reform appeals to liberals and conservatives. ""Some states may take the lead,"" he said, ""and you'll see the federal government follow.""\ Don Lubick, the Treasury department's acting assistant secretary for tax policy, said most new tax schemes the department has examined involve consumption, such as a value-added tax, sales taxes or production taxes.\ ""The income tax is a surrogate for a wealth tax,"" said Lubick. ""They are designed to tax people on the basis of their ability to pay. The consumption tax is designed to encourage saving and investment by not taxing that, but on what they consume.""\ Payroll taxes account for close to a third of federal revenue.\ Karl Scholz, the Treasury department's deputy assistant secretary for tax policy, pointed out that the federal government already has so-called ""sin taxes"" to discourage certain conduct.\ ""That's why the alcohol and tobacco taxes are as high as they are,"" he said. ""In addition to raising revenue, there is an attempt to discourage it.""\ A carbon tax would be similar by taxing elements in the economy that produce environmentally unwanted results.\ But the IRS doubts that a carbon tax could raise the necessary revenue needed by the federal government.\ Said Lubick: ""If you wanted to replace income with a value-added tax, that would be a 30 percent sales tax added to everything you buy."" And some way might be needed to exempt the poor from taxes on housing, food and medical care.\ Lubick also noted that pension plans, charitable contributions and health insurance plans often are linked to income taxes.\ ""You take all that stuff apart and throw it overboard,"" he said, ""the consequences not foreseen will be drastic.""\ Hamond agreed, adding that there is a point where consumers revolt against taxes.\ ""Evidence around the world indicates that sales tax compliance begins to break down when you reach 10 or 12 percent,"" he said. ""If you put in a sales tax of 25 percent where everything you buy has a 25 percent tax, the black market is going to skyrocket even larger than today's. People will look to buy their goods at non-retail outlets. They don't want to pay the tax."""
131,"SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) - Soaked by showers in a lush green rain forest, President Clinton urged nations not to sacrifice their environment in pursuit of economic gain. ""We destroy these resources at our peril,"" he warned Friday.\Underscoring his message, Clinton announced he will lead the U.S. delegation on June 26 to the United Nations' conference following up on the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. He urged other world leaders to attend: ""Together, we need to reaffirm the spirit of Rio."" In his final stop before a Caribbean summit in Barbados, the president flew by helicopter to Braulio Carrillo National Park - 500-square miles of towering mountains and tropical rain forests roamed by monkeys, jaguars, tapirs, puma, ocelots and deer.\It rains virtually every day, and Clinton's visit brought a downpour that drenched his clothes and turned his speech notes into a sodden mess of blurred ink. He spoke from a stage built at the top of a gorge shrouded in whips of fog and the constant spray of rain.\""You were very, very emphatic about wanting to visit a rain forest,"" Costa Rican President Jose Figueres kidded Clinton. ""We have some thunder and lightning on order in a few minutes."" When the two presidents hugged, water flew from their jackets.\With 25 percent of its land in protected areas, Costa Rica has taken the lead in preserving natural resources. It stands in stark contrast with other Latin American nations where the environment has been spoiled by pollution, smog and deforestation.\""We are trying to make preservation of the environment and sustainable development the policy of every nation in the world,"" Clinton said.\In a series of modest agreements, the United States pledged to help Costa Rica design and find funds for a pilot program of electric vehicles. The two countries also pledged deeper cooperation on improving their national park systems. For example, Costa Rica's park service will share its computer software to help park rangers at Yellowstone catalog its natural wonders.\""Economic development itself cannot occur unless the environment is preserved,"" Clinton said.\""We know that the rain forests of the world provide us with a good deal of our oxygen and enormous resources coming out of the plant and animal life,"" Clinton said. ""It nurtures plants that provide food and clothing and furniture and medicine. And from the stunning quetzal bird to the stealthy jaguar, we know that the marvelous animals must be preserved for all to see.""\The president shook his head in awe at the majesty of the park, which encompasses five climatic zones from tropical wet to cloud forest. The park is home to more than 6,000 identified species of trees and over 500 species of birds.\Figueres is considered an innovator in ecotourism - attracting visitors who spend money to see lush natural beauty. He endorsed a new carbon tax devoted to restoring tropical forests, imposed a new electricity tax to promote energy conservation and blocked business developments that he said posed harm to the environment.\""Our role as leaders in a global and increasingly interdependent world is to choose the right way of doing things,"" Figueres said. ""This is not always the easiest choice. But this path creates the conditions for real advancement of quality of life.""\He said the splendor of the rain forest was ""the result of at least 70 million years of life on our planet. And its preservation is vital to insure our good quality of life.""\In Barbados, Clinton will meet with Caribbean leaders hoping to reverse what they feel is American neglect after the Cold War. U.S. economic aid for the region dropped from $225 million in 1985 to $26 million in 1996.\The Caribbean Community wants NAFTA-like trade privileges with the United States. White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the administration does not plan to expand NAFTA to the Caribbean but will ""talk about granting enhanced preferences,"" on some Caribbean goods like apparel and leather.\The leaders also are angry about a successful U.S. challenge to European trade preferences for the islands' banana exports. McCurry said Clinton will declare that he is not opposed to ""some sort of preferences to the Caribbean,"" but that America will not back down from its opposition to the Europeans' current system.\In an area of agreement, the leaders are expected also to sign a 40-page cooperative plan for cracking down on drug smuggling, gunrunning and other crimes, McCurry said.\Credit: AP"
132,"
The nation's chief environmental enforcer says that industry must adopt practices that prevent pollution and preserve natural ecosystems.
\
That means manufacturers must find ways to produce products without ecological harm, said Carol Browner, new administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
\
""Pollution prevention and source reduction are going to be very important,"" she said, adding that she intends to avoid traditional command and control methods that set limits on pollution.
\
Browner said she has suggested several job-creating ideas to President Clinton, including watershed restoration and wastewater treatment facilities construction.
\
For every $1 billion spent on wastewater projects, she said, 50,000 jobs are created.
\
The ideas she has presented are intended to help jump-start the economy while saving the environment.
\
Carl Pope, the Sierra Club's executive director, adds that it's no longer pie-in-the sky to expect industry to operate in environmentally friendly ways while becoming more competitive.
\
""We are doing it in virtually every industry,"" said Pope. He offered these examples:
\
- Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in San Francisco announced in 1991 that 75 percent of the expected increase in energy demand over the next decade will be met by energy efficiency, not new power plants. The utility promotes energy-conservation programs for residential and commercial customers.
\
- Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. saved $570 million since 1975 by preventing pollution at its plants and reducing costs for waste disposal or pollution-control equipment.
\
- Monsanto Co. in St. Louis believes it has met its pledge to cut toxic air emissions by 90 percent by the end of 1992 through technological improvements, recycling and shutting down polluting equipment.
\
Environmentalists are calling attention to such examples as President Clinton's administration embarks on a program to stimulate the economy and increase the global competitiveness of U.S. industry. Before becoming president, Clinton said it was time to recognize that ""Adam Smith's invisible hand can have a green thumb.""
\
""At long last, we have an administration that recognizes the link between a healthy environment and a healthy economy,"" said Pope. ""The two areas we probably will spend most time talking to the Clinton administration about are clean energy and transportation and, in the West, better management and restoration of public lands.""
\
Headquartered in San Francisco, the Sierra Club is the nation's largest grass-roots environmental organization, with 600,000 members. It believes, said Pope, that job opportunities through ""growing a green economy"" are plentiful.
\
As ""the most spectacular example,"" Pope pointed out that the federal government spends $4 billion each winter to heat the poorly insulated homes of low-income residents.
\
""It's crazy to spend money on oil and natural gas when you can pay people to reduce those expenses,"" said Pope, by weatherizing buildings. Such a program would create 15,000 new jobs a year, he estimated, and cut energy consumption in weatherized buildings by 30 to 60 percent.
\
The Sierra Club supports energy taxes, such as a gasoline tax or a tax on fuels that contain carbon, to help reduce the federal deficit.
\
Pope also urged the federal government to end a $100 million annual subsidy that aids the export of raw logs and to stop allowing companies to mine federal lands without paying royalties.
\
""We subsidize pollution and tax employment,"" he asserted. ""It's not surprising we have too much pollution and not enough employment.""
\
Economic policy in the context of the environment is gaining national attention.
\
Among the buzzwords in the discussion are ""market mechanisms,"" intended to use market forces as incentives for environmental protection.
\
""That truly would be a welcome and positive change in environmental policy,"" said a new report from the Heritage Foundation, a non-profit conservative public policy institute in Washington, D.C.
\
From the report's title, ""How to Help the Environment Without Destroying Jobs,"" it might appear at first that conservatives agree with ecologists. But the report actually is an example of how much conflicting advice President Clinton is likely to get in trying to think up techniques for greening the economy.
\
The report urges Clinton to:
\
- Revamp the Superfund program for cleaning toxic waste sites and order the EPA to define an unacceptable risk of cancer at such sites.
\
- On global warming, support research on climate change but oppose legislation for a carbon tax, which the foundation says would cost an estimated 600,000 jobs.
\
- Veto bills that would require automakers to improve auto fuel economy from the current standard of 27.5 miles per gallon to 40 or 45 m.p.g., which ""will result in thousands of avoidable highway fatalities"" because fuel-efficient cars would be lighter.
\
- Require the government to pay landowners the value of confiscated property rights when they are denied permission to develop land because of federal wetlands-protection policies.

133,"
Look! Up in the stratosphere! It's Ozone Man! Will Ozone Man-in real life, mild-mannered Al Gore, the vice president-elect-stop the American economy with his bare hands to save the spotted owl? Will he leap tall deficits in a single bound to prevent the emission of even a single molecule of carbon dioxide?
\
Stay tuned for the next four years. But don't expect dramatic developments in the first few episodes.
\
In the last week before the election, President Bush dubbed Al Gore ""Ozone Man"" because of the Tennessee senator's ""environmental extremism."" If Bill Clinton and Al Gore were elected, Bush warned, ""We'll be up to our neck in owls and out of work for every American.""
\
Everyone knows what happened last Tuesday. But does this sound like a gleeful environmentalist who is rubbing his hands at the prospect of turning the White House into a bird's nest?
\
""My sense is that, going into a new administration, the priorities with respect to broad, sweeping initiatives will be health care, infrastructure, the economy and possibly education,"" said Joseph Goffman of the Environmental Defense Fund, a leading national environmental group. ""You'll notice the environment is not on this list. The new president is likely to give the environmental community something of a raincheck.""
\
Two factors lead environmentalists, policy analysts, and business representatives to forecast that Ozone Man and activist, environmental policies will be grounded during the first period of the Clinton administration.
\
The main reason is the stagnant economy, which dominated the presidential campaign as the environment did not. And, since last week's election, talk has focused on the need for the new administration to take steps in the first 100 days to fire up the economy.
\
""The way to do that is not with an ambitious range of regulatory programs,"" said Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for the Future, a non-partisan Washington, D.C., environmental policy review group. ""Anytime the economy is an issue, I think it's going to take precedence. If people are worried about paying for Chip and Muffy's college education, they're not going to worry about the air quality of their metropolitan area.""
\
New regulatory programs cost money, in the form of either taxes or business costs, and the country's businesses and citizens already spend about $130 billion yearly to comply with federal environmental regulations. To increase that annual outlay could lead to the loss of jobs, and that leads to the second reason many feel the Clinton White House will move cautiously on environmental issues. Portney notes that Clinton's record as governor of Arkansas indicates he will balance the environment with the need for jobs.
\
But even if Clinton does not make the environment a top priority, he will not be able to avoid the issue. First, he must appoint a new head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Speculation so far centers on former Vermont Gov. Madeline Kunin, Environmental Defense Fund director Fred Krupp, and Colorado Senator Tim Wirth.
\
Then, after Congress reconvenes next year, three major pieces of environmental legislation will be up for reconsideration-the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the nation's basic solid-waste law; the Clean Water Act, which regulates industrial and municipal discharges to the nation's waterways; and the Superfund law, covering cleanup of hazardous-waste sites.
\
Although all three laws are on the books, they contain provisions that Congress must reauthorize periodically, which usually leads to major rewriting of the acts.
\
""President Clinton will be taking over at a time of fundamental review of major laws,"" said Mary Gade, director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. ""This gives the Clinton administration a major opportunity to put its stamp on these laws.""
\
That stamp is likely to be the familiar one of mandates and prescriptions, said Gade, a Republican who favors innovative free-market mechanisms such as her recent Cash-for-Clunkers program, in which corporations buy and scrap old, pollution-spewing cars as a cheap way to meet reduced-emissions goals.
\
The chief pieces of evidence to support this view, besides a partisan disposition to view Democrats as big-government types, come from Gore's background. He was one of the authors of the original Superfund law, passed in 1980, which established a turtle-pace process for cleaning up abandoned hazardous-waste dumps. A study earlier this year found that almost 90 percent of the money spent by insurance companies on Superfund cleanup claims went to lawyers and consultants, not cleanup companies.
\
Then, earlier this year, Gore published ""Earth in the Balance,"" his analysis of global environmental challenges in which he calls for a tax on carbon-dioxide emissions, which could be leading to a warming of the Earth's climate. Such a carbon tax would add $100 to the price of a ton of Illinois coal and effectively kill the Illinois coal industry, Gade charged.
\
But Goffman sees the Superfund law as dating from the ""middle ages of environmental policy."" Since then, new approaches to controlling pollution have come to the fore, especially since the Clean Air Act of 1990 established an emissions-trading system to give electric utilities an incentive to reduce pollution. A free market will determine the price of emissions credits that utilities will earn for cutting emissions to levels below those required by law. Those credits can then be sold to utilities that cannot meet the requirements.
\
""I think they'll look at existing mandates and see if they can be expanded using market-based approaches,"" Goffman said. ""I think that will help them a lot because it will deliver on their promise that they're new Democrats with a new paradigm. They'll be able to show movement in terms of environmental benefit, and they'll be able to do it without incurring a lot of costs.""
\
One other point about the role that Gore will play in environmental policy, courtesy of Sid Marder, environmental consultant for the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce:
\
""Al Gore is the vice president. He's not the president, thank goodness.""
\
For the most part, Marder sees little change ahead in the kind of environmental regulations that are imposed on business under new versions of the resource-conservation and clean-water laws.
\
""I think that what was going to happen will probably happen a little faster,"" Marder said. ""But quite honestly, I don't think what is going to come out in those bills will be substantively different than they would have been under a Bush administration. Over the last six or seven months, I have detected a shift in the mood of the country toward the environment. I was intrigued that the president was able to go on national TV and say Gore is an environmental extremist and he got away with it. We've got some hard economic times, and people are starting to look at tradeoffs.""
\
He regrets, however, the coming end of the Council on Competitiveness, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, which has delayed and changed environmental regulations in the name of sparing American businesses onerous regulatory burdens.
\
Of course, one interest's loss is another interest's gain. Goffman sees the departure of Quayle and the arrival of Gore as signaling, if not a period of environmental activism, a new era of White House receptivity to green thinking.
\
""A lot of environmentalists feel that the basic premises that were under attack in many quarters of the Bush administration are now going to be accepted,"" he said. ""So the atmosphere in which these issues and problems are thought out is going to be more positive.""

Seth Borenstein's Dec. 12 article about climate change should have appeared on the Opinions page. I thought the Associated Press was supposed to be unbiased. This article should have been headlined ""an inconvenient lie.""
\
I am a global warming skeptic. No, change that. I believe the global warming hysteria is propagated by many charlatans with political and economic motives.
\
Read his article closely. Things like: ""change could raise sea levels,"" ""some scientists worry,"" ""one even speculated,"" ""two top scientists"" should ring a bell, especially when he fails to mention anything about the many scientists at Bali who outright oppose the ""global warming is caused by man and the world is going to end"" theories.
\
Al Gore gets over $3,000 a minute for his global warming speeches. The U.N. is now calling for a global carbon tax. This tax would be something like $10 to $40 billion per year, and wealthy nations like the United States would bear the biggest burden. Another inconvenient omission is that Gore is chairman of Generations Investment Management, one of the groups that would collect and manage these carbon tax dollars (and I'm sure we all know the United Nations has an impeccable record of managing money).
\
Don't be manipulated. Google global warming or visit the Web site of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and look at both the majority and minority pages. If we just sit back and let Gore, Borenstein, the U.N. and the Sierra Club have their way we will regret it.

135,"The Obama administration plans to push ahead with efforts to aggressively limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming despite fears that it could further slow the recessionary economy.\Instead of backing away, the administration plans to portray the limits as a boost for America's ""clean energy economy,"" according to congressional leaders and energy experts who have talked with top Obama advisers. The step would spur competitiveness and promote investment in renewable alternatives to imported oil, the government will argue.\At issue is the so-called cap-and-trade initiative, under which the government would set limits on carbon emissions by power plants, factories and other installations but allow those that emit more to buy or trade permits with companies and facilities that emit less than the prescribed limit.\The idea is that raising the cost of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere would encourage companies and other emitters to cut back, thus reducing a principle cause of global warming.\""If we don't put a price on carbon,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, ""we'll never get these clean energy sources online.""\But cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth, a concern raised frequently by opponents of climate change legislation.\""The whole economic issue will be front and center in the debate on this,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, who has discussed President Barack Obama's global warming plans with senior administration officials ""on both sides.""\Polls show voters increasingly losing interest in the global warming issue. By pressing ahead anyway, Obama would be sticking with a program he said during the campaign would be a high priority of his presidency.\""There's a general consensus that things are going to be done with climate"" in Washington this year, said Daniel Yergin, author of the Pulitzer-winning ""The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power,"" who recently updated his book with an epilogue on Obama and energy.\He added: ""We're going to go through a very intense national seminar on cap-and-trade and carbon tax.""\Details of the administration's approach are far from set, though Obama has repeatedly said he favors cap-and-trade. The administration will argue that greenhouse gas restrictions should be part of a two-pronged effort to stimulate renewable energy supplies and ensure demand for the megawatts they'd produce.\The first part is to invest heavily in wind power, solar power and biofuels, through the massive stimulus bill working its way through Congress. The second is to help that power compete with cheaper fossil fuels by pumping up fossil fuels' costs to reflect the potential economic damage from a warmed Earth.\Critics, including many Republicans on Capitol Hill, say those moves will only increase energy prices and hurt already-struggling families.\""I just have concerns on the impact on the economy with all of the issues of global climate change,"" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who sits on the Senate's energy and environment committees, ""and what restrictions there's going to be, what expenses there's going to be for American taxpayers.\Economists generally agree that limiting emissions is likely to curb economic growth, at least in the short term. Peter Orszag, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office who now heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Congress last year that emissions limits would reduce long-term economic risks but ""also impose costs on the economy ... in the form of higher prices for energy and energy-intensive goods.""\Orszag also testified that the size of those costs could depend on whether the government sells emissions permits, and if so, how it spends the proceeds.\Environmentalists have recently pushed that idea one step further, arguing that if Congress passed emissions caps today, it could borrow against the future revenues from permit sales and spend the money on alternative-energy research and technology.\That would stimulate the economy and ""allow polluters to transition from a high-polluting environment to a low-polluting environment,"" said Andy Stevenson, a former hedge fund manager who is now a finance adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\Other experts are more skeptical. Subsidizing alternative energy could stimulate the economy, said Robert Shapiro, an economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton and now chairman of the U.S. Climate Task Force. But a cap-and-trade system, he said, ""would raise energy prices at a time when you're trying to increase consumption. ... It goes against everything [Obama] campaigned on.\Shapiro and many economists would prefer for the government to tax carbon emissions and refund the proceeds straight to taxpayers. The Democratic leaders working with Obama on climate legislation prefer cap-and-trade. So do a coalition of business leaders -- including Shell oil and the Big Three automakers -- who joined with some environmental groups to release an emissions-limit proposal earlier this month.\Boxer said Friday that she has learned from the defeat of a cap-and-trade bill in the Senate last year. She's set to unveil basic principles of a simpler, more focused plan within a week in hopes of passing a bill by year's end.\Her counterpart on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) talks even more optimistically: He has promised a bill by Memorial Day.\----------\jtankersley@tribune.com\Get green news at one site\Tribune's Green page has news about recycling, jobs and getting eco-friendly at chicagotribune.com/green\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, Washington Bureau"
136,"For some of the people in New York this week demanding action on global warming, the menace is not just carbon dioxide. The real Tyrannosaurus rex is the American economic system. On Monday, the day after the huge march through Manhattan, a few hundred protesters showed up in the financial district for ""Flood Wall Street."" Their slogan: ""Stop Capitalism. End the Climate Crisis.""\One of them lamented to ThinkProgress that ""not many people are willing to say that the root problem of climate change is capitalism."" Another told The Daily Beast she was there ""because I'm a Mashpee Wampanoag native to this country, and as far as I'm concerned, Wall Street greed has been killing me and my ancestors for 400 years."" \It's not exactly clear how Wall Street greed was killing Native Americans in the 17th century, since the New York Stock Exchange didn't come into being until 1817. But leave that aside. \What was obvious from the Monday protest is that the radical elements of the movement against climate change have some serious misconceptions about economics and the environment. \It's true there are corporations that profit from goods and services that contribute to global warming, from Exxon Mobil to General Motors to Duke Energy. But blaming capitalists for excessive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is like blaming grocery stores for obesity. In each case, the business is taking its cue from what consumers want. \Capitalists have no stake in pumping out greenhouse gases double time. If consumers prefer products that are easy on the Earth, businesspeople will trample each other to provide them. When the federal government cracked down on air and water pollution in the 1970s, companies found ways to survive -- and even to profit from cleaning up the environment. If Washington takes sensible steps to curb carbon dioxide output, the same thing will happen. \It's not as though socialism is a proven way to restore the Garden of Eden. The profit motive was anathema in Eastern Europe under communism. But the region became a giant chemical waste dump. \""As Eastern Europe struggles toward democracy, it must also grapple with a ravaged environment,"" reported The New York Times in 1990. ""Corrosive soot has fouled water and soil, and in blackened industrial cities the air is laced with heavy metals and chemicals."" \Some land was so polluted as to be useless for growing crops. Kids in one part of Poland had five times more lead in their blood than kids on the other side of the Iron Curtain. \In China, communism was equally destructive. American University scholar Judith Shapiro wrote a book called ""Mao's War Against Nature."" \The idea that capitalist businesses can't function without belching poison is one the Flood Wall Street folks share with many corporate executives and Republican politicians. When the Environmental Protection Agency ordered a 30 percent cut in emissions from coal-fired power plants, critics insisted it would kill jobs and cripple growth. \Alarmists said the same thing when Congress passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act decades ago. \In fact, companies quickly adapted to the new rules -- a tribute to the innovative capacity of a free-market system. \Since 1980, carbon monoxide pollution in America has been cut by 83 percent, lead by 91 percent and sulfur dioxide by 78 percent. But total economic output per person, adjusted for inflation, has risen by 77 percent. We've gotten greener and healthier as we've gotten richer. \Today's corporations, subjected to meaningful limits on carbon output, would soon find low-cost ways to comply. \That's why a lot of impeccably conservative economists have endorsed a carbon tax -- including Greg Mankiw, who was President George W. Bush's chief economic adviser, and the late Nobel laureate Gary Becker, who said it ""would be appropriate in light of the real threat from global warming."" \The problem today is not that capitalism can't function without ruining the environment but that the public isn't demanding serious action against global warming. \A recent Gallup poll found most Americans think the planet is baking -- but they rank the issue 14th in importance on a list of 15 concerns. \Back in 1990, a Polish teenager, asked about environmental degradation in his country, told The New York Times, ""I don't know the way, but we have to get over the I-don't-care disease."" \Capitalism can't cure that malady. But if and when we overcome it, capitalism can reverse its effects. \---------- \Steve Chapman, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at chicagotribune.com/chapman. \schapman@tribune.com \Twitter @SteveChapman13\Credit: By Steve Chapman, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board"
137," Your June 27 article ""Climate change clues show up in ice"" made interesting points that deserve further emphasis. There is a great deal of misinformation about so-called ""global warming.""\ While the earth's average temperature has risen about one degree Fahrenheit over the last century, only 18 percent of scientists responding to a Gallup Poll of the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union believed the observed warming was the result of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The change is well within the parameters of natural fluctuation.\ Much of the observed temperature increase occurred pre-1940, well before man-made greenhouse gas emissions grew to significant levels. Satellite temperature readings the last 14 years, far more accurate than measurements taken on the ground, show no warming trend for this period.\ Predictions of global climate change are based essentially on scenarios generated by computer models, which scientists admit are too simplistic to provide a reliable forecast of the climate. Wide acceptance of such models by policy-makers and activists points to the need for more climate research and solid, accurate information.\ Some policy-makers want to rush into action, proposing drastic greenhouse gas reduction strategies that could have severe impacts on our economy. A carbon tax, for example, could produce annual GNP losses of 1.7 percent, substantially increase residential energy bills and consumer product prices, cost thousands of jobs, and make U.S. products less competitive, giving our foreign trading partners an advantage.\ The United States should pursue actions to reduce greenhouse gases that, regardless of global climate change, make sense for the economy and environment. The world needs to work cooperatively to provide energy-saving and environmental technologies to developing countries, whose industrialization will account for the majority of future greenhouse gas emissions.\ What we should not do, however, is pursue costly measures in the absence of adequate climate change science.\JOHN SHLAES Washington, D.C. (The writer is executive director, Global Climate Coalition.)"
138,"BLOOMINGTON — A scientist speaking Wednesday at Illinois Wesleyan University used “Pascal's Wager” to explain one reason why action is needed on climate change.\Philosopher Blaise Pascal argued in the 17th century that it was safer to “bet” that God exists and live your life accordingly.\If you were wrong, you would suffer little harm. But if you made the opposite wager — that God didn't exist — and were wrong, you faced the risk of internal damnation.\Likewise, Harvard University professor Naomi Oreskes said, if we reject the idea that climate change is occurring, “the consequences are likely to be dire.” But, she said, if we accept it is occurring and take steps to improve our environment, even if climate change isn't happening, the worst that happens is, “we will have created a better world for nothing.”\Inaction will lead to more “unnatural disasters” caused by or intensified by climate change, like recent wildfires in California and Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, she said.\There's a difference between genuine uncertainty about a scientific question and exaggerated, overblown or politically driven uncertainty, said Oreskes, speaking at IWU's annual Founders' Day Convocation.\“Not long ago, people believed wholeheartedly in science,” she said. “We now live in a world where many people doubt scientists, a world of fake news, 'truthiness' and alternative facts.”\Oreskes is a professor of the history of science and affiliated professor of earth and planetary science. Her books include one co-authored with Erik Conway, “Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco to Global Warming.”\She also has been a TED Talk speaker.\During a question-and-answer session with students at a lunch that followed her talk, Oreskes pointed to changes in attitudes and policies related to tobacco as an example of how to overcome deliberate misinformation.\First came scientific evidence of the harm caused by tobacco, both directly to users and to others exposed to it. Next came leadership from individuals such as the surgeon general. That was followed by grass-roots action, such as local governments and states banning smoking in public.\The final step was litigation, with the U.S. Department of Justice successfully suing several major tobacco companies for fraudulently covering up the health risks of smoking and addictive nature of nicotine.\“Science along cannot solve our problems,” said Orestes.\She favors litigation as one tool and said, “There's a lot that can be done through grassroots organizations.”\Orestes said it's also important to consider the social dimension of climate change and how actions, such as a carbon tax, can impact individuals.\Although there are many different approaches to science, she said, it all comes down to evidence and “all of the diverse experts who have considered available evidence” and reached a consensus.\Contact Lenore Sobota at (309) 820-3240.

139,"Thousands of Chinese are fleeing to the United States. We are not talking about impoverished peasants hiding in cargo containers. We're talking about millionaires flying first class and buying condos in the choicest ZIP codes. A big reason for this relocation, real estate agents say, is a desire for America's clean air, as opposed to China's suffocating smog.\Welcome to the new world of environmental immigration. These are not the ""huddled masses"" immortalized on the Statue of Liberty's poem, but they are -- quite literally -- ""yearning to breathe free.""\One can see the point of leaving China if you have the resources. Rust-colored toxic wastes choke its rivers. Sooty air makes eyes itch. And public health crises in some industrial towns have reached the level that they're being called ""cancer villages."" Who wants to expose the family to that if you can live under Boston's blue skies and in close proximity to the select U.S. universities you want your kids to attend anyway?\About a quarter of recent buyers for Boston's top luxury condos have been foreign investors, especially from China and other parts of Asia. A local entrepreneur, Patty Chen, runs a soup-to-nuts relocation service, American Asia Business Tour Group-Boston, helping out with immigration visas, real estate services, and advice on schools and neighborhoods.\Manhattan has experienced a similar rush of Chinese buyers. Michael Chen at the brokerage firm Bond New York cites their preference for New York's fresh air and ""better family and work/life balance."" Guess it's all relative.\How bad is the pollution back in China? A recent study published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found that Chinese living in their country's heavily industrial north die on average five years earlier than those living in the south. Reliance on coal-fired heating and factories is largely to blame.\China has been the world's third-most popular tourist destination, after France and the United States. But the number of visitors there fell 5 percent this year. The China National Tourism Administration cites the smog as a big factor keeping people away. Beijing saw a steeper, 15 percent, drop in foreign travelers. More and more businesspeople are reportedly trying to get moved out of Beijing for health reasons.\For decades, corrupt Communist Party leaders have squandered their natural heritage in their push to create jobs -- and stay in power. The policy has also enriched their families and cronies feasting off the big, dirty industrial machine. But now environmental squalor is beginning to be bad for business. The government has started sponsoring studies on ways to lessen pollution, both the noxious type you breathe and the invisible planet-warming gases from the same sources. Proposals include a carbon tax on fossil fuels and a national carbon credit market. Sound familiar?\Environmental segregation is not unknown in the United States. Affluent precincts in this country maintain pristine surroundings, while poorer ones often get the smokestacks, waste facilities and lax regulations.\But Americans never let things reach the point that their rich citizens immigrated in massive numbers to cleaner countries. And to their credit, Americans have accepted the loss of some competitive advantage in global manufacturing as a necessary price to pay for protecting our natural surroundings.\The alarm is sounding for China's elite to also address the trade-off between explosive economic growth and environmental degradation. Jobs versus early death should be a topic for national debate.\You wonder whether China's environment would have been allowed to get so putrid if rich Chinese had to gasp the same air as the toilers. One can't blame them for wanting to escape, but still you wonder."
140,"Carbon tax\While the news cycle was dominated by big Supreme Court decisions, President Barack Obama gave a speech at Georgetown University on June 25 that may come to define his legacy. \He threw down the gauntlet over climate change. \It's too bad the media frame this as a struggle between ""environmentalists"" and Republicans because climate change affects the life of all Americans -- bricklayers, nurses, truckers, accountants, farmers, bankers and used-car salesmen every bit as much as eco-activists. \Most of all, it affects our children and grandchildren because fossil fuel emissions are changing the chemistry of their world in unpredictable and dangerous ways. We do need to act, and we commend the president for doing all he can through executive authority. The current trajectory of greenhouse gas buildup is still far more than the world can tolerate. \But Obama's plan may not be the most economical way to get this done. \A better solution would be a fee on fossil fuel carbon, rising every year, with 100 percent of the money rebated back to households to offset the increased cost of energy and goods. \As the president spoke in the hot sun at Georgetown, ordinary citizens from all over the country -- members of the Citizens Climate Lobby -- were visiting congressional offices to press the case for a revenue-neutral carbon fee. \Republicans should embrace this policy as a market-based alternative to the president's regulatory action plan. \We hope they will rise above petty politics and do the right thing. \-- Perry Recker, Jay Mulberry and Rick Knight, Chicagoland Citizens Climate Lobby, Chicago \Time to act \Last month Barack Obama announced a comprehensive climate plan to address global warming -- a welcome first step, and a big one. His plan includes setting limits on carbon pollution from power plants, the largest source of carbon emissions in the country, advancing energy efficiency and increasing the nation's commitment to renewable energy. \Last year, more than 3 million Americans voiced support for those standards. \In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, record drought in many states, wildfires in Colorado and devastating floods here in Illinois, the president listened to these Americans and rose to the challenge. Policies like these are essential to implementing the clean energy solutions necessary to tackle global warming. \I thank the president for backing up his strong words on global warming with strong action to clean up power plants, so that we can fulfill our obligation to our children and future generations by addressing global warming. \Now we need all of our elected officials to make serious efforts like the president's. \-- Ember McCoy, Environment Illinois, Chicago \Wildfire fighters \While our planet is threatened by climate change caused by man's endless exploitation of fossil fuels, millions of Americans profit from its denial. But if you want to find a group of courageous, principled professionals who understand the truth and stark horror of climate change, just visit with our nation's wildfire fighters. \They've gone from experiencing a two-month fire season to a four-month fire season to a six-month fire season and anticipate the day when it will be year-round. \They scoff at ludicrous, head-in-the-sand climate-change deniers. \It's said there are no climate-change deniers on the fire line because anyone who is quickly discovers the undeniable truth. \I was reminded of this fact when I heard of the horrific deaths of 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots of Prescott, Ariz. \We can never adequately honor their service and sacrifice. \The least we can do, however, is continue the uphill battle, albeit one that may already be lost, but which we must fight on as furiously as those 19 heroes, to stop and then reverse the enormous damage we've done to our one and only home. \-- Walt Zlotow, Glen Ellyn \Obamacare intro \In my last tax bill, I paid more than 7 percent in property tax to support my local public library. \I am appalled that the Obama administration is recruiting and training our librarians to push its agenda on the Affordable Care Act.

142,"Talk of independence is largely hushed in Quebec these days, yet the federal separatist party is rising from the abyss and could soon hold sway in Canada once again. \Just a year ago, the Bloc Quebecois was trying to recover from an internal feud that split its lawmakers and left it leaderless. Polls now suggest the tide has turned. The Bloc is on track to win the most seats in a decade, making it a potential power broker in Parliament assuming the two largest parties fail to win a majority in the Oct. 21 national elections.\""Anybody who talked about the end of the Bloc Quebecois after the last two elections -- it was premature,"" said Sebastien Dallaire, a pollster at Ipsos in Montreal.\Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, 54, who managed a rock singer before entering politics, is aiming for at least 20 seats in Ottawa to defend the French-speaking province's interests, twice the tally from the 2015 election. Projections compiled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. as of last week suggest the party is on track to take 25 districts, third-most among all parties.\With the polls showing that either Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals or Andrew Scheer's Conservatives are likely to end up with a minority government in the 338-seat House of Commons, 20 or so seats could be enough to wring concessions in exchange for the Bloc's support.\Though the Bloc has backed the Conservatives in the past, Blanchet hasn't committed to helping any particular party, and will consider each bill through the lens of Canada's second-most populous province.\""It's good for Quebec? We vote in favor. It's bad for Quebec? We vote against,"" he told journalists after a televised debate this month in Montreal.\While the Bloc has no aspirations to form government -- it only runs candidates in Quebec's 78 electoral districts -- and has put separatism on the back burner, it favors taxing digital giants such as Facebook and Amazon.com and giving Quebec powers to reject projects under federal jurisdiction like pipelines or airports.\Perhaps most controversially, it opposes any attempt by Ottawa to challenge a recent law barring teachers and other government workers from wearing religious symbols.\The party's focus on secularism and the environment, along with the plunge in support for the New Democratic Party in Quebec, have given a boost to Blanchet in his first campaign, and may bring the Bloc closer to the 50 or more seats it traditionally held until 2011.\The party can be hard to place on the Canadian political spectrum. Its values and social policies are more aligned with the Liberals on a classic left-right scale, but its separatist aspirations bring it closer to the Conservatives' decentralized approach to federalism, said Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa.\The Bloc was the occasional ally of minority Conservative governments from 2006 to 2011 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, pushing for policies such as stimulus spending. Lucien Bouchard, who founded the party in 1991, was a Cabinet minister for Conservative leader Brian Mulroney.\Rising environmental concerns could complicate cooperation with the pro-pipeline and anti-carbon tax Conservatives. The Bloc wants to end fossil-fuel subsidies, crank up targets to reduce Canada's carbon emissions, and devised a ""green equalization"" system of payments to provinces that would tax higher-carbon emitters.\""In the 2000s, the Bloc's focus was on federalism,"" Lecours said. ""Now that would perhaps be more complex. If the Conservatives said 'We'll leave Quebec alone but we will build a pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Ocean,' I'm not sure how the Bloc would react.""\CAPTION: Photo: Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, left, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet take part in a debate in Gatineau, Quebec.

143,"After criticism from environmental groups, Sen. Mark Kirk said Thursday that climate change is real and human activity contributes to it.\The Illinois Republican issued a statement after Environment & Energy Daily reported Thursday on remarks Kirk made a day earlier to one of its reporters. According to E&E Daily, Kirk said climate change isn't caused by industrial greenhouse gas emissions, but its report did not quote him directly on that point. \E&E Daily did quote Kirk as saying that ""political correctness took over climate science."" \It also quoted Kirk as saying: ""We had the previous warming period, which was called global optimum, and the best way to talk about that is when (Leif Eriksson) went west from his home, he discovered a land mass that he called Greenland, because it was. And that was called the global optimum, because the planet was much warmer. By calling Greenland 'green land,' we know that the climate has been changing pretty regularly within recorded memory."" \Eriksson was an 11th-century explorer widely held to have been the first European to reach North America, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. His father, Erik Thorvaldson, founded the first European settlement on Greenland, Britannica says. \Climate change is a hot issue as the Senate is poised for votes beginning Monday on the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline. The White House says it will veto the measure, if passed. \Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, sought Thursday to amend the pipeline legislation with a ""sense of Congress"" resolution saying climate change is real and caused by human activity and already has caused ""devastating problems."" \His amendment was offered at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee meeting and was tabled, said Jeff Frank, his press secretary.

144,"CORRECTION: This story contains corrected and additional material, published Feb. 13, 2008.\Invoking symbols as varied as the Brooklyn Bridge and the Allied war effort in World War II, two billionaires helped open a United Nations climate change meeting Monday aimed at promoting global efforts by governments and businesses to slow the gradual warming of the atmosphere.\Among the ideas proposed was the need for a ""war room"" to coordinate actions against warming and replacing New York City's use of hardwoods with plastics and other materials.\UN officials hope the two-day debate will build on the results of a December conference in Bali, where nearly 190 nations agreed that by the end of 2009 they would come up with a new plan to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists say are trapping heat and changing the Earth's climate.\""If the year 2007 was the year when climate change rose to the top of the global agenda, 2008 is the time we must take concerted action,"" said UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon.\Ban said an estimated $500 billion a year in ""green"" investments such as alternative fuels is necessary to reduce levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\To prevent rising sea levels, drought, species extinctions and other consequences of rising temperatures, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by 25 percent to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.\Richard Branson, the head of Britain's Virgin Group, called for the creation of a ""war room"" to coordinate the work of scientists, engineers, civic groups and government agencies to come up with solutions. He likened the effort that is needed to slow global warming to the intensive Allied research projects in World War II that resulted in such innovations as radar, sophisticated code-breaking techniques and the atomic bomb.\""There is no coordination of ideas"" currently, Branson said at a news conference. ""In a war situation, you literally have a war room, and we have a crisis that is bigger than World War I and II combined.""\Branson, who has offered a $25 million prize for an invention to remove carbon dioxide from the environment, urged the 20 richest nations to match his offer. That would up the incentive to $525 million, which he said would be the largest scientific prize in history (this sentence as published has been corrected in this text).\New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire founder of the media company that bears his name, said slowing or reversing global warming would require dramatically stepped-up action by the U.S., the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\To achieve ""real and binding"" emissions reductions, Bloomberg favors a mandatory cut in carbon dioxide emissions coupled with a carbon tax, measures the Bush administration opposes.\In an address to the UN meeting, Bloomberg reviewed the steps that New York City is taking to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, such as converting the taxi fleet to hybrid vehicles, and announced that the city would cut its use of tropical hardwoods by 20 percent a year.\Cutting down tropical forests reduces the ability of the earth's ecosystem to absorb carbon dioxide, which trees convert into oxygen.\Tropical woods are prized for their durability. That has led to their use in pilings at the docks used by Staten Island ferries, and in the 3,500-foot boardwalk that pedestrians use to cross the Brooklyn Bridge.\To take the place of tropical wood, Bloomberg said, the city would use recycled plastic lumber, domestic hardwoods, concrete and other substitutes.\The mayor is disappointed that presidential candidates have not made global warming an issue in the presidential campaign.\""Candidates on both sides of the aisle should be talking about it more,"" he said, while acknowledging that it is a difficult subject for a political campaign. ""It is complex, and it requires investment now that will yield benefits down the road.""\The climate-change meeting continues Tuesday with speeches by representatives of more than 100 countries, including the U.S.\----------\soswanson@tribune.com\Credit: By Stevenson Swanson, TRIBUNE CORRESPONDENT"

Champaign County Circuit Court
\
URBANA - Urbana will likely join Champaign in attempting to intervene in a lawsuit over the creation of the Champaign Southwest Mass Transit District.
\
Meeting as the committee of the whole, the Urbana council, in a 6- 0 voice vote, directed city staff to draw up a motion to intervene in the lawsuit. The issue will come up for a formal vote at the council's July 9 meeting. The Champaign council authorized legal intervention last week.
\
Urbana Mayor Laurel Prussing, who is attending an out-of-town convention, asked the council to consider intervention in a June 20 memo.
\
Prussing wrote that Urbana is a participant in the Champaign- Urbana Urbanized Area Transportation Study, which developed a long- range transportation plan in 2005. That plan listed development of mass transit services for the entire urbanized area as a key goal, she wrote.
\
To that end, the cities both entered into agreements with the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District calling for the district to expand with the cities as they annex additional territory. The district then began taking steps to annex territory.
\
""In an attempt to frustrate the community plans, some persons in southwest Champaign sought to create a 'hollow' mass transit district for the express purpose of staying out of the CU MTD service area, thus initiating a pattern of fragmenting the mass transit system,"" Prussing wrote in her memo.
\
""Since the express purpose of those seeking to form the Southwest Mass Transit District is in direct opposition to Urbana's goals, it is in our interest to seek intervention in this case,"" she wrote. ""Urbana has an important stake in the matter before the court.""
\
Litigation in the case is currently consolidated into a single case, Tapley vs. Champaign-Urbana MTD, in Champaign County Circuit Court.
\
Voters in the Champaign Southwest MTD voted in March 2006 to create the new district, which includes the subdivisions of Lincolnshire Fields, Trails at Brittany, Ironwood, Copper Ridge, Glenshire and Turnberry Ridge as well as rural areas. Last April, residents approved a 2.6-cent per $100 of assessed valuation property tax to support the district.
\
Champaign resident Scott Tapley - a member of the Champaign County Board - filed the suit two years ago seeking a restraining order to prevent the Champaign-Urbana MTD from annexing the subdivisions, which were then proposed to be part of the southwest district's territory in the 2006 referendum.
\
The request for a restraining order was denied, but the judge also denied a motion for summary judgment by the Champaign-Urbana MTD, indicating the judge believed both districts could operate simultaneously.
\
Whether the cities are allowed to intervene will be up to the judge in the case.
\
""It's a mistake about to happen, having a transit authority serving a splinter community of 6,000 people,"" said Alderman Dennis Roberts, D-Ward 5.
\
Charlie Smyth, D-Ward 1, said southwest Champaign residents drive more to get to the central city and require a greater investment in city streets.
\
If residents there want to go strictly to user fees, he said, they should also pay a carbon tax for their negative impact on the environment.

The effect would be rapid and large. \-- Doug Burke, Citizens' Climate Lobby, Oak Park \Taxing questions \Although I've been voting in all general and mid-term elections in the past half century, during the last 35 years, I've carefully scrutinized them, discovering that Democrats usually proposed tax increases for high-income earners and Republicans consistently opposed them. \Tax reductions on high-income earners won out. \The result has been deficit spending, an unprecedented increase in the national debt and the decline of the middle class. During this time income inequality between the rich and poor widened and now is the greatest gap in world history. \But this begs the question: \Why are tax reductions affecting the wealthy so toxic when their principle is untouched, leaving their already accumulated fortunes intact? \Don't taxes apply only to recent earnings? \Which previous State of the Union speech has ever explained this small detail to the public? \What am I missing? \-- James D. Cook, Schaumburg \Dangers in U.S. \It can be easier to get a gun than to get a small-business loan or even to buy a home. \Like the rest of the world, the U.S. is in danger. \But it is a danger that can be corrected -- if that is what we really want. \-- Bernard Biernacki, Aurora \In search of winners \The Chicago sports teams, after selecting their coaching staffs for their coming season, know that ""you cannot win the derby on a donkey!"" \The voters of Illinois seemed to have learned that lesson when electing a governor. \When will the national voters learn the same lesson when electing a president? \-- Gary D.

147,"Deforestation plan grows at climate summit\The 195 nations that met over the past two weeks in Poland for a global summit on climate change made only modest progress toward an agreement, including an accord designed to slow deforestation that may be the meeting's signature accomplishment. \""Clearly, the accomplishments here are modest. The principal agreement of note would be on the rules for forest investments,"" said Paul Bledsoe, senior fellow on energy and climate at the German Marshall Fund and a former Clinton White House adviser on the environment, who is in Warsaw for the talks. \The deforestation plan provides economic incentives for countries to reduce the emissions that come from deforestation and a way for developed nations that will foot the bill to measure their efforts. \Norway, Britain and the United States pledged $280 million toward the effort, with the U.S. share at $25 million. \There were a number of setbacks during the session. Japan, with its nuclear power plants shuttered after the Fukushima disaster, took the occasion to note that it would sharply reduce its previous commitment to cut emissions. Australia's House of Representatives voted Friday to repeal the nation's carbon tax. Fed up with those actions and with little movement on financial issues, an estimated 800 members from a variety of nongovernmental organizations walked out. \Negotiators were continuing to talk Friday night, with the possibility of going into the early hours of Saturday. \Death toll from collapse of Latvia store reaches 51 \Rescue workers pulled bodies from the ruins of a collapsed supermarket in the Latvian capital Riga on Friday as the death toll rose to 51. \Cranes lifted large slabs from the wreckage of the Maxima store, in a Riga suburb of gray, Soviet-era housing, to find those trapped when the roof collapsed late Thursday. The supermarket was full of shoppers on their way home from work. \Police said three rescue workers were among those killed. \Murder charges for ally of CIA's bin Laden hunt \PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- A local Pakistani government has brought murder charges against Dr. Shakil Afridi, who helped the CIA find Osama bin Laden. \Afridi was hailed as a hero by U.S. officials for organizing a fake vaccination campaign in Abbottabad on behalf of the CIA in a bid to collect DNA and otherwise confirm the al-Qaida leader's identity. \Afridi was charged in connection with the death of a teenage boy he operated on eight years ago. \3 to 5 years for crime lab evidence tampering \BOSTON -- Annie Dookhan, a former Massachusetts crime lab chemist, was sentenced to three to five years in prison Friday after pleading guilty to tampering with evidence and other charges in a case that shook the foundations of the state's criminal justice system. \Dookhan's mishandling of evidence at the now-closed Hinton State Laboratory Institute, where she worked from 2002 to 2011, may have tainted cases involving 40,000 people, investigators have said. \U.S. government told to upgrade cybersecurity \WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government itself seldom follows the best cybersecurity practices and must drop its old operating systems and unsecured browsers as it tries to push the private sector to tighten its practices, technology advisers told President Barack Obama. \The government ""needs to lead by example and accelerate its efforts to make routine cyberattacks more difficult,"" the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology said. \The Newsmaker Herzog picked to lead Israel's Labor Party \Israel's Labor Party on Friday elected Isaac Herzog as its leader. Herzog, 53, is also something of a political blueblood: He is the son of former President Chaim Herzog and grandson of a pre-statehood chief rabbi. \Afghanistan dismisses U.S. deadline for pact \KABUL, Afghanistan -- Afghanistan on Friday brushed aside an end-of-the-year U.S. deadline for signing a 10-year security pact between the two nations that would continue U.S. military and reconstruction aid after combat troops withdraw at the end of 2014. \The spokesman for President Hamid Karzai, who stunned U.S. officials Thursday by saying the government would not sign the agreement until spring, reiterated Friday that his nation wanted to wait. \PRINCETON MENINGITIS 8 \The number of Princeton University students now diagnosed with meningitis, a potentially fatal infection that causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord, a university spokesman said Friday. \Health officials will try to determine whether the latest case is related to the previous seven that have been identified since March. Officials could not provide the health status of the eighth student. \Texas clinic resumes abortion services \DALLAS -- A Planned Parenthood clinic in Austin, Texas, resumed abortion services Friday under strict new state rules, the organization said, but 11 other abortion clinics in the state are still not performing the procedure. \Planned Parenthood said its Austin doctor had received admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, a new requirement under the new law.

148,"Cleaning up Chicago's air \The recent Tribune article on air quality in Chicago (""Chicago air dirtier in July than notoriously smoggy LA,"" July 12) shows a disturbing paradox: Even though people across Chicagoland have dramatically reduced their regular activities, our local air quality is as bad as ever.\A combination of car fumes, factory exhaust and other pollutants have actually made the air in Chicago worse than that of notoriously smog-ridden Los Angeles. The higher temperatures of climate change, combined with fireworks smoke and smog that moves inland from Lake Michigan later in the day, have piled on to create dangerously high levels of ozone. This is especially relevant during the pandemic, as higher levels of pollution directly correlate to a higher fatality rate of COVID-19, a recent Harvard study found.\Thankfully, there are some bold policy changes that we can make to improve our air, and that's around the electrification of our transportation industry. With the transportation sector being the largest contributor to air pollution, a move away from fossil fuels and toward wind and solar energy would be a huge boon to the Chicago region.\In a 2016 study of 10 states, more electric vehicles on the road, for instance, could save more than $21 billion in health and climate costs combined by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the air. Electrification would also lead to more jobs, as new, cleaner industries enter the marketplace. Pollution has always been bad in Chicago -- the city ranked 16th most-polluted city in the country based on number of high-ozone days in 2019, according to the American Lung Association.\Additionally, when it comes to childhood asthma rates, Chicago ranks third-worst among major metropolitan areas because of the levels of air pollution.\As a member of Illinois Clean Air Now (ICAN), a coalition of clean energy, health advocacy and transportation industry stakeholders, the American Lung Association is advocating for these changes because we know the impact they will have for generations to come.\Let's not waste this opportunity, because electrification could be an action that can lead to cleaner skies and a better lung health. What's not to like?\-- Angela Tin, national senior director for clean air initiatives, American Lung Association, Springfield \\Bipartisan backing for carbon tax\I'm not afraid to admit it: The three piping plover chicks are really cute. It's truly amazing how much fluffiness and adorableness can be wrapped up in such tiny little packages. I love their new names and all the thought that went into coming up with them.\You know what else I love? Pushing Congress to enact meaningful climate change legislation that will ensure a hospitable environment these plovers can continue returning to. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives that just received its 81st co-sponsor last month. The bill proposes putting a fee on carbon at the point of extraction and returning those funds monthly to American households, like a regular stimulus check but paid for by fossil fuel companies. While some Chicago-area U.S. representatives are already co-sponsors -- like my representative, Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia -- we need to push them to reach across the aisle and ask more of their Republican colleagues to join them. If Congress passes this legislation, we will begin to create the kind of world where we will see more cute piping plover chicks.\-- Alex Marianyi, Chicago \\Don't expand military testing site\The Desert National Wildlife Refuge in Nevada is the largest refuge in the lower forty-eight states. It's home to hundreds of unique wildlife species and contains areas sacred to neighboring tribal nations. Its history and significance to Native Americans make this a precious place all Americans should care deeply about. But this invaluable landscape is under threat. Recently, a House committee passed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would give away 850,000 more acres of the refuge to the military for bomb testing -- which would mean giving away more than 5% of wildlife refuge land in the lower forty-eight.\The military's Nevada Test and Training Range already contains 2.9 million acres. Any expansion will endanger critical wildlife habitat, destroy sacred tribal land and erase popular outdoor recreation sites that generate sustainable income for the country. Illinois' congressional delegation should reject the amendment. We cannot let the military test-bomb away heritage, culture and nature.\-- Courtney Bourgoin, Chicago\----------\For online exclusive letters go to www.chicagotribune.com/letters.

149,"U. of I. chief gets a whopping raise \It is shocking that University of Illinois President Timothy Killeen is slated to earn $835,000 a year merely for doing his job well, while graduate and teaching assistants at the University of Illinois at Chicago needed to strike for three weeks to slightly improve their lot. Graduate students at UIC make a minimum salary of $18,000 and pay $2,000 in university fees. Their new contract reduced fees, increased contributions to health care plans and family coverage, and gave them a $2,550 pay increase but over three years.\The UIC workers were seeking to boost minimum salaries by 7.4% in the first year of the new contract, 7.2% in the second year and 8.2% in the third year. UIC offered a 4.1% jump in year one, then 4.1% and 3.75% increases in subsequent years.\UIC faculty members avoided a strike when they negotiated a contract that contains a 4% total raise pool per year as well as new policy protections.\How is it possible that Illinois can find the money to boost Killeen's salary by 40% but is unable to improve working conditions for hardworking faculty members, adjunct professors, graduate students, and clerical and technical personnel until they strike, and even then, is able to raise their salaries by paltry amounts?\-- Orayb Najjar, professor emerita, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb \\Ban foam containers at restaurants\Chicago's restaurant and business community should support the ban on Styrofoam containers proposed by Ald. Scott Waguespack.\As a Chicago restaurant owner in Chicago for over 30 years and one who, with Ina Pinkney in 2008, founded the Green Chicago Restaurant Coalition, all six of my restaurants have been free of Styrofoam and polystyrene (No. 6 plastic) for over a dozen years. Neither profitability nor our customer base was affected when we made the switch.\Chicago is playing catch-up with the rest of the world on this issue. In addition to the European Union, many major U.S. cities, including New York City; San Diego, California; San Francisco; Los Angeles; Seattle; Washington; and Portland, Oregon, have some form of ban on the use of Styrofoam. Next year, the entire state of Maine will ban Styrofoam.\While the Waguespack ordinance is still in its early form and should be modified to make it even more practical and environmentally friendly, the Illinois Restaurant Association, the Illinois Retail Merchants Association and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce should all be early and strong supporters of a Styrofoam ban. With sustainability being so much a part of Chicago's vibrant restaurant scene, there can be little doubt that our great chefs and restaurateurs will be solidly behind such action.\-- Dan Rosenthal, president, Sopraffina Marketcaffes, Trattoria No. 10, Chicago \\Hope in fight against climate change\I largely agree with New York Times columnist Paul Krugman (""Australia shows us the road to climate hell,"" Jan. 10) but believe two things offer hope.\Climate change is my foremost concern. I closely follow the news and continually learn new things, from the latest grim statistics and prognostications to both encouraging and discouraging developments worldwide. But I'm in the minority. Most people ""believe"" in human-caused climate change but are preoccupied with other problems and don't realize that climate action can't wait. They know Australia is burning and ache for the baby koalas. They cluck sympathetically without comprehending the immediacy of the crisis.\Unlike Krugman, I believe that many people are open-minded but insufficiently informed. They must be reached and motivated to both take and demand climate action. Don't put too much blame on politicians. They tend to respond to the expressed concerns of their constituents, which are usually health care and jobs, not climate change.\I also disagree with Krugman on the need for and usefulness of a carbon tax. Again, many people are insufficiently informed about the wide-ranging benefits of a transparent, well-designed, revenue-neutral tax. They anticipate and fear sacrifice. Some are irrevocably opposed for ideological reasons or perceived self-interest and won't be swayed, but I think they are outnumbered. A growing number of economists believe a strong tax that returns most of the revenue to taxpayers is a necessary part of any climate strategy. It would sharply discourage the use of fossil fuels without regulations and government meddling.\But not all carbon taxes are created equal, and success or failure is in the details. Several models have been thoroughly analyzed and predicted to benefit almost everyone except those who gain from destroying the environment, climate, and future. The people who are insufficiently informed about such a tax must be reached.\It should be possible to awaken the somnolent. There seems to be progress. Whether we can still avert climate disaster is moot, but disaster a given unless we try.\-- Carol Steinhart, Madison, Wisconsin\----------\For online exclusive letters go to www.chicagotribune.com/letters.

150,"A new life \I was distressed to learn of the likely demolition of the Harley Clarke Mansion in Evanston. This historic building is an architectural gem, on the National Register, landscaped by Jens Jensen and sitting next to a public beach. It served the public for many years as the Evanston Arts Center. A small group of private citizens have raised funds to tear it down to open the view of the beach. Another proposal is a private hotel on this public site. Those funds could be used to restore it and give it new life for the community, whether as a gallery, a learning center, an event space or a combination of uses.\When we destroy our history we cannot get it back. I lived in Evanston and I took many classes there -- studying in such a beautiful environment was like a trip to another world -- and that changed my life. This building could be used in ways that will enhance the lives of the next generation and those to follow. We have squandered many treasures already, let's not do it again. Repair this one and give it new life.\-- Jan Tymorek, Madison, Wis. \\Changing priorities\While following the news of California's fires, I thought of everyone who is dreaming of where to live when they retire. Will they consider what the climate will be like in 20 or 30 years? Would they hazard California, with its worsening climate-related conflagrations, heat waves, droughts and water shortages? Or the Southeast? That's also burning.\The East Coast? Much of Florida will be under water and the rest of the coast is relentlessly retreating westward. Some friends lost their intended retirement home on St. Thomas to hurricanes Irma and Maria and promptly bought property on Martha's Vineyard. I said, ""Stay dry."" They said, ""It's not on the shore."" Think. Think. Five, 10 years from now.\Canada? Perhaps, if they haven't built a border wall to keep us out and one stays clear of forests.\Nowhere is safe from the ravages of climate change. Maybe we Midwesterners should sit tight because other places can be much worse. We'll continue to have storms, floods, droughts and heat waves unlike any in the last century, and perhaps an influx of climate refugees from both within and outside the United States, but, well, it could be worse.\Climate scientists say we have to end all use of fossil fuels in the near future. But that won't be sufficient because irreversible change has begun. We must remove some the carbon we've added to the atmosphere and oceans. There are nascent technologies for that, but they are far from practicality.\Fortunately, recent polls show that most Americans take the climate crisis seriously. Many would be willing to pay a price, in the form of a carbon tax, to bring it under control. Moreover, both Republicans and Democrats have proposed market-based carbon taxes that could rapidly reduce fossil-fuel use.\It will demand an all-out effort, but it isn't too late to salvage a stable climate. It's up to us voters to get things started by telling all those seeking election or re-election that we want, need, and expect climate action and it will be a priority when we vote.\-- Carol Steinhart, Madison, Wis. \\Finding a vocation\I've heard a lot of talk about pushing for free college education, and I think that is a laughable proposition to support four-year colleges in that way.\However the cost of college has truly become so exorbitant that it is a burden on parents, students and society. A high school education hasn't been ""good"" enough for a long time, but a lot of well-paying vocations do not need a bachelor's degree either. Perhaps a free associate's degree would be better to give the youth something under their belts and mature before either continuing into higher education or a vocational program (or just stopping their training there).\In Switzerland, kids often declare a vocation by 16 so they can finish by 19; many do not continue on to higher education yet they are all highly skilled in what they chose. Shouldn't we reduce the burden on our children and society before individuals are in debt by essentially the price of a house just to decide they then need to enter an advanced program? Or half a house and working at your local Starbucks?\-- Ted Terziev, Chicago \\----------\For online exclusive letters go to www.chicagotribune.com/letters.\Send letters by email to ctc-TribLetter@chicagotribune.com or to Voice of the People, Chicago Tribune, 160 N.

151,"EPA should take action against steelmaker \The Post-Tribune story (""Report: Steelmaker ArcelorMittal doctored tests after toxic spill,"" Jan. 8) about a possible cover-up by ArcelorMittal of its pollution of the Little Calumet River is alarming. This company's gaming of the environment and public health, as alleged by the state of Indiana, would be a clear violation of federal law.\The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must respond with the urgency this matter deserves.\ArcelorMittal allegedly lied to state regulators and everyone who lives in the Lake Michigan watershed by falsifying its tests. Strong enforcement from the U.S. EPA is required. The Clean Water Act makes it clear that ArcelorMittal must be held accountable.\As an Illinois senator who represents Lake Michigan -- which the Little Calumet River feeds into -- and the countless constituents that could be affected by this pollution, I'll be demanding accountability. We have to hold ArcelorMittal accountable when it comes to pollution and the company's unwillingness to accept responsibility. It isn't a matter of bureaucracy; it's a matter of common sense.\Ammonia and cyanide present clear and dangerous environmental and health risks. It's time for this major corporation, ArcelorMittal, to clean up its act and give us reliable assurances it will not happen again.\-- U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. \\Carbon tax would fight climate crisis\Several writers have characterized climate change as the ""problem from hell."" That's because we have great difficulty tackling a crisis that is slow-moving, spans the entire globe and is everybody's fault. American politicians say, ""Why should we take the lead when China pollutes more?"" Politicians in other countries say, ""Why should we take the lead when the wealthy United States is doing nothing?"" Activists point fingers at energy companies, which respond that they're just giving their customers what they want.\""Problem from hell"" is a fitting metaphor. But to Australians caught up in apocalyptic wildfires, it's more than a figure of speech. To them, hell is at their front door and all around them, burning their world and everything in it to cinders.\As the Tribune states in the editorial ""Australia burns as the planet bakes"" (Jan. 7), climate change exacerbates the frequency of extreme weather events. Drought and record-high temperatures have turned the Australian bush into a literal tinderbox. We know that greenhouse gases, mainly from burning coal, oil and gas, are partly responsible.\The Tribune also points to an effective policy to stimulate the innovations that can put the brakes on global warming: taxing fossil fuels ""to reflect the damage they do."" Charging fossil fuel producers for every ton of carbon they pull out of the ground would stimulate the deployment of clean alternatives, energy efficiency and climate-saving technologies that could not otherwise beat the unfair cost advantage of cheap fossil fuels.\Legislation has been introduced in Congress to achieve exactly what the Tribune suggests according to a straightforward plan that would benefit the vast majority of Americans.\The bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763), based on years of study and analysis, was introduced last January and now has 75 House sponsors from 22 states. That list includes five from the Illinois delegation -- Danny Davis, Chuy García, Robin Kelly, Dan Lipinski, and Jan Schakowsky -- who have all taken the big step we need toward a safer, saner, cleaner world.\We need to not only debate and discuss ideas, but also to turn them into real-world policy. Please support lawmakers who have the vision and wisdom to go beyond rhetoric. Climate change is here, now, and we have no time to lose.\-- Rick Knight, research coordinator, Citizens' Climate Lobby, Brookfield \\The devastation in Australia\The terrifying wildfires in Australia have killed 1 billion animals and countless trees and plants. The nation's beloved koala bears have perished in the infernos. The iconic kangaroo population has been horrifically decimated. Countless animal and plant species have been ravaged to the threshold of permanent oblivion.\Scientists concur that global warming is significantly responsible for this cataclysmic disaster. The grievous plight of Australia and its fauna and flora provides overwhelming proof that global warming has the potential to wipe out all species.

152,"In June, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a defender of the coal industry, and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a champion of the environment, decided to set aside differences and learn about how climate change affects each other's state.\Which is why one bright October morning, Manchin stood with Whitehouse on a trawler in Rhode Island Sound as fishermen and marine scientists explained how in 30 years, the fish have left where they are supposed to be, some species such as lobster have grown rarer, and the seas have turned more dangerous. \Friendly and relaxed, Manchin asked a few questions. But anyone expecting him to interpret the damage to Rhode Island as a mandate for federal action on climate change would be mistaken. He moved, instead, to defend coal. \""There is no doubt that 7 billion people have impacted our world's climate,"" Manchin said, relying on a narrative he has used in Washington as well as that day in Rhode Island. ""We have a responsibility. But no one is going to stop using fossil (fuels) for a long time."" \In today's Congress, historically unproductive and stocked with recipients of donations from fossil fuel industries, this cultural exchange between two Democrats counts as progress on climate change. It came about in part so Manchin could simply tell other senators wary of federal intervention that climate change is real. \""I didn't invite Sen. Manchin here expecting him to have an epiphany and become a greenie and go to the next climate march,"" Whitehouse said. ""He has very, very good relations with some of the most conservative members of the Senate who think climate change is a conspiracy."" \If Manchin said that the damage from climate change isn't imaginary, Whitehouse said, ""some of them might listen to him."" \While success on Capitol Hill is measured in such small doses, countries including the U.S. are pushing to forge an international emissions agreement by late 2015 to slow climate change and avert its worst effects. There are more heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere than ever in recorded history, \So far, the Obama administration has aggressively used existing authority to address climate change, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's moves to raise vehicles' gas mileage and cut power plant emissions. But many economists and climate experts contend bolder steps, such as a carbon tax, are needed to make the deepest emissions cuts, and those steps need congressional action. \""The president and his team, we're squeezing everything we can out of that authority,"" said Todd Stern, the administration's chief climate negotiator, during a speech at Yale University last week. ""But you can't go far enough unless you get new legislative action, and Congress is gridlocked on these things right now."" \Manchin gained notoriety during the 2010 midterm elections with an ad in which he shot the Democrats' cap-and-trade bill because it was ""bad for West Virginia."" Although Manchin does not deny the existence of man-made climate change, he is reluctant to curtail it, West Virginia political analysts say. \""You are talking about Kentucky, West Virginia, and people mining coal for two, three, four generations, and nothing else is there and people don't see that anything else is possible,"" said Jeremy Richardson, senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, whose family has mined coal in West Virginia for three generations. ""Coal mining is very much an identity, and successful action on climate change means we have to create new opportunities in the coal fields."" \Whitehouse's visit to West Virginia on Wednesday will focus on how miners have been affected by the shrinking demand for Appalachian coal, driven mostly by mechanization, and more recently, by cheap natural gas and environmental rules. A bipartisan bill has been introduced in the House to protect miners from the economic effects of lower coal use, and Whitehouse's staff is exploring the issue too. \Manchin made millions of dollars as a coal broker before entering politics, and his investments are now in a blind trust. But at a seaside bar that has lost much of its beachfront to erosion and rising sea levels, he said, ""I'm trying to learn so I can say I've been on the front lines"" of climate change. \Rhode Island is losing ground to the Atlantic. The senators stopped by a tide gauge in Newport that has measured sea level since 1930. The tide rose 1 inch per decade until about 25 years ago, when the rate increased about 40 percent to 1.4 inches a decade. The state has lost about 150 to 250 feet of shoreline in the last 65 years. \Communities such as the blue-collar village of Roy Carpenter's Beach have picked up their cottages and moved inland, after storms dragged roads, homes and parking lots into the sea. \""I just want them to understand how important this place is to us,"" said Christa Thoresen, as Manchin and Whitehouse toured the cottages still on the shore's edge, ""and how much we have to lose to climate change."" \For Manchin, the coal industry advocate, the highlight of the trip appeared to be BioProcess Algae. The company operates a project in Iowa that takes heat-trapping carbon dioxide from an ethanol plant and uses it to grow algae, which is then used as animal feed. Whitehouse plans to talk to the EPA about including such options in its power plant greenhouse gas rules. \By using carbon dioxide as an algae feedstock, the technology would be a way to keep coal plants alive. \An enthusiastic Manchin invited the company's leaders to West Virginia to meet with power plant operators. Bounding to his car to head to the next stop, Manchin glanced back at the BioProcess building and said with a wide smile, ""This is what it's all about."" \---------\nbanerjee@tribune.com\Credit: By Neela Banerjee, Tribune Washington Bureau"
153,"With the Bush administration refusing to commit to emissions reduction targets, negotiators trying to build a global action plan to stem climate change appeared to face a tough choice at key talks set to end Friday: Agree to a plan weak enough to win United States backing, try to embarrass the U.S. into compromising or simply move on, at least for now, without the world's biggest greenhouse gas producer.\Former Vice President Al Gore, in a speech Thursday night, urged the delegates to set aside their frustrations and work around Bush administration objections, in hopes that a new U.S. administration to be elected next year would fill ""the blank space"" in the deal, due to be completed in 2009.\With China and other developing nations showing early signs of agreeing to emissions reductions, the U.S. ""is principally responsible for obstructing progress here,"" said Gore, who accepted the Nobel Peace Prize earlier this week for his efforts to alert the world to the perils of climate change. But ""political will is a renewable resource,"" he promised.\European delegates, however, threatened to boycott a U.S. effort to initiate separate climate talks among the world's major greenhouse gas emitters next month unless the United States agreed to emissions reduction targets at Bali. And some developing nations hinted they might let the Bali talks fail rather than agree to U.S. demands.\Laying the groundwork for a new international climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, has been tortuous work for government delegates from more than 180 countries at the Bali meeting. Japan, for instance, has resisted committing to deep new emissions cuts for developed nations, but only because its per capita emissions are already less than half those of the United States.\Australia similarly won't commit to cutting its emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 -- the level of reductions proposed for developed countries in the new plan -- because its new prime minister, in office less than a month and a key supporter of emissions cuts, had promised to consult with Australians first.\U.S. blocking tech transfers\But the U.S. has been singled out at the meeting as the biggest obstacle to progress, not only because it has attempted to remove targets and deadlines for emissions cuts from any deal but also because it has blocked agreement on issues like the transfer of clean technology from richer to poorer countries.\Most climate negotiators argue that such transfers are key to helping developing countries and emerging major polluters like China and India build cleaner power plants and adopt more environmentally friendly manufacturing processes. But Bush administration delegates have raised concerns about the loss of intellectual property rights, among other issues.\Similarly, U.S. delegates have tried to weaken a proposal to allow greenhouse gas emitters to earn emissions reduction credits for protecting the world's remaining rain forests, largely, environmentalists say, because that implies accepting some form of international carbon credit trading system and the emissions caps and reduction targets that come with it.\Chinese delegates in Bali have suggested for the first time that they might be willing to commit to reducing their emissions as part of a technology transfer deal, even though China's emissions, per capita, are only a quarter of those of the United States. But the Bush administration, which has demanded such reductions from China and other growing polluters, is now jeopardizing such a deal with objections to some aspects of technology transfer, analysts and environmentalists said.\""What we have is what [the Bush administration] asked for: Clear science and big players like China stepping up,"" said James Leape, director general of World Wildlife Fund International. But the U.S. delegation ""is rebuffing that opening,"" he said. ""That's tragic.""\Americans defend proposals\U.S. negotiators insist that their proposal -- allowing the 16 developed and developing nations that emit the most greenhouse gases to draw up voluntary national targets and programs for reduction -- makes the most sense, given the failures of most Kyoto Protocol signers to live up to internationally set commitments and given concerns about the potential and economic effects of large-scale mandatory emissions cuts.\James Connaughton, the White House's environmental chief and a U.S. delegate to the talks, said Thursday that it is not the United States but the European Union and developing nations that are being obstructionist by insisting on specific emissions reductions for developed nations at Bali, the first gathering in a two-year process of creating a new climate treaty.\""Those suggesting you can magically find agreement on a [number] when we're just starting negotiations, that in itself is a blocking effort,"" he charged.\But delegates at Bali said there was little hope world governments would follow U.S. proposals -- even good ones -- after the Bush administration had for years ceded leadership on climate issues.\""We've lost the trust of the world in many ways,"" said Russell Mittermeier, the head of Washington-based Conservation International.\""The U.S. is being adamant on not accepting for itself ... anything that looks like a commitment to fixing targets,"" said Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister. ""Those historically responsible for greenhouse gas emissions must stop preaching and set the example.""\Meanwhile, other American officials have been keen to showcase growing U.S. progress on climate change. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was in Bali on Thursday to argue for a U.S. carbon tax. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) flew in as well earlier in the week to urge U.S. negotiators not to block ""reasonable targets"" at the meeting.\Signs of bipartisanship\Back in the United States, Senate committees passed legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and the House pushed forward a long-stalled energy bill, both indications that action on climate change is gathering increasingly bipartisan support.\""Over the next two years, the United States is going to be somewhere it is not now,"" Gore told delegates Thursday night, noting California's move to pass mandatory emissions reductions and a call by 150 business leaders for similar nationwide reductions.\Observers at the Bali talks said that at least some developing nations -- including China -- appear now to be feeling similar pressure to act on climate change threats.\""For the first time developing nations are coming to the table and tabling real proposals for emissions reductions,"" said Philip Clapp, deputy managing director for the Pew Environment Group. ""They recognize this situation is real and the pressure will get worse."" For many countries, failing to act, he said, ""is not an option.""\""The community of nations must reach agreement,"" concurred Kevin Rudd, Australia's new prime minister, who stopped by the talks. ""There is no Plan B.""\----------\lgoering@tribune.com\Credit: By Laurie Goering, Tribune foreign correspondent"
154,"More obstructionism, fewer rights for us\The obstructionists are on top of their game.\The debt ceiling issue was pressed to zero hour by the Republicans before it was put in the hands of a supercommittee. The Supers will not solve this either; they'll squabble over Medicare/Medicaid and Social Security because these programs are on the table along with the debt ceiling issue.\In terms of the jobs bill ... 63 percent of the people support Obama's jobs bill. In fact, the majority feel it is the No. 1 priority. Shame on every Republican legislator for recently voting against it and not offering any compromise.\Maybe the Republicans can wait until the next election to accomplish their own self-serving political gains, but the unemployed cannot afford one more day.\A couple weeks ago, Obama offered a stripped-down version of that jobs bill in hopes it would pass for hiring first responders, police and teachers. Again every single Republican voted against it.\Where are the logical, common sense Republican voters? Why aren't they calling their representatives and asking for them to do the right thing?\Look to the governor of Wisconsin to see how the Walker regime is obstructing voter rights. They have passed bills to make it difficult for the elderly and disenfranchised to vote by requiring a voter card, which costs money and limiting polling places and hours. Some states are eliminating early registration and ending early voting done two weeks in advance of Election Day.\It goes on and on ... more obstruction and rights being taken from the 99 percent -- they don't care about you. In fact, they're arrogant about it.\The Occupy people know the score.\Joni Lindgren\Elgin\Who will vote Democrats out?\The stench of corruption emanating from Springfield has become so overpowering that it is difficult to believe the millions of voters who blindly vote for Democrats aren't disgusted with almost daily stories of corruption and malfeasance in state government.\Citizens in Illinois pay a heavy price as a result of the corruption and malfeasance in the Democrat-controlled legislature and in 2012 voters will have the opportunity to express outrage by sweeping Democrats out of office.\However, as we have learned from previous general elections, about 50 percent of all voters are either too lazy or apathetic to even vote; so to assume that in 2012 Democratic voters will suddenly say, ""Enough is enough"" is probably a mistake and the likelihood is that the corruption and malfeasance in Springfield will continue -- albeit to a smaller degree.\Will voters punish Democrats in 2012 by sweeping them out of office? I doubt it and predict Democrats will retain control of the legislature and Illinois will remain the country's laughingstock.\Victor Darst\West Dundee\Road map for USA's self-destruction\If I wanted to destroy a great and powerful nation like America, first I would use 9/11 and the terrorist threat to enact a police state. Cameras everywhere surveilling our every move; phones and cameras tracking everything we do; TSA in the airports putting their hands on our women and children, teaching Americans to be subservient.\Then I would change the banking laws, create a giant derivatives and mortgage bubble, then burst the bubble. Then I would get the private Federal Reserve Bank to print up almost a trillion dollars and bail the banks out, really sticking it to the American people. Then, in the name of the environment, I would put a tax on the life cycle itself. Brilliant.\In fact, I would create a whole carbon trading market, take that carbon tax and stick it to the American people.\And lastly, don't let the people use any of their resources to create energy.\Chris Scott\St. Charles\Some teens would be better off in jail\After reading the editorial, ""Teen alternatives to jail good for all,"" I feel that is not OK to give teenagers alternatives for their bad behaviors and actions. Being a teenager myself, I understand the way some people think and process. Jail is certainly the correct path for certain people who do certain things.\I believe that desperate times do call for desperate measures, and that is exactly what going to a jail or juvenile center can offer. If someone does something wrong, they need some sort of punishment to make them realize their fault.\Giving someone an innocent alternative, such as community service, gives them an easy way out of their action. It does not improve or benefit them in any way.\I strongly disagree with the statement, ""As youth who are kept at home with comprehensive services are less likely to repeat offend."" Going home would be more of a gift than a punishment. Teenagers may feel that they ""got off the hook"" this time. They could easily think that the next time they do something, they will be given the same result which they didn't think was that bad.\Going to jail really opens their eyes to the consequences that can happen. Also, just because ""it costs taxpayers in Illinois more than $80,000 a year to keep a kid locked up,"" does not mean that we should not lock them up, anyway. Even though money is spent, safety is worth more.\It may be hard to believe that teenagers could be that great of a threat, but nothing is certain these days. It is better to take precautions and spend a portion of our money, than let unlawful people off the hook.\Giovanna Galetta\Roselle\Article on wealthy was ill-timed\The Sunday article in the Home and Garden section regarding the North Shore home is in my mind the most ignorant article for this country and peoples' economic reality.Do you really think I read the article because I cared how the ex-president of some possible Wall Street brokerage firm handled his ugly duckling?I read it because I couldn't believe anyone would really write it. I kept looking for the punch line.\I find it comical that Deborah Donovan thought it newsworthy to write how even the wife doesn't know how much was spent. Really? That alone, during this economic time, is pitiful. What a waste.\If your article is typical of such families lucky to have such wealth, and choose to be so whimsical with their fortunes, this country is worse off that any of us understand.

155,"A dichotomy: Cold is declared warm\It's Orwellian when cold is declared warm, that the earth is continuing to get warmer even as it feels colder outside.\Given that a huge blizzard shut down much of the Northeast, creating havoc with holiday travelers, it would seem reasonable for the Obama administration to re-examine its mad dash to limit greenhouse-gas pollution for the purpose of curtailing global warming through the reduction of CO2.\This year Great Britain is experiencing its coldest winter and the heaviest snowfalls since seasonable records began. Despite the winter of 2008 registering as the coldest in a decade and 2009 topping 2008 as the coldest in 30 years, Meteorological Office scientists published a map predicting a 60 percent to 80 percent chance of a warmer-than-average winter on its 2010 website.\Parallel weather is also occurring in the U.S., where new low temperature records are being set. Columbia, S.C., had its first significant Christmas snowfall since weather records were kept.\Notwithstanding, Great Britain is building an energy policy around a global warming policy that will bring more cold and darkness to the British people in order to save them from getting too warm.\If this nation goes down the British road with an equivalent carbon tax, likewise applied to transportation, it could result in raising the average household energy bills of the American people by about $2,200 a year.\Climate on Earth has changed in many ways, many times. In the last half million years, vast expanses of glacier ice have grown on land and then melted away again four times. Instead of standing at attention, animals and plants have gone with the flow, moving along. The changes have been fast and slow, some quite fast indeed, but certainly not caused by man.\It would be foolish to cripple this nation with global warming policies that would enrich a few financially while substantially reducing the standard of living of the American people. Confucius said 2,500 years ago, ""Study the past if you would define the future.""\How long will the American people stand for the global warming nonsense!\Nancy J.

Among them were Penny Pritzker, a Chicago business executive and finance chair of Obama's presidential campaign; Robert Wolf of UBS, a member of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, an Obama golfing partner and a Democratic fundraiser; American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault; Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers; Google CEO Eric Schmidt; and Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric and would-be beneficiary of the president's green agenda.\It was not about substantive changes to promote our free market economy; it was about a show of good intentions. With a ballooning national debt and budget deficit, job-destroying government regulations, high personal and corporate taxes, a policy of class warfare and ongoing attempts to vilify and condemn successful individuals and businesses, his words have spoken much louder than his actions.\Despite numerous commissions called by the president to generate a plan to revitalize our economy, we remain another Europe waiting to happen.\There are four reasons an unfavorable business climate persists: high corporate tax rates, high regulatory cost, high labor costs and high litigation costs. Unless President Obama and his administration are ready to address the root causes of a hostile business environment, it will continue to be business as usual.\Ray Cziczo\Antioch\Resolve to limit federal government\New Year's Day is a time for reflection. I pray that this year our elected representatives will reflect upon our nation's recent past and future prospects. On Christmas Day 1991, the Soviet Union officially ceased, ending over 70 years of repression and 45 years of ""cold war."" U.S. leaders promised a ""peace dividend"" resulting from the return of American troops from abroad and the redistribution of funds from defense needs to the American people in the form of tax cuts and infrastructure improvements. Those Americans who fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, and those who paid for the Cold War would see the fruits of their sacrifices.\It never happened. Today, our national debt approaches $14 trillion, yet the federal government continues to lavish money that it does not have on favored persons and causes here and abroad under the pretense that Congress has the constitutional power to do so under the Commerce Clause. What freedoms have we lost as a result?\A recent Rasmussen Poll indicated that 27 percent of Americans would prefer a federal government central-managed economy. How tragic that, after all of the years of sacrifice, 27 percent of Americans today would prefer living under communism. That may be our future unless we again commit ourselves to our Constitution and our Republic.\Greg Guckenberger\Batavia"
156,"The Illinois gas tax was last increased in 1990, from 16 cents a gallon to 19 cents. \In that year, East and West Germany reunited, Nelson Mandela left prison and Andre Dawson played for the Cubs.\It was, in short, a long time ago, and the tax has not kept up with inflation. Some lawmakers pushing for a capital bill want a hike in the current gas tax, which helps pay for construction and repair of the state's roads and bridges.\But the gas tax has another problem. More fuel-efficient cars mean drivers buy less gas, and that means lower gas tax proceeds. As a result, some states have looked into an alternate road use tax, charging by miles driven.\So far, this idea has gone over like a flying Edsel in Springfield. But the state should give it a try, said Audrey Wennink, transportation director for the Metropolitan Planning Council, a nonprofit research group.\""Even if we have a gas tax increase, that's a short-term solution,"" said Wennink, who favors a pilot program for a miles-traveled tax along with a gas tax hike so the state can learn about it.\Gov. J. B. Pritzker proposed a pilot during his gubernatorial campaign but isn't currently pursuing the idea, said spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh.\Rep. Marcus Evans Jr., a Democrat representing Chicago and some south suburbs, introduced a bill for a miles-traveled tax pilot last month but tabled it a week later. He said the time was not ripe, and more education needs to be done.\""Most people who responded to me didn't know what it was,"" he said. \\How it works\Oregon -- which in 1919 was the first state to impose a gas tax, to fix its muddy roads -- was also the first to try a miles-traveled program in 2015. Volunteers pay the state 1.7 cents for every mile they drive and in return, they are credited for fuel taxes they pay at the pump. The program is currently limited to 5,000 vehicles. Azuga, a private GPS and fleet tracking company, counts driver miles for the state.\Smaller pilots have been tried in Colorado, Washington, California and along Interstate 95 on the East Coast, according to Nate Bryer, Azuga's vice president of innovation\Users can choose how they want the miles counted. One way to do it is to plug a transponder into the diagnostic port of a vehicle, to count miles. If GPS is used with the device, out-of-state miles will not be counted. Pictures also can be taken of a car's odometer, Bryer explained.\The idea is to make sure every user of the state's roads helps pay for them, said Maureen Bock, manager of the Oregon Department of Transportation's miles-based usage program, That means the owner of a new electric Tesla, who does not have to buy gas, pays the same as the owner of an old gas-guzzling pickup truck. The amount of damage a vehicle does to the road is the same up to 10,000 pounds, so all vehicles in that weight category pay the same, said Bock. \\Privacy and fairness issues\One of the main concerns raised about a vehicle-miles-traveled program is privacy. Some people fear having the government know how many miles they have driven. Bock said mileage information provided to Oregon's Transportation Department is kept private and destroyed 30 days after the bill is paid. She said if law enforcement officials want driver data, they need a warrant.\Another worry is that rural drivers may get taxed more than urban drivers, because they are presumed to drive farther. But research has shown that on average, rural and urban drivers drive about the same number of miles. Rural drivers do longer trips less frequently, while urban drivers make more frequent short trips, Bock said.\One advantage of fuel-efficient vehicles, besides that people pay less gas tax, is that they are less polluting. The gas tax is effectively a carbon tax and fairly accounts for the pollution impacts of fuel-inefficent trucks and cars, said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which opposes a vehicle-miles-traveled tax. ""The tax does not differentiate between gas guzzlers and fuel-efficient vehicles. That undermines sound climate change solutions policy.""\Wennink agreed that efficient vehicles are good for the environment but are bad for road revenue. In 1991, Illinois residents paid $166 per capita in motor fuel taxes. It's now down to about $100 a year, a 40 percent drop, she said.\""People are using the system more and paying less,"" she said. ""This results in bad conditions on our roadways, potholes, need for resurfacing and a lot of deferred maintenance.""\Bock said that the gas tax is regressive, in that people with older cars subsidize those with newer, more fuel-efficient cars. A vehicle-miles traveled tax ensures that everyone pays the same. She compared it with an electric utility, in that the more power you use, the more you pay. \\Fear of higher taxes\But while a usage fee makes sense, it should not be implemented in addition to the existing gas tax, which is already high when other taxes are figured in, cautions a conservative think tank.\Illinois is one of the few states that impose both a gas tax and a sales tax on gasoline, said Adam Schuster, the Illinois Policy Institute's director of budget and tax research. Cities like Chicago also impose their own taxes on gas.\""I don't see us supporting the tax until it addresses the overpayment concerns and privacy concerns,"" said Schuster.\There is also an issue of how out-of-state vehicles would pay. In its limited program, Oregon uses both taxes, so out-of-state and Oregon drivers who are not in the program still pay fuel taxes at the pump. A vehicle-miles-traveled-only program in one state but not in surrounding states would give visiting drivers a free ride.\The Illinois Economic Policy Institute, a think tank whose board members represent the construction industry and labor unions, believes a miles-traveled tax should be considered.\""The gas tax needs to be increased and will help revenue in the short term, but vehicles in the long term are getting more efficient, and we need a tax that is not tied to gas used,"" said Mary Craighead, transportation policy analyst for the institute. \\Transportation song quiz\* Our last song was about a kind of street, and how it's affected by a Chicago weather phenomenon we hope to be rid of soon.

I always thought we had some involvement and responsibility in pregnancy. \-- Jon O'Brien, president, Catholics for Choice, Washington \Rosenwald's impact \Tribune columnist Clarence Page's inspiring Wednesday column on Julius Rosenwald shed light upon an under-recognized (by his own choosing) giant who transformed aspects of life in Chicago and throughout the nation. \Rosenwald's incredible success in commerce only stoked his sense of responsibility to his community and world. The lasting impact of the Rosenwald schools or the Chicago cultural institutions he championed each would have been an amazing legacy. Yet he did so much more. \And in Chicago's Jewish community, he helped craft an effective central philanthropic body that evolved into today's Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago. \Fittingly, 115 years later, we fund one of the nation's largest social-service systems, serving hundreds of thousands of Jews and non-Jews alike. \And the highest honor we bestow each year is the Julius Rosenwald Memorial Award. \-- Steven B. Nasatir, president, Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago \Rejecting Republicans \Looking at the Republican primary race, I and others are concluding that Republican voters are rejecting their own party.

Most of them have addressed the current issues of the day: the Iran deal, immigration, anchor babies, etc. However, I have not heard one of these candidates mention the fact that the United States is $19 trillion in debt, and what, if elected, he or she is going to do about it. Could it be none of them has a solution to the problem? \-- Carol Lieske, Genoa City, Wis. \Social Security \Social Security taxes are both an impediment to business competition and a regressive tax on workers. \Currently, the employer and employee each pay 6.2 percent on the first $118,500 of employee income. Those eligible for Social Security include the employee, his or her spouse, former spouses, surviving spouses, minor orphans, disabled and likely others. \Since an employer pays into the fund on behalf of each employee, this amount must first be recovered, before a profit can be earned. The same goods manufactured elsewhere in the world may therefore be more favorably priced. \The country needs to broaden the source of revenue if we want to retain the benefits of this program while being competitive and fair to smaller business and lower-waged employees. \Think how positive to the economy it would be to eliminate a tax on payroll while allowing lower-wage employees to have more spendable income. \We should eliminate payroll taxes on businesses and workers and increase the personal and corporate income taxes on each tax bracket. \Corporations could instantly become more competitive. Most consumers would have greater take-home pay, and taxes would be more fairly aligned to the broader application and variety of beneficiaries of Social Security while being consistent with being progressive instead of regressive. \-- Sheldon I.

Global warming leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration and timing of weather and climate extremes, and can result in unprecedented environmental extremes.\""Changes in extremes can directly be related to changes in mean climate, because mean future conditions in some variables are projected to lie within the tails of present-day conditions.""\MICHAEL MANN\Director, Earth System Science Center at Penn State\""We are currently engaged in an unprecedented and uncontrolled experiment with the only planet we know that can support life, including us. That should give us pause.\""The good news is that there is still time to act in a way that will avert catastrophic climate change, but we must act now. We must accelerate the transition already taking place away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. We must elect politicians who will support these actions and our interests rather than the polluting interests that are behind the problem."""

THE DEMOCRATS
\
Ann Callis vs. George Gollin vs. David Green
\
CHAMPAIGN -- Champaign Democrat David Green may not have won the hearts of the more than 100 people at a congressional candidates forum Thursday night, but he certainly stood out.
\
Right from the start, the social-policy analyst at the University of Illinois set himself apart from his two better-known opponents, former Madison County Judge Ann Callis and UI physics professor George Gollin.
\
Asked what his priorities would be as Illinois' 13th Congressional District representative, Green said, ""Bringing our troops home and dismantling both our empire of bases and our unconstitutional national surveillance state, ending the unjust and racially biased war on drugs, which is a war against the poor and a war against black males, and ending poverty, especially among children in this wealthy country.""
\
Gollin said his top priority is bringing jobs into the congressional district that stretches from Champaign-Urbana on the northeast to Edwardsville and Collinsvile on the southwest.
\
""We would like to move toward producing clean energy. We would like to increase the affordability of education,"" he said. ""We would like to make sure that the Affordable Care Act evolves into something that works productively.""
\
Callis, who lives in Edwardsville, said her top issues would be jobs, ending income inequality and preserving Social Security and Medicare.
\
""What's going on in Springfield, for instance, is that there are investments in rehabbing homes in blighted areas,"" she said. ""If we expand on those programs with good prevailing-wage jobs, we can replicate that and people can become first-time homebuyers and we can stimulate our economy immediately.""
\
The three agreed on many issues, including support for same-sex marriage, the Senate immigration reform bill that has not been taken up by the House and a carbon tax that would reduce pollution.
\
On the latter, Gollin said, ""This is an issue that shows why it would be helpful to have scientific expertise in Congress. We really need to embed questions about specific energy policies into a much larger program involving new forms of energy production, how to deal with the waste that comes about from nuclear (power) and other things.""
\
[Callis was less certain, saying, ""Well I think that the climate change issue is a grave, grave issue not only for the U.S., but also for the world. And now that we've had, I know some of you have heard this, in just the past few weeks we've had terribly cold weather across this nation, and now people are saying, they are denying that climate change exists just because its cold outside, denying 30 years trends, an abundance of scientific evidence. So I do believe that we have to make some changes and really be cognizant of what is going on with our environment.""]
\
Callis said ""people shouldn't be discriminated against by whom they love.""
\
Regarding preserving the Social Security system, Green and Gollin suggested removing the cap on the payroll tax.
\
""On that basis,"" Green said, ""with rich people paying the same flat tax on their entire income, we could probably lower the level of the payroll tax and increase payments from something like $1,200 a month to $1,500 per month.""
\
Gollin added, ""All it takes to fix (Social Security) is to remove the cap on income that is set at roughly $120,000. There's no reason that someone earning a million dollars a year should pay he same amount into the system as someone earning $120,000 a year.""
\
Callis said she opposes a ""chained CPI"" that would limit Social Security benefit growth ""and any type of privatization of Social Security that was proposed by the Republicans.""
\
Gollin and Callis endorsed a plan to allow graduates to pay off their college loans with either community, volunteer or military service.
\
""This is something we've been talking about off and on in higher ed for quite a while. It's a very good idea,"" Gollin said.
\
Callis added, ""It would be a fantastic idea for people who want to dedicate their lives to public service then to be able to graduate from these programs without debt.""
\
But Green responded, ""I don't accept the assumption that students should be graduated from school in debt.""
\
He said college, preschool and day care should be subsidized by the government.
\
""How about making it really simple? Let's make college free. Let's get rid of student debt and then we won't have to have all of these convoluted ways of solving a problem that shouldn't be there in the first place,"" he said.
\
Among those at Thursday's forum was David Gill, the Bloomington physician who was the 13th District's Democratic candidate against Republican Rodney Davis in 2012. Gill lost by less than a half a percentage point in a three-way race.
\
(A-1:
\
On what candidates for Congress should do for their constituents:
\
Democrat George Gollin (below): ""We should be engaged. We should be fearless and we should not float high above the countryside in a bubble. We should not hide from the voters by refusing debates and fleeing from people ... asking hard questions."")
\
THE REPUBLICANS
\
Erika Harold vs. Michael Firsching
\
CHAMPAIGN -- Attending the Republican Congressional debate in Champaign on Thursday night was like watching the final round of the Miss America Pageant, except that one of the finalists was in Trenton, N.J., instead of host city Atlantic City.
\
Attorney, former Miss America and GOP candidate Erika Harold of Urbana faced off in a debate against veterinarian Michael Firsching of Midway (near Edwardsville) at the Champaign City Building, but incumbent Rodney Davis was about 45 miles away, taking part in the Decatur Lincoln Day Dinner.
\
""I would want to go to Washington, D.C., and be willing to make votes that might be unpopular if I ultimately thought they served my constituents' best interests,"" Harold said.
\
""My entire life government has gotten bigger and bigger,"" Firsching said. ""Government at the federal level should be small and constitutional.""
\
Harold said she has a greater commitment to reducing the national debt than Davis.
\
""I would not have supported the last budget because I thought it did very little to address the largest drivers of our national debt and sort of kicked the can down the road,"" she said. ""Not only did that budget not address spending, but it targeted the very nominal cuts that were made toward veterans' pensions. To me that was unacceptable because we were asking sacrifice from the one group of people who sacrificed the most.""
\
Harold said her life experience as an attorney representing businesses also differentiates her from Davis.
\
""I believe that most of his experience has been spent working in the political process. Mine has been spent working in the private sector,"" she said. ""I believe if you have private-sector experience, where you are representing businesses and working with people who have to make a budget and have to deal with a profit margin, it gives you are greater appreciation for the importance of not saddling businesses with unnecessary regulations.""
\
Harold said she is the person who can uniquely help the Republican Party ""to grow in ways to engage people who are not currently engaged in the Republican Party.""
\
Firsching described himself as more of a constitutionalist and economist than his two opponents. He said his primary goal is to promote more regional and local control over people's lives.
\
""My emphasis is going to be to get the country back under control instead of this endless growth, bigger and bigger government and more and more deficit spending,"" he said. ""We've got to get some sense back into government.""
\
He said he favors a shift toward more private-sector involvement in people's lives rather than government.
\
""I'm running not because Rodney Davis isn't a nice guy, because I think he really is. But I definitely disagree with him politically as far as the role of government,"" he said. ""He has voted yes for too many things which increased the size of government, increased budgets.""
\
Harold said she would oppose any efforts to eliminate federal Pell grants, which provide money for students who need it to pay for college.
\
""I want to make sure that this on-ramp to our educational system is something that is important,"" Harold said. ""I was able to pay for my law school education in a unique way. I became Miss America to pay for law school, but I know that most students are not going to become Miss America to pay for school.""
\
Firsching disagreed, saying the number one cause of the skyrocketing cost of education is too much money being made available from the federal government.
\
""What we need to be doing is bring universities back to a market model,"" he said. ""We need to get back to the days when you can go to school and pay for it by doing a side job.""
\
Harold said her top three priorities if she is elected would be reducing the national debt, reforming the healthcare system and protecting constitutional freedoms.
\
""I don't think the Affordable Healthcare Act has served constituents well,"" she said. ""I've heard people throughout the district talk about losing their insurance programs and having to pay increased premiums.""
\
Firsching said his top three priorities would be addressing concerns over the federal reserve system, balancing the budget and making government smaller.
\
""My priorities reflect my extreme trepidation about the financial precipice I think we are on,"" he said. ""I think our economy is suffering due to government dominating and not giving the private sector much of a chance.""
\
The debate was sponsored by the NAACP, the League of Women Voters and The News-Gazette.
\
[The three Republicans have agreed to an on-air radio debate from 7 to 8 a.m. March 10 on Bloomington radio station WRPW 92.9 FM.]

160,"Cuba Twp. pantry grateful for food\To the editor: This years Barrington Fourth of July parade was another successful and fun event. Many thanks to Melissa Bingham and her committee for organizing the parade and for adding the food collection to the parade activities. Cuba Township was happy to be a recipient of the food collection.\In these stressful economic times, the Cuba Township food pantry is being called on more than ever to assist our residents. As the daily demands on the pantry have left the shelves almost bare, this infusion of food from the parade collection came at a fortunate time.\The pantry is always happy to accept donations of nonperishable food items and gifts cards to grocery stores.\If you are interested in making a donation, or have need of assistance from the pantry, contact the Cuba Township office at (847) 381-1924.\Priscilla RoseCuba Township clerk\and all Cuba Township elected officials\Barrington\Who says it isnt about the money?\To the editor: In response to your story, ""Elk Grove Resident Drops Idea of Red Light Camera Referendum,"" Id like to direct comments at Elk Grove Mayor Craig Johnson, and, indirectly, at the village board of trustees.\Mayor Johnson stated ""we do not govern by referendums."" In the U.S., we rely on our elected officials to execute the will of the people. We are not, however, required to sit on the sidelines while a small group of government officials install a program whose merits are debatable.\The villages Red Light Photo Enforcement System is ... an overzealous attempt to raise revenue under the guise of safety. True, they have reduced right-angled impacts significantly. They also, however, increase rear impacts as drivers panic and (stop suddenly) to avoid a ticket.\Additionally, the draconian fee of $100, which cannot be directly contested in court, is assessed by a person miles away, looking at just two photographs of a vehicle as it passes over electronic sensors embedded in the roadway.\The fee is completely without reason. How can one expect residents to look past the revenue-building intent of the camera project when such an exorbitant fee is assessed? What is the fee for an unlawful right-on-red when conducted in the presence of an officer, rather than a camera? According to Village Code, as low as $25.\Trustees, I encourage you to halt the construction of new Red Light Cameras pending a study of their effectiveness, a review of the fines and reform in how tickets are processed. Residents should see statistics on exactly how many accidents are prevented, and how many rear-end collisions are caused as a result of the cameras.\In addition, a report on the accuracy of the cameras, and the rate at which tickets are dismissed by the ""Traffic Control Administrator"" or overturned in court should be furnished. Should the cameras be found ineffective, or unfair, I would demand their permanent removal.\Mayor Johnson, your comment is irresponsible, ignorant and pathetic. You should know that you hold your position at the mercy of the people. I know that I am not alone in longing for the day you are the former mayor of Elk Grove Village.\Dustin Sneath\Elk Grove Village\Owe a lot to those who came before\To the editor: Thank you for publishing Viola Straubs memories of growing up in rural Schaumburg.\So many of her memories remind me of the memories that my mother had of growing up on a farm on the North Dakota prairie. Asmy motherwas born in late 1910, she and Viola were contemporaries.\Stories such as this serve to give all those of us who take todays modern lifestyle for granted a deeper respect for those whose lives have gone into providing us with what we now have.\I do have one tiny comment that will surely serve to date me. The caption beneath the photo of the family gathered around the 1917 Studebaker says it shows ""little Viola sitting on the fender"".\It would appear that perhaps she is sitting on what was known as the running board. Cars no longer have them, but when I try to climb into our daughters SUV, I very much wish that they did!\Betty Grenda\Mount Prospect\Lets put camera at Anderson, Williams\To the editor: I am wondering if village vehicles are exempt from the ""red-light cameras""? I am also wondering why bicyclists that blow stop signs are not stopped and ticketed? If they were stopped and ticketed and publicity given, bicyclists would not be blowing through stop signs!\Williams Drive in Palatine is particularly dangerous. This is a stretch that has many 4-way stops. At Anderson and Williams, on Sundays, with the church traffic parked up to the stop signs, its just a matter of time before an accident involving a cyclist happens.\Not only do the cyclists deserve tickets for blowing through the 4-way stops, the churchgoers deserve tickets for not parking 10 feet from the stop signs! These would be legitimate safety concerns that would deserve citations; not some red-light ticket minutia.\Six months ago, the police were notified of this concern ... today, the problems still exist. Perhaps the location of Anderson and Williams would be a good location for a camera.\Gordon Speake\Palatine\Join Rotary at Flyers game on July 30\To the editor: As you may know, charities throughout the United States are having a\hard time raising funds. Since the economy has slowed, contributions are down over 33 percent and charitable programs are in trouble. The long-standing principle: ""We are judged by the way we treat those who are least able to take care of themselves"" could not be more true than it is today.\We at Schaumburg A.M. Rotary are doing something about it. On July 30, we are teaming up with the Schaumburg Flyers for a night at Alexian Field to raise funds for the many local charities.\Schaumburg Village President Al Larson has proclaimed July 30 ""Schaumburg A.M. Rotary night at Alexian Field"". One hundred percent of the profits will go to area, local and national charities.\Here in the area we have for nearly 20 years contributed to organizations such as Schaumburg Township Food Pantry, Childrens Home & Aid Society, Clearbrook and Alfred Campanelli YMCA among others. In addition, we have received donations that will enable 800 needy young people from Childrens Home & Aid, Kenneth Young, Clearbrook and Alfred Campanelli YMCA to attend the game as our special guests.\Our work is not done; our goal is to raise $50,000 in contributions to help our charities meet their budget short falls. We need your support.\Rotary Night with the Flyers features a minor-league baseball game on Thursday, July 30: Schaumburg Flyers vs. Fargo Redhawks. The game starts at 7:05 p.m. Gates open at 5:35 p.m.\Tickets are $5 for lawn seats and $10 for reserved seats with 100 percent of the proceeds going to help organizations in need in our communities.\Tickets must be purchased in advance at www.rotaryfundraiser.org.\Please order as soon as possible so we can get them to you in time for the event.\Earl Bateman, president\Schaumburg A.M. Rotary Club\Wise Road work is Schaumburg project\To the editor: In recent months and with now increasing concern of government spending I have been approached while doing drive around inspections and have received phone calls with concern to the cost/expense of the Wise Road Project from Plum Grove Road to Roselle Road.\I must tell you that the project in question is the jurisdiction of the village of Schaumburg. I must direct any concerns and/or comments to the village of Schaumburg.\In the past as an example Spring South was a joint jurisdiction construction project from wise road to Irving Park Road and the relationship between the two government agencies worked very well for a reasonable finished product. The Mayor of Schaumburg Mr. Larson was very involved at that time to prevent any raise in taxes from the Schaumburg budget, and I myself did not have to increase taxes to pay for Spring South Road.\Robert A. Fecarotta\Schaumburg Township Highway Commissioner\Schaumburgs true motivator is money\To the editor: To anyone that read your red-light articles it should be obvious that there is one and only reason for these cameras existence and that is they are money generating devices for the government.\Claiming that these cameras are installed for safety reasons is like saying the proposed carbon tax is going to save the environment.\The real motivation for these is that they are an indirect way to get more tax dollars flowing into the government. If by some off chance there is a slight improvement in safety it is truly unplanned for and a totally relevant side effect.\Another side effect of these cameras is that they promote the idea that it is perfectly normal to have government watching over you at all times.\While I applaud Schaumburgs decision to remove their red-light cameras I suspect that their decision had more to do with money than the concern over an individuals rights or safety.\That $100,000 collected in fines was a potential $100,000 not spent at Woodfield Mall plus how many people might decide to not visit the mall because of the possibility of getting a $100 ticket?\Richard Gideon\Schaumburg\At the Barn, its all about the seniors\To the editor: The Senior Advisory Council of the Schaumburg Barn would like to thank the Daily Herald for providing the community with information about the ""Barn Cafe."" The mission of the Barn is: ""No senior should go hungry!""\Due to information provided by your newspaper, we have recently seen an increase of guests enjoying the nutritious meals, offered daily, at a low cost.\The Barn also provides companionship, enjoyment, health clinics, exercise, entertainment, trips, talks and much more to alleviate any isolation that seniors may experience in being alone. Bus service by the Schaumburg Township and Pace can also accommodate those who are unable to drive.\We, at the Barn are seniors, concerned about seniors, dedicated to seniors, and pooling resources to enrich our/their lives.\Lori Kandl, president\Senior Advisory Council\Schaumburg Barn"
161," Sometimes we in journalism think we have all the answers. Then something happens that makes us sit up and take notice of what you have to say about the course of events in your nation.\ A humbling awareness settles on us at that instant.\ We may well have a franchise on ink and paper or a name on a Web site, but we don't control the franchise on thought, on passion, on ideas.\ Before Christmas, I asked on the op-ed page for readers to help revive Newt Gingrich's 1994 ""Contract With America,"" which was a brilliant idea that was flawed in its execution.\ One takes a risk when one solicits a response. It was with no small concern that I made the offer. What if no one replied? What would that say about how we talk with you and about how you talk with us?\ One of the best Christmas surprises of all came in the form of more than 160 e-mails from readers who took their holiday time to offer their own agendas for the nation as we head into this congressional election year.\ We have read every response.\ Many of them are published here as submitted. Many have suffered a little editing, and some a lot of editing, solely because we wanted to publish as many as we could. It's clear that passion fueled a lot of the offerings. We tried to trim them to their essence and apologize for compressing those thoughts. Would that we had an eternity of ink and paper!\ We offer still more contracts at chicagotribune.com.\ In no case was the process like being trapped in a bar beside someone you only want to escape. It was more like sitting in a big bright room where the conversation of democracy was under way, with all of its passion and hope.\ We present these ideas with thanks, as a reminder that politics belongs not to the media, not to the lobbyists, not to the interest groups, and not even to the politicians.\ It belongs to the people who still hold optimism in their hearts and practical thought in their heads about what their nation represents today and what it can represent tomorrow.\ -- Charles M. Madigan, Perspective editor\ - - -\ Replace political aristocracy with democracy by limiting the number of terms for both elected and appointed officials to two consecutive terms. After changing ""jobs"" for a minimum of one term they can then be re-elected or reappointed for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The cycle could be repeated indefinitely.\ A.F. Cieszkiewicz\  Peoria\ - - -\ If the federal government were doing only what the Constitution authorizes, we would have a stronger, freer and more prosperous America. We would have a national government that does a few things well, instead of one that does everything ineptly.\ If the political consensus were there (which, of course, it is not), the process of transitioning to a constitutional government would be fairly straightforward and painless: All government agencies other than those necessary to carry out constitutional functions would either transition to private status--if their services could be competitively offered in a free market--or package everyone out with generous pensions, which would come from their generous budgets.\ Alan M. Perlman\ Highland Park\ - - -\ End government that is too big, too intrusive and too easy with the public's money. Have a Congress that respects the values and shares the faith of the American family. Also, Congress should obey the same laws as everyone else. Have independent auditors to check the books. Committees and staffs should be reduced. Committee chairmanships and congressional terms should be limited to two terms. Committee meetings should be open to the public. Tax increases should require a three-fifth's majority. Zero-based budgeting should be implemented.\ Bob Moriarty\ Hoffman Estates\ - - -\ Ideas for a new ""Contract With America?"" I'll give you one:\ Elected officials should ignore the silly, predictable suggestions of partisan newspaper columnist named Madigan.\ Bruce Allardice\ Des Plaines\ - - -\ P.S. Needless to say, I don't expect this suggestion to ever appear in print.\ Stop corporate welfare, including the welfare to large farming interests and contractors in Iraq.\ Bob Fisk\ Schaumburg\ - - -\ Election finance reform will be enacted.\ Campaign contributions will be limited to $100,000 per candidate, and active campaigning will be limited to six months prior to the election. Corporate donations will be limited to a total of $50,000, collectively. Candidates will not be allowed negative rhetoric toward opponents, and must state goals and plans. Voting machines will be required to produce a paper copy of ballots.\ Children and families of all citizens will have medical coverage, paid for through fair taxation of every citizen, including corporations and the wealthiest citizens. Poverty-level citizens will be required to enroll in educational programs and job training programs if they are receiving government subsidies.\ Child-care and transportation vouchers will be provided as needed. All working parents at or below a defined income level shall receive vouchers to help pay for child care or shall receive tax deductions for child-care expenses.\ Incarcerated citizens shall be required to participate in the above programs, including drug rehabilitation, when applicable. Gerrymandering of congressional districts to favor one party or another will be illegal.\ The term ""war"" shall not be used unless it refers to a military conflict (""war on drugs,"" ""war on poverty,"" etc.), and military conflicts shall not be fought unless we are attacked or go to the defense of a nation that has been attacked.\ In the event of an attack on our country, we will go after the perpetrators. Other countries having nothing to do with the assault will not be attacked unless they can be proven to be actively supporting the perpetrators.\ U.S. corporations with ""headquarters"" offshore will be taxed at the same rate as those who are within the boundaries of our country. Guns will be illegal unless it is proven through the purchase of hunting licenses that they are to be used for hunting. Violation will result in a substantial fine.\ Possession of assault weapons will result in a higher fine. Community service will be mandatory. No religion shall influence decisions made by our Congress, the judiciary, the president, his Cabinet or other governmental appointees.\ Barbara Blades\ Evanston\ - - -\ We, the members of both houses of Congress, hereby agree:\ That no amendment(s) will be attached to any legislation unless it pertains completely to that particular legislation.\ That all favorite state appropriations (better known as pork- barrel spending) will not be presented to either house of Congress for consideration until all other appropriations pertaining to domestic and international spending has been approved and paid for.\ That no legislation will be passed without a complete reading on the House and Senate floors.\ That there will be no automatic pay increases, including cost-of- living adjustments, when our nation is facing a financial crisis and/ or outspends its fiscal budget.\ That we will change our current health-care program to a less expensive HMO program. This HMO program will remain in effect until both houses of Congress design, approve and implement a national health-care program.\ That any members convicted of a federal, state or local crime, abuse of power, and/or unethical behavior will hereby surrender their government pension.\ That no lobbying group shall submit any legislation to any one member of Congress.\ That no member of either house of Congress shall receive gifts of any kind, favors, rewards, airline tickets, vacations or fact- finding travels paid by any lobbyist group.\ That we will have national campaign spending caps. No political party shall accept contributions from any corporation, company or lobbyist. All contributions shall be made by individuals; no contributions shall exceed $500; and each political party will receive 100 hours of free commercial time to air their respective candidates' campaign commercials on their local PBS station. Presidential campaign spending will be capped at $5 million; Senate campaigns will be capped at $2 million, and House campaigns will be capped at $1.5 million.\ That we will have in place in every national election a computer system that prints out each vote so that the voter can confirm that they have indeed voted for their chosen candidate.\ That there will be no more ""no-bid"" contracts given out by any body of Congress or any branch of government, including the executive branch.\ That no corporations or companies shall receive a government contract if they have ever been convicted of defrauding the United States government.\ That any corporations or companies doing business with the United States government must submit an honest estimate for any job for which they are bidding, and any corporation or company that falls behind in fulfilling contractual obligations shall be held responsible for cost overruns and will not be paid until said work is completed.\ Ann de Broux\ Park Forest\ - - -\ We are the only ""civilized"" country in the world without a national health-care system. It is inhuman that there are so many millions of uninsured and underinsured people. Health insurance must become an entitlement for every man, woman and child in this country, whether or not they are employed.\ It must offer the same benefits to everyone, and must be administered by a single payer.\ The level of education in this country is a disgrace. We must come up with a system that will truly educate all children so that they can be competent in their daily lives and compete on a level playing field in the new global economy. The system must be funded fully and fairly, and not solely dependent on the resources of the community in which a child lives.\ We are competing in a global marketplace. Our manufacturing jobs have long since disappeared. ... We have to find new ways to make a living, and people will have to retrain themselves to meet the needs of this century. It does no good to have Wal-Mart supply us with cheap goods from India or China if we have no income with which to pay for them.\ How do we pay for all the new programs? Well, we could get out of this war, for one thing. And those of us who are still working are just going to have to pay more taxes.\ Is it too much to ask that our representatives be honest, moral, ethical people? Not ""born-again"" not ""concerned about family values,"" but just ordinary people who do the right thing simply because it is right?\ Barbara Lipkin\ Naperville\ - - -\ My contract will have an America in which people can afford health care and obtain health care that is not injurious to their health.\ Everyone will pay premiums, but the premiums will be determined by income and three broad age categories (18-35, 36-50 and 51-64). There will no longer be employer-based insurance. Insurers will market only to individuals, not as they do now, in very discriminatory campaigns for large corporate clients.\ Related to high health-care costs is that 98,000 people per year die of errors, accidents and infections in hospitals!\ All that it would take to change that is for the president and Congress to say that the number of deaths must be reduced 50 percent in the first year (that's 2007), 50 percent again in 2008, and 75 percent in 2009. Any hospital that doesn't comply is closed. Period, zip, done, gone.\ Beth Lisberg Najberg\ Chicago\ - - -\ In conjunction with the Iraqi government, develop a timetable for the gradual withdrawal of our troops from Iraq. Develop a timetable for the implementation of the recommendations of the 9/11 commission. Develop a plan to support educational opportunities for the poor and the disadvantaged, recognizing that education is the best weapon to fight the war on poverty.\ Develop a plan that will ensure the solvency of Medicare. Develop an option that will offer health insurance to the 46 million people currently not covered. Simplify the income tax law and close all loopholes for big business. Select and fund an energy research committee of leading scientists to develop sources of energy that will reduce or eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels.\ Develop a plan to reduce emissions that pollute our rivers, lakes and air. Develop a plan of increased revenue and decreased spending that will eliminate the federal deficit over a stated period of time.\ Enact laws that will make it difficult to obtain guns, that will limit the types of guns that may be obtained, and that will require a user's test and license before a gun can be used. Eliminate tax cuts for the wealthy and reduce taxes for the poor.\ Develop a Peace Corps that serves depressed areas in the United States.\ Ron Fraser\ Yorkville\ - - -\ The American people have the right to expect that their government will treat taxpayer contributions for retirement and health care (Social Security and Medicare) as a secure, personal investment in our future.\ The current entitlement system cannot guarantee the availability of funds beyond 2019 and must be radically overhauled. Representing both the largest payroll deduction for most Americans and the largest budget item (collectively) for the federal government, retirement and health-care funding must be built on personal savings using a secure, forward-looking system that allows the American people to provide for themselves.\ Richard Biederman\ Naperville\ - - -\ As an American citizen I vow to become more knowledgeable about the current issues of governance facing our country and fulfill my obligation and eligibility to vote in every election.\ In so doing, I expect political officeholders and aspirants to always speak the truth and to consider the value of their every position on issues to be based upon what is truly best for the good of the public.\ Put aside cronyism in favor of honest deliberation of and decisions on the issues and votes confronting every political office.\ Endeavor to always abide with the courage and rationality of the rule of law.\ Reject rumormongering in favor of searching out and promoting truth about elected officials and issues we confront.\ Encourage the qualities of fair and honest leadership to be developed in everyone. From citizens to politicians, we will work to find new directions through ideological differences to bind ourselves to the facts of real issues that face our nation, states and municipalities.\ Do better in promoting the ideals of American democracy in our Bill of Rights.\ Seek political office to serve an ideal for improving our government, but not to serve an opportunity for enabling greed.\ Robert Hageman\ Carbondale\ - - -\ How's this for a back-of-the-envelope health plan?\ Everyone (even illegal aliens) in the U.S. is covered by Medicare, funded by a 10 percent sales tax on all goods and services including housing. This program does not forbid private insurance for better or supplemental health coverage. The destitute can have a reasonable amount of their tax refunded. This refund-what-you-spend- on-sales-tax approach will cut down on the amount one can cheat because if one spends more than what one reports, one is paying extra taxes on that. A person's credit report can also be used to see how much they're spending versus how much income they are reporting.\ The elderly, who already are on Medicare and would be pretty upset about paying a new sales tax for it, would no longer have to pay a separate premium. Long-term care would be included in Medicare.\ Charles Amenta III\ Flossmoor\ - - -\ The first item should be a detailed list of each vote legislators casts in each session, accompanied by a total of any funds they receive directly from that business group or the group's direct lobbyist.\ Example: A member of Congress votes to restrict the government from negotiating a volume discount for the Medicare drug plan. The next day in the newspapers (front page, preferably) and in the broadcast media the total contributions from drug companies or Pharma, their lobbying group, should be listed next to the legislator's name.\ It might not change where legislators get their money, or even how they vote, but at least they couldn't claim to be ""for the people.""\ Chris Stevens\ Bradford\ - - -\ The first thing I would like to see in this contract is an agreement that, from the moment a person announces his/her candidacy, each word spoken will be the truth.\ I'm not asking that they give up secrets. It's perfectly OK if a candidate or officeholder says, ""I don't want to answer that question."" It's also OK for them to say, ""I hope to do this, but that's only my best opinion right now, and I might change it later.""\ What's not OK is when Lyndon Johnson says our ships were in international waters when they were attacked without cause; when Richard Nixon says he has a secret plan to end the war in Vietnam; when George H.W. Bush promises no new taxes; when Bill Clinton says he did not have sex with that woman; or when President Bush says Saddam is buying uranium from Niger.\ What I'd like to see to enforce this is simple: A written, signed, legally-binding contract that if the person is caught lying- -making a provably false statement to the public on an issue of significance--then he/she will abandon the campaign or resign from office.\ When candidates get elected, perhaps we should add a legally binding oath of truthfulness to the oath of office, so that any politician who lies in office can be convicted of perjury.\ Dan Starr\ St. Charles\ - - -\ Simplify the tax code and make it fairer. Americans shouldn't get to pay less in taxes just because they are cleverer or can hire more clever accountants. And why should lobbyists be able to influence tax rules that favor one industry over another? For a country founded on the cry of ""no taxation without representation,"" we seem awfully willing to go along with a system in which most of us are not represented.\ Develop an energy policy aimed at eliminating the use of oil as a fuel. Ever since I can remember--I'm 45--it has been clear that most of our political, military and environmental problems are connected to our use of oil as a fuel. This couldn't happen overnight so the people in the oil industry now would have plenty of time to find and adjust to new jobs--they'll adjust just like the typewriter repairmen, milkmen, icemen and coal deliverymen did when their jobs dried up due to technological advances.\ Get the NHL out of the South. Any place where you can't ice skate outside on an unrefrigerated surface even for a few weeks a year has no business having a hockey team.\ Figure out a way to make our health-care system more fair and affordable. We might also start by working toward having a system where basic coverage is not tied to your job.\ Dave Evans\ Glen Ellyn\ - - -\ For people:\ Elect politicians who practice what they preach. Isn't it odd that all the ""good morals"" and ""family values"" politicians are usually the ones with convictions or secret sexual fantasies? Use common sense. Although fun, ideology hardly goes anywhere. It's not practical, and it doesn't work often.\ We need a government that is pragmatic, but in order to do that, we have to be the same. Stay informed. It is truly sad when more people know about Paris Hilton or Jessica Simpson than about current events.\ Limit government oversight. Government regulating commerce? Fine. Government limiting pornography on TV? No problem. Government in charge of disaster relief? Sure.\ Government telling me it's morally wrong and illegal to marry, say, my gerbil? No!\ Stop the pork. Every attachment to a bill would have to be approved by the majority of the Congress. It seems like a big waste of time, but come on, do you want money for homeland security to be spent on air-conditioned garbage trucks?\ For politicians:\ Welcome to the club, brother/sister! As a member of Congress, you are now entitled to represent the people ... or something like that. To tell the truth, no member of Congress has really read the Constitution. That 18th Century writing is really confusing. And you never will, if you sign this wonderful contract.\ Be forewarned--by signing this document, you are legally, politically, economically, militarily and metaphysically bound to this document. Failure to abide by it will result in a strongly worded memo. Also, you won't get a Christmas card.\ The principles:\ Always fight the other party. Even if you agree with them, try to call them liberals or fascists.\ Avoid facts. Facts are the bread and butter of the snobby intellectual/devout believer, but the populace eats them like candy.\ Use fiery rhetoric with some facts (God forbid you should include a complete fact). Also, use polarizing remarks, like ""All Democrats are going to hell"" or ""Jesus was never alive.""\ Pork. Pork. Pork! If a bill doesn't have any unnecessary appropriations, it's a not good bill. Why can't your district be encircled with a wall of fire? Attach it to a defense spending bill, and you're guaranteed passage!\ Always use good language. In every speech you make, use the words: American, democracy, freedom, enemy, liberty, God and bless. Try not to overdo it, though. The media hates those types of sound bites.\ David Thomas\ West Chicago\ - - -\ We are at a moment in American and world history when old paradigms are no longer adequate for the challenges of today. We promise to approach these challenges with imagination and creativity, to draw ideas from every sector of society and from every political persuasion and to innovate boldly.\ We promise to replace America's current arrogance toward the rest of the world with a confident openness and a readiness to listen and learn from others. We will become a world leader in reducing our dependence on oil and innovating in alternative, sustainable sources of energy. We will create a national health-care system that serves all Americans, that is both efficient and effective and that provides incentives for wellness.\ We will become a world leader in preserving and restoring our environment. We will use our enormous creativity to build an educational system that is funded as well as our military, that nurtures self-respect, that promotes excellence and that serves all our children. We will manage our national finances with the same sense of responsibility that we use to manage our personal finances.\ We will be consistently pro-life by abolishing the death penalty, reducing abortions through education and birth-control programs and fostering non-violent conflict resolution in our schools, communities and in foreign relations. We will sponsor a national service program for all young adults, which includes the military as an option for service. We will address terrorism by creating a program of national security that balances our safety and our liberties by creating a seamless system of national and international cooperation in identifying and apprehending terrorists, and by again becoming a champion of oppressed people.\ R. Cotton Fite\ Wilmette\ - - -\ Line Item veto (with only 60 percent needed to override). Amendments to a bill must be related to the bill itself. No legislation could become law without first being subjected to a ""find the loophole"" contest where the first person to identify a given loophole in the legislation would win a $10,000 prize. Then that loophole must be closed. A loophole would be one that allows a person to defraud the government or allows a person to violate the spirit of the law without violating the letter of the law.\ All pay raises for local, state and national legislators must be approved by the people during the general election.\ David Thiessen\ Woodstock\ - - -\ We must end government by lobbyists. Special interest representatives may present facts on the record, period. Any violation will have severe penalties. We will ban all political contributions (and add a $5 mandatory ""voter education fund"" from every taxpayer).\ PACs must identify funding before they utter a word and be held accountable for misstatements. We will ban political ads on television and radio; sound bites and mini-soaps are meant to sell stuff, not judges or presidents. True debates are encouraged.\ Any bill coming before the House or Senate must be limited to a single subject.\ All federal agency employees, even heads of agencies, must have appropriate knowledge, training and experience.\ No-bid federal contracts are outlawed; a full audit and investigation of Halliburton-KBR projects will be done.\ Entitlement programs will be redefined to include all benefits routinely received by corporations, and full disclosure made of the dollar value of the benefits to each recipient.\ Transforming corporate entitlement programs to ""fees for services or uses"" will help reduce the deficit. Checks and balances will be restored. If at any time both the House and Senate are controlled by one party and the president is of that party, an automatic declaration of a state of national imbalance will kick in.\ A special SWAT team of professors of constitutional law, economics and global relations will serve as the oversight team with full veto power.\ All federal judges will serve for no longer than 15 years and may not accept employment in the private commercial sector.\ Members of Congress will serve for no longer than 15 years and may not accept employment in the private commercial sector.\ Retirement benefits of judges and Congress will be reduced based on years of service and years of work life remaining. The projected savings will fund private HMO premiums for those who cannot afford health insurance.\ It shall be an impeachable offense for a president to use the influence of his office to slander a group of professionals, such as trial lawyers and journalists, to brand dissidents as disloyal Americans or to disparage the right to trial by jury.\ Any member of Congress who publicly disparages another will lose his right to vote for a fixed time.\ States' rights will be respected.\ Debra Thomas\ Glen Ellyn\ - - -\ To counter the disconnect between government and the people in the taxation without representation society that we have become, I propose to either eliminate all lobbying in Washington or to create a third house in Congress that would serve only the people. This would free up the present two houses to continue to represent (so obediently) the lobbyists and corporations they now serve. Also, any president or member of Congress caught lying to the people would receive the same punishment given to an individual who lies to them.\ Roy Dehn\ Lisle\ - - -\ I support legislation and amendments to remove redistricting from the legislature and make it the responsibility of a non-partisan commission so that constituents choose their representatives instead of representatives choosing their constituents. Real campaign finance reform will limit the amount that can be spent on campaigns and require timely revelation of contributors. This may create an atmosphere in which legislators actually represent their constituency instead of their paymasters.\ Don Thomas\ Homewood\ - - -\ I would propose that every new bill making its way through Congress be of only one subject, and between one and 10 pages long-- no longer.\ D. Kolinger\ Pentwater, Mich.\ - - -\ We need public financing of elections with limited free airtime for incumbents and challengers, including third party candidates. We need uniform national voting standards with all voting machines regulated and verified by experts from universities, not private industry. Presently only 10 states are committed to use electronic voting machines with a paper trail.\ Edie Abajian\ Arlington Heights\ - - -\ We need to restore people's trust in their government.\ The popularity of term limits shows that people realize that politicians control their own re-election too much. Part of the problem is that redistricting has become a tool for politicians to re-elect themselves, or choose the political party or race of the candidate that will represent a district.\ The stakes are so high in the redistricting that states have had redistricting decided by flips of a coin or by draws from a hat. Others have had redistricting done by an unelected (and not directly accountable) judge. The Constitution gives the federal government the power to ""guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government."" (Article IV, Section 4).\ It should use that power to put an end to the practice of politicians selecting their voters, and institute non-partisan ways of drawings district lines so that politicians have to serve voters.\ Erik Flom\ Chicago\ - - -\ The contract I propose begins with a prohibition on using language to inflame rather than to inform.\ Nasty old ""taxes"" are, when it suits, wonderful ""infrastructure enhancement funds."" I'm sure you can think of other rhetorical dodges like that.\ The venerable ""Robert's Rules of Order"" may not be the operative parliamentary law in Congress, but it ought to be. The scurrilous practice of attaching an unrelated piece of legislation to a pending action would be ruled out of order by an alert and responsible chair, or, failing that, a member of the body could rise to move a division of the question on the ground that each must be considered separately.\ Raising the level of political discourse is widely desired. It would be helped greatly if every speaker would be held to account when he/she is guilty of argumentum ad hominem, which is one of the older rhetorical dodges. Don't try to discredit the person making an argument; discredit, if you can, the argument.\ Fred Reklau\ Winfield\ - - -\ We should have our elected officials pledge that when they assign responsibility, they will make certain that they have provided the necessary manpower and money. Leaving aside the obvious example of Iraq, we are regularly treated to coverage of congressional hearings in which our elected officials castigate assorted bureaucrats for failing to accomplish this or that task that is within their responsibility. Generally, the outcry is coming from the same folks who piled on the latest set of requirements more or less at the same time as they cut the budget and staffing of the responsible office.\ We should have our elected officials pledge to make new rules or regulations that can be read and understood by the average American. The latest obscenity is the Medicare drug legislation and all that has arrived in my mailbox on the subject. I'm pretty well-read and well-educated, but confronting this stuff is mind-numbing.\ Fred Drury\ Wheaton\ - - -\ How about this alternative to the nuclear option: Let's have a rule in both the House and Senate that all votes are cast like in the College of Cardinals. Everybody knows what they are voting for, but each vote is cast in perpetual secrecy. The bill being considered would be either up or down based on its own merits. Each member would cast his ballot based on conscience, as opposed to partisanship, because nobody could accuse him of not being loyal to the party or ideology. Lobbyists would be reluctant to give money or favors if they couldn't be sure of buying the vote.\ Citizens would have confidence that our representatives are acting on our behalf, not as loyal party members, or puppets of special interests. We would decide to re-elect them on the basis on what they did as an elected body, not as an individual, since most of us don't know what they voted for in the first place. I think that concept is the definition of a republic. I think even God would be in favor of this alternative.\ Fred Bricketto\ Naperville\ - - -\ I suggest that in middle and senior high schools--and in colleges and universities--we place the Constitution at the heart of the curriculum.\ We are a nation of laws and the Constitution is the primary document of ""We the people."" In addition to the Constitution, students could read landmark court cases that pertain to the various amendments.\ In light of recent events, such as President Bush's authorizing spying on our citizens, in violation of the 4th Amendment, and the recent ruling in Pennsylvania against the teaching of intelligent design in public schools--related to the 1st Amendment--we would do well if we could educate our citizens as much as possible about the laws that govern us all. The more informed we are, the more we stand ready to honor and uphold our form of democratic government.\ John Gabriel\ Chicago\ - - -\ Members of both parties in the House and Senate must have a mandatory social gathering every Friday from 4 to 6 p.m. Make these people hang out together over some drinks, cocktail weenies and Yahtzee. The idea behind this is that at the end of the day they're all just regular people with families, children, etc., and this is what defines them, not the policies of their political party.\ Anyone not in attendance at the social gathering must attend the next year's State of the Union address fully nude and with a sign around their neck that reads ""I have a problem playing with others.""\ Jeffrey Goodman\ Chicago\ - - -\ We should be represented by citizen-statesmen and stateswomen who would put the interests of our nation before their personal interests or outside special interests. There would be no term limits in this contract because the choice of representation should be left up to the people. That also means repealing the presidential term limit in the Constitution.\ Some of our current problems can be laid at the feet of people in government who forgot that they serve the citizens and not themselves or their agencies. Toward that end, an independent monitoring commission with people coming from outside government should be set up to include oversight over the three branches of government. This is not a grading system, but a review based on advancements and declines in service. The agency makes recommendations but is not responsible for any internal operations of governmental agencies.\ Let us contract to work on the generality of the problems and then with the final recommendations give back to those in authority the responsibility of implementing solutions.\ The contract should also include the right of medical care for all citizens regardless of income or other factors; care and respect for our elderly paid for by tax dollars with a decent standard of living for all elderly. We should eliminate the Senate. Proportional representation in the House of Representatives is sufficient for our needs. Also, Supreme Court justices should be limited to 10-year terms unless renewed by the president and House Judiciary Committee.\ Greg Cederlund\ Wheaton\ - - -\ First, members of each party will be allowed to hammer and tong each other while in session. However, once session is out they will act like gentlemen and quit calling each other names. Without this provision, nothing will ever get done.\ Second, lobbyists will no longer be the middlemen between constituents and their members of Congress.\ Third, members will devote the majority of their term doing our business rather than their business of running for re-election.\ Harold Prichard\ Glen Ellyn\ - - -\ Corporations are the most corrupting agents in the United States.\ The Supreme Court decision handed down in 1886 that declared a corporation is a person must be reversed. In fact, the private corporation must be dissolved. All businesses will be partnerships or sole proprietorships.\ Every person is entitled to universal, free health care.\ Every student who performs above average in school is entitled to advanced education at no cost.\ The media can be owned only by non-profit organizations.\ No person is worth more than 10 times another person's worth. Therefore, no person can be compensated more than 10 times the lowest paid person.\ No person can be denied the right to vote for the person of his or her choice.\ The vote always must count, even if it is a write-in.\ The Electoral College must be abolished, and candidates selected by direct vote.\ The federal judiciary system must be revamped.\ The Supreme Court must be increased to 21 members so that one president cannot have a significant influence on the philosophy of the court. At least two judges will be recalled at every quadrennial election. Additional federal judges can be recalled by a three- fifths vote.\ The computer and Internet have made it possible for citizens to vote directly on most if not all legislation. Only then can there be a possibility of true democracy.\ The Constitution was the result of a compromise on issues such as slavery and states. It is highly imperfect. The Founding Fathers intended for it to be replaced from time to time. It must be changed to a parliamentary system to be more inclusive and flexible.\ Harold Taggart\ Skokie\ - - -\ All citizens should remember they live in a representative democracy and each citizen has one precious vote.\ We must all partake in elections, from dogcatcher to president. Failing to do so undermines the concept of a representative democracy.\ Confidence must be established and maintained in the election process. The process should be tamper-proof at all levels.\ Candidates should say what they mean and mean what they say. When elected as a representative of the people, they should stay true to their campaign statements of intent.\ There can be no pork deals with the people's money, or with the professionals representing big companies.\ We must revise the tax system, creating equal opportunity for housing, health care and education (early childhood to graduate levels) for all citizens.\ Herb Philipsborn\ Northbrook\ - - -\ We need responsible government, including a balanced budget, an end to pork-barrel spending, and tougher ethics laws. We can have no illegal surveillance, no secret prisons and no rendition of terror suspects. We must also end American torture. We need renewed international priorities, such that pursuing a lower priority doesn't happen at the expense of higher priorities.\ Our priorities, in descending order: Safety at home, stopping nuclear proliferation, preventing genocide and advancing freedom and democracy.\ Jeff Pinzino\ Chicago\ - - -\ Individual initiative will remain the single greatest characteristic determining one's status in the U.S. This separates the U.S. from Europe. Most Europeans are still constrained to a great degree with the class of their birth; in the U.S., if you work hard you can rise.\ America was founded on a rebellion against taxation and a key point is the right to retain one's accumulated wealth. As a maximum cap on taxation, I propose 28 percent but modified upward based on the number of social programs one desires. If the most the government can tax is 28 percent, then every citizen can count on her or his own initiative and greater earning power to make the smartest rich and also the second tier wealthy, the third tier upper middle class and even the fourth comfortable.\ J.J. Hantsch\ Vernon Hills\ - - -\ One clause of a citizen agenda should call for no excuses, no exceptions and full disclosure by government officials, both elected and appointed: Who has given you money and how much? What else have people given you, and what was it worth? With whom have you met, and what did you discuss? How have you voted on issues favored by those who have given you money and with whom you have met?\ Include a clause barring midnight riders to bills, germane or not, that have not been fully debated by Congress.\ Include a clause promising to appoint judges, including Supreme Court justices who--regardless of their positions on Roe vs. Wade, affirmative action, gun control, or gay marriage--believe that the rights of individuals supersede those of corporations.\ Propose that the benefits of tax cuts and subsidies be proportional to the size of the populations that receive them. For example, the top 1 percent of the population shall receive no more than 1 percent of the benefit; the top 1 percent of farms shall receive no more than 1 percent of the subsidy.\ Peter Jaffe-Notier\ Oak Park\ - - -\ I believe we should limit the government in our lives. I believe government employees should be in the Social Security system like the rest of us and not in their special program. I believe we should reduce the cost of government by demanding government employees pay for their health care, reduce their retirement program payments, make them work to age 70 to collect 100 percent. I believe we should demand a 30 percent reduction in government employees and overall demand that the government live within its annual budget. No additions can be made to the budget without a corresponding reduction in costs elsewhere.\ I would like to see the borders closed unless the people have proper entrance papers and those here without proper papers be sent home at once.\ I would like to see much more civility in all levels of government; the constant spinning, lying and harsh talk is very discouraging to the citizens.\ I would like to see no more changing of the laws asking for removing ""in God we trust,"" ""under God,"" etc. We should return to having God in our lives as our forefathers stated.\ James Poulsen\ Viera, Fla.\ - - -\ Tax decreases for the wealthy should require a three-fifths majority vote by Congress.\ The Republicans called for a three-fifths majority vote for tax ""increases."" The same procedure should apply to both up and down votes.\ Assent to wage a pre-emptive war will never be given until sufficient funds are available to conduct it without cutting entitlements for the poor. If a president decides to engage in pre- emptive war, Congress will immediately reinstate the draft to provide sufficient manpower to wage the war, and all college deferments and other discriminatory exemptions from the draft will not be tolerated.\ At present, an undue burden to fight such wars is borne by minorities and members of impoverished families. Congress will pledge to pass legislation forbidding the secretary of defense from dispatching State National Guard units to participate in overseas conflicts because this weakens national security and emergency preparedness at home.\ Also, if the executive branch refuses to heed the advice of military experts that more regular troops may be needed to conduct the war than are considered politically expedient, then that war should not be conducted, and permission would not be given to augment regular forces with National Guard units.\ Military recruiters will no longer be permitted to entice people under 21 to join the military without allowing the solicited party's parents to be present during the interview.\ Jerry Schmitt\ Roselle\ - - -\ Remove the wage cap from Social Security taxes. The personal exemption from federal income taxes should be the sum of: Gross pay from the federal minimum wage at 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year. The child exemption from federal income taxes for dependent children should be equal to the personal exemption calculated above. This would function as a block grant, making it easier for parents to afford adequate housing and child care.\ All new homes must be ADA compliant. Ban mobile homes from high- risk zones of extreme winds, as mapped in FEMA Publication 320. We should have national health insurance, like Canada. Make illegal immigration a federal crime. Ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Disaster rebuilding aid should be contingent on victims either moving out of a disaster zone, where applicable (e.g. floods & storm surges), or the new structure able to resist what destroyed the old one (e.g. tornadoes).\ Adjust the numbers so that all minimum-wage workers can afford their own dwelling with enough room for possessions (not just what fits in a duffel bag or shopping cart) and enough workshop space so they can make clothing or furniture; start a business to better their situations; and have it be affordably close to their workplace.\ End the assumption that land ownership gives one the right to do anything one wants on it, that all restrictions are takings requiring just compensation. We need national zoning laws. Some land is so inherently constrained it shouldn't be available for private ownership. Some levels of usage restrictions may prompt waiving of property taxes as compensation. Build more health clubs and enable unemployed people to walk to them and use them for free. Grant the constitutional right to hunt with a bow and arrow, fish and gather; always permit the use of bare hands to hunt and fish. Commit to full employment. Fight underemployment. Fight long-term unemployment. Start a new Works Progress Administration program for both. Start a fast-track system to bring all school-finishers into the productive sector without underemployment. Eliminate exclusion of certain workers from coverage of the minimum-wage law.\ Jean Smiling Coyote\ Chicago\ - - -\ Stop political bribery in the form of monetary contributions to politicians. Raise the minimum wage to a livable level and permanently link it to inflation by granting cost-of-living increases.\ Start fining TV networks and radio stations for the lies spread by their pundits and other speakers. Talk about indecency!\ Start some big national scientific initiatives that all Americans can be proud of. Think about what the space race did for national pride and school-age interest in the sciences.\ Give third party candidates a fighting chance with national elections.

Our reliance on foreign sources of energy affects every aspect of our economy and our foreign relations. Eliminating that dependence would have a profound effect on our security and our daily lives. To achieve energy independence, we will need a three- pronged approach: increased energy efficiency, alternative sources of energy, and increasing our use of domestic sources of conventional energy.\ No. 2 should be to get our financial house in order. Reduce federal spending. Reduce the federal debt.\ Jim O'Neal\ Lindenhurst\ - - -\ We need universal single payer health insurance and a balanced federal budget every year--no excuses, no exceptions, no off-line items. Stop spending the Social Security surplus. Take the surplus real paper dollars and put them in Ft. Knox or buy gold and put that in Ft. Knox. At least we'll have something real to spend when the surplus goes away.\ Increase the required car mileage standards--a small increase every year for the next 20 years--and get rid of the exception that treats SUVs like trucks. Increase the federal gasoline tax with a similar tax on all non-renewable energy sources (like President Bill Clinton's ""carbon tax"") with small increases every year for the next 20 years. That would be accompanied by an enhancement of the earned income tax credit and a decrease in the income tax across the board.\ Bring all of our troops home from Iraq, immediately.\ Pass a law that will provide a major incentive for recycling.

Over the last five years under Republican control, there has been very little oversight of spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. GOP control, especially in the House of Representatives, has led to secretive committee meetings where Democrats and their witnesses either are not allowed to comment on pending legislation or their microphones are shut off in midsentence. This has been a tactic in hearings headed by Republican Wisconsin Rep. James Sensenbrenner.\ Having one-party control of the House, Senate and White House has led to a power grab and corruption that was supposed to have been eliminated by the ""Contract With America.""

We have a large safety net already and can incrementally increase it. The Middle East with the inevitable spread of nuclear weapons to Iran and others is the current security concern.

162,"WASHINGTON — Republicans greeted climate legislation from their Democratic peers with a cold embrace, calling it a “one-size-fits-all” approach. Nevertheless, some elements of the bill have a shot at bipartisan support, including electricity standards, carbon-trapping technology, toxic chemicals, a diesel emissions program and controls on methane.\The bill, which Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats introduced last week, sets national targets to slash greenhouse gas emissions at least 50% by 2030, down from 2005 levels, and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.\Its central element, a policy known as a “clean electricity standard,” would require utility companies nationwide to generate a rising percentage of their electricity from zero-emissions sources, hitting 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.\The bill is the first piece of broad climate legislation to be introduced in the 117th Congress and contains elements likely to be rolled into a broader climate-and-infrastructure bill.\“We’re beginning to see actual legislative language being put together to enact the Biden legislative agenda,” Lindsey Walter, deputy director for the climate and energy program at Third Way, a centrist think tank, said in an interview.\While ranking member Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and Reps. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and David McKinley, R-W.V., swiftly rebuked the legislation as a “rush to green with one-size-fits-all regulations,” the members said they were open to working on specific provisions addressing innovation, nuclear power and hydroelectricity.\Recent legislation from committee Republicans also hint at areas of potential bipartisan support within the bill, though it appears unlikely the legislation would get much if any GOP backing in its present form.\McKinley and Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., introduced legislation in December to establish a clean electricity standard with the goal of cutting 80% of greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by 2050.\That target is not as aggressive as the bill Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., introduced last Congress. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the business lobbying and advocacy group, backed the McKinley-Schrader legislation last year.\Nearly three-quarters of states had adopted voluntary or compulsory electricity standards as of early 2019, according to researchers with Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan organization.\“The idea of a national clean energy standard is not new, and the concept has received bipartisan support,” the researchers wrote, noting that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sponsored CES legislation in 2010 that aimed for generating 50% of U.S. electricity with clean sources by 2050.\The Democrats’ bill this Congress includes other topics that draw bipartisan interest.\It includes $5 million for fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2026 for the injection and sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions into deep rock formations. Carbon capture technology has strong support from oil- and coal-state members of both parties, including Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W.V., the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and his GOP counterpart on the panel, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\The bill also reauthorizes $500 million annually for fiscal 2022 through 2031, for a federal grant program at the EPA to help states reduce emissions from diesel vehicles.\“It is a voluntary program, administered by the EPA, that helps fund the retrofit or replacement of existing heavy-duty diesel vehicles, engines, and equipment with cleaner diesel or new technology,” Upton said Sept. 9, 2019, on the House floor in support of the program. “The federal and state grants and other assistance under this program resulted in cleaner, more efficient vehicles, and the net effect is cleaner air in cities and communities that, in fact, need it the most.”\And last year, Upton introduced a bill to reduce methane emissions from burning off natural gas at drilling and processing sites, a practice known as flaring.\Methane is more than 80 times more potent to the climate than carbon dioxide. EPA weakened methane regulation in August 2019 to mixed reaction from the oil and gas industry.\Oil-and-gas giants Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Equinor are broadly in favor of limiting methane gas releases through flaring.\The House bill also carves out a new grant program at EPA to provide funding for water utilities to address contamination from perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — better known as PFAS, the near-ubiquitous chemicals found in myriad consumer goods — and authorizes funding for that program at $500 million for fiscal 2022 through 2031.\A rare environmental issue that has bipartisan urgency, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has made PFAS a focus early this Congress as have dozens of Democrats in both chambers.\At a subcommittee hearing last summer, Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., an Energy and Commerce panel member, called the presence of PFAS contamination across Michigan “alarming.”\“The number of PFAS-confirmed sites has grown rapidly over the last few years, my district included, and Michiganians are seriously concerned,” he said.\CREDIT: BENJAMIN J.

163,"
Before you add insulation to your attic, replace your antiquated single-pane windows or give up on your old furnace, get your gas and electric companies on the phone. The utility may be willing to help defray the cost of any steps you take to lower your energy bills.
\
""Utilities are more than just a bill every month,"" says Keith Voight, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned electric utilities. ""They can help in many ways.""
\
Besides investing in the development of energy-efficient products like the gas heat pump and microwave clothes dryer, many utilities are offering cash rebates, low-interest loans and other types of financial assistance.
\
At the very least, they'll have information that could save you hundreds of dollars.
\
It's part of a renewed effort at demand-side management, or DSM, which is utility jargon for attempting to influence energy use.
\
DSM is not new to the power business. In fact, the first try at altering consumer behavior can be traced back to Thomas Edison's Pearl Street facility in Manhattan. Back then, the only demand for electricity was for nighttime lighting. So Edison hired people to promote electric motors and other daytime uses.
\
Of course, he wanted people to use more electricity. Nowadays, utilities want us to use less. Electric companies, for example, want to shift demand from peak periods when they often must add expensive back-up power to times when there is so little demand that huge generating plants are sitting idle.
\
This is not the same as energy conservation. It's energy efficiency. There is a difference: Conservation means doing without to save money or protect the environment. Efficiency, on the other hand, means getting the most value from each dollar spent.
\
EEI's Voight says electric companies want to be a resource for advice and financial aid, since ""it leads to more satisfied customers and more efficient power-plant use.""
\
By leveling demand, electric companies will not only be able to keep the cost of electricity lower, they will be able to defer the need for expensive new power plants, not to mention help protect the environment.
\
According to EEI, its members' demand-side management efforts have deferred more than 26 million kilowatts of capacity, roughly the equivalent of 54 medium-size plants.
\
Here's a rundown of the kinds of help available from local power companies:
\
- Energy audits: Dozens of utilities will provide energy-oriented assessments of existing houses and make recommendations for improvements. The majority provide this service at no cost, but some charge between $15 and $30.
\
If you hire an outside auditor, your utility may pay part of the fee.
\
- Rebates: To encourage homeowners to upgrade to a higher level of energy efficiency, some utilities pay rebates or outright grants. If attic insulation is boosted from R-7 rating to a more efficient R-30, for example, Georgia Pacific will pay $530. There also are rebates of $120 for any caulking or weatherstripping that reduces air infiltration, $250 for sealing ducts, and $25 for installing a high-efficiency refrigerator.
\
Low-interest loans: Virginia Power customers can borrow up to $10,000 at below-market interest rates to make improvements that will achieve significant energy savings. Among the improvements covered are upgraded existing heating and cooling systems, increased insulation and the installation of storm doors, storm windows and programmable thermostats.
\
Customers first must secure their own loan from a participating lender. Then the power company pays the bank a fee to reduce the loan rate by up to 2 percent. Rates are linked to the efficiency of the equipment installed, with loans for the highest efficiency systems carrying the biggest break.
\
- Special rates: To shift demand to mid- or off-peak periods, Baltimore Gas & Electric varies its rates according to the time of day. Customers who shower, wash dishes or do laundry during the least costly periods-nights and weekends-can cut their utility bills anywhere from 3 to 21 percent, BG&E says, with little or no impact on lifestyle.
\
- Load control: To manage demand more efficiently, BG&E also pays customers to install energy-saver switches on heat pumps and air conditioning units. During periods of peak demand, usually weekdays when many people aren't home, the utility sends a radio signal to the switch, which cycles the equipment on and off every 15 minutes.
\
Customers received a $25 sign-up bonus plus a $10-a-month credit on their bills from June through September for the life of the unit. A similar switch that turns off the electricity to water heaters for no more than six hours at a time earns a $20 annual credit.
\
- New homes: To assure buyers that the new homes they are buying are as energy efficient as their builders claim, utilities often certify houses under such names as Good Cents Homes, Energy Wise Homes and Power Miser.
\
Under these programs, builders receive co-op advertising dollars and cash rebates in return for meeting certain construction standards and installing high-efficiency equipment.
\
Even with the rebates, however, a true energy-efficient house is somewhat more expensive. But it also is more comfortable and less costly to operate.

Starting Jan. 1, electricity prices across Illinois are going to rise 20 percent to 55 percent, with an approximate 40 percent increase for AmerenIP customers.
\
This is the end result of a nine-year rate freeze during a transition time to develop competition in a deregulated electrical market. However, no competition has been created.
\
Instead of a regulated monopoly, we are left with an unregulated monopoly. These sharp price increases will have major impacts on those with tight and fixed incomes, like students, the working poor and senior citizens.
\
Deregulation is not appropriate for essential services and resources, such as electricity. Prices are significantly higher in deregulated electrical markets, and the systems are less reliable.
\
The government has an important role in regulating prices and ensuring that utilities are providing clean, secure power. The energy crisis in California is a testament to the failings of deregulation and the ability to manipulate the system for the benefit of the power suppliers, such as Enron.
\
We have waited nine years for real competition to materialize, but we still have no real choice. State Rep. Namoi Jakobsson, D- Urbana, is naive to believe that simply freezing the rate another three years will solve our problems. The rate spikes, legislation and accusations will simply recur without any tangible improvements.
\
There is also concern that campaign contributions from utilities such as Exelonpac and Mid American Energy Holdings Co. jeopardizes her ability to adequately represent the interests of the people of this state.
\
Deregulation gives the government less power to mandate clean energy programs, such as a renewable portfolio standard, requiring utilities to provide a certain percentage of their generation from renewable energy. Reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and our greenhouse gas emissions is essential to mitigating the impacts of global warming on our environment, families and economies.
\
Instead of fooling ourselves into accepting deregulation, we must resist this movement and return to a truly regulated structure.
\
Prices will remain stable, with small increases as necessary to maintain distribution systems and account for energy costs. This will still allow the generators to earn a reasonable return on their investments.
\
Instead of building additional power plants, a regulated utility system can be required to implement integrated resource planning to control its needs with demand side management programs.
\
This can be achieved through energy efficiency and conservation programs for residential and commercial customers.
\
Regulation also provides more avenues for increasing the capacity of clean, renewable energy.
\
While I could support a short rate freeze to prevent the drastic rate increases resulting in last week's auction, we need to abandon the myth of a deregulated competitive market and move toward a fairly regulated system.

Three Chicago-area plants in 1988 were among the state's 10 largest emitters of chemicals that have been linked with birth defects, according to a study to be released Thursday.
\
Illinois companies discharged into the environment more than 70 million pounds of pollutants that are known to cause or suspected of causing birth defects, the report says.
\
The study, prepared by Illinois Public Action, found that almost 80 percent of the emissions went into the air, the least-regulated portion of the environment. All of the discharges were legal.
\
""We were surprised by the large amount of such emissions,"" said John Cameron, associate director of the non-profit environment, energy and public-health group. ""It's three times as much as the reported release of carcinogenic substances. That's a serious threat to public health and shows the need for more aggressive action to create economic incentives to reduce the use of these chemicals.""
\
The group, which supports a proposed state law to impose a 15-cent-per-pound tax on toxic emissions, based its findings on statistics reported by large companies to state and federal agencies under a 1986 law. Figures for 1988 are the most recent available.
\
Earlier this year, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency found from such industry reports that companies released 348.3 million pounds of toxic chemicals of all kinds in 1988.
\
Cameron said an emissions tax is needed to give companies an incentive to reduce pollution immediately. The pending Clean Air Act, which mandates reductions in toxic air pollution, won't get results quickly, he said.
\
The public-interest group's report says the most commonly emitted chemicals associated with birth defects are the solvents xylene, toluene, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The substances, used in printing inks, adhesives, chemical manufacturing and metal degreasing and cleaning, can cause mutations and damage developing fetuses, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's office of toxic substances.
\
Of Chicago-area plants cited in the study, the Maxwell Communication plant in west suburban Broadview released 2.4 million pounds of substances linked with birth defects. That was the greatest amount in the state, but the plant is now closed.
\
The R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co. plant in Chicago ranked fifth, with emissions of 2 million pounds. The Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. plant in southwest suburban Bedford Park released 1.5 million pounds of chemicals linked with birth defects, the study said, making it the eighth largest source of such chemicals.
\
David Satterfield, director of the Chemical Industry Council of Illinois, said the raw statistics do not prove that the companies are causing birth defects.
\
""Toxicology is a very complicated science,"" he said. ""You have to be very careful when drawing conclusions about the toxic effect of certain chemicals because factors such as dose and length of exposure are critical.""
\
Donnelley's printing presses are equipped to capture evaporating solvents from inks and either burn them or recycle them, said vice-president and general counsel David Hart.
\
""We do give off some vapors and when you add them up over a year, it looks like a large number,"" he said. ""But they go out and are dispersed, and they're not in any concentration that causes any problems.""
\
Environmentalists have called for printing companies to switch to water-based inks that contain no toxic solvents, but Hart said such inks currently available are unsuitable for a large commercial printer.
\
3M officials could not be reached for comment on the Bedford Park plant. In the past, environmentalists have applauded the company's pollution-prevention program, which attempts to substitute non-polluting substances and processes for environmentally harmful ones.

"
167," The perils of climate change are attracting much attention these days, with a popular award-winning documentary on the subject, a UN panel emphasizing the dangers and widespread agreement among scientists that global warming presents a potentially catastrophic threat.\ The concern has prompted a flurry of legislative activity on Capitol Hill, with four major bills, soon to be five, vying for support and votes, and some measure appearing likely to pass. But it remains unclear how strong it will be, how far lawmakers are willing to go in restricting U.S. industry, and whether President Bush might veto a bill.\ The documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" spearheaded by former Vice President Al Gore, focused attention more clearly on the issue, especially after it won two Oscars last month, but it is not the only catalyst. In the last month, a United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a study determining that the world's temperature is rising and declaring with 90 percent certainty that human activity is the cause.\ Nearly a dozen energy companies have joined with leading environmental groups to form the United States Climate Action Partnership and have begun lobbying the federal government to institute strict standards for emissions reduction.\ Meanwhile, in the absence of binding national standards, many states, on their own or in regional consortia, have adopted laws to regulate emissions. Individual cities have even imposed regulations.\ ""Things are moving right now at an incredibly quick pace,"" said Antonia Herzog, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. ""I think the people in Congress who matter accept that global warming is a fact and are now trying to figure out how to address it in a responsible manner.""\ However, turning that political potential into a nationwide law may take time, despite pledges from Senate leaders to address the issue and promises from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to bring a bill up for a vote on the House floor by the summer. Although U.S. industry is increasingly on board, there are competing proposals for how to tackle the problem.\ ""It's going to be very complicated, with a huge amount of political infighting,"" said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank which opposes legislative efforts to combat global warming. ""We think we have a very good opportunity to stymie everything so that nothing will emerge.""\ Building consensus\ Although interest in global warming is increasing, enacting emissions controls has proved a sluggish enterprise at best; there has not been a new, overarching law on the subject since the Clean Air Act of 1990. Today the challenge is building consensus in a Congress with global warming naysayers.\ There appears to be at least a basis for dialogue, however, as all the bills propose a ""declining cap-and-trade"" system. Under that approach, an overall emissions limit would be established for a subset of polluters. Companies could then engage in trade, that is-- bidding, buying or selling permits--so each could continue to operate profitably while the overall level of pollutants would go down. Over time, as the cap is lowered, permits would decrease in value or be removed from circulation.\ ""People are coalescing around that as the broad approach, though there are differences on the particulars,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. ""There's some sense in the business community and in Congress that this is a tried- and-true approach.""\ It's a tack that was used successfully to limit acid rain- causing emissions under the Clean Air Act.\ ""When given a clear goal and an opportunity for markets to develop the technology to meet the goal, we've always met them,"" said Mark MacLeod, special projects director for Environmental Defense, an advocacy group. ""There's no reason to expect we couldn't achieve the goal this time.""\ Goals different\ The goals, however, differ from proposal to proposal. A bill offered by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I- Vt.) would aggressively reduce emissions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. At the other end of the spectrum, an as-yet- unintroduced plan from Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) ties emissions reduction to gross domestic product and does not guarantee any reduction in emissions.\ Because it's unlikely that any one bill will make it through unchanged, most observers are not expressly advocating any single approach.\ There is much more than just an emissions cap to discuss, as each bill also brings its own priorities for research. A proposal by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) includes controversial provisions for advancing nuclear technologies, while one from Sens.

168," Buying a new house is always a numbers game.\ There is the cost of the mortgage, assessments and taxes.\ There are the number of bedrooms and baths, the square footage of the house, the cost per square foot as well as the size of the lot.\ And home maintenance? Many people buy new construction in the hope of minimizing those costs or postponing them for a couple of years.\ Basic utilities such as heating and cooling cannot be put off, however, though surprisingly few buyers bother to inquire about estimated monthly energy costs, say builders I've queried over the years.\ Typical of the attitude among some builders was the one I heard after I toured a model home with a cavernous two-story living room/ dining room/family room area opening to the kitchen and breakfast area.\ ""Almost nobody ever asks,"" said the builder when asked about the house's energy efficiency and the estimated monthly utility bills. ""The occasional man who has had a bad experience will ask. Women don't care.""\ A small but growing number of new home builders are betting buyers, both men and women, do care.\ They believe that some buyers, all else being equal, will find a home built to a higher energy-efficiency standard to be appealing.\ The reasons: lower utility costs and a more comfortable living environment with less air pollution.\ One of the recent converts to this way of thinking is Court Airhart, president of West Chicago-based Airhart Construction, who has signed on to be a partner in the Energy Star program, a voluntary effort sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\ The agency, which has teamed with the U.S. Department of Energy for some categories, provides performance guidelines for buildings and more than 35 types of residential and commercial products, including appliances, lighting, home office equipment, consumer electronics, heating and cooling equipment.\ Builders are free to select energy-saving features from a variety of reliable and established technologies and practices, but the goal is to achieve at least 30 percent more efficiency than the 1993 national Model Energy Code or 15 percent more efficiency than state energy rules, whichever is more rigorous.\ To win the Energy Star label, usually attached to the cover of a new home's circuit box, a house undergoes an air leakage test.\ Not surprisingly, a number of enterprising people saw opportunity in testing and proving to owners of drafty older homes that they needed more insulation and repairs to cut down on high energy bills; so Energy Star is perhaps better know among those who own existing housing.\ Builders have been slower to get on board in part because most buyers assume new construction is an improvement over what was built in the past.\ While that is generally true, building to code is a minimum standard of safe construction, not necessarily the highest level of quality craftsmanship.\ Airhart said his firm, which builds about 45 homes a year, devoted some attention to improved insulation, good house wrap, careful taping of ductwork and caulking wall plates. Extra effort also went into the windows and exterior door frames, investing in windows with low-E (low emissivity) insulated glass. The builder also installed energy-efficient heating and cooling units.\ The company plans for all homes in the Medalist and Signature series to be Energy Star compliant. The label will set the company apart from some of the competition --there are only 31 Energy Star builders in the entire state.\ Airhart estimates that buyers will save from $200 to $400 a year on utility costs.\ Some key numbers for Airhart are items that buyers may not know about, or neglect to ask.\ He says 2-by-6-inch exterior framing allows two extra inches of insulation in exterior walls for an R-24 rating compared to the more standard R-13. (The R value measures resistance to heat loss).\ Using a spray-in-place cellulose insulation made from recycled newspaper called Nu-Wool plugs small cracks and crevices for an R- 38 rating, more than the standard R-30 for a roof.\ The company installs gas-fired heating systems that are 92 percent efficient and Puron-charged (not Freon-charged, which damages the atmosphere) cooling systems rated 12 SEER (for seasonal energy efficiency rating).\ Electronic zone dampers are installed in homes between 3,100 and 3,900 square feet. Controlled by a second-floor thermostat, the electronic zone damper can provide cost-effective second floor heating and cooling when there is only a single furnace in the home.\ While buyers will appreciate the long-range utility savings, Airhart believes the more immediate reason for opting to buy an Energy Star home is a more comfortable interior environment.\ The efforts to prevent heat and cooling loss are not aimed at sealing the house entirely, he notes. Houses need a constant air exchange to be healthy places to live.\ These construction measures are an effort to control air exchange to a consistent level. It is the random air leaks that cause drafts that lead to the familiar energy-wasting and costly battle between family members of turning up, then turning down the thermostat.\ The final measure of whether a structure qualifies as an Energy Star home is called the blower door test. To see how this works, I headed out to one of the company's just-finished custom homes (pictured) in the Prince Crossing Farm subdivision in West Chicago on a snowy January morning.\ Craig Matteson, partner in Arc Insulation, Romeoville, was conducting the blower door test, which depressurizes the house and replicates the effect of a 24-mph wind on all sides of the structure.\ The point of the 30-minute test is to measure how much air is moving through the house under such conditions. Matteson, whose firm provided and installed the insulation for the house, said he usually conducts the test twice.\ Matteson, a former builder, has been installing cellulose insulation since the early 1990s. He said he was trained to conduct the Energy Star testing in part to try to prove to builders that he had a better product.\ The 3,500-square-foot, five-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath house cost about $535,000 including the lot. The upgrades to qualify for the Energy Star label cost about $6,600, just 1.3 percent of the total cost, Airhart said.\ Homeowners ""are not going to get it back in the first year, but in five or six years"" Airhart said, but he suggests that those living in the house during that time will have a more comfortable, healthy and pleasant experience. Yet he says not every buyer will want to spend even that amount on energy efficiency.\ ""If you are in a subdivision with 10 builders, two different buyers will make different choices. I don't think either is right or wrong. The consumer has the choice,"" he said.\ - - -\ Secrets of an Energy Star house\ - Upgraded insulation and structure\ - High performance windows\ - Controlled air infiltration\ - Energy-efficient heating and cooling equipment\ - Tight duct systems\ Energy Star qualified homes are independently verified to be at least 30 percent more energy efficient than homes built to the 1993 Model Energy Code or 15 percent more efficient than the state energy code, whichever is more rigorous.\ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency"
169,"Reversing the course of the nation's progress: Republicans want Bush to overturn a list of Health and Safety Rules\Congressional Republicans, in their desire to undo all of the progress made during the last Democratic administration, have drawn up a list of 45 health and safety rules that they want the Bush White House to overturn.\According to Tuesday's Washington Post, ""The regulations included on the [Republicans] list [covers] nearly every major area of government policy, including, labor, abortion and the environment.""\""The reason why Republicans have to use this kind of back-door approach is that they are trying to hide the fact that they are doing the bidding of the special interest by eliminating regulations that the vast majority of Americans support,"" said Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Terry McAuliffe.\""Republicans feel they need this sort of covert approach to hide the harm they are causing from the American people and the fact that these actions net big projects for big donors at the expense of our quality of life.""\According to the Post article, the Republicans want to overturn rules that define a child as a fetus, restrict snowmobile use in national parks, impose tougher energy standards on air conditioners, prohibit minors from operating in workplaces that use power tool equipment and a host of others.\Furthermore the Post states that, former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson criticized Bush for the proposed reversal of conservation rules.\""Most disturbing are reports that the Bush team may bow to pressure from the Air Conditioning Industry to pull back the energy-efficiency standard, appliance standards, including those for washing machines and refrigerators, issued since 1997 which will save enough energy by 2010 to light every home in the country for two years and produce a net energy savings to the nation of $27 billion through the year 2030.\""Republicans won't be content until we live in a country free of regulations that get in the way of their biggest supporters,"" said McAuliffe.\""If they really believed the American people support them on overturning these rules, they would not have used these dead-of-the-night tactics to roll out their radical agenda.""\Article Copyright Sengstacke Enterprises, Inc."
170,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) - Senate Democrats conceded Monday that a temporary repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax increase is unavoidable, and Republican leaders prepared to tap the nation's savings institutions to pay for it.\Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said the Senate could vote as soon as Tuesday on the tax cut, which he proposed less than two weeks ago. He planned to discuss the timing, as well as a Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage, with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.\""We think (it) is inevitable,"" Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters. Republicans are ""in the majority. They have the votes to pass legislation.""\The leading proposal for paying for the cut, according to House and Senate aides, was separate legislation that strengthens the government fund insuring savings and loan deposits.\That plan requires a one-time premium payment from S&Ls, and, under budget rules, the money can be used to offset the tax cut. GOP leaders also are looking at a cut in Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.\The Clinton administration supports the S&L legislation and Daschle said ""I'm not necessarily averse"" to using it to cut the gas tax.\Republican leaders are pushing hard for the repeal, which is seen as having wide popular appeal. Dole, Clinton's rival in the presidential race, notes repeatedly that the tax increase was approved ""without a single Republican vote.""\Many Democrats are criticizing the tax cut, saying it could amount to a windfall for the oil companies who pay the tax and ultimately pass it on to the consumer. And environmentalists maintain the tax cut would encourage more energy consumption and hurt the environment.\Repeal is ""attractive as a matter of raw politics, but it is terrible as a matter of public policy,"" said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. ""Just as we were beginning to make sustained progress in bringing down the deficit ... we blink. We can't take the political heat.""\However, some Democrats feel compelled to vote for the tax cut and Republicans are near unanimous in backing it.\Credit: AP"
171,"
Gasoline pumps across Illinois ring in the new year Monday with higher prices as a result of a new 3-cent-a-gallon state fuel tax hike.
\
The jump is among hundreds of new laws taking effect with the advent of 1990, following a year in which legislators not only raised several taxes, but also dealt with an eclectic assortment of issues ranging from strengthened antidrug laws to a ban on using baby chicks as raffle prizes.
\
The new gas-tax boost-to 19 cents a gallon-is the second and final boost in the levy arising from legislation signed by Gov. James Thompson last summer.
\
A similar increase took effect statewide Aug. 1.
\
Combined with per-gallon taxes levied by Chicago and Cook County, and local, state and Regional Transportation Authority sales taxes, Chicago motorists will be paying about 45.6 cents to federal, state and local governments on top of a base price for a gallon of gasoline of 68 cents.
\
""One of the main reasons we saw the gas tax go up this last summer is because the sources of revenue are literally drying up,"" said Donald Schaefer, associate director of the Illinois Petroleum Council, which represents major oil companies.
\
""Increased demands to maintain and improve and construct new roads are going to fall either on an increased gas tax or on fees for license plates, driver's licenses, impact fees and tollways. You'll find a lot of groups that will say we now have to take a good hard look at how we fund our highways.""
\
Federal highway trust fund money is currently being held as a hedge against congressionally mandated deficit reduction and some transportation officials believe there will be even more pressure on the states to increase their motor fuel taxes if the government alters its distribution formula and requires more state dollars to obtain federal funds.
\
""With or without an increase in federal taxes, there will be increasing pressure on the states to provide the matching money for federal aid,"" said Jack Martin, a spokesman for the Washington-based Highway Users Federation, a lobby group representing a variety of road-related interests.
\
Nineteen states, including Illinois, raised gasoline taxes in 1989 and the Highway Users Federation predicts as many as 18 others may take similar steps in 1990.
\
But legislators were driven to do more than merely increase the gasoline tax in 1989. They approved several new laws that take effect with the new year. Here is a sample:
\
Drugs
\
The types of crimes eligible for the death penalty will be expanded to include drug-related first-degree murder convictions. Maximum fines for delivery or possession of large amounts of illegal drugs will increase.
\
A new tool for drug-fighters is a law that makes it illegal to fortify a residence against police raids. The law is aimed at crack houses, which are usually fortified and stocked with weapons. And the secretary of state will now be able to suspend or revoke the drivers' licenses or permits of people convicted of possessing marijuana or drugs while operating a vehicle.
\
The increase in gang- and drug-related crimes committed by youths also came under the scrutiny of lawmakers, who enacted laws such as banning the use of pocket pagers or beepers by students on school property-devices linked to drug dealing-and allowing schools to ask for police help in conducting drug searches of lockers and school grounds, including the use of specially trained dogs.
\
Minors 15 years old and older who are caught selling drugs in public housing will automatically be tried as adults, as will those who have a history of gang-related criminal activity.
\
And in a move aimed at penalizing some youths where it hurts the most, judges, as a condition of probation, could restrict the driving privileges of minors found delinquent on alcohol, marijuana or drug charges.
\
Crimes
\
Spouses will now be able to be prosecuted for criminal sexual assault if the victim reports the offense to police within 30 days.
\
Victims of sexual assault or abuse will be able to sue the producers and distributors of obscene materials if they caused an assailant to commit the crime.
\
The sale and manufacture of steroids will be illegal and new crimes of ritual mutilation and ritual brutality will be created to combat cults.
\
State police will have the right to reject or cancel a firearm owner's identification card if the gun owner is of dangerous mental character.
\
Placing a computer virus into a computer program will become illegal and the unsolicited faxing of advertisements will be against the law under a new ""junk fax"" statute.
\
And, as a result of the case of Scott and Carolyn Swanson, the west-suburban couple whose secret search for perfect love resulted in a massive police manhunt after they were feared dead, fugitives can now be forced to pay for the costs of a police search if they know they are being pursued.
\
Babies
\
Concern over the rising number of so-called cocaine babies-newborn infants born addicted to drugs-and an overall need to improve prenatal care prompted legislators to react with several new initiatives.
\
A new law will allow the state to move more quickly in taking custody of newborns addicted to cocaine and other drugs. The Department of Children and Family Services will be able to use medical tests showing traces of drugs in a newborn's blood or urine as evidence of neglect in a child custody proceeding.
\
Retail liquor stores must post warnings to pregnant women on the danger of birth defects if they consume alcohol. County clerks also must hand out a pamphlet detailing fetal alcohol syndrome, the pattern of birth defects linked to a mother's drinking, to marriage license applicants.
\
Schools
\
While legislators increased the state's income tax by 20 percent for the next two years in part to boost funding for schools, they also enacted several new requirements to begin Jan. 1.
\
School districts must prohibit the use of tobacco on school grounds, with limited exceptions for school staff and spectators at indoor and outdoor athletic events.
\
In addition, schools with sex education programs must teach their students that abstinence before marriage is the expected norm.
\
Students also will be required to learn the dangers of drug, steroid and substance abuse; be taught about recycling; and receive a unit of instruction on the Holocaust atrocities committed by Nazi Germany.
\
Three new school holidays were created by legislators, but they're ""commemorative,"" meaning students will still have to go to school. Jan. 28 is now Christa McAuliffe Day in honor of the nation's first teacher in space who died in the 1986 explosion of the Challenger space shuttle; the day before Veterans Day is Korean War Veterans Day; and Oct. 1 is Recycling Day in the state.
\
Environment
\
Concern about the state's rapidly filling landfills prompted legislators to look further at recycling, allowing the state to give grants to businesses that compost and recycle solid waste. Machinery used in recycling hazardous and municipal waste will be exempt from the state's sales tax.
\
Lawn services will now have to post signs warning that residential yards have been chemically treated.
\
The sale of so-called plastic cans for beverages will be banned and the state's 84 counties with fewer than 100,000 people each must develop a plan to handle solid wastes by March, 1995. Larger counties are already under a deadline.
\
In addition, a new $2 increase in vehicle title fees will help fund bicycle trails in the state.
\
Aids
\
Although they had repealed the state's controversial premarital AIDS testing law earlier in 1989, legislators remained concerned about just what the state's role should be in dealing with the deadly disease.
\
Under a new criminal law, people who attempt to prevent a student infected with the AIDS virus from attending school could be charged with ""willful interference.""
\
Police officers will be able to demand a test for the AIDS virus if they come into direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an individual. Paramedics also will be able to give a patient an AIDS test without his or her consent.
\
Elderly and disabled
\
After a couple of years of debate, the blind and elderly tax exemption on Illinois income tax forms will be restored. They had been eliminated as a result of federal tax law changes in 1986. But the exemption won't apply until the 1990 tax year.
\
In addition, new crimes of criminal neglect and financial exploitation of the elderly were created to further combat scams in which people are bilked of their savings and to ensure that elderly receive proper care. Judges also will be allowed to consider the age of people 70 and older when setting trial dates.
\
Widows and widowers will be eligible for Circuit Breaker tax and pharmaceutical assistance benefits if they turn 65 within two years of the death of a spouse already eligible for such benefits.
\
Other
\
A new Home Ownership Made Easy program for first-time buyers will go into effect, allowing potential homeowners to deposit money with the state that will be invested at above-average interest rates to provide for a down payment.
\
Racetracks and insurance companies will be allowed to contribute to political campaigns under a law approved over the governor's veto.
\
And mail-order shoppers will have to pay state sales taxes on goods purchased from most out-of-state catalogue firms.
\
Legislators also dealt with less-than-weighty issues: They banned the award of rabbits, ducklngs and baby chicks as prizes in games of chance and named the Tullimonstrum Gregarium, known as the ""Tully Monster,"" the state fossil.
"
172,"
When the clock strikes midnight Sunday, new taxes will ring in the New Year at gasoline stations across Du Page County.
\
The jump is among hundreds of new laws taking effect with the advent of 1990, following a year in which Illinois state legislators not only raised several taxes but also dealt with an eclectic assortment of issues ranging from strengthened antidrug laws to a ban on using baby chicks as raffle prizes.
\
The price of gasoline will increase 7 cents on New Year's Day, the most significant tax increase for Du Page in 1990. That will make New Year's Eve Regret doubly strong for those who don't stop at the gasoline station before the party.
\
The price increase is so sharp because both the state and the county will collect additional taxes on gasoline. The county's share will be 4 cents a gallon, while the state's portion will jump 3 cents.
\
County officials have estimated that the new county tax will cost drivers who own one car about $27 a year. Combined with a property tax cut approved by the county, residents will come out ahead this year, officials say.
\
But opponents charge that the figures are misleading and that residents will pay in the end.
\
The gasoline tax reflects a growing trend in the county to rely on so-called user fees, as residents complain about growing property taxes.
\
Supporters argue that these user fees and taxes, such as the one on gasoline, are more fair because those who use the roads more, for instance, will pay more. The county expects to get $13 million a year from the gasoline tax for road construction.
\
But opponents say the new gasoline tax, in addition to hitting taxpayers, will cause service station operators along the border to lose business to stations in Kane. That means sales tax revenues to municipalities will drop, opponents say.
\
Du Page was the first county to impose the additional tax on gasoline since the General Assembly in June authorized three counties to do so. McHenry and Kane Counties are expected to consider endorsing the tax sometime in 1990, according to officials in those counties.
\
But state legislators were driven to do more than merely increase the gasoline tax in 1989, and they approved several new laws that take effect with the new year. Here is a sample:

The $443 million budget approved last week by DuPage County Board members is a frugal spending plan that provides no new money in fiscal 1996 for county-subsidized transportation services for the mentally handicapped and the elderly.
\
Nor does it provide new funds to attack problems in the county's troubled juvenile justice system.
\
But there apparently is money available to advance DuPage's plans to build new office and garage space for county highway department staffers and vehicles.
\
On Monday, a board committee recommended paying nearly $300,000 to a Schaumburg firm for design work on a new facility for the county's Division of Transportation.
\
The eventual cost of the facility, which would be built at the site of the existing Highway Department garage at Manchester and County Farm Roads in Wheaton, is estimated at $5.5 million. A new garage would allow for consolidation of Highway Department staff--office and maintenance workers--in one facility, according to county transportation officials. Highway Department engineers and administrative staff members now work in a small building several hundred feet east of the garage.
\
Officials also say that a new garage would allow the department to store most of its equipment indoors rather than outside and would improve vehicle maintenance.
\
The contract with RUST Environment and Infrastructure was approved by the board's Transportation Committee without discussion.
\
""It's interesting that we can spend money on things we want to spend money on,"" said board member Roger Kotecki (R-Glen Ellyn), who tried unsuccessfully last week to add $2 million to the county's budget to fund a boot camp for young offenders. Kotecki is not a member of the committee.
\
Plans for new Highway Department offices and garage space have been in the works for several years, said board member Michael Formento (R-Glen Ellyn), who chairs the Transportation Committee. Funds for a new facility would come not from property taxes, but from the proceeds of the county's 4-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline, he said.
\
Formento said the plans for the project had been on hold until the gas tax cleared legal hurdles. Revenues from the gas tax must be spent for transportation-related purposes.
\
The existing office building, constructed in the late 1950s, is in need of as much as $1.6 million in repairs and upgrading, according to Donald Zeilenga, the county's transportation chief.
"
174,"The top two leaders of the Illinois House and Senate began paving the way Tuesday for increasing the state's gasoline tax to fund billions of dollars in highway and mass-transit projects.\House Speaker Michael Madigan will support a proposal to raise the existing 19-cent-per-gallon motor fuel tax to 27 cents -- a boost that could raise $500 million a year to fund bond payments on a $5.9 billion transportation repair plan, a Madigan spokesman said.\Senate President John Cullerton also told the Chicago Tribune's editorial board that increased motor fuel taxes and higher vehicle fees should be considered ""on the table"" for what he called an Illinois ""stimulus"" package that would fund school construction as well as road and transit projects.\A spokesman for Gov. Pat Quinn said the governor is ""keeping all options open as he works to get a clear idea of the state's finances."" In one of his first appearances since replacing Rod Blagojevich as governor last week, Quinn called a statewide public works program a top priority.\Quinn, Madigan and Cullerton are all Chicago Democrats.\Madigan is backing a gasoline-tax increase proposal sponsored by Rep. John Bradley (D-Marion), which initially drew derision from some lawmakers because of sensitivity to the likelihood of spiking gasoline prices.\But Madigan spokesman Steve Brown said the House speaker believes that Bradley's proposal ""looks like a very well thought out way"" to fund a rehabilitation program for neglected roads and bridges around the state, along with ailing mass-transit systems in urban areas.\The state has not had a so-called capital construction program to pay for such large-scale improvements since George Ryan was governor. Blagojevich proposed a number of ways to fund a much larger public works program, but distrust of the governor in the legislature and other factors prevented it from happening even though lawmakers, trade groups and local officials have clamored for a plan.\Illinois' current gasoline-tax rate of 19 cents per gallon is slightly above the national average of 18.4 cents. But the state also charges sales tax on gasoline, and many municipalities also tax motor fuel, such as the 6 cents a gallon charged by Cook County and 5 cents a gallon charged by Chicago.\By adding the cost of state and local levies to the federal tax rate of 18.4 cents per gallon, the taxes Illinois motorists now pay on average on a gallon of gas total 50.8 cents, the ninth-highest in the country, according to the American Petroleum Institute. An 8-cent boost would make Illinois' tax rate an average of 58.8 cents, second only to New York's 59.7 cents.\Illinois' current motor fuel tax rate has been unchanged since 1990.\Cullerton maintained that motor fuel tax revenues, which go into the state's road construction fund, have been ""flat or declining"" because of better fuel efficiency in newer vehicles.\""One of the things on the table should be raising that 19 cents, and it also has a second benefit [for] folks who believe that, as a form of tax policy, we ought to raise the gas tax because we discourage SUV use and encourage people to take mass transit,"" Cullerton said.\Cullerton also said the state should also consider raising other vehicle fees, such as license plate fees, to generate construction dollars.\The Senate president also said he was ""open"" to an increased income tax to help the state's current budget deficit, which is approaching $5 billion. But he said any efforts to raise income taxes should await any state deficit relief dollars coming to Illinois from a federal stimulus bill.\""And then it's up to the governor,"" Cullerton said of Quinn. ""If the governor says he's not for it, we'll start doing a budget by cutting because we don't have the votes.""\Republican leaders in the General Assembly are supportive of a state public works proposal, though they have not backed a funding source. But GOP leaders are opposed to increasing income taxes -- particularly during a recession.\""Raising taxes in this environment is probably the worst thing you can do to the public,"" said Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno of Lemont.\-----------\rap30@tribune.com\arueff@tribune.com\Gov.

175,"SMALL BUSINESS\ Despite efforts by Gov. Blagojevich to provide better services to small businesses, a survey shows that Illinois is in the middle when compared with other states.\ According to the Small Business Survival Index developed by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, Illinois ranks 21st in the country.\ The survival index ranks states according to the policies implemented in terms of taxes, regulation, spending and other government costs affecting the entrepreneurial sector of the economy.\ ""Illinois small businesses and entrepreneurs benefit from relatively low personal income and capital gains tax rates and a relatively low level of government employment. On the negative side, there are high property taxes, a state death tax, an added tax on S corporations and a high gas tax,"" said Raymond Keating, chief economist for the Washington-based advocacy group."
176," The House likely would go along if the Senate votes to suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax, but a new way would have to be found to pay for highway construction, according to House Majority leader Dick Armey.\ At any rate, Armey (R-Texas) said that suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem of high gasoline prices. More helpful would be to augment the natural-gas delivery system, deal more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on oil imports, he said on the ""Fox News Sunday"" television program.\ ""Let's look at building natural gas lines so people in the Northeast can be ... heating with good, clean, reliable inexpensive natural gas,"" Armey said. ""Let's have a foreign policy that allows us to get some respect out of the OPEC nations that we deserve -- and we fought for, by the way. And then let's ... reduce our domestic dependence on foreign oil.""\ On the gasoline tax, most of which is supposed to go into a highway trust fund, Armey said a source of replacement money would be an important consideration before the tax could be suspended. Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who controls the flow of legislation in the Senate as majority leader, has said he may have a vote on a suspension suggested by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas).\ ""I think the House is willing to do that, but ... we want to do it correctly,"" Armey said. ""And the first thing you have to answer is: How do you replenish the highway construction funds?\ ""And if we can work out that riddle, I think we'll be able to do that. It will be a good thing to do.""\ Like other Republicans in this election year, Armey largely blamed the Clinton administration for high gasoline prices. Should Vice President Al Gore become president instead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, he said, gas prices would climb inexorably higher.\ ""That is his policy for the environment, to eliminate the internal combustion engine,"" Armey said.\ In April's reissue of Gore's 1992 book ""Earth in the Balance,"" the vice president wrote a foreword in which he reaffirmed his idea that internal combustion engines should be eliminated within 25 years. He said he doesn't want to eliminate the car, just to develop a car that won't harm the environment.\ On ABC's ""This Week,"" Wisconsin's Republican governor, Tommy Thompson, was asked his view of what is causing the current price levels, more than $2 a gallon in much of his state.\ ""First, I don't think the Clinton-Gore administration has any idea what a good energy policy is,"" Thompson said. ""Second, we're so dependent on OPEC nations for importing our oil.""\ He added into the mix new Environmental Protection Agency rules for less-polluting fuel and the country's dwindling refining and delivery infrastructure.\ ""I've just heard from Gov. Thompson [what] you've heard from virtually all the Republicans across America, I guess following the lead of Gov. Bush,"" responded Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), whose state has been hit by exorbitant prices. ""You never once heard him suggest the possibility--even the possibility--that the oil companies might have been gouging us. ... They don't want to put the blame where it should lie, and that's with the oil companies.""\ Durbin said the Federal Trade Commission is issuing subpoenas to major oil corporations in its investigation of their activities across the country."
177,"
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says his decision to impose tougher fuel-economy standards on Detroit automakers was prompted by concern over America's growing dependence on foreign oil and the need to conserve energy. Those are legitimate worries, but the secretary should have been more forthright.
\
By holding General Motors' and Ford's feet to a higher-mileage fire in 1990, the Bush administration sends another strong message to environmentalists and to industry that it plans to work aggressively to improve air quality and energy efficiency, two worthy goals. It scores points with environmentalists, who weren't crazy about Bush's slow response to the Alaskan oil spill, and with some lawmakers who want to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards significantly.
\
In fact, Skinner's decision to lift the goal back to 27.5 miles per gallon next year will do little to save gasoline or to reduce the nation's reliance on imported oil. It's too late for Detroit to make major technological changes in 1990-model cars, so automakers will respond by selling more small cars at a discount and charging more for larger ones. Consumers will be forced to pay more for the big cars they seem to want to drive, keep their old gas-guzzlers longer, switch to less efficient vans or trucks or buy some of the larger, less efficient Japanese cars that are being shipped to compete with Detroit's bigger models.
\
Skinner claims he also wanted to send Detroit a message that it must spend more on developing fuel-efficient engines and engines that will run on alternative fuels. Detroit didn't need Sam Skinner to tell it that. There are several proposals in Congress to boost fuel-economy standards to as much as 45 m.p.g. by the end of the century, and some analysts believe a standard of 33 m.p.g is inevitable by 1995.
\
In response, Detroit automakers are working on developing multi-valve engines and variable speed transmissions to improve fuel economy, and they are experimenting with engines that run on methanol, natural gas and other alternative fuels. Still, the automakers say new technologies aren't expected to produce quantum leaps in fuel efficiency or emission quality, only steady incremental gains. They fear the higher standards will damage the industry.
\
The Reagan administration recognized the drawbacks of the CAFE standards, which were set by Congress in 1975 after the panic caused by the Arab oil embargo. The Reagan White House wisely granted relief from the 27.5 m.p.g. standard for three years in a row and advocated abolishing the law. But the Bush administration wants to set itself apart from its predecessor, even if its tougher stance could result in more Japanese car sales, lost jobs for American autoworkers and lost lives as some motorists switch to smaller, lighter cars.
\
If the Bush administration wants to save fuel, it should increase the federal gasoline tax, a move that would shrink demand and help pay for rebuilding the nation's crumbling highways and bridges. That, of course, would be politically unpopular and contrary to Bush's no-new-taxes campaign pledge. If the administration is serious about improving air quality, it should consider a fee structure or a tax on all carbon-based fuels, not just gasoline.
\
Economists have long argued that a tax on pollution is a more efficient, less costly way to protect the environment than the direct controls that government imposes. The Bush administration is reported to be considering a system of market permits, for example, to contain smokestack emissions and help solve the problem of acid rain. Such a system would permit manufacturers to buy and sell the right to pollute and give them more flexibility in meeting lower emission standards. Such a system would cut pollution at much less cost to society and the economy.
\
That approach to reducing the acid rain problem makes much more sense than Skinner's adherence to the outdated CAFE standards. It's too early to condemn the Bush administration for its efforts to improve the environment and to develop a sound national energy plan. It is on the right track in some areas, but there are better ways to help Detroit be competitive in a global market and to make a contribution to a cleaner, more fuel-efficient world than through costly, counterproductive laws like CAFE.

""I have never voted for a tax or fee increase and just reduced the court fees at the county.""\DuPage County Chairman Dan Cronin said the capital bill will offer sufficient road funding.

CHAMPAIGN -- Saying the money will start to chip away at $60 million worth of desperately needed road improvements, the city council on Tuesday night voted to begin collecting 4 cents per gallon of gas sold in Champaign starting in May.
\
The new tax had both its advocates and detractors, but a slim 5-4 majority of council members ultimately decided that crumbling city streets need more funding.
\
""For me, this is a matter of a shared sacrifice,"" said council member Tom Bruno. ""It's a matter of personal responsibility.""
\
Bruno was the first council member to begin circulating a petition to get the discussion about a 4-cent tax rolling last year. Officials expect the new revenue to total about $1.5 million per year, all of which is required by ordinance to fund transportation improvements.
\
Bruno called it a jobs bill -- work for local laborers and local paving companies.
\
""This is building our roads and highways for our children and our grandchildren,"" he said.
\
A key project for the city in the near future is improvements to the bridge carrying Windsor Road over Interstate 57. The Illinois Department of Transportation has said it is willing to improve the bridge and complete the overpass with sidewalks and bicycle lanes, but the approaches on either side are the city's funding responsibility.
\
That's just one in a long line of road projects the city has lined up.
\
""While those expenses are rising, we have every indication that help from Springfield, the home of the unfunded mandate, is not going to be forthcoming,"" said council member Michael La Due, who voted for the tax.
\
Representatives of two local paving companies that stand to get those contracts spoke in favor of the tax Tuesday night.
\
""We have a huge investment in the city street network, and our delayed maintenance will make it cost more in the long run,"" said John Peisker, vice president of O'Neil Brothers construction company.
\
The tax also had opponents in the audience Tuesday night. Mark Gray, a regional director for Thornton's, said it will hurt businesses and drivers alike.
\
""It does drive the price of gasoline up,"" he said.
\
And council member Will Kyles, who had voted in favor of the tax in an informal straw poll last year, switched his vote Tuesday night.
\
""I'm not against the actual idea of better roads, it's the timing of it all,"" Kyles said.
\
Kyles said he sees other city taxes and fees rising -- like a coming stormwater utility fee -- and also sees residents struggling with the economy.
\
""It's one priority at a time in this type of environment,"" Kyles said.
\
Council member Kyle Harrison changed his vote, too, from a ""no"" last year to a ""yes"" Tuesday night. He said he has trouble wrapping his head around that $60 million backlog and the magnitude of unfunded road improvements, but the 4-cent gas tax will be a start.
\
""We're trying to throw a toothpick at a bear here,"" he said.

187,"As Illinois roads crumble, gas tax revenue to fix them keeps declining\As roads and bridges in Illinois crumble, so too does the primary source of revenue the state relies on to fix them -- the gas tax.\Illinois adds 19 cents to the pump price of each gallon of gas to underwrite road work, a fee that hasn't changed in 27 years while inflation has cut the purchasing power by half. And with cars getting better gas mileage, the Motor Fuel Tax reaps less today to fund repairs than it did a decade ago: $1.38 billion in 2007, last year $1.28 billion, state data shows.\Experts warn the same march of technology that has helped lay waste to manufacturing, in-store retailers, print-on-paper newspapers and other businesses will soon exact a similar toll on the revenue-generating power of the gas tax. That will set Illinois, other states and the federal government, which levies a similar tax for road work, scrambling for alternatives.\The ultimate disrupter could be the electric car, which Ford, General Motors, Volvo and Tesla have all committed to making in a big way. Though it won't happen overnight, the equation eventually becomes simple: the fewer internal combustion engines powering the vehicles of tomorrow, the less gas tax collected.\""It's completely unsustainable and it's really a crisis right now,"" said Audrey Wennink, director of transportation for the Metropolitan Planning Council. ""You can boost or change the structure of the gas tax, as some states have done, but in the long term it isn't going to work. You have to find another way.""\She gives the tax five more years before the bottom drops out.\Wennink's group last year proposed a 10-year, $43 billion transportation plan for the state that included a 30-cent leap in the gas tax. The idea was a non-starter in a political climate where tax hikes are a hard and sometimes toxic sell.\Recent talk in Springfield about a new infrastructure development program prompted the reelection-seeking Gov. Bruce Rauner to say he would not support a higher gas tax, which was last raised in 1990. Only three states -- Mississippi, Oklahoma and Alaska -- have gone longer without boosting their gas taxes.\In Washington, discussions over a $1 trillion infrastructure plan have generated talk of raising the federal gas tax of 18.4-cents a gallon, according to Bloomberg News. The federal tax has stayed the same since 1993, and there are few signs of support from the Republican-controlled Congress.\Illinois is in many ways an outlier when it comes to pinching transportation-related revenue sources.\Transportation for America, a nonprofit advocacy group, says 31 states have hiked transportation revenue since 2012, with 20 of them bumping up charges for their gas tax. In 2016, New Jersey raised its per-gallon charge from 14.5 cents-a-gallon to 37.5 cents, a whopping 23-cent increase.\But transportation analysts characterize that spate of state gas tax hikes as a last-gasp effort to temporarily finance road and bridge repairs until a more reliable replacement funding source can be put into place.\""There's a strong argument that says we need to boost or change the structure of the gas tax, to index it, which some states have done. But in the long term it isn't going to work. You have to have another way,"" said Joseph Schofer, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern University.\Schofer said recent public votes on transportation funding plans, such as in Los Angeles and Atlanta, show that voters will support higher taxes and fees for specific programs that are well-explained.\But replacing a nearly century old taxing mechanism that would directly affect a broad cross section of voters in an entire state is another matter. As unpopular as the one-size-fits-all gas tax is with some drivers, the alternatives can be financially, economically and politically problematic.\Toll roads wouldn't affect all drivers in a state. Hiking registration fees wouldn't account for the wear and tear different vehicles impose on highways. And a tax per miles driven system as in Oregon can lead to its own counterintuitive impact on fuel efficiency.\""There's pushback to the mileage-based plan, and it comes from politicians who are very much focused on the next election and fearful of that,"" Schofer said. ""They're saying ""no, I don't want to raise the gas tax and I can't give you an answer on how you're going to pay for (road upkeep.). So there's a mismatch.""\""Eventually, the motor fuel tax is going to be irrelevant,"" he added.\* This story was written and reported for the Better Government Association by Tim Jones.

188," Kane County Board member Catherine Hurlbut of Elgin is being challenged for her District 19 seat in the March 21 Republican primary by Hugh McGowan and Judy Colletti. The Daily Herald sent the candidates questionnaires asking them about some of the important issues in their district. Here are selected questions and responses.\ Q. One of the biggest problems the county faces is the provision of transportation services in the face of fast growth. Would you support an increase in the gas tax to help fund needed road projects?\ Judy Colletti. Cutting county taxes should be at the top of almost any reform agenda. When problems occur, local officials inevitably discuss raising taxes. I will investigate alternative solutions. While the Stearns and Bolz Road bridge projects are important in reducing traffic congestion and automobile accidents, I am concerned about the impact that any planned or potential project has on our wetlands and historic sites. We need to protect our environment.\ Catherine Hurlbut. I do support the 2-cent gas tax. I firmly believe it will be a tax on oil companies and not individuals. You do not see a 2-cent increase in gas prices as you cross into our neighboring counties that have long ago invoked this tax. We cannot afford to lose any further roadway revenue. Projects for which the county has lobbied for and received federal and state funds, requiring our local match, have to be our first priority. The Stearns Road bridge and Randall Road at Route 64 are two of the larger projects. We need to begin focusing on the Longmeadow Parkway (Bolz Road) bridge project, as we have the Stearns Bridge project, to determine the scope, phasing and future funding possibilities.\ Hugh McGowan. I know that a gas tax for county spending increase is necessary, but if so, there is money set aside by Kane County for a tax increase which would not necessarily necessitate higher gasoline prices. There is already in place a Transportation Impact Fee in addition to the taxes generated by the existing gasoline tax feeding the road and bridge fund. With constant and sizable Kane County growth, we must build/improve roads, lest we face gridlock. The Bolz Road bridge and Stearns Road bridge are necessary to avoid gridlock, but we must build them as four-lane bridges or they will be outdated by the time construction is completed. Since I see the Bolz Road bridge primarily serving the growth to the northwest into McHenry County, I am at a loss to understand why McHenry County isn't being expected to shoulder the vast majority of this new bridge expense.\ Q. Though most growth is controlled by municipalities, is the county doing a good job in those areas of growth management that it does control?\ Colletti. The county is not doing enough to maintain a system of planned growth. We need to focus on cooperation among townships and municipalities. Kane County is one of the fastest-growing counties in Illinois. Its projected growth of 71 percent over the next 25 years will substantially increase the need for county services. We must have elected officials who will best represent the needs of their constituents. I am not beholden to any special interest group. My concerns are community concerns. I want what's best for Kane County and District 19.\ Hurlbut. Kane County is a statewide leader in planning. As of last year, we combined the planning of both development and transportation in our two 2030 plans. As a county, we meet with our municipal planning partners on a regular basis to educate, promote and assist smart growth and planning. However, we do not have control over municipal annexation or facility planning areas (sewer and water service areas) within Kane County. The county leaders and staff will not and should not discontinue meeting with all of our municipal partners in planning for coordinated and organized growth within Kane County.\ McGowan. Yes, Kane County is doing a good job as it has reached out to its municipalities working with them to form boundary agreements. This prevents developers from pitting one municipality against another in negotiating land prices. Kane County is also assisting the smaller communities with their own comprehensive land use plans. Wisely, Kane County is encouraging growth toward the center of Kane County, which is our critical growth area. It is important that Kane County follow its own 2030 comprehensive plan, being strict with municipalities who wish to compromise that plan for their own purposes. We must look to the overall good of Kane County and its residents."
189,"
President-elect Bill Clinton, using a format popularized by Ross Perot, moderated an electronic town meeting on the economy Monday and was advised to pick up a tax proposal from his one-time presidential rival as well: Raising the federal gasoline tax.
\
Clinton used the televised meeting to build support among business people and other key constituencies for his long-term economic agenda, which emphasizes greater public spending on education and infrastructure and curbing health-care costs and the federal deficit.
\
Almost nothing was said, however, about his short-term economic program, suggesting that Clinton hasn't decided whether the econ- omy still needs an extra kick next year from tax breaks and $20 billion in increased road building.
\
The apparent consensus among participants-especially on universal health care-suggests that Clinton may have an easier time winning passage of his domestic initiatives, which he intends to introduce within the first 100 days of his administration.
\
These measures may now include higher gasoline taxes, last increased in 1990.
\
Arguing that the president-elect will need more money to finance his domestic programs without adding to the federal debt, Clinton adviser Jessica Tuchman Mathews of the World Resources Institute said at the conference that Clinton should increase energy taxes.
\
Clinton then turned to Harold Poling, chairman of Ford Motor Co., for a rebuttal. But rather than rejecting a tax hike, as expected, Poling said the federal tax should be raised by 25 cents a gallon over three to five years, adding that it would not hurt auto sales or the economy.
\
Clinton didn't immediately respond. Indeed, he elaborated little on policy matters, preferring instead, it seemed, to play the role of a discussion-group leader.
\
But he said at other points in the daylong meeting that the U.S. can no longer afford to be so dependent on foreign oil, which supplies almost half the nation's needs, implying a readiness to use taxes or some other mechanism to dampen consumption.
\
Clinton spokesman George Stephanopoulos called Poling's remarks ""intriguing.""
\
Clinton's advisers have been increasingly pushing for higher energy taxes. In just the last week, two groups that include ranking Clinton advisers issued reports that recommended boosting fuel taxes. And one group, the National Commission on the Environment, advocated increasing the tax by $1 a gallon through the 1990s.
\
As legislators, the members of Clinton's economic team from Congress-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D-Calif.)-also have urged higher gas taxes to reduce the federal debt.
\
The federal government levies a tax of 14.1 cents a gallon on gasoline, while states on average charge an additional 20 cents. At 34 cents a gallon, total gasoline taxes have more than doubled during the last decade, from 15 cents in 1982.
\
Typically, the tax is used to finance road building, though half the nickel-a-gallon boost in the federal tax in 1990 was earmarked toward deficit reduction.
\
Clinton's two-day economic summit conference has brought more than 325 people from across the country to Little Rock to meet with him and Vice President-elect Al Gore and discuss the economy, suggesting ways to boost long-term economic growth and thus improve Americans' standard of living.
\
Clinton listened to hours of presentations at a huge oval table at the city's riverfront convention center, asking questions and occasionally making points on policy. The proceedings were broadcast over two cable networks.
\
Participants were clearly pleased to be included in what Paula Stern, a former federal trade official, called ""a teach-in"" reminiscent of the 1960s. Hipolito Roldan of the Hispanic Housing Development Corp. in Chicago equated the session to a ""political Woodstock.""
\
The lack of dissent may be misleading. Most of the participants, culled from a list of more than 10,000 names, were Clinton supporters. And all of the economists at the meeting had endorsed Clinton's program during the campaign.
\
The guest list included many prominent business executives, most of whom voted for President Bush and contributed to his re-election effort. Despite their Republican affiliations, these business leaders also welcomed Clinton's long-term program.
\
The meeting's tone was set by Robert Solow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won the Nobel Prize in 1987. In his opening remarks, he noted that the growth rate of U.S. productivity has slowed since the early 1970s, jeopardizing living standards.
\
Moreover, income inequity has widened, so that over the last decade, the poorest fifth of the nation has grown poorer, while the wealthy have grown richer. Education is the key to explaining the gap, he said.
\
Controlling health-care costs is also critical, participants agreed. Health care costs now consume 13.5 percent of the economy and are projected to rise to 18 percent by the end of the decade, costing the nation $1.8 trillion a year. In 1972, the nation spent just 7.5 percent of its gross domestic product on health care.
\
That puts the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage against other nations, whose health-care systems consume no more than 9 percent of their economies.
\
The burden is especially pronounced in heavy manufacturing, where employers are paying benefits to huge numbers of retired workers. For instance, Ford spends as much on health care as it does on steel, Poling told the conference.
\
As these costs rise, more and more Americans find they can no longer afford health insurance.

190," As homeowners steam over rising natural gas prices, some suburban governments are making plans to return the tax windfall generated by those enormous heating bills.\ Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley insists that the city needs that money to pay its gas bills and cover other cold-related expenses. But many suburbs are either suspending their natural gas taxes or looking for other ways to refund the money to residents.\ ""We are recognizing that people are paying this extraordinary amount of money for a basic utility,"" said Mike Allison, village manager for Vernon Hills. ""The village does not want to take advantage of a situation that the people who work here are experiencing too.""\ Higher bills can mean hundreds of thousands of extra dollars for smaller communities, which are allowed to tack on a tax of up to 5 percent. The City of Chicago, which by law can charge 8 percent, expects to collect several million dollars.\ Vernon Hills expects to receive more than $100,000 in extra tax money. Allison said several options are on the table, including reducing or suspending the tax or reducing the fees charged for garbage collection.\ For most homes, the savings would amount to little more than $10, Allison estimated. But no one has stepped forward to say they don't want the money.\ ""Every little bit helps,"" said Edward Sychta, 77, president of Vernon Hills' Senior Citizens social group, who received a $235 heating bill for December.\ In Waukegan, city officials have suspended the natural gas tax until the price of fuel declines, said Mayor Bill Durkin. Carpentersville administrators have done the same for a three-month period beginning in February. And the Village of Lemont will lift its natural gas tax from Feb. 1 through the end of May.\ ""We've already met our budget figure, which is $105,000 for revenue tax,"" said Gary Holmes, Lemont village administrator. ""Anything from here on out that we collect is surplus.""\ Although Daley has called for a state investigation into the cause of skyrocketing gas prices, he has firmly resisted calls for tax relief from residents and consumer groups.\ Besides using the windfall to pay gas bills for city buildings, Chicago has earmarked $2.75 million to expand an emergency housing- assistance program to help people make their homes fuel efficient, said Jessica Rio, spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of the Environment.\ Daley also has asked the City Council to place $1.5 million in a fund to support other programs that will help low-income residents pay their heating bills, Rio said.\ Some communities do not charge a natural gas tax. Many others charge less than the maximum of 5 percent allowed by state law for communities of fewer than 1 million residents. Of 302 communities in Cook, Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane and Will Counties, 168 have a natural gas tax; 123 charge the top rate.\ Chicago is not alone in its decision to keep the extra money.\ John Kasperek, finance director for Calumet City, said any extra tax revenue will be welcome in light of new budgetary challenges facing the city.\ ""We just finished settling the police union contract, and this will help to defray the union salary increase for police,"" Kasperek said. ""It will come at a good time. When those checks do start arriving, it will help us pay our bills.""\ Zion, too, is likely to use the money to help pay for new police officers, Deputy Comptroller Bill Johansen said.\ ""We just hired seven new officers,"" Johansen said. ""That's a need right now.""\ Zion recently took a budgetary hit when its Commonwealth Edison nuclear power station shut down, he said.\ ""Any time you lose a source of revenue, it hurts a city,"" he said.\ Park Ridge City Manager Tim Schuenke said he isn't convinced there will be a great windfall. But any extra money will come in handy to pay higher-than-expected cost of plowing streets this year, he said.\ ""We took a significant hit in our budget for snow removal,"" Schuenke said. ""If the money is there, it will help us pay the budget.""\ In Burr Ridge one village trustee has asked that the tax be suspended, but other officials are hoping the extra funds will allow them to hold down a property tax increase for next year, Village Administrator Steven Stricker said.\ Other suburbs are considering tax relief that stops short of suspending or refunding the windfall.\ Midlothian has reduced its tax to 2.5 percent from 5 percent on home heating bills through April. And officials in Justice are investigating whether it would be legal for them to refund part of the money in the form of a property tax rebate for senior citizens, Mayor Mel VanAllen said.\ Some municipalities remain on the fence.\ Evanston City Manager Roger Crum said additional gas tax revenue probably would be used to hold down property taxes, although no decision has been made.\ ""Our primary goal in Evanston is to keep our property tax increases as low as possible,"" Crum said."
191,"
A U.S. motorist pulls into a service station and plunks down 97 cents for a gallon of gasoline. In Britain, the same amount of gas would cost the equivalent of $2.77.
\
Why the difference?
\
British motorists, and drivers in many other European countries, pay taxes accounting for approximately half of the price of gasoline at the pump, making it a luxury item for many.
\
Some now believe the modest U.S. federal gas tax of 9 cents a gallon could be headed in the same direction.
\
""We are about to follow the Europeans down the road of no return,"" says Bill Berman, director of energy and environment for the American Automobile Association.
\
He also heads a newly formed umbrella group called Fuel Users for Equitable Levies, which has launched a campaign to offset mounting pressure for a gas tax increase as a way of reducing the nation's $155 billion budget deficit.
\
The antitax lobby is supported by such groups as the American Farm Bureau Federation and the American Petroleum Institute.
\
No gas tax increase is imminent, but with policymakers desperate for some solution to the deficit, the debate continues.
\
Critics say a tax increase would mean slower business, higher inflation and fewer jobs.
\
Supporters retort that a higher tax would calm international deficit jitters and thus strengthen the economy in the long run. As an added benefit, they claim, it would reduce America's growing dependence on foreign oil by curbing demand for gasoline.
\
""The effort must now be made to get the deficit down,"" former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said earlier this year in calling for an increase in the tax.
\
President Bush is opposed to a higher gas tax, but the idea has drawn support from witnesses before the 14-member National Economic Commission created by Congress to search for deficit remedies.
\
Each penny-per-gallon of additional tax would yield $1 billion in revenue. That makes it seem an attractive way to sharply reduce the budget deficit.
\
Business is divided. Within the auto industry, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca supports a tax increase, but General Motors Corp. is stoutly opposed to it on grounds that it would hammer the economy. Ford Motor Co. is hesitant on the issue but has said it could support a phased increase of 5 cents per gallon per year.
\
The roadbuilding lobby, led by the Associated General Contractors, opposes a tax increase on grounds that the additional revenue would go to cutting the budget deficit instead of expanding the $14 billion Federal Highway Trust Fund.
\
There is no assurance that the additional tax collections would be used for trimming the deficit, however, if the money were channeled into general revenues.
\
In Congress, Southwesterners are cool to anything that would reduce demand for gasoline at a time when energy-producing economies back home are feeling the pain of depressed oil prices.
\
""I hope they are able to avoid any new tax, including a gasoline tax,"" Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Tex.), said in a statement.
\
As chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, Bentsen would have much to say about the matter.
\
Other congressmen are split.
\
Some critics of the idea say a gas tax increase would fall unfairly on Westerners and farmers, some of whom must drive long distances to take care of essential needs.
"
192,"
Senate Democrats conceded Monday that a temporary repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax increase is unavoidable, and Republican leaders prepared to tap the nation's savings institutions to pay for it.
\
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said the Senate could vote as soon as Tuesday on the tax cut, which he proposed less than two weeks ago. He planned to discuss the timing, as well as a Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage, with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
\
""We think (it) is inevitable,"" Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters. Republicans are ""in the majority. They have the votes to pass legislation.""
\
The leading proposal for paying for the cut, according to House and Senate aides, was separate legislation that strengthens the government fund insuring savings and loan deposits.
\
That plan requires a one-time premium payment from S&Ls, and, under budget rules, the money can be used to offset the tax cut. GOP leaders also are looking at a cut in Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.
\
The Clinton administration supports the S&L legislation, and Daschle said he was ""not necessarily averse"" to using it to cut the gas tax.
\
Republican leaders are pushing hard for the repeal, which is seen as having wide popular appeal. Dole, Clinton's presumptive rival in the presidential race, notes repeatedly that the tax increase was approved ""without a single Republican vote.""
\
Many Democrats are criticizing the tax cut, saying it could amount to a windfall for the oil companies who pay the tax and ultimately pass it on to the consumer. And environmentalists maintain the tax cut would encourage more energy consumption and hurt the environment.
\
However, some Democrats feel compelled to vote for the tax cut, and Republicans are near unanimous in backing it.
\
At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton wanted the tax cut considered as part of a balanced budget. But that doesn't mean Clinton had decided to veto the cut.
\
With gas prices soaring roughly 20 cents a gallon since February, Dole on April 26 proposed shaving the 1993 increase of 4.3 cents off the 18.3-cent federal gasoline tax.
\
Dole (R-Kan.) suggested the Senate should act on Tuesday, which marks what the private, business-financed Tax Foundation has called Tax Freedom Day. That's the date, according to its calculation, by which the average taxpayer has earned enough to pay federal, state and local taxes for the year.

193," Why it would pay to get rid of tollways\ Let's look at some of the facts about the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority that politicians will never acknowledge.\ Fact No. 1:\ Since its early days and continuing to the present day, the toll authority has been a playpen for political appointees, patronage workers, businessmen looking to cash in and many others looking for personal or professional gain.\ Fact No. 2:\ Politicians say the cost to transfer expenses for the toll authority to the Illinois Department of Transportation would be too high. This must be a new way of thinking, since recent history shows many tax hikes that have been enacted even though popular opposition was obvious.\ What is the real reason the politicians are running away from elimination of the toll authority? See fact No. 1.\ About 25 percent of the toll authority budget is wasted due to the costs of collecting tolls. This is one way to reduce expenses to the state; another is to realize that all dedicated I-PASS construction, management, expenses and tollbooth stop signs should go away. This causes a reduction of gasoline usage for motorists. Also reduced is air pollution and the waste of time sitting in toll plaza delays.\ The extra expense the Illinois Department of Transportation would be responsible for should be paid for by an increase in the statewide gas tax, with a moderately higher gas tax increase for the counties nearest the areas served by the toll roads. New toll road construction would be carefully evaluated before any commitment is made, and the system of exit and entrance interchanges on the existing toll roads should be expanded to make the highways more accessible to local roads. This would further reduce pollution, fuel usage and commuting time.\ Elimination of the toll roads will not make everyone happy. Illinois residents should be demanding that the transportation issues of the state be handled more by professionals and less by politicians, which eventually should reduce state government inefficiencies and improve the region's livability.\ Glenn Golz\ Arlington Heights\ Young people are not being taught to respect\ I read with interest the Associated Press article ""Survey: Americans have no respect, no respect at all.""\ I am in perfect agreement with this statement and also agree that it has gotten worse. I believe that part of the problem is that children today are not being taught manners.\ Many of the current younger generation and the generation before live as though they are the only ones who count and everyone else can like it or lump it. I also was glad that customer service was included. On Easter Sunday, we took our 85-year-old mother to brunch.\ The young hostess showed us to a booth. When we explained that our mother would have too much trouble getting in and out of the booth and we would like a table, she said absolutely not.\ The tables were arranged and there could be no changing. Not only did she have no respect for our senior citizen, she had no customer service sense. We asked for the manager who accommodated our request without question.\ He was, of course, older. I think this points out that much of this disrespect is because the younger generations are not being taught the proper actions in a social environment. It is up to those of us who know better to set an example of good behavior.\ Ann Kowalski\ Wheeling"
194," Prince, Cinderella hurt by Mickey Mouse rules\ The decision by the Jacobs High School principal to let only students who ride their prom bus go to prom is a bad and inconsistent decision. Not all extracurricular activities associated with the school get the must-ride-the-bus rule, and prom should be no exception.\ Community School District 300 Superintendent Kenneth Arndt said, ""It's when there are exceptions that trouble occurs.""\ Because of this decision, the two students who play Prince Charming and Cinderella in the Christian Youth Theatre's ""Cinderella"" will not be able to honor their commitment to their theater group and attend their prom. It must be one or the other. If allowed their own transportation, they could do both.\ One of the responsibilities of a high school is to prepare its students for college and the real world. Once they graduate, no one is going to make them ride a bus anywhere to an activity that is optional and they are going to pay big money to attend.\ After high school, one of the things productive citizens have to face every day is how to fit more and more activities into a limited amount of time. These kids already have learned how to do that by wanting to take their own transportation to the prom so they can fulfill their commitment with their theater group and attend their prom.\ It is an excellent idea to offer a bus as an alternative form of transportation. That way parents who have kids they are concerned about can insist they take the bus. It is wrong to exclude students from prom who cannot make the bus because of prior commitments but who can do both if allowed their own transportation to prom.\ It is admirable that the school wants to do everything in its power to prevent irresponsible students from hurting themselves. It is both a tragedy and a travesty that good, responsible students are going to suffer to accomplish this.\ I'll bet Prince Charming and Cinderella never thought they would be in such a Mickey Mouse situation.\ Clarence Hayward\ Elgin\ Young people are not being taught to respect\ I read with interest the Associated Press article ""Survey: Americans have no respect, no respect at all.""

Sure, you promised the voters to fight the expansion, but we don't expect the truth from our politicians.\ Case in point - look at how many times George Ryan, Dick Durbin and Richard Daley have been re-elected. Can't you see the value in the expansion?\ The runways will be reconfigured to steer all the flights away from the city of Chicago where Mayor Daley's constituents are unhappy with the massive air and noise pollution. It is much better to deposit all this in the suburbs and deposit only the increased tax revenues in Chicago.\ Drop your opposition and you, like Durbin, can command huge campaign contributions from the firms that will reap sweet contracts from the mayor.\ Besides, we lemmings don't know how to deal with a politician who keeps his word.\ Jim McAllister\ Roselle\ Priests guilty of abuse terrorize their victims\ The current debacle within the Roman Catholic Church has an interesting parallel to the ""U.S. War Against Terrorism.""\ President George W.

The American bishops and archbishops must be held accountable, not only to the church members, but also to the law enforcement agencies of various municipalities.\ Edwin A. Hollatz\ Wheaton\ Bipartisan coalition aids McHenry County\ The McHenry County legislative contingent of state Sen. Dick Klemm, state Reps. Jack Franks and Mark Beaubien must be congratulated on their hard work in passing legislation that helps the McHenry County Mental Health Board. Franks introduced House Bill 4170, which was co-sponsored by Beaubien and will allow the McHenry County Mental Health agencies much greater access to federal funds as well as access to private funds.\ It is a creative solution to funding problems that won't cost local taxpayers any additional money while at the same time greatly helps the mental health community. The bill passed unanimously in the state House on March 20, and Klemm guided the bill through the Senate with the same results on April 18.\ I am proud that our legislators work so closely together and so effectively. We are fortunate to have such highly effective, competent and compassionate legislators representing us.\ Jason Berezowski\ McHenry"
195,"
George Gollin and David Green would like to see a repeat of the 2012 Democratic primary in the 13th Congressional District, in which the candidate backed by U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and most of the top downstate Democratic officials, Greene County State's Attorney Matt Goetten, lost to Bloomington emergency room physician David Gill by 163 votes.
\
Gill, who went on to lose the general election to Republican Rodney Davis by 1,002 votes, opted not to run again this year.
\
In this year's Democratic primary, the big money and support have lined up behind former Madison County Judge Ann Callis. She not only has Durbin, the DCCC, labor unions and other interest groups behind her, but also former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several other Democratic House members in Washington. She also has raised about $830,000 -- not as much as Davis, the incumbent Republican -- but greater than Gollin's $477,562 ($165,000 of which was loaned by Gollin himself) or Green's unknown amount (he once said he had a fundraising goal of $10,000 but never filed a disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission, which requires reporting once contributions reach a $5,000 threshold).
\
Callis is outspending Gollin on local television stations as well, according to reports reviewed last week. Callis has spent $34,925 on Fox and ABC stations in the Champaign-Urbana-Springfield-Decatur market and about $30,000 at WCIA in Champaign. Gollin has spent $28,500 at the Fox and ABC stations and $28,8710 at WCIA.
\
The only public poll of the race, taken about 10 days ago, gave Callis a 41 percent to 25 percent lead.
\
Still, Gollin received the backing of all three newspapers making endorsements in the race -- The News-Gazette, Chicago Tribune and State Journal-Register in Springfield -- all of which were critical of Callis' torpid campaign.
\
""Callis sticks to safe talking points, occasionally name-checking Durbin. Her answers to our survey are carefully scripted, heavy on promises to protect seniors and middle-class families without explaining what she'd actually do,"" said the Tribune, which added that she declined to do an interview with the Tribune.
\
None of the Democratic candidates support repealing the Affordable Care Act, although all voiced concerns about it.
\
Callis: ""I want to find reforms that fix and improve the Affordable Care Act. The rollout was abysmal, but I think it's wrong to hurt the middle-class by going backward. I oppose spending more time and money to push a political agenda. We can't just shut down our government and cost our economy billions of dollars because we disagree with a law.""
\
Gollin: ""The rollout was entirely unacceptable in execution. But we are Americans, and we fix problems rather than throwing up our hands and walking away. The enrollment software is now working nearly as well as intended, and the rate at which people are signing up for health insurance isn't appreciably lower than the targeted rate.""
\
Green: ""I do not support repeal of the ACA, which, however, was a betrayal of the base of the Democratic Party by President Obama. I support moving to Medicare for All as quickly as possible.""
\
Each said their top priority was increasing employment in the 13th District.
\
Green: ""There are 20 million Americans who want a full-time job and do not have one. The federal government should provide employment at a living wage for each of them. Meanwhile, the minimum wage for all jobs should be raised to $15 per hour at a national level.""
\
Callis: ""The most important issue to our community is how we can grow our economy and create jobs. That will be my focus from day one if I am honored to be elected. I truly believe we can grow jobs here in our district. That means we stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas.""
\
Gollin: ""Returning the district, and the country, to full employment.""
\
All three said they'd oppose a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman; each has expressed support for abortion rights; and they've all said they support an immigration reform bill passed by the Democrat-dominated Senate.
\
But there are differences among the candidates.
\
Regarding the federal death penalty, Green and Gollin say they want it repealed, but Callis said, ""I believe states should continue to set their own guidelines in this area and do not believe we should change federal law.""
\
Of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, Gollin and Green say they oppose its construction, while Callis said, ""Since recent news has come out on the pipeline, I think we need to wait and see what will happen in courts. Then we should be bringing all people together to make responsible and informed decisions that will foster job growth and at the same time protect our environment.""
\
And while Green and Gollin proposed specific changes in federal campaign finance laws -- they want public financing of all political campaigns and limits on campaign contributions -- Callis gave a more vague answer.
\
""I will work in Congress on legislation that ensures our elections stay fair, that secret money does not have such a large influence, and that individuals are given the power to have a say in our political process,"" she said.
\
Gollin said he'd support an increase in the federal gasoline tax to help finance infrastructure improvements; Green said his ""dramatically revised overall federal tax system"" with higher taxes on the wealthy would make a higher gas tax unnecessary; and Callis said she'd oppose a higher gas tax.
\
""I do not support an increase in the federal gasoline tax, and instead would work to cut subsidies for big oil companies or companies that ship jobs overseas and put that toward needed infrastructure projects in our communities,"" she said.

196,"The Illinois gas tax was last increased in 1990, from 16 cents a gallon to 19 cents. \In that year, East and West Germany reunited, Nelson Mandela left prison and Andre Dawson played for the Cubs.\It was, in short, a long time ago, and the tax has not kept up with inflation. Some lawmakers pushing for a capital bill want a hike in the current gas tax, which helps pay for construction and repair of the state's roads and bridges.\But the gas tax has another problem. More fuel-efficient cars mean drivers buy less gas, and that means lower gas tax proceeds. As a result, some states have looked into an alternate road use tax, charging by miles driven.\So far, this idea has gone over like a flying Edsel in Springfield. But the state should give it a try, said Audrey Wennink, transportation director for the Metropolitan Planning Council, a nonprofit research group.\""Even if we have a gas tax increase, that's a short-term solution,"" said Wennink, who favors a pilot program for a miles-traveled tax along with a gas tax hike so the state can learn about it.\Gov. J. B. Pritzker proposed a pilot during his gubernatorial campaign but isn't currently pursuing the idea, said spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh.\Rep. Marcus Evans Jr., a Democrat representing Chicago and some south suburbs, introduced a bill for a miles-traveled tax pilot last month but tabled it a week later. He said the time was not ripe, and more education needs to be done.\""Most people who responded to me didn't know what it was,"" he said. \\How it works\Oregon -- which in 1919 was the first state to impose a gas tax, to fix its muddy roads -- was also the first to try a miles-traveled program in 2015. Volunteers pay the state 1.7 cents for every mile they drive and in return, they are credited for fuel taxes they pay at the pump. The program is currently limited to 5,000 vehicles. Azuga, a private GPS and fleet tracking company, counts driver miles for the state.\Smaller pilots have been tried in Colorado, Washington, California and along Interstate 95 on the East Coast, according to Nate Bryer, Azuga's vice president of innovation\Users can choose how they want the miles counted. One way to do it is to plug a transponder into the diagnostic port of a vehicle, to count miles. If GPS is used with the device, out-of-state miles will not be counted. Pictures also can be taken of a car's odometer, Bryer explained.\The idea is to make sure every user of the state's roads helps pay for them, said Maureen Bock, manager of the Oregon Department of Transportation's miles-based usage program, That means the owner of a new electric Tesla, who does not have to buy gas, pays the same as the owner of an old gas-guzzling pickup truck. The amount of damage a vehicle does to the road is the same up to 10,000 pounds, so all vehicles in that weight category pay the same, said Bock. \\Privacy and fairness issues\One of the main concerns raised about a vehicle-miles-traveled program is privacy. Some people fear having the government know how many miles they have driven. Bock said mileage information provided to Oregon's Transportation Department is kept private and destroyed 30 days after the bill is paid. She said if law enforcement officials want driver data, they need a warrant.\Another worry is that rural drivers may get taxed more than urban drivers, because they are presumed to drive farther. But research has shown that on average, rural and urban drivers drive about the same number of miles. Rural drivers do longer trips less frequently, while urban drivers make more frequent short trips, Bock said.\One advantage of fuel-efficient vehicles, besides that people pay less gas tax, is that they are less polluting. The gas tax is effectively a carbon tax and fairly accounts for the pollution impacts of fuel-inefficent trucks and cars, said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which opposes a vehicle-miles-traveled tax. ""The tax does not differentiate between gas guzzlers and fuel-efficient vehicles. That undermines sound climate change solutions policy.""\Wennink agreed that efficient vehicles are good for the environment but are bad for road revenue. In 1991, Illinois residents paid $166 per capita in motor fuel taxes. It's now down to about $100 a year, a 40 percent drop, she said.\""People are using the system more and paying less,"" she said. ""This results in bad conditions on our roadways, potholes, need for resurfacing and a lot of deferred maintenance.""\Bock said that the gas tax is regressive, in that people with older cars subsidize those with newer, more fuel-efficient cars. A vehicle-miles traveled tax ensures that everyone pays the same. She compared it with an electric utility, in that the more power you use, the more you pay. \\Fear of higher taxes\But while a usage fee makes sense, it should not be implemented in addition to the existing gas tax, which is already high when other taxes are figured in, cautions a conservative think tank.\Illinois is one of the few states that impose both a gas tax and a sales tax on gasoline, said Adam Schuster, the Illinois Policy Institute's director of budget and tax research. Cities like Chicago also impose their own taxes on gas.\""I don't see us supporting the tax until it addresses the overpayment concerns and privacy concerns,"" said Schuster.\There is also an issue of how out-of-state vehicles would pay. In its limited program, Oregon uses both taxes, so out-of-state and Oregon drivers who are not in the program still pay fuel taxes at the pump. A vehicle-miles-traveled-only program in one state but not in surrounding states would give visiting drivers a free ride.\The Illinois Economic Policy Institute, a think tank whose board members represent the construction industry and labor unions, believes a miles-traveled tax should be considered.\""The gas tax needs to be increased and will help revenue in the short term, but vehicles in the long term are getting more efficient, and we need a tax that is not tied to gas used,"" said Mary Craighead, transportation policy analyst for the institute. \\Transportation song quiz\* Our last song was about a kind of street, and how it's affected by a Chicago weather phenomenon we hope to be rid of soon.

\
Patricia A. Avery
\
Age: 51
\
Address: 1308 W. Clark St., C
\
Political experience: Champaign County Board, 1998-2006, four years as chairwoman; appointed Champaign County recorder, served August-December 2006
\
Political affiliation: Democrat.
\
Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? ""Yes. I also think that appointments to the police review board should be made by the entire council, rather than being appointed by the mayor and just approved by the council.""
\
Do you favor having Champaign conduct rental apartment inspections, like Urbana does? Do you favor rental registration, which could be used to pay for an inspection program? ""Yes, I think Champaign should look at an enhanced inspection plan. I don't think the city's commons-areas inspection program is comprehensive enough, nor does it address possible code violations of non-commons areas.
\
""I can support a rental registration fee or imposing fines on violations that aren't corrected within 30 days. And, more importantly, timely reinspections should be done on those complaints.""
\
What should the city do to address its $43 million backlog of unimproved arterial roads? Implement a city gas tax? Require developer contribution toward arterial roads? Both? ""I would not support implementing a gas tax. We should make better use of our current tax revenues to meet our responsibilities for these roads. Developers should be required to contribute their fair share. We also should try and negotiate greater county and state contributions to fringe-road agreements.""
\
Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you would favor. ""I support the ordinance. This is 2007, where the public is now more informed about the hazards of smoke. I believe this matter has already been dealt with and should stand.""
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives to city developers? ""Yes. I am interested in development that sparks the local economy by providing new jobs and opportunities to the residents who live in the areas where the development is happening. That is not the case in Champaign.
\
""I don't think residents should have to pay 75 cents an hour to park to help pay for the $11 million parking garage that's been proposed. I think the city should engage in sound fiscal practices and slow down the merry-go-round of tax cuts and subsidies whose net effect is to give away the tax dollars needed to finance the public infrastructure and government services we are providing.""
\
Tom Bruno
\
Age: 53
\
Address: 1109 W. Park St., C
\
Political experience: Appointed to the city council in August 1997. Elected in 1999; reelected in 2003.
\
Political affiliation: ""I am not active in party politics of either party. I have never held a partisan office.""
\
Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? ""It depends on the makeup and rules of such a board. I would not rule it out, but I would not want to create a board that fostered division in the community. We have a great police force right now, and I want to keep it that way, but if a mechanism can be created that increases public trust and confidence in our police, then it would be a good thing for all of us.""
\
Do you favor having Champaign conduct rental apartment inspections, like Urbana does? Do you favor rental registration, which would be used to pay for such a systematic inspection program? ""Persons should be free from unwarranted governmental intrusions into their homes. If a tenant welcomes city inspectors into their living quarters, then they will gladly conduct an inspection. ... The notion of forcing inspections and then passing along the cost of those inspections in the form of higher rental costs would only further burden those we are seeking to help.""
\
What should the city do to address is $43 million backlog of unimproved arterial roads? Implement a city gas tax? Require developer contribution toward arterial roads? Both? ""The county needs to step up to the plate with its fair share of contribution to the cost of fringe road improvements, and we need to keep the city's economy healthy to be able to improve our arterial roads.""
\
Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you would favor. ""We made the right choice when we enacted the clean air ordinance. We joined a growing list of forward-looking communities and states who have put the health and welfare of their citizens first in their priorities.""
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives to city developers? ""Economic incentives are required to see the levels of development we have witnessed in our community over the past 10 years. Communities unwilling or unable to offer an attractive opportunity will be passed over by investors seeking to develop in a competitive world.""
\
Deborah Frank Feinen
\
Age: 39
\
Address: 1202 Mayfair Road, C
\
Political experience: Champaign County Board, 1992-2006; ran for state representative in 2004; appointed to the city council in August 2006.
\
Political affiliation: Republican
\
Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? ""I do not favor creation of a civilian police review board; however, I am aware that Chief Finney has been working on the concept internally. It is possible that if a plan is forwarded by the chief and has his support that I might change my mind. I do not favor the board because there are internal review steps already in place and there is a system in place to field citizen complaints.""
\
Do you favor having Champaign conduct rental apartment inspections, like Urbana does? Do you favor rental registration, which could be used to pay for such a systematic inspection program? ""I do not favor either.""
\
What should the city do to address its $43 million backlog of unimproved arterial roads? Implement a city gas tax? Require developer contribution toward arterial roads? Both? ""The first thing we should do is continue to follow the city's long-range improvement plan and make sure it is adequately funded. I would also be willing to consider some level of bonding to support road improvements. I do not support a city gas tax. I believe that the city is primarily responsible for infrastructure. I don't support requiring developer contribution toward arterial road improvements. I don't object to the city as part of negotiations on a new development working to see if they can negotiate those improvements as part of the agreement.""
\
Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you would favor. ""I was not supportive of the smoking ban when it was established. I support a repeal for bars and veteran's clubs (VFW, American Legion, etc.). I would consider a total repeal, especially if we receive economic evidence that the ban is having a detrimental effect on businesses.""
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives for city developers? ""I believe that the city has acted appropriately with developers. We are a probusiness city, and we are using the tools available to us to attract new business and development and to create infill development in our center city. New development creates jobs for our community and also a larger tax base for the city in the long run.""
\
Karen B. Foster
\
Age: 56
\
Address: 2113 Blackthorn Drive, C
\
Political Experience: Never run for public office. Worked with the County Board in my position as child care director at Champaign County Nursing Home.
\
Political affiliation: Republican. Precinct committeewoman since July 2006.
\
Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? ""I am not in favor of a civilian police review board because it would be another layer of government that is already in place through the Human Relations Commission. The people serving on that commission are citizens who can be contacted to perform the same function as a review board. By working with the Police Department and following proper channels, problems may be solved in the same manner as a review board.""
\
Do you favor having Champaign conduct rental apartment inspections, like Urbana does? Do you favor rental registration, which could be used to pay for such a systematic inspection program? ""No, I do not feel Champaign needs to conduct systematic rental apartment inspections because Champaign already has a pilot apartment commons area inspection program. There is also a database created with the landlords' owner information. I am not in favor of adding a fee to the registration.""
\
What should the city do to address its $43 million backlog of unimproved arterial roads? Implement a city gas tax? Require developer contribution toward arterial roads? Both? ""I would be against implementing a city gas tax, but all options should remain open to public discussion. After weighing all of the options, I would implement a plan that would equalize the burden between taxpayers and developers.""
\
Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you would favor. ""I favor a repeal of the smoking ban. In speaking with different bar owners and employees, revenues are down. I am not a smoker, but I feel that each establishment should have the right to make policies for themselves concerning allowing smoking or not. ... I would want to know the impacts of the smoking ban before suggesting specific changes.""
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives for developers? ""No. In order for developers to continue and provide new growth, the city is well within its parameters in granting incentives. New growth generates new income for the city. The council needs to review the long-term effects of the projects proposed and determine the projected revenues vs. incentives. I would like to make sure that smaller projects are also given consideration."" Bill Glithero
\
Age: 47
\
Address: 13 Sherwood Court, C
\
Political experience: Served nine years, until 2006, on city Neighborhood Services Advisory Board; three years on city Human Relations Commission; vice chairman of the TIMES Center advisory board; former president of the Spalding Park Neighborhood Association; member of compliance committee for Americans With Disabilities Act, city of Champaign.
\
Political affiliation: ""None, although I tend to think of myself more Republican than Democrat.""
\
Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? ""Yes. While I think police do a good job the majority of the time, oversight doesn't hurt. I object to an organization, any organization, policing itself. I would favor a countywide board that would review complaints against all police in the county. I would like to see a former police official to be included on the board to explain police procedures.""
\
Do you favor having Champaign conduct rental apartment inspections, like Urbana does? Do you favor rental registration, which would be used to pay for such a systematic inspection program? ""Yes, I do, as long as rental houses are included, since they have a greater impact on the neighborhood. I do see a positive with annual inspections. The landlords can use the fact the properties have been inspected and meet city standards. ... The renters will be assured of quality housing. The cost of the registration needs to be minimal since it would most likely be passed along to the renter.""
\
What should the city do to address is $43 million backlog of unimproved arterial roads? Implement a city gas tax? Require developer contribution toward arterial roads? Both? ""First, we need to ensure that the backlog projects are properly prioritized within the federal aid system plan for the city. I would not be in favor of a city gas tax. I would, however, be in favor of developers carrying their fair share of the improvements required by their projects."" Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you would favor. ""I favor a modification that would allow smoking at establishments with a Class A liquor license. I would also allow an exception for any organization connected to our military.""
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives to city developers? ""Yes, I do. While I understand some level of incentives are necessary to continue the growth of the city, we have been overly generous with the incentives on the fringe of our community. I am more accepting of incentives that would promote growth and redevelopment of the city's core and established neighborhoods.""
\
Michael Henley
\
Age: 37
\
Address: 4204 Ironwood Lane, C
\
Political experience: None
\
Party affiliation: Conservative
\
Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? ""It would depend upon what type of department issues the board is appointed or elected to review. I feel that police matters should be handled within the department, as persons either elected or appointed to a citizens' review board may not be familiar enough with the 'inner workings' of the police department to be able to make certain types of determinations.""
\
Do you favor having Champaign conduct rental apartment inspections, like Urbana does? Do you favor rental registration, which could be used to pay for such a systematic inspection program? ""I feel that there are enough ordinances regulating rental property and the condition thereof. If a problem is serious enough, the current ordinances will address said problem and the landlord would be required to remedy any serious problem or issue.""
\
What should the city do to address its $43 million backlog of unimproved arterial roads? Implement a city gas tax? Require developer contribution toward arterial roads? Both? ""I don't agree with either a gas tax or mandated developer contributions. In addressing the unimproved arterial roads, the citizens of Champaign do not need yet another tax imposed upon them. I also do not think that requiring a developer to contribute to the repair and maintenance of the roads will do anything to attract new development.""
\
Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you favor. ""I feel that there should not be an ordinance mandating any business to prohibit smoking in their establishment. The choice whether or not to be a smoke-free establishment should be up to each owner. I think the ordinance should be abolished, not revised, and I do not support the ordinance in any form.""
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives to city developers? ""I am for tax incentives to attract new businesses and development to the city. However, I do not think that it is a good idea for the city council to play the futures market with taxpayers' dollars for the short-term gain of select entities.""

\
Political affiliation: Democrat precinct committeeman, City of Champaign 11
\
Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? ""I do. I think Chief Finney has worked to rectify years of wrongdoing and neglect by that department. I think an independent neutral citizens' review would be a fairer way to judge complaints against police.""
\
Do you favor having Champaign conduct rental apartment inspections, like Urbana does? Do you favor rental registration, which could be used to pay for such a systematic inspection program? ""Yes. I would favor us moving in that direction. I would have to look at what Urbana is doing and figure out what works best for Champaign. But I don't want anybody living in unsafe conditions.""
\
What should the city do to address its $43 million backlog of unimproved arterial streets? A city gas tax? Require developer contribution toward arterial roads? Both? ""It's about time to improve our older infrastructure, and that's what the primary focus should be. As much as we give to developers, they need to provide something to the community, like road contributions or other infrastructure improvements, or providing a percentage of affordable housing.""
\
Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you would favor? ""I support the ban. In the future, we may need to tighten it to include workplaces, public parks, and have at least a portion of outdoor patios be smoke free. If we're going to revisit this again, I'm going for a stronger ordinance, not a weaker one.""
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives to city developers? ""I'm not comfortable characterizing the incentives as excessive. The important consideration is what public interest is served by the incentives. On a case-by-case basis, the council needs to determine if the benefits of the development are worth the city investment in incentives. I want to make sure the city isn't left footing most of the costs.""
\
Annette B. Williams
\
Age: 62
\
Address: 505 Louisiana Ave., C
\
Political experience: None
\
Party affiliation: Democrat
\
Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? ""Yes. Unfortunately, there have been incidents in our city when individual police officers misapplied their authority and abused the public trust. The happens more frequently among the minority and low-income populations in our community. It seems to me that a proper view of democracy should allow ordinary citizens some recourse and oversight of inappropriate or illegal police conduct. A civilian police review board can provide means for the community to bring grievances regarding police to a fair and impartial hearing."" Do you favor having Champaign conduct rental apartment inspections, like Urbana does? Do you favor rental registration, which could be used to pay for such a systematic inspection program? ""Yes. Apartment rental inspections are necessary to insure tenant's safety. Had this policy been in place, a death that occurred due to a lack of improvements could have been prevented. I also favor rental registration to monitor and track rental properties in our community.""
\
What should the city do to address its $43 million backlog of unimproved arterial roads? Implement a city gas tax? Require developer contribution toward arterial roads? Both? ""The city should require the developers whose projects include the expansion or creation of arterial roads to serve their developments to contribute toward the arterial roads' construction and repair. I oppose a city gas tax.""
\
Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you favor. ""I support it as it is. This is a public health issue. As shown in other communities that have enacted bans, the general public embraces and supports a smoke-free environment.""
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives to city developers? ""Yes. The city's excessive level of incentives for wealthy developers has siphoned tax dollars for needed services, such as roads. There needs to be a serious study and review of this issue to determine the larger social cost of how these incentives have negatively impacted our city ... and have placed the other city needs and its citizens at risk.""

Do you favor creation of a civilian police review board? Why or why not? Yes, I fully support the idea. Recent incidents have convinced me more emphatically that the city council needs to take up this issue. I think the community expects the city council to address this issue. We need a fair and impartial process; we don't have that right now.

Many people feel like this issue is being politicized with the most recent March 30 incident where a black youth was pepper-sprayed and subdued by four police officers in the Douglass Park area. It's a coincidence that it happened right now, but it's an example that there is a problem in the black community with the police.

Do you favor repeal or modification of the city's smoking ban, or do you support it? Be specific about any changes you favor. I support it as it is. This is a public health issue. As shown in other communities that have enacted bans, the general public embraces and supports a smoke-free environment.
\
Do you believe the city has approved excessive levels of economic incentives to city developers? Yes. The city's excessive level of incentives for wealthy developers has siphoned tax dollars for needed services, such as roads. There needs to be a serious study and review of this issue to determine the larger social cost of these incentives.

199,"The battle lines have formed again in the decades-old controversy over extending a key artery, Illinois Route 53, north through Lake County. This time the fight has stirred attention well beyond the county's borders.\A key question looms on whether the Illinois Tollway should spend nearly $6 million for an environmental impact study on the feasibility of the controversial project. \That study, if favorable, could serve to greenlight a much more costly decision by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority board: Should the agency build a proposed $2.65 billion tollway that would cost more to drive per mile than anywhere else in the entire system? \An advisory committee recommended in March that Lake County residents bear a major share of the construction costs, with a new county gas tax and creation of a special taxing district. But the project's cost would be shared by everyone who uses the tollway system. \Supporters and opponents of the project have become increasingly vocal in recent months, turning out at Tollway board meetings to  present their arguments. \Hawthorn Woods resident Vanessa Griffin told the Tollway board last week that constructing the highway would disrupt the environment and harm ""a beautiful, calm, quiet, nature-soaked community."" \Evan Craig, representing the Sierra Club, said the extension would destroy portions of the county's valuable wetlands. Furthermore, the project would result in Lake County ""taxing itself to help pay for its own demise,"" the Vernon Hills resident said. \But Jeffrey Berman, a Buffalo Grove village trustee, countered that plans call for wetland protections and restoration of natural resources, with innovative stormwater management techniques to minimize environmental impact. \After 40 years of debate, ""it's time to move forward with this critical infrastructure project that will mitigate congestion and drive renewed economic opportunity"" in the county, Berman said. \Foes have organized to oppose the project. More than 100 project opponents rallied Sept. 20 at the Heron Creek Forest Preserve in Lake Zurich. Proponents have mobilized as well and recently issued a new survey of county residents that they say bolsters their case. \But three years after a special Blue Ribbon Advisory Council proclaimed that it had achieved a consensus on how the proposed ""21st century urban highway"" should look, Lake County communities appear to be engaged in a civil war over the issue. \The advisory council called for not only extending Route 53 north through Lake County, as originally intended, but creating a broader corridor also encompassing Route 120, which runs east-west across the county. \The plan envisions extending existing Route 53 for 12.5 miles north from Lake-Cook Road to Grayslake. There, it would form a ""T"" with a 12-mile stretch of Route 120, which would also be upgraded. \The new Route 5 3/120 corridor would be unlike the rest of the tollway system, a ""parkway"" limited to four lanes and a 45-mph speed limit. Advocates describe it as ""a modern boulevard with a small footprint to protect the natural environment and preserve the character of Lake County."" \If the extension is built, it could be the most expensive tollway to drive in the Chicago area, with a base toll of 20 cents per mile. Tollway users currently pay an average of 6 cents per mile. \Working with the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, a county-led Land Use Committee recently completed a draft document for the corridor. \A comprehensive plan created by CMAP, the official planning agency for the Chicago area, lists the Route 5 3/120 corridor project as its highest priority, citing performance measures that show it as ""ranking highest among all projects in its effect on regionwide congestion."" \The Land Use Committee is scheduled to meet Nov. 5 and may sign off on the 170-page draft plan. The document is heavy on statistics and maps, but as of this week, still lacks an executive summary containing specific recommendations. \The draft does conclude that the Route 5 3/120 corridor ""will be a catalyst for economic development"" in Lake County. \In June, leaders in Hawthorn Woods, Kildeer, Long Grove, Mundelein and Round Lake, which contend they will be the most directly affected by the highway, wrote to the Tollway expressing concern with the project's planning process. \Hawthorn Woods contends that the advisory council's report is flawed. The panel ""did not include a single community in the path of the proposed Route 53 as members,"" the village wrote in a comment on the land use plan. \""Residents in this part of the county located their homes here to avoid maximum build-out of land, high density development and commercialization of farms with industrial centers, shopping centers and multistory employment centers,"" the letter stated. \Their letter was quickly followed by one in support of the project by leaders in 40 other municipalities. Those officials asked Tollway Chairman Bob Schillerstrom and three new board members -- all appointed by Gov. Bruce Rauner -- for their ""continued support with the next engineering and environmental studies required to keep this project moving forward."" \Tollway officials say they anticipate the authority's board will make a decision on whether to authorize an environmental impact study at the agency's Dec. 17 meeting. \That's the day that the Tollway is scheduled to approve the agency's 2016 budget, which includes $5.8 million for planning studies for ""emerging projects."" \Tollway Executive Director Greg Bedalov, addressing the Transportation Management Association of Lake-Cook last week, said the agency will be ""looking more critically"" at the project. \Lake County Chairman Aaron Lawlor, who has championed the project and co-chaired the land-use panel, told the association that the project has a ""tremendous amount of support"" throughout the county. \One alternative that some have suggested, widening some 56 miles of existing arterial highways, would cost an estimated $2.8 billion, more than the proposed Route 5 3/120 project, Lawlor said. \Furthermore, there is no source of funds for this work, unlike the ""more certain future"" that is offered by the Tollway, Lawlor said. \An analysis by the development group Lake County Partners determined that the Route 5 3/120 corridor project would generate $17 billion to $19 billion in economic impact and create 25,000 to 30,000 jobs, Lawlor said. \""When you look at all the alternatives,"" Lawlor said, ""the project is less costly, it has more environmental benefits and it leverages the collective will of our mayors, economic development professionals and environmental leaders to work together in a collaborative manner for smart growth."" \----------\rwronski@tribpub.com \Twitter @richwronski"
200,"The cost of owning and operating a vehicle in Illinois would increase dramatically under a proposal in the state Senate aimed at paying for repairs to crumbling roads and bridges. \The legislation, introduced this week by Democratic Sen. Martin Sandoval of Chicago, would more than double the state's gas tax to 44 cents a gallon, double the driver's license fee to $60 and raise the vehicle registration fee to $148. The driver's license fee is now $30; the vehicle registration fee is $98.\It also would significantly hike the registration fee for electric vehicles, from $17.50 to $1,000. Greater fuel efficiency and an increasing number of electric vehicles on the road has cut into the revenue available to the state to fix transportation infrastructure.\In addition, in an effort to provide a stable source of transportation funding, the gas tax and registration fees could continue to creep up every year under a formula tied to the rate of inflation.\Sandoval said his plan would raise an estimated $2.4 billion in annual transportation funding for Illinois. Illinois' gas tax has been 19 cents per gallon since 1990, and the state's last large-scale infrastructure improvement program was approved a decade ago.\A variety of ideas to fund repairs to the state's aging infrastructure have been proposed over the years, from previous attempts to raise the gas tax to proposals to tax vehicles based on the number of miles driven. But none has gained traction in Springfield. Since 2013, 30 other states, including neighboring Indiana, have enacted legislation to increase gas taxes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\""We have fallen behind. Our continued investment in our Illinois infrastructure is key in creating jobs, promoting full economic recovery,"" Sandoval said Wednesday at a statehouse news conference. ""Investment will boost productivity, support business growth, create jobs, provide a healthier environment and improve opportunity for Illinoisans. It is about time. Doing nothing is not a solution.""\Sandoval's bill also includes provisions aimed at increasing the number of minority, female and veteran apprentices working on public infrastructure projects. It does not address the buildings component of a capital bill.\Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker has expressed support for a program to upgrade the state's roads, bridges and public buildings, but he hasn't said how much the state should spend or endorsed a specific source of revenue.\""Passing a capital bill is a top priority for the governor this legislative session,"" spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said in an email. ""Bipartisan working groups are discussing various components of a capital plan, including both projects and potential revenue sources, and the administration is working with federal partners and engaging local stakeholders on the needs for their communities as the process moves forward. We look forward to introducing a bill soon.""\Abudayyeh did not comment directly on Sandoval's proposal.\A Senate panel has been holding hearings around the state this spring to gather wish lists of transportation and building projects that local officials would like to see included in a capital bill, but a list of projects that would be funded in a capital bill has yet to materialize.\It's unclear how much appetite there will be in the General Assembly for a gas tax increase. In Pritzker's spending plan for the budget year that begins July 1, he's asking lawmakers to legalize and tax sports betting and recreational marijuana, and to increase or enact taxes on cigarettes, e-cigarettes and plastic shopping bags, among other items. On top of that, the rookie governor wants the House to follow the Senate's lead in approving a proposed amendment to the Illinois Constitution that would allow for a graduated-rate income tax and to pass a bill setting the rates that would take effect if voters approve the amendment on the November 2020 ballot.\But unlike Pritzker's tax proposals, the idea of increasing the gas tax has some Republican support, thanks in large part to a recent amendment to the state constitution that requires transportation-related revenue to be spent only on transportation-related projects.\""The time is now to make the needed changes to adequately fund our transportation and infrastructure systems,"" said Republican Sen. Don DeWitte of St. Charles, who attended the news conference where Sandoval's proposal was announced. ""The funding increases currently being debated in this legislature will provide a steady stream of funding for years to come. ... Most important for taxpayers, they are guaranteed to go where promised.""\The Illinois Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that Sandoval's measure needs more work, but the group already has made clear it supports a gas tax increase -- if coupled with a repeal on the state's 6.25 percent sales tax on gas at the pump.\""More work is needed to achieve consensus on the final transportation package,"" chamber President and CEO Todd Maisch said.\----------\dpetrella@chicagotribune.com\Twitter @PetrellaReports\CREDIT: By Dan Petrella, Chicago Tribune; Chicago Tribune reporter Jamie Munks contributed."
201,"Note: rimmed\Face it: Global\warming just myth\In a letter to the Herald on Feb. 23, Tracy Wax of Environment Illinois claims that ""clean energy will recharge the economy"" while providing ""100 percent clean energy"" and ""bring America one important step closer to solving global warming."" Unfortunately she is wrong on all counts.\As for ""100 percent clean energy"" that is a pipe dream unless by ""clean"" she means nuclear. If she is talking about wind then I refer her to two European studies that put the ""100 percent clean energy"" lie to rest. In Germany, a study by the grid operator E.ON Netz titled ""Wind Power 2005"" stated that when Germanys wind power goal of 25 percent is reached, 96 percent of that 25 percent would have to be backed up by conventional power, namely gas and coal. So according to E.ON Netz you dont get 100 percent clean power, you get 4 percent clean power with wind. This has been further confirmed by Germanys plan to build 26 more coal-fired plants despite the countrys huge buildup of wind power.\In Great Britain, the Royal Academy of Engineers did a similar study and came up with ""at least 90 percent"" conventional backup. Both reports highlight the highly unpredictable and unreliable nature of wind power. Wind speeds less than 10 mph produce zero electricity and wind speeds less than 25 mph very little, and therefore grids must have gas/coal online at all times to provide consistent real-time backup power for the grid.\As for combating global warming one might ask ""What global warming?"" According to satellite measurements temperatures in 2008 were colder than 1980 and 1981. So despite hundreds of millions more cars on the road and thousands of more coal power plants being used than in 1980, the temperature is colder. Last winter China recorded its coldest winter in at least 50 years. Here in Chicago, this winter is 5 degrees below normal and the 10th coldest in 128 years. Ironically on Oct. 28 Great Britains Parliament passed a law mandating reduced CO2 to combat global warming during the first snowstorm to hit London since 1934.\Finally, in December the U.S. Senate Environment Committee issued a 233-page report by 650 international scientists disputing the CO2 warming hypothesis. The argument that placing plant food (CO2) into the atmosphere causes dangerous global warming is scientifically unsupportable and the world will be better off when we admit it.\Bill Zettler\Mundelein\More taxes? Like\kid in a candy store\On Feb. 24 or Fat Tuesday, if you will the Daily Herald had a ""need for more taxes"" story printed on virtually every page by virtually every branch of government. Page 1 is ""GOP open to gas tax hike?"" Sure, go ahead politicians, raise the tax on gas to the point we cannot get to work by car anymore because the wages we are supposed to be getting have not increased to stay up with your wages and taxes. You seem to need all of this tax money from those who cannot afford to give it to you in order to make us more self-sufficient and thus come out of this greed-caused recession.\It seems to me that to give you a total of $25 billion to use and spend on programs you control is kind of like asking a very young person to manage a candy store. The wages you pay out might be good but the outcome would be a money-losing situation in the long run. Hellooooo, we have done that before.\You ask us to conserve and we do and then you raise taxes because we do not spend enough. Well which one are we supposed to do? Spend more or conserve more? You cannot have it both ways and right now spending more is out of the question because we are not working because of unemployment and job availability. Your fault again, you sent them overseas for cheaper wages and products so now our people cannot get jobs to pay for your taxes. Gee how does that work again?\Thomas Jefferson said in 1802 that ""I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.""\He also said ""The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.""\I would say Thomas Jefferson knew in 1802 what you would do to us if given the chance and you have proven him correct AGAIN.\Rodney Erb\Ingleside\Let feds build bridge to recovery\Not to pick on Mr. Stossel. He is one of the more amusing people on ABC News. But, like many, he is carrying his ideology too far. Like many conservative economists, he asserts that World War II was the only thing that helped the economy in Roosevelts term. This strongly implies, if not outright insists, that the way out of the current recession is to go to war. Except, arent we already in one? He also claims that no government spending ever creates wealth. But if it repairs worn-out roads and bridges, arent we better off? Even weatherizing homes and schools, saving energy, will later allow precious capital to be used for other things.\There is also the specious argument that the government is taking capital away from the private sector, which is itching to build new plants, malls, buildings, or other projects. If only it were. And if the private sector were busy with new investment, it might be complaining about a shortage of workers. Havent heard that one lately. Yes, when the economy recovers and private business is keeping everyone busy, we can cut back on the public infrastructure work. But for now, it is a rare opportunity to get some public investment (yes, some of it IS necessary) done.\Peter VandeMotter\Mundelein\Build trust by\doing due diligence\Lake Zurich Village President Tolomei and Trustees Callahan, McAvoy and Taylor seem to have great confidence in Mr. David Smith and his Equity Services Groups pending downtown redevelopment agreement.\I want that same confidence but am perplexed by the boards actions on Feb. 17.\At that meeting Trustee Suzanne Branding asked the village to do what any reputable business would do before they sign a contract with a potential business associate: Count the cost and know who you are dealing with. Tolomei, Callahan, McAvoy and Taylor voted ""no"" to Trustee Brandings requests to 1. Perform due diligence toward Smith and ESG, as well as clarify Mr. Smiths qualifications, references and past performance; 2. Update financial projections for the downtown redevelopment project focusing on the likelihood of achieving much-needed future revenues; and 3. Require regulatory studies such as environmental impact statements and infrastructure studies before proceeding with the project to avoid costly and time-wasteful mistakes. In my estimation, Brandings request is for the safety and benefit of the village. If Mr. Smiths credentials are solid and the financial projections for the project are realistic and verifiable, then they will stand up to any scrutiny.\Its essential to have the best understanding possible of the proposal, its impacts on our community and a trust in the developer himself.\Judi Thode\Lake Zurich"
202," Congratulations to the Tribune for stating the inconvenient truth about the need for gasoline taxes. Your proposal, however, to rely exclusively on a gas tax at the pump may be less effective than you hope because it does not target an important source of the problem. Affluent people who buy monster SUVs to drive in our immaculately paved suburbs are unlikely to switch to less-fashionable, fuel- efficient vehicles because of gas-price increases in the magnitudes you suggest. It seems to me we also need to introduce new taxes on vehicles by weight and fuel consumption--taxes that would be applied at the point of purchase and through annual registration fees.\ People should have every right to drive gas-guzzling behemoths if that is what makes them happy. It is both fair and prudent, however, that they compensate society for the harm they do to our energy independence, as well as the additional harm they cause to roadways, the environment and traffic safety.\ It might also induce them to switch to fuel-efficient and (God forbid!) hybrid vehicles, creating a new fashion trend that would benefit all of us."
203,"State Rep. Verna Clayton's 51st house district seat is being sought by four candidates who will square off in the March 17 GOP primary.\The four are Ray Ivancic, 45, Sidney Mathias, 53, Mark Riefenberg, 35, and Mike Salvi, 39. Following is a continuation of the candidates' written responses to questions posed by the Daily Herald:\Q: What changes, if any, do you favor in the state's abortion laws? Explain.\Ivancic: (Verbal answer) I happened to be raised as a good little Catholic boy. The concept of abortion is revolting. It upsets me. While I oppose it personally, I happen to live in a world in America that's called a melting pot and we have different cultures and different needs for abortion. So publicly, yes I have to accept that choice. But while personally I cannot accept it, I will allow the choice issue to go forward and not restrict it.\I can't accept the partial birth abortion, that's a horrible thing, unless of course it threatens the mother's life. I agree with the concept of abortion in the event of rape, incest and other disgusting crimes that women sometimes are victims of. I agree with a women's right to that. But I know that in our current welfare system, we pay for abortions on demand... I think a limit should be put on the number of abortions the public is going to pay for (per person) with my tax dollars.\Mathias: I support Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.\Riefenberg: I truly believe that any decision on social issues, such as abortion, should be left up to the State Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution. Although what I said will not deter furthering questioning of Pro- Life or Pro-Choice issues, I believe to continue down this path will lead to more division within this country.\I don't believe there should be any change to the post-viability ban that is currently the law of this state as defined in the Illinois Public Aid Code. There is a current legislative declaration that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, Illinois would prohibit abortion. I do not agree with this declaration nor would I support legislation to uphold this ban. I do agree that taxpayer money be excluded for abortion coverage in state health care programs. Also, I would support the banning of partial-birth abortions which normally occur during the third trimester of pregnancy.\Salvi: I am the only pro-life candidate running for State Representative in the 51st District. But, I believe abortions should be permitted in circumstances including situations of rape, incest and when the mother is subject to serious health problems created by pregnancy. I agree with Governor Edgar in his opposition to partial birth abortions. I believe Illinois law should be changed to limit when, and under what circumstance, a teenager, may have an abortion without her parent's consent. Of course, if a child is the victim of incest, the law should allow her an abortion and accommodate her without parental consent.\Q: How would you characterize the successes and problems, to date, of the state's welfare reform efforts? What adjustments, if any, might be needed?\Ivancic: Outwardly the program seems to have moved many people from welfare to work and not left ""thousands"" sleeping in alleys. But the core issue is the quality of work available to the entry level worker, the benefits, access and stability of jobs. I want Illinois to have the strongest job/labor market in the country. The only way to do that is by having strong employers. Creating a pro-business environment will create better jobs.\Mathias: I believe welfare reform initiatives have been very successful so far. Literally thousands of people have moved from AFDC and into the workforce. We need to monitor the success of this legislation and help it continue but be prepared to make changes should economic changes require it.\Riefenberg: The Illinois General Assembly did pass Public Act 90- 74 (Welfare Reform Research & Accountability) in July of 1997. That legislation has instructed the State Human Resources Agency to study various parts of welfare administered in this state and report interim findings of the study to the governor beginning March 1, 1999. These interim finding reports will continue through Dec. 31, 2004, with a final report due March 1, 2005. These studies are to analysis traits of welfare recipients for the next 60 months. I believe this is far too long of time, and should instead be conducted over an 18- to 24-month period. Although the Interim Assistance Program was abolished on Sept. 1, 1995, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) will become inoperative as of Dec. 31, 1998, they will only be consolidated under the State's Transitional Assistance Benefits Program. The legislature must do more to improve our state's ability to effectively administer programs for needy families by expecting accountability and performance of the agencies staff.\Salvi: As a whole it has been a success. And, I don't believe I would support tinkering with the success at this time. Let's continue to see how fair the system is operating, keeping in mind that we want to provide adequate assistance to those who need it and encourage those merely dependent on it to obtain meaningful skills and work.\Q: The Department of Transportation says it cannot keep its current pace of highway maintenance without an increase in the gas tax. Do you support a gas-tax increase? If not, what ideas do you have concerning better maintenance of the state's highways?\Ivancic: Over the holidays I traveled to Ohio, where the gasoline prices were 25 cents a gallon less than in Illinois. In Indiana the price of a gallon a gas was generally 20 cents less. What's wrong? Step back and look at the whole tax picture, are we not collecting enough or are we spending what we collect unwisely? Do other states supplement road maintenance another way?\Mathias: I support a moderate increase in the gas tax. Without action now, roads everywhere will continue to deteriorate, making it a more expensive problem to fix later on. I view the gas tax as a user fee. Those who use our public highways have always paid to keep them in good condition. It's far better to pay a nickel more in gas taxes now to fix roads than to pay for our cars to be aligned every couple of months because of continued road deterioration.\Riefenberg: While the major roads in our state are the second worst in the country, I would not support legislation to increase the current gas tax. Right now the state spends $175,000 a mile for repairs, compared to the national average of more than $210,000. Although the state spends $35,000 less per mile for maintenance, I still believe that we should have better maintained roads. As a legislator, I would like to investigate IDOT's handling of taxpayers' money to make sure that the people of my district and the state are getting their money's worth. Also, we may have to talk to other states to find out how they can successfully maintain their roads and bridges when our state cannot. It would be premature to propose a solution to the problem until all the facts are known. If it is determined that additional funding is needed, and that IDOT has been cost effective in their work, then we may consider a small increase in license-plate fees.\Salvi: I would support a gas-tax increase if it was directed specifically to improving existing roads. I would especially like to see Route 22 improved and widened. Also, I would like to see the Route 22 by-pass implemented in Lake Zurich."
204," I note with some surprise that our governor has, while claiming legislators are spending like ""drunken sailors,"" decided to favor our community with substantial funds for a variety of projects.\ This is done while the state is running a deficit and cannot meet its obligations to the primary and secondary schools, the amounts owed to pharmacies and nursing homes and others entitled to be paid by the state. The failure to meet one's current obligations is the definition of bankruptcy.\ I realize that he comes from the Mickey Mouse Club generation where you just put on your hat and sing to be happy and that he has the wonderful Alfred P. Neuman smile -- Who? Me worry? But I have always understood that for the state to spend, the Legislature must first budget and then appropriate by formal act before anyone can write a check.\ The governor may be the conduit, but the Legislature disburses the proceeds from the income tax, gas tax, fees, inheritance tax, etc. I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, but to pretend that we are recipients of a governor's largesse seems to be contrary to the way life is. How does he decide what is ""given"" to any community without the action of the Legislature?\ I also realize that our governor comes from the environment and area where one is raised to believe government is there for the benefit of those in power. As Mike Royko used to say the motto of the officeholders there is ""Urbie est meo"" -- I may not have spelled the Latin correctly but Royko's translation of it was ""Where's mine?"": Thus it may come as some surprise to Mickey that the Central Illinois residents feel that first you pay the bills and then if there is anything left over you might consider some upkeep of the premises.\ One wonders if the gift horse didn't come out of our own barn. I don't care much who has the lead on the halter but let us not pretend that the groom has much to do with the ""gift."" Bill BrandtNormal"
205," Lake County canceled a contract Tuesday with a research firm it hired to survey residents about transportation needs after complaints arose of a potential conflict of interest with the firm.\ The county had hired Richard Day Research of Evanston to compose and conduct a survey to gauge opinions on whether or how residents are willing to pay for new roads.\ Richard Day, however, is on the board of directors of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a staunch opponent of the controversial Route 53 extension and a group interested in preserving the environment.\ Lake County Board member Bonnie Thomson Carter of Ingleside said the board did not question Day's integrity but feared the survey data would be criticized.\ ""We were afraid people might not validate the results"" because of the environmental center's strong views against Route 53, Carter said.\ State Rep.

207," This is one of a series of questionnaires that the Daily Herald will publish for all contested races in the Tri-Cities area in advance of the March 21 primary election.\ There are two Republican candidates in the March 21 primary for Kane County Board District 5.\ The incumbent is Bill Wyatt of Aurora, who has served on the board since 1997. The challenger is Rey Cruz of Aurora.\ The winner will face Aurora Democrat John W. Anderson in the Nov. 7 general election.\ District 5 encompasses northwest Aurora and part of Sugar Grove Township, including the Prestbury community.\ Below are some of the questions sent to the candidates and their answers:\ Q. Why are you running for this office? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what? What will be your main priority?\ Cruz: The catalyst that convinced me to run for Kane County Board was how the Orchard Road project in Aurora was grossly mismanaged fiscally by the incumbent. Keeping taxes low at the county level and being fiscally responsible with taxpayer's dollars is very important to me as a Republican candidate.\ This is a very difficult question to answer since I will only be one of 26 Kane County Board members and to assume that I alone can set priorities would be presumptuous. The main priorities for my term, when elected, will be to use my certified financial planner training and financial expertise, which I have used on many boards already, and take that experience with those boards to the Kane County Board level. I want to represent the taxpayers of my district.\ Wyatt: I am excited about the direction we, as a county, are heading. Yes, we face many challenges as we continue to grow. Foremost are the development of vital infastructure (especially roads, sewers), water quality and quantity issues, and delivery of programs and services to a growing and de-centralized population. I want to ensure that the county works with municipalities, state and federal officials to provide the infrastructure, manage our natural resources and continue to update and improve the delivery of county services to our citizens. Our 2030 plan provides that template.\ Q. In light of documented problems in the county clerk's office with regard to tax extensions, is there anything the county board could or should do to ensure those problems are corrected?\ Cruz: As I have owned my own financial and investment business for 21 years, one of the things that I have learned is that you have to have systems in place to get anything done. Anytime you are dealing with money, people, and procedures, you have to systematize the events or problems that need to be taken care of. More important than the systems themselves, it is important to have checklists and that they be followed and signed. You must also cross-train the backup individuals who will be responsible for the projects, and to make sure that the backup staff uses those checklists so problems do not occur. If I were a county board member, I would look into the systems and checklists currently being used at the clerk's office regarding tax extensions, and make appropriate recommendations.\ Wyatt: Problems like the tax extension will occur as we grow. The important factor is recognizing the problem, analyzing the cause and taking steps to find solutions. As an elected official, the clerk is in charge of determining the cause and suggesting solutions. My job is to work with the clerk to provide funding for the best solution.\ Q. Some are concerned that the county could soon run out of water. Should the county be concerned? If so, what steps might the county take to address the issue?\ Cruz: Of course, the county should be concerned if they could run out of water. If this is a legitimate problem and concern, before it happens we need to start to look for alternative solutions now to solve this problem. Questions like, what other source of water can we tap into, like Lake Michigan, and costs should be reviewed.\ Wyatt: This is a huge concern for me. One of the best decisions we made as a board several years back was to commission the water survey, which is now nearing completion. Their finding will, I believe, show that future demands on water will exceed supply.\ We need to work with all Kane municipalities to educate water consumers about the best conservation practices, and then enact ordinances to regulate such usage as lawn watering, which wastes more water every year than any other action. The key is to get ""buy- in"" from the municipalities, because this is where most of the growth in our county is occurring.\ Q. Are you satisfied with construction and funding plans for the new Kane County Jail? Why or why not? What concerns, if any, do you have about the project over the long term and how should they be addressed?\ Cruz: I am happy that the taxpayers taxes will not be raised to pay for the new Kane County jail, and that it is being paid by bonds. I am concerned about the financial costs, overruns, and change orders on this project. Even though I am aware that there is a ""top price"" guaranty on this jail, my experience with the Fox Valley Park District, its expansion of two facilities and its new $30 million dollar building on Indian Trail, tells me that somebody better be watching the numbers. That guaranty was based on specific criteria. If that criteria changes, there goes the guaranty.\ Wyatt: I am satisfied that we are building a much safer and modern facility than we presently have. The final figure for the jail will probably be around $60 million, which is a lot of money. One thing I know for sure is that waiting to build will only result in higher costs to the taxpayer. After speaking with many of our corrections officers, who function daily in that dangerous environment, I became convinced that a ""Band-Aid build on to existing"" approach would not do much to eliminate the inherent safety problems for our men and women who work there. Above all else, we must provide safety to our employees and detainees at the jail. This new facility will accomplish that.\ Q. A referendum question that didn't make it onto the ballot this election was a tax to subsidize senior services. Is this is a county responsibility or does it more properly rest with township, state or federal governments that already provide such services? Would you support a future effort to put this measure on the ballot?\ Cruz: I am against any new taxes as a future representative on the Kane County Board. Until the State of Illinois corrects the dependence on our real estate taxes for education, which is the largest part of the real estate tax, we need to keep the county taxes as low as possible to encourage young families to stay and to move to Kane County. There are many senior service programs available through the federal, state, and township governments, and we do not need to provide redundant services and ""reinvent the wheel.""\ Wyatt: We are working with state legislators to allow wording that would make the referendum question singular, and more understandable. The current wording is confusing and leaves open the possibility that the concept will pass, but not the taxing authority. In an already lean budget, some existing programs and services would have to be cut or eliminated altogether. I am not willing to take that risk. We will work to get the changes needed and place this on the November ballot. I truly believe in the mission and purpose of the initiative. Let's figure out the best way to deliver the question to the voters.\ Q. One of the biggest problems the county faces is the provision of transportation services in the face of fast growth. Would you support an increase in the gas tax to help fund needed road projects? Why or why not? What projects should have priority funding? Please include your views on the Stearns and Bolz Road bridge projects in your answer.\ Cruz: I do not support a gas tax to fund needed road projects. The reason this issue is now coming up is because the people responsible for the transportation budget blew it on the Orchard Road project. They did not go after matching federal funds like they should have, and change the stages of the project. If better decisions would have been made and politics kept out of the road projects, we would not be facing this situation currently.\ Wyatt: As former transportation chair, I have given the gas tax plenty of thought, and listened to both sides of the argument.\ Under my chairmanship, we crafted and passed the impact fee program, which has brought in over $8 million in the past two years. I favored that approach over gas tax because it required new development to pay a fair share to provide for the impact of their growth. Even so, that only accounts for 8 percent of the total needs we have to meet growth.\ I am against raising the gas tax because of the hardships it will create in my city (and others) on the independent gas station owners. The nature of pricing will favor the big suppliers and leave the small suppliers to eat the increase themselves. This will be a death tax to small business owners and result in a far less competitive atmosphere for consumers. I support any and all bridges in Kane county and will push for funding from any available source."
208,"Senate OKs eliminating gas sales tax\Illinois would eliminate its 5 percent sales tax on gasoline under a Senate bill overwhelmingly sent to the House Thursday. But Gov. Jim Edgar promised to veto any budget-buster like this one, which his administration says would cost the state $235 million annually. However, petroleum marketers say the resulting increase in sales would more than offset the tax cut, because the state would keep collecting its 19-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax. Local governments also would keep their 1.25 percent gas tax. Senate President James ""Pate"" Philip of Wood Dale argued Illinois' booming economy means the state can afford the cut, and thus lower one of the Midwest's highest taxes. The Senate tax-break proposal joins a flurry of other giveaways to be considered by Edgar and legislative leaders next month.\Cook Co. to keep judicial privilege\Voters in the county with the most residents will continue to elect three Illinois Supreme Court justices at-large, while the rest of the state chooses one, after Senate Democrats defeated a proposed constitutional amendment along party lines. Republicans wanted to subdivide Cook County, which Democrats said really was aimed at electing a Republican justice and tipping the balance of the seven- member high court. A similar GOP effort last year was overturned by the court itself.\Heiple amendment gets political support\Voters could be asked to decide in the November election to change the Illinois Constitution because of last year's allegations against Illinois Supreme Court Justice James Heiple. The Senate unanimously sent the House an amendment that would add two public members to the five-member Illinois Courts Commission, which was accused of going easy in censuring Heiple following complaints he used his clout to get out of traffic tickets.\Environment bills are killed -- again\Environmental groups are blaming Commonwealth Edison and other utilities for killing proposed additions to last year's utility deregulation bill. ""No"" votes included Republicans Mary Lou Cowlishaw of Naperville, Brent Hassert of Lemont and Vince Persico of Glen Ellyn.\Senator surfaces in statehouse\For five years, U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun may have been busy in Washington, D.C., but she was virtually invisible in Springfield. Now that she's seeking re-election in seven months, political and government reporters are getting at least a fax a day touting her achievements. The latest, however, hailed Senate confirmation of two downstate federal judges who had been blocked by a dispute between Moseley-Braun and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm. Ending that dispute took the intervention of GOP governor nominee George Ryan at the request of U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin.\Compiled by Don Thompson of our Springfield bureau."
209," Lake County canceled a contract Tuesday with a research firm it hired to survey residents about transportation needs after complaints arose of a potential conflict of interest with the firm.\ The county had hired Richard Day Research of Evanston to compose and conduct a survey to gauge opinions on whether or how residents are willing to pay for new roads.\ Richard Day, however, is on the board of directors of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a staunch opponent of the controversial Route 53 extension and a group interested in preserving the environment.\ Lake County Board member Bonnie Thomson Carter of Ingleside said the board did not question Day's integrity but feared the survey data would be criticized.\ ""We were afraid people might not validate the results"" because of the environmental center's strong views against Route 53, Carter said.\ State Rep. Sid Mathias, who complained of Day's involvement, said he would have questioned the survey's findings.\ ""How questions are asked do influence the outcome,"" said Mathias, a Buffalo Grove Republican. ""If your position is you're supporting county improvements over the extension of 53 ... I believe there would be a built-in bias.""\ Richard Day could not be reached for comment.\ The telephone survey, now on hold, is supposed to gauge public opinion on congestion, roadway improvements and whether county residents would be willing to increase the county's sales tax or gas tax to help pay for more county roads. The board planned to use the findings to determine whether it should seek state legislation or go to referendum to help pay for more roads.\ The county used Day research in the past to conduct surveys for the forest preserve district. Lake County Board Chairman Jim LaBelle said the county hired the firm based on its previous relationship and did not know of Day's involvement in the environmental law center.\ ""They're a professional research firm; they're fully capable,"" said LaBelle, of Zion. ""There was an issue raised. We thought it was best to drop it and move ahead. We were hoping the poll would resolve some questions, not raise more questions.""\ Day will be paid for the time the company has put in so far. Both LaBelle and Thomson said they were not sure how much money has been spent but said the total survey will cost less than $25,000.\ The county will use whatever data Day research has so far and hire a new firm to conduct the survey."

Since we've been talking about employee relations in this space as of late, it's worth noting that state Rep. James Stange (R-Oak Brook), the self-proclaimed taxpayers' pal, has had a number of family members on the state payroll.
\
Indeed, at one point or another, Stange's wife and three daughters all have held taxpayer-supported jobs.
\
Here are the details, according to the state comptroller's office:
\
His wife, Carol, has been working for the Illinois Youth Center in Warrenville since last May, and currently pulls down $21,120 a year. Previously, she worked for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs in the information center at Midway Airport.
\
Daughter Heather, still a high school student, works part-time for the Illinois State Tollway, at an hourly rate of $6.
\
Daughters Kimberly and Marcy were both employed by the state while in college, Stange says. Kimberly was with the state tollway from June 1, 1987, to July 10, 1988, and Marcy was with the Department of Revenue from June 15, 1987, to Sept. 15, 1989.
\
Stange, who's up for re-election in November, has been laboring mightily to get rid of Du Page County's 4-cent-per-gallon gas tax, a proposal that received a major setback in the House on Tuesday. He claims voters sent a message to Republicans in the primary that they want their representatives to ""hold down taxes as much as possible and repeal this kind of tax.""
\
But as much as Stange apparently loathes burdening the taxpayers, he doesn't seem to have a problem with politicians loading down the state payroll with their nearest and dearest.
\
""As long as the person is doing the job and is qualified, I have absolutely no problem with it,"" he says.
\
""You should see the job my wife is doing with the kids in Warrenville. It's unbelievable.""
\
He goes on: ""They have the right to work like anyone else as long as they're qualified. My biggest beef is with ghost payrollers-the people who don't work and still draw a paycheck every month."" Hair care It all started with a little harmless teasing. And then matters became cuttingly serious.
\
A group of air traffic controllers as O'Hare International Airport's Chicago Center in Aurora were giving controller Michael Hannigan some harmless abuse last month about his unconventional hair style.
\
Hannigan, who says he works in ""a pretty conservative environment,"" had worn it bushy and long for the past several years, almost halfway down his back.
\
""Get it cut,"" his cohorts said.
\
""Pay me,"" Hannigan retorted.
\
One challenge led to another, until Hannigan found himself telling fellow controller Carl DeBroux, a Fox Valley Hospice Board member, that he would get a crew cut if DeBroux raised $500 among employees to benefit the hospice.
\
DeBroux and the rest of the employees upped the ante. They told Hannigan they'd raise $750 if he'd shave his head. Hannigan agreed, but those crazy controllers couldn't help egging him on. Would he wear a mohawk for 21 days, they asked, if they raised $1,000 for the hospice?
\
The controllers collected a total of $1,237. Then they took Hannigan to the North Pole Barber Shop in North Aurora, where barber Wayne Lee ""did the dirty deed,"" as DeBroux puts it, free of charge.
\
Hannigan says that life with a mohawk has been ""really cold. I've got no hair on the side of my head.""
\
He also concedes he's gotten a sort of perverse enjoyment from the stares of folks in shopping malls.
\
""If I had known I could get that much money in a day,"" he says, ""I would have increased the amount.""
\
But the hospice, located in Batavia, couldn't be happier with the money it received.
\
""When you work with people who are dying, it gets kind of heavy sometimes,"" says hospice executive director Vivian Nimmo. ""It's nice that people can use their creativity and ingenuity to give you a giggle."" Pomp and circumstance Congratulations to Anthony Peccarelli, chief judge of Du Page County, who's apparently been hitting the books during his off-hours.
\
Peccarelli recently graduated from the nation's first and only advanced academic degree program for trial judges-the master of judicial studies degree program offered by the University of Nevada, Reno.
\
His master's thesis, entitled ""A Moral Dilemma: The Role of Judicial Intervention in Withholding or Withdrawing Nutrition and Hydration,"" is to be published in the John Marshall Law Review.

212,"State Rep. Cal Skinner Jr. of Crystal Lake is being challenged by Rosemary Kurtz of Crystal Lake for the Republican nomination for 63rd Legislative District in the March 17 primary.\The Daily Herald asked the candidates questions on various issues. Here are their answers to some of those questions.\Q. School funding aside, what do you think of the idea of decreasing property taxes while increasing some other kind of tax?\A. Skinner: Since 1978, I have indicated that I am willing to entertain the proposal of shifting local residential school property tax burden to a local income tax on individuals, providing such a proposal were approved by voters in a local referendum. So far, not one school board has passed a resolution favoring such a proposal. Of course, the only ""fair tax"" is one someone else pays.\A. Kurtz: State government is already too big. The current tax money is not being spent wisely nor distributed fairly to districts like 64 and 63. I am not in favor of increasing another kind of state tax. I am a proponent of property tax reduction. Dependent on this reduction is a fair distribution of state money to schools in the fastest-growing county in Illinois.\Q. What changes, if any, do you favor in the state's gambling landscape? Please describe briefly your views on additional riverboats, land-based casinos and slots for racetracks.\A. Skinner: I favor no expansion of gambling in Illinois. Contraction would be a better direction. I do not believe gambling entities should be allowed to make political contributions.\A. Kurtz: There are enough riverboat gambling opportunities in Illinois now. The ""free market"" will back me up on this. Last year only one riverboat casino made a profit. As for racetracks and slots, it may be unfair that the tracks, which have been in Illinois for years and have been a part of a town's economy, are not allowed to compete in the new gambling environment where the newest competitors have been given state license for slots.\Q. What changes, if any, do you favor in the state's abortion laws?\A. Skinner: That there is a debate over the partial-birth abortion ban should convince any neutral person that the U.S. Supreme Court decisions Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton (handed down the same day, but largely ignored by the media) are much too radical. Now, a baby can be aborted up to and including the day of birth under Doe v. Bolton.\When you had your children, did you call it a fetus after you knew you or your wife were pregnant? Of course not! It's a baby. Society and state law should do everything they can to limit the number of abortions. Instead, Illinois has an ""almost anything goes"" set of abortion laws.\As a father who is in the process of adopting a 5-month-old son, in view of the demand Dr. Seed thinks infertile couples will make on his cloning clinic, and, considering the ready availability of birth control devices and drugs, I find it hard to believe the demand of abortion advocates to maintain the current ""almost anything goes"" state of Illinois law.\A. Kurtz: My lifelong Republican philosophy is ""the less government, the better."" I do not favor legislative tampering with a woman's right to consult with her doctor and minister or priest or rabbi in cases of pregnancy. As long as the state's laws are constitutional, my efforts will be focused on the unequal fiscal treatment my district receives from the state.\Q. The Illinois Department of Transportation says it cannot keep its current pace of highway maintenance without an increase in the gas tax. Do you support a gas tax increase? If not, what ideas do you have concerning better maintenance of the state's highways?\A. Skinner: The Federal government collects 4.3 cents per gallon of gas used, but does not use it to build highways. That is where Illinois should look first for new highway money. If that does not work, I am willing to consider raising revenue here. The elimination of the biggest bottleneck in my district would have to be part of the package, however.\A. Kurtz: If the Assembly raises the gas tax and license fee for road maintenance this year, McHenry County and Barrington Township will be subsidizing the rest of the state. It is unjust to keep forcing our district to pay for road repairs throughout the state. For example, we were in the budget to the tune of $8 million for one intersection. When funds became limited, the recipient areas were prioritized, and District 64 is now at the bottom of the list.\If there is a bill to increase the gas tax, I would only vote for it if the money went directly to District 64. If legislature raises the license fee, I can accept that additional money going for road improvements in the rest of the state."
213,"State Rep. Rosemary E. Mulligan is facing a challenge for her seat in the March 17 Republican primary by former Des Plaines Alderman Jim Curley.\Mulligan, 56, lives in Des Plaines, as does Curley, 66.\Mulligan is a full-time legislator and Curley is a semi-retired manufacturer representative.\The district the two are running in covers Maine Township, including Des Plaines, and parts of Elk Grove Township.\The following are some responses from the candidates to questions posed by the Daily Herald.\Q. What changes, if any, do you favor in the state's abortion laws? Explain.\Curley: Except for the life of the mother, abortions should be illegal. Particularly the very grotesque procedure of partial term abortion. General tax dollars should not go to fund abortion. The benefits of abstinence should be stressed in schools, clinics and doctors offices.\Mulligan: I'm pro-choice but not pro-abortion. I don't think we need additional laws. Recently passed anti-abortion laws have been challenged in court and found unconstitutional, costing Illinois taxpayers millions of dollars.\This money would be better spent working to avoid unplanned pregnancies (particularly among teenagers), assisting with child care, early childhood education and prenatal care. I firmly believe that reproductive choices are best left to a woman in consultation with her family doctor and that they are profoundly personal. The government shouldn't be involved.\Q. How would you characterize the successes and problems, to date, of the state welfare reform efforts. What adjustments, if any, might be needed?\Curley: The programs of Wisconsin and Michigan seem to be working well in getting people off of welfare and into the workplace. These programs should be studied.\Mulligan: I think we have made a good beginning with many reforms. But, in order to be successful, we have to move forward with excellent programs to increase jobs, fix the Medicaid delivery system and continue to monitor and have available enough quality day care slots. The problems of those who are chronically unemployable must be addressed if we are to be successful. I continue to seek solutions to human service problems, as that is the area where I concentrate. I have seen either the chair (majority) or spokesman (minority) of Human Service Appropriations for the last four years, so I'm quite involved.\I have an open ear to people statewide who need assistance and those who provide services. They continue to count on me to convey their concerns to my party leaders and the governor. I have tried to work on the additional issues surrounding legal immigrants and human service funding.\Q. The Department of Transportation says it cannot keep its current pace of highway maintenance without an increase in the gas tax. Do you support a gas-tax increase? If not, what ideas do you have concerning better maintenance of the state's highways?\Curley: Normally the damage to roadways is caused by trucks and very heavy traffic. I would need more information as to the license cost for trucks and heavy vehicles, to see if a gas-tax increase would be warranted.\Mulligan: I would oppose a gas tax. The Chicago area already pays too much for gas. I can fill up my tank for an average of 20 to 30 cents a gallon less downstate then I can in this area. This raises the cost of everyday living and goods and services. This raises the cost of everyday living and goods and services. Another raise in tax would not be to our advantage.\Currently there is a legislative audit being conducted examining how road fund dollars are spent. This report may show ways to do a better job and hopefully save money.\There is a good chance that we will get a good six year federal bill for fiscal year 1999 later this year. Congress' decision to only do funding for projects for six months may mean that more money will be available later. In the meantime, there is legislation being proposed to fund proposed projects with bonds until this happens, which would allow us to move forward on proposed projects.\Q. What issues unique to your district and constituents would you try to address in the next legislative session?\Curley: The noise and air pollution caused by O'Hare field is an issue of particular concern to the 55th District. The expansion of new runways should be restricted, efforts made to control noise and pollution through new technology should be made. A third regional airport would have little effect on the economy at O'Hare.\Mulligan: I was just successful in obtaining an appropriation for flood money, but we will need additionally monies to complete the project. Also, unincorporated Maine Township does not have the authority to enter into the agreements to be part of the flood correction plan, so I'm trying to assist them.\We need an environmental study of the airport; and Senator Butler and I are working on that issue.\I represent the Republican district with the largest number of immigrants, and with the changes in federal funding, we need to address potential problems at the state level so that the burden of funding those who need help doesn't fall entirely on our local communities. Working to obtain grants to work on naturalization is one area that could help our communities. This also has an impact on our school districts.\Mainly, I try to stay in touch with my local communities and respond to their ongoing needs as they arise.\Q. What further changes, if any, do you favor in the way Illinois pays for its public schools? Explain.\Curley: The new $4,200 minimum support is needed but did not do anything for District 55. The method of raising funds to support (from cigarette and casinos) could very well be reduced in the near future and then the general fund will be required to pick up any shortfall. This is not a good program and will require revisiting.\Mulligan: Right now I see this as the most difficult question. We have added money and reforms in the past three years and yet I don't think we have a solid solution. I'm glad we have raised the funding level for the poorer schools, but unhappy that we don't seem to be able to adequately address everyone's needs.\I would like to measure the success of the changes we have made in the school reforms on an ongoing basis. Forming some solid partnerships with business in shaping curriculum and meeting needs of a changing job environment would be an excellent way to begin to shape our resources to their best advantage.\I serve mainly in the area of Human Services. I have not served on any education committees. I do, however, work with my local educators and have served on my high school district's yearlong committee to change our local system. We have come up with some solid changes such as testing graduating eighth-graders and requiring summer school prior to freshman year for those who need it.\The 1995 House Republican plan for the Chicago schools has made a big improvement. I believe Paul Vallas is really committed. Individuals make differences that laws and money cannot. The state's current plan gives us a few years' breather, but we must begin work immediately to find better solutions. Although, we continue to pour money into a really diverse state system, problems confront even the better districts."
214,"Parks' smarts nets pool\At least Dick Emery can read. At Tuesday night's Vernon Hills village board meeting, the transfer of park donations was about to be voted on, with the caveat that all the money must go to the expansion of the pool (village takes control of the park district). Problem is, the vote was for $480,000 plus an unknown amount of interest and the pool expansion is projected to cost over $1.1 million, leaving the park district about $700,000 short. Park board President Fillipo, in his letter to the village, said that the park district would make the pool its No. 1 priority if the village would commit future impact fees, as outlined in a March 9 letter to the village board prepared by staff. That letter indicated about $600,000 in additional impact fees are expected by September or so this year. That guarantee was necessary for the park district to properly plan to proceed with the expansion. Without it, the park district could start the project only to find that the village board changed its mind and decided not to fund the project in the future.\Fortunately, Mr. Emery apparently is the only one who paid attention to this potential problem as outlined by Mr. Fillipo, and the village board changed its motion to include this additional funding. We actually agree on this one, Rick! While it does not preclude them from changing their minds in the future, it makes it a lot more difficult as I would certainly remind them of this board vote.\Personally, I believe a survey of village residents should have been done before a concrete list of future projects was presented to the village board by the park district, and that the village board really should have no right to dictate where the park district spends its money. But the village board changed the rules on developer donations in order to get this control. I would prefer that some of the money went to debt reduction for the two-time voter-defeated Sullivan Center (won't future residents be using what we have been unwillingly paying for?) and it appears ball fields of all types are in short supply if you believe what you read in the paper. In fact, the village was looking to buy the Golf Learning Center property for use as ball fields and leasing land to the YMCA. Now it's for ice rinks, which are apparently more important than ball fields. Had we gotten the land we should have gotten from Cuneo for the park district, we wouldn't need to be buying the Golf Learning Center in the first place and attempting to put this taxpaying amenity out of business. Of course, it would be in competition with the Cuneo driving range, and we couldn't have that, now could we. That is why the park district is smart to get commitments in writing!\Steven T. Klein\Vernon Hills\Fight hate with peace\Who knows the violent sting of the Ku Klux Klan better than black folks do? Who can and did internalize the symbolism of burning crosses on lawns, the brutal beating such as that of Emmitt Till or the cutting off of fingers and other body parts of black men and women, the raping of black women and children? These are only a few of the vicious vile list etched in my mind from stories (factual) told to me by my mother. You reap what you sow, so we must be careful of what we as a people do.\The above horrors explain my repulse for the Southern Dixie flag, a symbol that was and is glorified today interwoven with slavery, blood, suffering and shame. In spite off the KKK's past and its present existence, we must not overreact, some of us, if not all, must pray, but others must watch, and watch we shall. If the Klan have a rally, we too have an obligation to watch and remember that whenever evil is present, good also is present, and whenever the devil is present, God, too, is present.\So on that proposed day in May or any day, right shall challenge wrong, and like the Jewish community, we too say ""Never Forget."" But in the face of the Klan we must stop and end the violence we do to each other. For sometimes, let the truth be told we are our worst enemy with explanation.\I challenge my community to be the best that we can be by God's grace and mercy, and if the Klan is a reason for us to be unified, then surely we should build on this unity and fully realize, we have more in common than we differ.\Our number one challenge is to stop! The violence toward and amongst ourselves and this alone will halt the violence and aggression of others toward us!\We must keep hope alive and our eyes on the prize realizing that the biggest threat is the Klan and the Klan mentality that we cannot see. You know the ones I'm talking about, the ones who have shed the hoods and now wear suits and robes and uniforms and pose as symbols of authority such as senators, congressmen and congresswoman, police officers, judges, etc. And those who still believe that blacks, Hispanics and other so-called minorities are inferior and the cause of their woes with an assigned place and must remain in place.\But I like the great emancipator Marcus Mosaiah Garvey say, ""Up you mighty people, you can accomplish what you will!""\If we don't know it by now the Klan Devil mind is glad to see crack cocaine use taking away our sons, daughters, mothers and fathers into a depth of hell here on earth that creates crime in our community, robbing us of true respect and love, keeping us fighting each other and selling death to our own and then creating laws that sends black men, Hispanic men and women to prison warehouses for possession of crack cocaine with longer sentences than those who are caught with powdered cocaine. And let's not forget the diluting and the dismantling of the heart of affirmative action that at least kept a surface balance of opportunity on a uneven playing field.\So, on the day of the Klan's rally remember everyone is not the same and a lot of good people do not prescribe to the Klan.\Cool heads should prevail; we do not seek confrontation then or now. We will not be the aggressor, for God despises the aggressor, but we will always fight in the name of God those that fight us, for self-defense is common sense. The best fight is with truth, for it is the only thing that will set us free, and you can always tell the tree by the fruit that it bears. Hold on, a change is coming.\Eddie Washington\Waukegan\Nature can't wait\Our unfortunate experience related to the Cherry Hill Development in Hawthorn Woods is teaching the Sylvan Lake community a terrible lesson. We have had problems with the developer and Hawthorn Woods management, specifically Jon Kalmar, supervisor, and Russ Jensen, engineer.\First, they approved the redirection of water, which flowed away from Sylvan Lake, to one of our parks and eventually the lake. The area being redirected will primarily be a parking lot, with winter salt and petroleum pollutants that can find their way into our water, damaging its quality. Second, they ignored ordinance violations which were impacting the environment.\The Stormwater Management Commission, with the help of Diana O'Kelly, finally cited the developer and Hawthorn Woods for numerous violations. Hawthorn Woods cried that they were powerless to force the correction of ordinance violations which were causing environmental damage to our community and our lake, because they do not have the power to obtain a ""letter of credit"" from the developer. If they could, they would be able to independently rectify the problems.\What they do is write a letter and wait for response from the developer. Then they write another letter and again wait for a response. After a long wait, they threaten to shut the development down until the problems are corrected. Unfortunately, damage occurs every day they wait. This would not be so ridiculous if they did not require ""letters of credit"" for landscaping.\Our lesson learned is that ""looks"" is much more important to Hawthorn Woods than the ""environment.""\Rich Mirock\Mundelein\Campaigns hit new low\I've been an observer, precinct worker and/or candidate for years and thought I had seen it all. But much of the campaign tactics and literature in the last few weeks should make candidates with any sense of their own moral values and self-worth sick to their stomach.\Downright lies, character assassination, marital history, distortion, innuendo, deliberately falsifying voting records, etc. ... So much garbage. So little respect for the intelligence of the voter.\Perhaps the low point in self-debasement was the candidate whose mailer likened his opponent to mass-murderer Andrew Cunanan, slayer of Gianni Versace. How badly does one want to be elected? Where was that candidate's pride?\Candidates used to gather some friends, raise some money and find someone who could write a readable election piece the candidate could take pride in.\Now? Candidates find a hired gun who can present lies, character assassination, distortions, etc. in four-color and walk away after the election with a bundle of the candidate's money. ""They did it, not me,"" is the cop-out plea we hear later from winners and losers.\Left behind are the ruined reputations of candidates who could not raise enough money or lower their personal values to match their opponents' dollars or basest motives.\There is one important factor to be remembered by those who campaign by deceit and character assassination. Years after the polls close in an election, you will be remembered as a person who had few moral values and was desperate to win at all costs.\Don't get me wrong, I want to win elections, but I also want to sleep at night.\Marty Butler\State Senator\28th District\Mount Prospect\Public transit needs\Your Feb. 24 editorial encouraging Congress to put federal gas tax revenues to work improving our nation's roads was right on target, but it neglected to mention the critical needs of the Chicago region's public transit system.\Recently, the U.S. Senate adopted SB 1173, its version of pending federal transportation legislation, containing an increased investment of federal gas tax revenues for federal highway and road repair. However, the bill may not provide adequate funds for critical projects like the Stevenson Expressway repair. And, the Senate bill, though supporting more investment in transit, failed to identify a clear funding source to support it. Transit, which carries 1.6 million people per day, needs a reliable source of funding to assure that the region's roads do not become even more congested than they are.\When the U.S. House takes up its version of federal transportation legislation soon, we urge the Illinois delegation to assure that key projects such as the Stevenson Expressway, and CTA and Metra rehab are adequately funded. Like the Senate, the House should dedicate current federal gas tax revenues to improving our road network. But it must go a step further and commit to providing the revenues to meet the growing need for transit and keep our region moving.\MarySue Barrett, President,\Metropolitan Planning Council\Co-Leader, Business Leaders\for Transportation\Chicago"
215,"Five candidates are competing for the Republican nomination for Kane County Board for District 16 in the March 21 primary.\Vincent Brandys Jr., 36, is an optometrist, and has lived in the district for three years. He has served as a St. Charles Township Republican Precinct Committeeman, and as a DuPage Airport Authority commissioner. He involved with the Bartlett Lions Club. He lives in Elgin.\George Elliott, 66, is a retired plumber and has lived in the district for six years. He served on the Elgin building commission from 1979 to 1982. He lives in Elgin.\Tom Hartwell, 40, the incumbent, is an attorney and has lived in the district for six years. He has served as a board member since 1996. He has been involved in the Rotary Club, Habitat for Humanity, 4-H and youth football. He lives in Elgin.\Bob Huff, 70, is a real estate agent, and has lived in the district for six months. He served as a precinct committeeman from 1993 to 1999, and in the Army Reserve and Illinois National Guard as an officer. He has served as an elder at his church. He lives in Elgin with his wife and has three children.\Daniel Walter, 47, is an insurance adviser and broker who has lived in the district for 19 years. He serves on the business advisory council for Elgin Area School District U-46 and Elgin Community College board. He is the vice chairman and founder of South Elgin Economic Development, and he served on the Community 2000 Image Task Force. He lives in South Elgin.\The Daily Herald asked the candidates some questions. Here are their answers.\Why are you running for this office, whether for re-election or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you? If so, what?\Brandys: I am running to give the voters a choice. I will promise the voters three things: accessibility, commitment and term limit of three terms.\To be more accessible, I will have regular office hours locally for people to address their concerns and problems. I will develop my own Web site for citizens to e-mail me about issues and use the Web site to update individuals on county board events/issues. I will attend local village, town and city meetings to communicate the county's position on issues and to listen and educate myself on the happenings of local events.\I will attend board meetings and committee meetings. I will have a much better track record of attendance than the incumbent. I promise the voters that I will dedicate myself to represent them, by attending and actively participating in all county board meetings.\I will serve no more than three terms on the county board. I think public service is an important accomplishment in someone's life; however, I feel strongly that others should participate in the process. I think after three terms if my influence on the board is not felt than someone should have that opportunity.\Elliott: There is no particular issue that motivates me. My reason for running is to represent and serve my fellow citizens and taxpayers. I have the interest, the patience, and the time to devote to the office.\Hartwell: I am seeking re-election as board member of the 16th District of Kane County because it is a wonderful opportunity to serve and have a positive impact on my community.\Over the past three years, I have acted to the best of my ability to do what is right for the people of my district. I hope that I have earned their trust. I believe that I have useful experience and demonstrated an ability to make sound decisions beneficial to the community as a whole and not to some special interest group. I am not the type of person to try to grab headlines or draw attention to myself. I only want to do the best job I can for my district.\I have always had a passion for helping children. I have long been involved in various volunteer youth programs such as God's Gym, Teen Challenge, Little League and youth football. This experience has made me very aware of the many issues that affect our children.\My initial decision to run for public office was primarily based upon my experience counseling at-risk children at God's Gym. I saw that crime was a serious problem and required a two-prong attack. First, after crimes are committed, criminals must be separated from society for the purpose of correction and rehabilitation. Second, pre- emptive measures must be take to reach out to our children to prevent crime by providing positive alternatives.\As a member of the corrections and rehabilitation committee and the judiciary committee, I have been able to impact the policy making on the county board. We initiated a number of policies to make our community safer.\Huff: I am running to pay back the community for all I have received over the years. No single issue compels me to run. I endeavor to exam facts without bias and represent the community.\Walter: I chose to pursue the county board opening for the 16th District at the prompting of a broad cross section of people in Elgin and South Elgin. They know me through my involvement in bringing a higher quality of life to the area, and through my service to the community, chambers of commerce, my church and our schools. Until recently, I have felt confident that those channels were the best ways for me to contribute.\In recent years, there have been a variety of 16th District issues requiring a strong working relationship with Kane County. Unfortunately, at present none exists. I recognize that the pace of development in our area will bring rise to many more issues, including transportation, landfills, waste management, environment, economic development, and land-use planning. We need more than just knowledge to address these issues. We need action, with thought and balance.\A vastly improved relationship with the county will serve the district better for all of the issues we face. My broad experiences in the community will be an advantage not only in communicating, but also in understanding different viewpoints. As a lifelong resident of Kane County, this is my home. I want to help take care of it the same as I do my home.\If you are an incumbent, describe your main contributions and any important initiatives you've led. If you are not an incumbent, tell what contributions you would make. Describe any shortcomings in the current board that you would help remedy and explain how.\Brandys: My background is the most diverse of any of the candidates. I am a graduate of DePaul University with a bachelor of science in biology, and of the Illinois College of Optometry with a bachelor of science in visual science and a doctorate in optometry. I have been in private practice in Bartlett since 1993. Additionally to being a health-care provider, I have been a grass- roots lobbyist for health-care initiatives in Springfield and Washington. I have worked with local, state and federal officeholders, in my capacity as president of the Illinois Optometric Association and as a member of the American Optometric Association's public health and disease prevention committee. I am business owner and know what it means to meet a payroll. I have been active in the community and as a father to two young children; I realize how important the decisions made by officeholders affect our families' futures.\Elliott: Whenever an issue arises there will be the questions by elected and appointed officials regarding an expenditure that will be borne by the taxpayers.\I have learned many years ago as an apprentice plumber to study intently any job I am delegated to perform. The same basic treatment on an issue should be faced by an elected official, this should include ""will it work,"" ""is it feasible,"" ""how much does it cost,"" and ""can we afford it?"" With these guidelines in mind, I would approach every issue to the best interest of the people of my district and the entire county.\Hartwell: In the course of my first term, the county board has accomplished much. We opened the Juvenile Justice Center, which brings in more than $1 million in revenue to Kane County; opened a substation for the sheriff's department in Aurora; updated the sheriff's computer system; implemented a storm-water management plan; balanced the budget; reduced the tax rate; passed the forest preserve referendum; and set a closing date for the landfill to name a few.\Although this is my first term, I was appointed to chair two subcommittees: the open burning task force and public health review subcommittee reviewing the makeup of the Kane County board of health.\Meetings of the review subcommittee have temporarily discontinued so that our new executive director of public health can become fully acclimated in her new position.\As a member of the public health committee, I initiated and now chair the open burning task force. My position and contributions are discussed fully under question 5.\Huff: My strength is my objectivity in examining each situation in the light of community wants, and my extensive experience in making these decisions.\Walter: I believe that open communication with all segments of the community and the government bodies involved is critical, and much more likely with me. My experience working with public and private ventures, for-profits and not-for-profits, business organizations, and community-based organizations, has enhanced by sensitivity toward differing viewpoints while strengthening my ability to make difficult decisions. The board shortcoming I seek to correct is the noticeable absence of a voice that has contact with the district.\The county jail is severely overcrowded. What short- and long- term solutions would you support to ease the overcrowding?\Brandys: Simply put - more beds. We need to make a commitment for the safety and welfare of our county to provide the necessary space. The current renting of space from other counties, while being a short- term solution, is not the answer. I would propose at least a 500-bed addition. I would not want to build something, however, that would need additional space in four or five years. Build for the future - build to protect the citizens.\Elliott: The only short-term solution is to continue using neighborhood county jails after the Kane County jail is filled. Home monitoring should be used whenever possible. It would save the taxpayers a lot of money.\Until we find a solution to overcrowded court system, the only long-term solution is more jail space, more personnel, more taxes.\Hartwell: The overcrowding should not be eased - it should be remedied. Three years ago when I first began my term and was appointed a member of the judiciary committee and corrections and rehabilitation committee, the jail was overcrowded. A referendum to expand the jail was defeated by the people of Kane County. Consequently, we began looking for other ways to relieve the overcrowding.\I learned that 80 percent of the inmates at the county jail were awaiting trial and that most of those inmates, if convicted, would be moved to a state penitentiary. Thus, a number of actions were taken to move inmates through the system faster. If an inmate was taken to trial sooner, he would leave the county jail sooner and relieve some of the overcrowding.\The following actions were taken to remedy the overcrowding: night court was initiated; the Illinois Supreme Court was petitioned for the appointment of an additional circuit judge; an additional felony court was opened and staffed; and the home monitoring program was expanded for nonviolent offenders.\These actions resulted in an initial decrease in the number of jail inmates. Nevertheless, over time, the number of inmates has continued to grow. We are now again overcrowded.\In the short term, the only real solution is to find other county jails with space and house our inmates there. This costs approximately $50 per day plus transportation costs. The sheriff currently estimates that in 2000, the taxpayers of Kane County will pay $1.5 million to send our inmates to other jails.\The long-term solution is to expand the current jail. Presently, we have engaged an engineering firm to develop preliminary plans and budget.\In the end, our best solution may be to duplicate what we have done at the youth home. The Juvenile Justice Center accepts detained youth from other counties. Kane County receives more than $1 million annually from other counties. I believe that we could build additional beds in our adult jail and accept inmates from other counties to pay for the cost of the expansion.\Huff: Short term: examine costs to outsource. Long term: reduce crime through early education and examine jail expansion.\Walter: Short-term solutions to the jail overcrowding we are experiencing could include the possibility of early release with community service for nonviolent offenders who have served a substantial portion of their sentence, home monitoring, and continuing the practice of utilizing available cells elsewhere. However, to do the latter, a cost analysis should be completed to identify if we are in fact paying a greater cost over an extended period by this practice. I also would want to confirm that we are moving offenders through our court system at an appropriate pace, leading to their timely release or moving them out to the appropriate facility. As our population grows significantly, we can safely conclude that a proportional increase in jail cells will be needed, especially given our present shortage.\We need to take reasonable action to reduce the stream of offenders whose incarceration results in the overcrowding. Early childhood and youth intervention programs that can address contributing factors should be considered.\Bridge projects have created much controversy in Kane County. Which of the proposed bridges do you support? Why?\Brandys: All of the proposed bridges I support. The basic fact is that the county is growing and will not stop growing. Once again, this is a future issue. We need to have the foresight to build bridges that will ease the transportation issues and the public safety issues. The NIMBY (not in my back yard) mentality is senseless. The myopic attitude of those individuals can not stop progress. We must proceed on what's best for all of Kane County.\Elliott: The county board elected to proceed with the Stearns, Bolz and Route 56 corridors. I would certainly support their choice. I have seen some of the studies along with the Red Gate corridor, but do not feel qualified at this point to make a decision.\Hartwell: The Stearns Road bridge project is the priority. First, it will relieve traffic congestion in my district. Second, being located near the center of Kane County, the Stearns Road bridge also will benefit the county as a whole.\Huff: I need to look at the facts in more detail before this issue needs determination.\Walter: If only one regional bridge could be built, the Stearns Road (CC&P corridor) bridge addresses the greatest range of regional transportation issues facing Kane County. By its central county location between South Elgin and St. Charles, and since it coordinates with the DuPage County transportation plan, the Stearns Road bridge effectively links Route 59 to Route 47 as a major and direct east-west corridor. The connection to South Elgin at McDonald and Randall roads will significantly complement the development plans under way for that area, contributing to the revenue, employment, and higher quality of life it is intended to provide. Stearns Road has the highest level of support among the cities and villages in the area it will serve.\However, both bridges are needed for the transportation needs facing Kane County. I support the continued pursuit of both regional bridges.\Do you support a leaf-burning ban throughout the county? Only in restricted areas? Stricter enforcement of the existing ordinance? Or no change in the status quo? Why?\Brandys: I strongly support the ban. As a health-care provider, I understand what the effects of burning have on people with asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory ailments. Other communities have already banned burning, so to have isolated areas with permission to burn is detrimental on the public's health. The harm that burning can cause should be eliminated, just as smoking is not permitted in public places.\Elliott: No I do not support a countywide leaf burning ban. Let the individual municipalities decide if they want a leaf-burning ban. No changes from the status quo. The cost of hauling leaves would be much more than in city-type areas.\Hartwell: As chairman of the open burning task force, I initiated the investigation into amending the current Kane County Code.\If an ordinance is not properly enforced, it is not very useful. As part of the task force's efforts, the sheriff's department has developed a uniform citation form to issue to violators of the open burning ordinance and has agreed to investigate complaints. Before this, complaints were investigated by the health department or local fire departments. The sheriff's department by far is better equipped to handle such investigations and issue citations. Consequently, enforcement will be improved whether or not the ordinance is amended.\Medical evidence shows that opening burning is detrimental to our public health and for those with certain conditions like asthma, it is very and immediately dangerous. Consequently, to enhance public health, I support a ban of open burning (in non- farming areas) in the most populous townships of the county. These are the six townships along the Fox River.\Huff: I support the leaf-burning ban throughout the county to protect those who have health problems from the smoke.\Walter: While being sensitive to the needs of people with respiratory disorders, I am not convinced that the current ordinance is inadequate as it is written. Assuming the public even knows the guidelines, they are presently responsible for determining if the conditions are appropriate for burning, which invites mistakes in even the best-intentioned residents. If burning is allowed to continue in open areas under the most favorable conditions, it is critical that a clear understanding of the guidelines be communicated. Perhaps staff can provide a more objective appraisal of burning conditions and communicate their findings in a recorded message at a designated phone number at the township or county.\In exchange for the right to burn, residents will have the responsibility to comply with the ordinance intended to minimize the health impact of burning. Fines should be adequate to detour unlawful burning, through an increase for repeat offenses, and be sufficient to cover costs incurred by the county or township.\Alternate solutions should be examined and presented for review.\Should the county board vote to increase the county gas tax from 2 cents to 4 cents a gallon to pay for future transportation needs?\Brandys: No. I am not in favor of increasing the gas tax. I think budget awareness and cost-cutting measures should be looked at first before raising the gas tax.\Elliott: Future transportation needs must be identified before any tax is increased. Increasing the gas tax will limit gas sales in the fringe areas of the county. It would eliminate many trucks from stopping in Kane County to buy gas.\Hartwell: At this time, I do not believe that a tax increase is needed.\Huff: Again I would have to examine these facts. I am not privy to all the issues on this and the numbers.\Walter: I would consider a 2-cent increase in the county gas tax only if presented with enough evidence that shows compelling, unmet transportation needs exist, and there is an inability to fund those projects elsewhere.\What matters of concern to your particular district do you plan to address if you're elected?\Brandys: Open space and jail space. The 16th District is a very large geographical area, with a lot of open space. I would spend some of the $70 million that the county has on land off Randall Road to keep open space and not turn Randall Road north of McDonald Road to Big Timber Road what it is south - in Geneva. Retail development is good, but excessive development can cause problems on infrastructure, public safety, and the enjoyment of not being in an urban area.\Elliott: If elected, I would make myself visible in the district. Regular scheduled meetings where people could express their concerns would be held.\Hartwell: In addition to issues discussed above, orderly development is an important issue. The county will continue to enforce its high standards for development. Because of the growth along Randall Road, the county has been investigating improvements of east-west arterial roads, such as McDonald Road. Also, I will continue to support the selection of the Stearns Road bridge to relieve traffic congestion in the district. Additionally, the forest preserve is interested in a number of parcels of land for possible acquisition. I will continue identify others as the case may be.\Huff: To address the jail issue, crime issue, need for bridges, and growth, in an orderly fashion.\Walter: Due to the significant importance of the Stearns Road bridge, and its ability to mitigate broad and pressing transportation issues for such a large part of the region, I would continue efforts to expedite its completion.\Open land acquisition is of major importance to our storm-water management plans as well as the aesthetic, recreational and environmental benefits open land provides. This should remain an ongoing priority as part of our land-use planning before it becomes too expensive to acquire. I encourage the consideration of cluster developments to complement this effort.\Randall Road serves as much more than just a transportation corridor. It has the capacity to link us to employment opportunities, substantial and critically needed sources of nonresidential revenue generators, retail and services that will keep our expendable income in our own region, and decrease the amount of travel required by obtaining these benefits out of our area. It is important, however, that needed development strategies include traffic signal synchronization, and the use of fiber optics to keep us moving at 40 to 45 mph through the area. My goal is efficient movement of traffic while still enjoying the best fruits that Randall Road has to offer.\In light of the existing traffic volume on Route 20 west of Elgin, and especially considering Elgin's far west development plan, I want to work with the county, township, Elgin, Illinois Department of Transportation, and our representatives to expedite improvements to Route 20.\I support the county's stated opposition to expansion or enlargement of the Woodland Landfill near South Elgin. Of concern will be the ongoing need to properly dispose of the waste we generate. As we continue efforts to reduce the volume of non- recyclable waste we produce, transfer stations are likely to be offered as the means by which we dispose of our waste. Transfer stations can essentially mean the closure of our area landfill, allowing us to transfer our garbage to a county that welcomes it.\Of greatest importance, and central to all of the issues that will arise, is improving the relationship and communication between District 16 and the county. We need someone who will step up, not just show up."
216," This is one of a series of questionnaires that the Daily Herald will publish for all contested races in the Tri-Cities area in advance of the Nov. 7 primary election.\ Two candidates are competing for the Kane County Board District 9 seat - incumbent Jim Mitchell and Democratic challenger Michael Lowery. Both live in North Aurora.\ The district covers North Aurora and part of Batavia.\ Below are some of the questions sent to the candidates and their answers:\ Q: Are you satisfied with the county's plans to fund its new animal control facility? Why or why not? What alternatives would you propose?\ Lowery: Animal control is a function of the county and it must be responsible for such in the best interest of residents' safety and overall well-being. The new animal control facility has been well- planned and has come in under budget, therefore, funding of this vital project mandates the finance committee and then the board more carefully review the overall budget, which would detail the funding of this and other projects, so that residents can be assured of the maximum number of quality services at the lowest cost.\ Mitchell: I was very vocal that the county should not pay for services that are the responsibility of the municipalities. Through my continued efforts and the county chairperson, each municipality that the county provides animal control service for will be involved in funding the facility as well as paying for their share of services.\ Q: Some in the county are concerned that the county could soon run out of water. Should the county be concerned? If so, what steps might the county take to address the issue?\ Lowery: Absolutely. I am very concerned about the water supply, as are the constituents of District 9. Therefore, the Kane County Board should be equally concerned. Living in North Aurora, which has experienced problems with supplying water, has made me keenly aware of this impending problem and its impact throughout Kane County. As recently published, regional planners have determined that if growth continues at its present rate, our water supply will be overextended by the year 2020.\ The county board, working in cooperation with the municipalities, should devise policies to ensure builders plan new communities which provide ample green space, and, if necessary, impose limits on the rate, density, and amount of building being done in the future. Kane County must also explore other water sources, including the feasibility of tapping into Lake Michigan water supply now before this issue becomes too critical to be addressed in a practical and cost-effective manner.\ Mitchell: In regard to water quality and shortages, the county has initiated a multi-year study not only on the quality of water available but the future amount available to all county residents. This study will be completed in the spring of next year and I believe that it will form the basis for not only controlled development within the county but indicate the direction we need to go to preserve water.\ It is interesting that despite the multi-year study some people seem to already feel that they know there is a water shortage. While I believe this is a concern I am amazed that they appear to know more than the experts.\ Q: Do you have any long-term concerns over the new county jail, the move of the sheriff's office to that facility eventually or the finances involved? If so, please explain.\ Lowery: Yes, the constituents of District 9 and I have concerns with the new jail, including its planning, its exorbitant cost, and its ability to meet future needs. There is a crucial need for additional inmate beds to accommodate our rapidly growing county, however, why our elected officials would opt to scrap a prudent, financially conservative $12 million build-out at the current jail for a proposed project of $50 million (and quickly escalating) for a mere eight additional beds is incomprehensible. One estimate claims it would have been almost 80 percent less expensive to build an addition onto the existing jail providing virtually the same amount of bed space as the new jail.\ Since these plans are now being executed, there remain many serious concerns. At the time the new facility is opened, some question remains if will meet the county's needs. Further, the inmate-to-staff ratio exceeds recommendations of current correctional facility guidelines. The county must address this situation without further burdening taxpayers. Lastly, bypassing a referendum on such a costly project and opting to procure debt certificates in quantities totaling over $30 million thus far, the current board has placed a sizable financial burden on the taxpayers. This will require innovative solutions in order to address this financial burden and not further tax the residents.\ Also of concern with the process was the total disregard of the concerns, issues, and needs of Kane County residents, particularly those who are most immediately impacted by its location and construction.\ Mitchell: Finally, after many years with me as part of the leadership team, the county is going to find a solution to our jail problem. This project not only allows for our present needs but is forward thinking for our future needs.\ While a small vocal minority has talked against the jail, the majority of the residents in my district support what the county board has done and in fact, many staunch Democrats have come forward applauding me personally for my leadership. Do not forget that the new jail will save the taxpayers of Kane County over $1.5 million per year and probably more. And, that by taking the approach we did, with rising construction costs, is a major accomplishment.\ Q: One of the biggest problems the county faces is the provision of transportation services in the face of fast growth. Would you support an increase in the gas tax to help fund needed road projects? Why or why not? What projects should have priority funding? Please include your views on the Stearns and Bolz Road bridge projects in your answer.\ Lowery: Current gas prices have already strained the budgets of hard-working citizens; additional taxation would only exacerbate their burden. The transportation issue can best be addressed by devising an effective, comprehensive public transportation plan that would truly serve the residents, while protecting the environment. There are state and federal grants available for such massive projects to expand and enhance the current public transportation network, but the planning of such projects would need to be an inclusive process, engaging local municipalities, residents and business owners, if it is to be truly effective.\ Prioritizing projects, including transportation infrastructure improvements, is crucial. A comprehensive regional approach, which includes input from citizens, municipalities, and local transportation agencies, must be implemented prior to specific projects being approved or funded by the county board. Speaking generally, I support additional options to cross the Fox River, but the planning of such projects must incorporate practical, cost- effective solutions that truly meet the needs of residents.\ Mitchell: I was one of the few people who voted against the 2- cent gas tax that the county currently has. What most voters don't understand where they have a 4-cent gas tax, gas overall is cheaper than in Kane County. My concern with the gas tax is point of delivery vs. point of service. The city of Batavia lost over $80,000 in taxes simply because a gas delivery firm changed their address. In terms of the bridge projects I have strongly supported all bridge projects and am appalled at the delay due to the bureaucracy for federal funding.\ Q: Though most growth is controlled by municipalities, is the county doing a good job in those areas of growth management that it does control? Why or why not? What further could the county do in terms of addressing growth-related issues?\ Lowery: Kane County has a unique role and opportunity to work with residents, developers, local municipalities, state and regional planners, as well as its own departments such as the Kane County Forest Preserve to ensure well-thought-out growth. Since growth concerns all of the residents of Kane County, officials need to work in a spirit of collaboration and consensus-building, and develop sound policy to ensure such cooperation with current and future residents and businesses of Kane County. The 2030 plan is an excellent guideline; however, it must be a shared vision by all the parties involved if we are to have a prosperous future.\ Mitchell: This question goes hand in hand with (the previous one). The county cannot build its way out of our transportation concerns with continuing development and that is why we have talked to municipalities about smart growth and working together to resolve problems. So far I have been the only proponent who has publicly talked about trying to force municipalities to accept our 2030 plan and to make sure they have boundary agreements which will not allow municipalities to play against each other or the county against municipalities.\ Q: Is there a particular problem in your district you would like to see addressed? If so, what is it and how would you recommend the issue be addressed?\ Lowery: Residents in District 9 have expressed concerns that they are not informed of the issues the Kane County Board is considering. Much of what is discussed in various committees and by the full board is not readily available in local publications - or is only published after the board has voted on the issue. A priority of mine would be to establish an open dialogue between the residents of district 9 and the full board by means of a non- partisan Citizens' Advisory group. In my opinion, open and clear communication to citizens is a vital function of Kane County Board members with regard to serving the public.\ Mitchell: The issues in my district that have been brought to my attention or that I am aware of I have worked hard to resolve and am proud of my public record of accomplishing solutions and bringing people together to resolve problems."

218," Big Oil greed that government officials choose to ignore is the best way to describe the ""crisis"" that is causing gasoline and natural gas prices to soar.\ They want us to believe that interruptions at production fields throughout the world are creating more demand for oil than can be supplied, thus causing prices to escalate.\ How can anyone possibly believe that when the world's largest oil companies are raking in record profits for the third quarter just ended Sept. 30? Here is an example:\ * Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, had record third-quarter profits of $5.68 billion, or 88 cents per share versus 55 cents per share in the same period last year. Profit up 60 percent.\ * Chevron Texaco, the second biggest U.S. oil company, netted $3.2 billion, sending its per share profit from $1.01 in the same period a year ago to $1.51 in the last quarter.\ * Conoco Phillips, the nation's third largest oil company, earned $2.86 a share vs. $1.90 a share a year ago.\ * Unocal Corp., on a smaller scale, had earnings of $1.23 per share last quarter vs. 58 cents a year ago. Profit up 112 percent.\ And it is not just American companies.\ * Britain's largest oil company, BP, had a 43 percent increase in profit to $2.1 billion.\ * Without giving figures on oil companies operating in Russia, it has been reported that Russia had adjusted its budget to reflect $17.6 billion from taxes and duties on oil industry profits this year. The budget originally showed $2.9 billion. Russia's taxes and duties skim off about 90 percent of the profits when oil exceeds $25 a barrel.\ With figures such as these, it's hard to believe the oil production interruptions have as much to do with the high prices of gasoline and natural gas as the companies would have us believe. We will concede that terrorists blowing up pipelines in Iraq; political unrest in the Nigeria oil producing region; attempts to oust the oil- controlling Saudi monarchy; scandals over oil profits and control in Russia; and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico are bound to have affected the supply.\ But when we see profits increasing from 50 percent to as high as 112 percent, it suggests the real culprits are in the Big Oil board rooms, refineries where gasoline blends vary from state to state to keep ""outside"" gasoline out of the local turf and perhaps, to a smaller extent, the more local distributors.\ And what is government doing? Nothing visible. And why should it? While we're gullible enough to believe the old ""supply and demand"" reasoning and pay the going rate for gasoline, the federal government is collecting 18.4 cents on every gallon of gasoline sold. And every state adds a per-gallon tax, varying from 8 cents in Alaska to 36.1 cents in Hawaii. The Illinois gas tax is 19 cents per gallon. Some communities also have local taxes added. Neither federal or state officials are going to rock the boat much because a reduction in gasoline tax revenue means they have less to spend.\ We could go on a conservation kick as we did in the mid- and late '70s and at the time of the Gulf War in 1991. People bought smaller cars that used less fuel. But history tells us that won't last. As soon as gasoline prices dipped, the era of the gas-guzzling vehicles returned.\ So, where is the problem? It is with us -- consumers willing to pay the going price when gasoline soars above $2 per gallon. We talk about buying more fuel efficient vehicles but fill the roads with gas guzzlers because we want them and they provide a measure of safety for our families. Car manufacturers have introduced hybrid cars, but are in a ticklish situation -- demand is greater than production, but not great enough to take other models off line to devote to the hybrid cars.\ The more we drive, the more gasoline we need. And because we won't let exploration for new supplies within the United States damage our environment, we have to depend on more imports. When anything happens in countries exporting oil to the United States, it's an excuse to increase prices. And as evident by Big Oil profits, anytime those companies see an opportunity to gouge U.S. consumers, they'll do it.\ The best way to put Big Oil in its place is to hit its piggy banks. With the kind of profits they're making, why do they need any tax loopholes or subsidies from the U.S. government. U.S. consumers have to put unrelenting pressure on U.S. House and Senate members to stop oil industry price-gouging now."
219,"Two candidates are vying for the Republican nomination for Kane County Board District 14 in the Tuesday primary - business executive incumbent Mark J. Davoust, 48, of St. Charles, and mechanical engineer Tina B. Yagla, 36, of Geneva.\Candidates were asked to complete a Q & A; some excerpts from their answers are given below. To read each Q & A in full, visit dailyherald.com.\Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for re-election or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what? What will be your main priority?\Mark J. Davoust. For the past 30 years, I have lived and worked in Kane County and I have raised my family here. I now have four grandchildren who also live here in Kane County. In order to provide a healthy, safe and nurturing environment for current and future residents of Kane County, it is important to focus on long- range solutions to our common concerns and take positive action in our long-range planning and development. I can best do this by continuing my work in community service and by working with a group of dedicated elected and community officials to meet these common goals. During my tenure on the board, we have made remarkable progress in transportation and public safety. I am proud to be a part of a team that has been able to effectuate positive change in our community. I hope to continue the projects and work that we on the board have undertaken and completed since I joined the board in 2004 and, for these reasons, I am seeking re-election.\Tina B. Yagla. Representation: I feel that the incumbent isn't truly representative to the citizens in the 14th District. In calendar year 2007, he has missed nearly 30 percent of the county board meetings. He failed to show up to vote for the single largest project in Kane County history that was sited in District 14 (the jail vote). He did, however, vote yes to give county board members a pay increase. He also voted yes to increase the gas tax. Higher taxes and greater pay for elected officials are not the issues for which a true representative would be voting ""yes.""\Q. For incumbents and non-incumbents. If you are an incumbent, describe your main contributions. Tell us of important initiatives you've led. If you are not an incumbent, tell us what contributions you would make.\Davoust. As an incumbent, I serve as vice chairman of the judicial/public safety committee and also serve on transportation, the enhanced 911 task force, jail steering committee and liquor commission. My duties as a forest preserve commissioner include service on the utilization and enterprise committees. Through my work on the judicial/public safety committee and jail steering committee, we have worked to enhance public safety through the construction of a new county jail. The transportation committee has been a driving force in bringing vast improvements to our county roads, intersections and bridges; most notably the new bridge under construction at Stearns Road. We have made real, concrete progress on the long-term transportation needs of the county. From the time that I joined the board and forest preserve commission in 2004, we have received an overwhelming endorsement by the voters of our open space initiatives and farmland preservation programs. I am proud to be an advocate for these valuable efforts.\Yagla. I would be a true representative for the citizens of the 14th District. I have a proven track record of hard work and dedication to researching the issues that affect the citizens of Kane County. I have spoken at the county board meetings on issues such as the gas tax, jail planning, animal control, etc. I am unafraid of many hours of independent research on major issues. I believe that the county board members should be putting in time to research some of the items that are put forth for vote; to ensure they have all the necessary information to make an informed vote.\Q. Revenues are down and belt-tightening has been ordered for next year's budget. In what ways would you attempt to control expenditures? What services would you reduce first and which would you consider necessities?\Davoust. The 2008 budget will be reduced by approximately 9 percent over past years. In our most recent budgets, we have seen large capital expenditures on projects such as the county jail, animal control facility and transportation projects throughout the county. We should expect to see fewer large capital outlays in 2008 because part of the way in which we can control our budget and live within our means is to postpone initiatives and new projects. With the cooperation of staff and department heads, we will have no reduction in services or personnel in 2008.\Yagla. The dependence of the county on outside consultants in the past several years is alarming. I would advocate the elimination of many of the county's contracts with outside consultants. Expenses are going to increase for the county's judicial and public safety line items. With an increase in population, unfortunately comes an increase in crime. The sheriff's office will need to continue to expand its patrol and corrections staff to accommodate the growing needs of Kane County. Additionally, the state's attorney office will need to expand its staff to accommodate the needs of those requiring legal counsel. Items of public safety should not be taken lightly. It is imperative that the offices charged with keeping the citizens of Kane County safe receive the funding needed to operate effectively and efficiently.\Q. Transportation issues continue to be a major concern to residents. How would you judge the county's response to their demands so far? What would you consider to be of highest county priority in this area and how would you fund its delivery?\Davoust. Transportation will continue to be a major concern within the county and our response will continue to be a balanced mixture of correcting existing problems and encouraging long-range planning to alleviate congestion problems in the future. The county has taken the lead role in the construction of the Stearns Road bridge project which is under way. Major intersection improvements at Randall Road and Route 64, and at Kirk Road and Route 38 are now completed - on schedule and on budget. Continuing work on the Stearns Road project is certainly a priority. Also important is the effort to partner with communities throughout the county to address future infrastructure needs through long-range planning. Joint efforts, such as the study being undertaken with regard to creating a comprehensive plan for Route 47, is an example of one such effort. Funding of these existing and new transportation programs may be accomplished, at least in part, by the implementation of the Transportation Impact Fee Program on new development.\Yagla. Transportation in Kane County is definitely a growing concern. The county is working with the state to construct more Fox River bridges. It is important that the county stay proactive in this as the county continues to grow. With the looming cutbacks to Pace and Metra, the transportation issue in Kane County will continue to be a major concern. It is crucial that the county work with state legislators to get the necessary funding to ensure that public transportation remains viable and convenient for the citizens of Kane County. The driving public as a whole will be negatively impacted if public transportation resources are cut as it will force more cars on to the overcrowded roadways.\Q. With one long-time issue, the county jail, all but resolved, there remains the enduring issue of county office consolidation. Should it be a priority and how would you accomplish it financially? Explain. If not, what issue do you consider of more immediate concern and why?\Davoust. The new jail on the judicial center campus has been constructed with shell space for its own future expansion as well as the anticipated arrival of the sheriff's office. This will consolidate the county's public safety services which is in the county's best interest. The county also has purchased the former Montgomery Ward property on Randall Road in St. Charles which allows for future consolidation in a more cost-controlled environment.\Yagla. The issue of building a new jail has been resolved. The county is building a $55 million, 640-bed facility. However, the issue of jail overcrowding has not been resolved. The county's inmate population has been in excess of the 640-bed count for months. Recently, the sheriff's office announced that the inmate numbers had reached 769. This is a troubling statistic. Because even with an expensive shell-space build-out to gain another 128 beds, the new multi-million dollar jail will still be overcrowded. The county is planning to consolidate the county offices to the Route 38 campus. Conceptually, that is a great long-term strategic plan as it would improve the efficiency of serving the citizens of Kane County. However, with the recent announcement of the county's need to purchase the Montgomery Ward building, that investment should be carefully considered along with the need to add courtroom space and a new jail wing before the county launches another expensive capital building project to build new office spaces for existing county functions.\Q. The county has taken a leadership role in studying the issue of long-term water supply maintenance and protection. What should the county's emphasis be in this area over the next few years? Explain.\Davoust. The county has reviewed and adopted a water resource planning process. This process consists of 7 steps and we have already completed the first three steps; identifying the projected problems and opportunities in our 2030 Resource Management Plan; creating a team with Illinois State Water Survey and Illinois State Geological Survey to assist with planning and feedback in the process; and working on scientific data and reports. Our emphasis in the following years will be to continue this process to identify alternative plans and implement them.\Yagla. Controlled development. Living in Kane County is a wonderful experience. It is estimated that the county's population could double in the next 20 years. It is imperative that the county work with the municipalities and developers to ensure that the growth is controlled and carefully planned."
220," Clerk responsible for Election Day confusion\ Voting in the March 19 primary was the first time for many of us to try out the new voting system. I liked it. But as I voted, I witnessed an awful lot of confusion in the polling place. Confusion the county clerk should have handled long before Election Day.\ A voter wanted to vote only on the referendum. He asked for a nonpartisan ballot. A Nonpartisan ballot offers only referendum questions and no candidates. He was informed there were no nonpartisan ballots and was asked to declare whether or not he wanted a Democratic or Republican ballot. He wanted neither and he left.\ Then, thank goodness, I looked at the back of my ballot to see if there were additional races to vote on. The lady I walked out with did not know there were candidates on the back of the ballot, and so more votes were lost.\ I don't blame the election judges. That is a thankless job, and I am sure they don't get paid what they are worth. I do blame Willard Helander, our county clerk. She was in charge of a very confusing day and should have spent more time educating the public and the judges.\ Margie Gelhar\ Waukegan\ Budget cuts will hurt program for disabled\ In Gov. George Ryan's recommended budget for next year, there are serious threats to people with disabilities and seniors. If this proposed budget is passed, it will have devastating consequences for seniors and people with disabilities, and potentially will force many people into nursing homes.\ Even though the Home Services budget was increased, it is still $23.5 million short of what is needed to continue this program as it is, and that does not include any increases in personal assistant wages.\ This budget is both irresponsible and shortsighted. The Home Services Program serves people with disabilities in their own homes at about one-third of the cost that nursing home care would cost the state, in addition to allowing people a much better quality of life. A person living independently with Home Services also adds to the state economy through possible wages, taxes and general input into the economy. Reducing Home Services hours by 12 to 15 hours per month per person may be catastrophic to many people with disabilities, and instead of adding to their communities, they would be forced back into nursing homes, thereby becoming a drain on the economy.\ The Home Services Program allows people with disabilities to remain in their own homes and hire personal assistants directly, for which the state pays only $7 per hour, another financial savings. Many of these personal assistants belong to SEIU Local 880, are hard- working and are dedicated to providing quality care. But the proposed budget cuts would take $84 per month from the paychecks of every one of these dedicated personal assistants.\ The budget cuts also would be harmful to people with disabilities through the proposed cut to LCCIL's Personal Assistant contract. This contract has enabled us to:\ - Train and refer personal assistants to Home Services consumers.\ - Provide Home Services consumers with the skills to recruit, train, hire and manage a personal assistant, thereby enabling themselves to remain in the community.\ - Provide early-intervention services and services to newly disabled people in rehabilitation settings to enable them to transition into their own homes rather into nursing homes.\ Our Personal Assistant Program is critical to the success of the person with a disability in regaining a dignified, quality and independent life outside of the nursing home.\ We need to send a message to our legislators in Springfield that people with disabilities and seniors deserve the dignity of living in their own homes in Lake County. Keeping people with disabilities and seniors in their own homes is a win-win situation for everyone in Illinois - the people with disabilities, the seniors, the taxpayers and the state itself. Together we can make a difference!\ Lori Clark\ Executive Director\ Lake County Center\ For Independent Living\ Mundelein\ Pom squad falls victim to unfair judging system\ The Olympics figure skating scandal rocked the world and pointed the finger at the subjectivity and arbitrariness of judging. Being a mother of three, none of whom is an ice skater, I was mildly interested in the outcome but did feel a sense of justice when the Canadians won. Recently, in two separate instances, it became clear to me just how cruel subjective judging can be and the devastating effects it can have on our youth.\ The first instance came to my attention when a client contacted me over a contract issue concerning ice skating costumes. A costume designer and a skating team were at odds over the bottom line. National competitions for team skating were held in Lake Placid, N.Y., and the designer, rather than pursuing her claim in a court of law, threatened to call certain influential people she knew, including judges, to influence their decision on the team's performance at nationals if she was not paid instantly.\ The second instance occurred on March 2. I have two daughters who are dancers, and both are or have been members of the very competitive and highly successful Lake Zurich High School Pom Squad. Every member of this team has spent endless hours on dirty, wooden floors just to make the squad. Once they make the team, they practice hours a day, three to six days a week, 10 months a year. They are five-time state champions and have never failed to qualify for state. They practice in the cafeteria, which is constantly filled with interruptions because of space and money issues.\ The road to state is a double qualification, which means you must qualify at local competitions and then qualify at super sectionals. Ultimately, last year there was a slight discrepancy between what I have to call an oversensitive Illinois Drill Team Association coordinator and the ""pom parents."" Immediate sanctions were invoked; the girls, who had nothing to do with this, were barred from a competition. We were under the impression that this was behind us.\ On March 2, our girls performed beautifully against some of the largest schools in the state. After they walked off the floor, they were told (by the same judge who had lodged the complaint the year before) that they were in violation of the ""safety pin rule."" Each girl wore a safety pin with only the bar showing to ensure that the elastic they were wearing would stay in place. This is the same safety pin they had worn in several prior competitions and had asked an IDTA judge if the pins were acceptable. If there was a risk of danger or injury, I wonder why IDTA judges would wait until after the girls had performed to tell them. The team was penalized 18 points, which meant that 10 months of work and sacrifice were for naught.\ If the safety pin rule were based on some real concern for safety or if this rule had been uniformly and consistently enforced in the past, I would not be writing this letter. When questioned about the penalty, we were told the team had gotten away with too much. Therefore, an obscure arbitrary rule with unclear definition was invoked as a power play by the IDTA officials at the only competition that could qualify the team for state.\ I must give a disclaimer here and tell you these are unauthorized opinions of a frustrated parent, and I seriously fear retribution. However, I will not be silenced. I urge coaches, athletic directors, the IDTA and judges of every sport to foster a fair, uniform system of judging. This should not be a popularity contest or a way to get even. Like the ice skating team, this dance team has worked harder than you can imagine, and to have their dreams destroyed by an arbitrary and what seems to me to be a vindictive act is cruel and not worthy of sport. Where is Scotty Hamilton when you need him?\ Susan Craven\ Kildeer\ Support for extending Rt. 53 continues to rise\ In the year since Citizens to Protect Quality of Life Through Better Transportation completed the monumental attitudinal survey of Lake County voters on transportation issues, and building Route 53 in Lake County showing overwhelming support (3 to 1), the support has soared.\ One million seventy-four thousand sixty (1,074,060) citizens in the area affected by Route 53 are represented by their municipal resolutions of support for Route 53. There are only two municipal resolutions in opposition, representing 12,737 residents. In both cases, we know not every resident in any municipality either supports or opposes building Route 53, but 67 percent of Lake County voters support building Route 53 and 20 percent oppose. But that was a year ago, and since our survey last spring, support has substantially increased while opposition has decreased.\ The resounding resolutions of support come from 66 villages and cities in Cook, McHenry and Lake counties where building Route 53 will have a substantial impact in relieving gridlock and congestion when these municipal officials realize the positive impact in their communities.\ The Lake County Municipal League, the Northwest Municipal Conference, the Barrington Area Council of Government, the McHenry County Northeast Council of Mayors along with the 13 chambers of commerce, the Cook County Board, the Lake County Board, and the list grows, all support building Route 53.\ In an unscientific poll on its Web site last week, Crain's found that 70 percent of poll respondents said Route 53 should be extended in Lake County.\ Five of the six candidates for governor in the primary election supported building Route 53 in Lake County, one candidate, Roland Burris, did not respond to our survey. It remains to be seen if Jim Ryan or Rod Blagojevich will be present to cut the ribbon.\ The support for building Route 53 is overwhelming, board based and convincing.\ Building Route 53 is the least expensive of all alternatives, including building billions of dollars of mass transit that few would use. Building Route 53 is the least environmentally damaging when you consider the trees cut down, wetlands filled on any road widening plan or homes and businesses destroyed to obtain rights of way for all the roadways. Route 53 will be built in two years once all the plans are completed, which means either Ryan or Blagojevich could dedicate it. The alternatives would take decades.\ The best reason of all to support building Route 53 is it will be built as a tollway and paid for by the users of Route 53. It will not require an income tax, sales tax, gas tax, utility tax, property tax, RTA tax or whatever tax to pay for Route 53. Only those who choose to drive on Route 53 and the tollway will pay for it.\ I do not lose sight of the small, vocal out-of-county objectors financed by the Environment Law and Policy Center who oppose everything and anything that will maintain or improve our quality of life in Lake County. The extremists who are objecting to building Route 53 maintain their influence by pointing out how bad things are, and that everyone else is to blame and no solution will ever make anything better. They keep their simple-minded influence by trying to convince us we can return to the days of yesteryear when we had fewer homes, people, traffic, taxes, schools, etc.\ How naive!\ As a lifelong resident, businessman and community leader, I am very proud of the work of our citizens organization and the overwhelming support we have obtained in securing real support for protecting and improving our quality of life with better transportation.\ Jack L.

For the second straight year, a bill to raise money for cleaning up abandoned hazardous-waste sites in Illinois seemed to be sailing along during the General Assembly's spring session before it foundered in the House.
\
That was a common fate for environmental bills in Springfield, where politicians like to talk about the environment but end up haggling over the crisis du jour: the budget, riverboat gambling, education or all three.
\
Among the other casualties was a tougher vehicle-inspection law required by the federal government. A major restructuring of the state's program to clean up leaking underground storage tanks managed to win approval and waits on Gov. Jim Edgar's desk for his signature.
\
The hazardous-waste measure, the most significant failure among environmental legislation in the spring session, would have raised $8.5 million a year by upping fees on hazardous-waste disposal and garbage dumping. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency needs the funds to begin catching up with a backlog of 105 old waste sites, including the Paxton Lagoon, an old chemical dump on Chicago's Southeast Side.
\
The proposal had a surprising list of backers, or at least of interest groups that did not oppose it. The state EPA, the Edgar administration and the environmental lobby supported an increase in disposal fees, and lobbyists for producers of the waste, including the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, the Illinois Manufacturers' Association and the Chemical Industry Council, did not oppose it.
\
But after passing 57-0 in the Senate, the bill was never called in the House. Steve Brown, spokesman for Speaker Michael Madigan (D-Chicago), said a ""range of people were concerned about it,"" but he refused to identify specific opponents.
\
""The House leadership is apparently playing politics with the public health,"" said Lynne Padovan of the Illinois Environmental Council, which represents the state's environmentalists. ""Why else would this desperately needed package, with bipartisan support, never be called for a vote for two years?""
\
One reason may have been the determined opposition of Waste Management Inc., the Oak Brook-based garbage and hazardous-waste hauler. The company maintains that the increased fees would have fallen unfairly on only two entities: its Chemical Waste Management subsidiary, which has two hazardous-waste incinerators and a hazardous-waste landfill in the state, and Peoria Disposal, which runs a hazardous-waste landfill near Peoria.
\
Disposal fees would have been raised from as low as $6 a ton now to $30 a ton and, with neighboring states offering lower rates, waste producers would have taken their already scarce business elsewhere, said Chemwaste spokesman Bob Reincke.
\
""This bill was not an equitable funding mechanism,"" he said.
\
IEPA Director Mary Gade said another push to pass the bill will be attempted in the fall veto session.
\
The most significant legislation to be passed was a rewriting of the state's law that dictates how leaking underground storage tanks are to be treated.
\
Since 1989, when the law went into effect, the state has steadily fallen behind in reimbursing tank owners for the cost of digging up the tanks, which are generally used to hold gasoline at filling stations or businesses.
\
The number of tank removals-1,625 so far-has overwhelmed the state fund, which is financed by a .3-cent-a-gallon gas tax. Reducing the backlog of unpaid bills while cleaning up the most dangerous leaking tanks will be the dual results of an overhaul of the law, according to Gade.
\
There are 206 tank owners who are waiting for $13 million in reimbursements that the beleaguered state fund cannot pay. Another 900 claims that are awaiting review will add another $60 million, the state estimates.
\
To provide the funds to cover current and future tank cleanups, the General Assembly authorized a $110 million bond issue, to be paid over 20 years with the gas-tax revenue.
\
The new tank program, the result of negotiations between business lobbyists and state officials, also allows the state EPA to rank tanks according to how imminent a threat they pose to groundwater. Leaking tanks over or near groundwater will have the highest priority. Others will be monitored and removed. All old tanks must be removed by 1998 and replaced with modern models that have leak-detection equipment.
\
""Up until now, all sites have been treated equally, whether they pose a risk or not,"" Gade said. ""It's an impossible situation. One of our fears was that we were missing the most serious group of tanks.""
\
Although environmentalists realize the old tank program was cumbersome, Virginia Scott of the Illinois Environmental Council criticized the new one because an advisory council that will draft the regulations to carry out the law consists only of experts and business representatives. There are no members of citizen or environmental groups.
\
""I would say they did not exactly invite environmentalist input on this,"" she said.
\
Another measure that stalled during the session was an expanded vehicle-inspection program, which the state must implement to comply with the 1990 Clean Air Act. New areas of the metropolitan area, including parts of Will, McHenry and Lake Counties, are to be covered by the broader program, which will employ treadmill-like dynamometers to give inspectors more accurate emissions information.
\
The inspection program, part of the state's effort to reduce summer ozone pollution, fell by the wayside as legislators focused their attentions on the state budget. Gade said the program will come up for consideration in the fall session.
\
The state must submit its program to the federal government by Nov. 15 for approval. The beefed-up program will begin in 1995.
\
Two measures that were important to environmentalists did not go their way. They opposed a bill that would stop local governments from regulating pesticides and make it a state responsibility, which environmentalists fear will result in weaker restrictions on lawn-care companies.
\
The bill passed and was sent to the governor, who has yet to sign it.
\
Enviromentalists wanted the legislature to approve a bill that would have ended a preferential deal for incinerators that sell the electricity they produce by burning garbage. Under a 1987 law, utilities are required to pay more than the going rate for the electricity, which environmentalists say encourages incinerator proposals, such as the controversial Robbins project.
\
The bill passed in both houses, but in different forms. The session ended before a single version emerged.
\
""There were some bright spots with some of the freshmen legislators who realize the environment is a top priority with the public,"" said the Sierra Club's Jack Darin, summing up his impression of the spring session. ""But unfortunately, the leadership hasn't recognized that environmental protection is crucial to public health and the economic vitality of the state.""

222,"Current leaders not solving problems\Yes, the distraction is the Trayvon Martin incident, which was a tragedy. Trayvon is gone, but the problems facing the rest of us are still here. People need jobs that the president once promised. Unfortunately full-time jobs are disappearing with the onset of Obamacare. Businesses can't afford the increased requirements of the new health care law. The penalty for not covering workers is cheaper than having them insured. Many jobs are becoming part-time jobs. People will need two part-time jobs to keep the same income level to pay bills. The problem is that they will have no health insurance.\If you like your doctors and insurance coverage, can you keep them? Other scenarios not being discussed are wealth redistribution, increased use of food stamps and the lack of border enforcement. We face extreme danger at the southern border from drug cartels and others, not from Mexicans looking for jobs. One Arab sheik has been looking for someone brave enough to carry anthrax across the border. His claim is that a small container could kill 300,000 Americans. That border is not secure, as proven by Dennis Lynch, who documented that on film (""The Cost of Amnesty"" and ""They Come to America"").\Other discussions should be about where all the money went for those shovel-ready jobs? The green technologies apparently have not been worth the $40 billion spent. What happened to the case of ""Fast and Furious"" gunrunning, where our border patrol agent was killed by one of those guns? We also have investigations into Benghazi where four Americans were killed. I have lost faith in our politicians, and that loss will be reflected in my vote.\Wayne Oras Sr.\Schaumburg\End 'boutiques' to balance gas tax\Concerning the recent editorial about the need for increased gas taxes, the Chicago area has some of the highest gas prices in the nation. On a week-to-week basis if we are not the highest, we are the second highest.\Part of the problem as I see it is the cost of ""boutique blends"", i.e. gasoline blends especially formulated to the specific needs of a major metropolitan area. Several years ago the EPA mandated that gasoline be blended to reduce air pollution and somehow found, or were told, that each metropolitan area's pollution problems were different.\Therefore, the gas blends for Chicago are different from all other major metropolitan areas in the Midwest. It's no secret to see that when something is custom made, the price is higher and this certainly holds true for gasoline. Those municipalities outside of the Chicago collar counties do not have these custom gasoline blends and their prices are much, much lower.\A check of Gas Buddy today shows regular unleaded gasoline in the 60193 ZIP code selling between $3.95 and $4.35 a gallon. By comparison, the same regular unleaded gasoline in Mattoon is selling between $3.47 and $3.51 a gallon. The majority of this price difference can only be attributed to the cost of formulation.\We all want good roads, but there has to be a balance between gas tax revenue, the environment and a consumer's finances. If a higher gas tax is necessary, then so be it. But let's balance the equation by relaxing the need for special gas formulations so the price of a gallon of gas does not go any higher.\Paul M. Lyczak\Schaumburg"
223,"If the price of your favorite latte suddenly went up 5,614% -- say, from $3 to $171.42 -- would you still buy it? Probably not. Unless you really like lattes. \Keep that in mind as you ponder state Sen. Martin Sandoval's plan to raise money for transportation funding in Illinois. The Chicago Democrat's bill includes proposals to more than double the gas tax to 44 cents a gallon, raise the driver's license fee to $60 and the standard vehicle registration fee to $148 ... and raise the yearly registration fee for electric vehicles from the current $17.50 to $1,000.\That's right, $1,000. That's a 5,614% increase. And it's nearly seven times more than the proposed fee for gas-powered vehicles. Sandoval's thinking: Electric vehicle owners don't pay a gas tax, so his stratospheric jump in the electric vehicle registration would make those car owners pay their fair share.\What Sandoval's not thinking about: The massive broadside that his fee would deliver to the electric vehicle market and electric vehicle owners. Far fewer people likely would buy electric vehicles in this state, and people who own them likely would want to unload their EVs.\What he's also not thinking about: The rise in popularity of electric vehicles represents a movement away from our reliance on petroleum -- a movement toward a cleaner, more environment-friendly way of getting around.\Yes, we understand that electricity comes from power plants, and as a rule coal-fired plants aren't environment-friendly. But in comparative terms, nuclear, natural gas, wind and solar power are.\Electric vehicles remain just a sliver of the overall U.S. auto market -- last year, EV sales represented just 2% of total American auto sales. But the market's growing; JPMorgan projects that by 2025, electric vehicle sales will make up 38% of all vehicle sales in the U.S.\The advent of electric vehicles is something to embrace, not discourage.\Sandoval is right to seek new ways to pay for Illinois' crumbling transportation infrastructure. We also like his user-fee orientation: People who heavily use roads should pay for their upkeep accordingly.\But he's way off course when it comes to finding new revenue sources for transportation funding. Raising the gasoline tax makes sense. Charging electric vehicle owners a yearly $1,000 doesn't."

If there ever was any doubt, President Clinton erased it Wednesday: He will not sit on his lead.
\
Clinton demonstrated his aggressive candidacy at a news conference in which he accused Republicans of extremism, congressional gridlock and personal attacks immediately after suggesting they put politics aside for 90 days to reach agreement on a legislative agenda.
\
With a 20-point lead in some public opinion polls, Clinton served notice on his rival, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), that he will give no quarter in responding to every political charge and every political stroke.
\
Clinton portrayed the Republicans as playing politics by tying up bills, as being nasty by attacking him personally and as being harsh on the middle class, the poor, the old, the young, and families with disabled children in their legislation.
\
The White House shows no sign of getting the ""George Bush malady,"" in which the former president sat on a huge lead in 1991 and early 1992, only to see it disappear in an economic downturn.
\
At a time when Dole appeared to be gaining a tactical advantage by supporting repeal of a 4.3 cent gasoline tax, Clinton said he would be glad to sign it if Congress sent the measure to him as a clean, separate bill along with another bill to raise the minimum wage.
\
It was a shift in position for the administration. The White House previously had said the gas tax should not be repealed unless it is part of a measure to achieve a balanced budget.
\
Dole has been pushing a bill that includes the minimum-wage increase, the gas-tax repeal and a measure--sharply opposed by Democrats--that would allow workers to bypass unions and negotiate directly with employers.
\
With Dole's bill tying up the Senate, Clinton made an appearance in the White House briefing room to tell reporters that his proposal would ""break the logjam"" and that the GOP was loading up too many bills with ""poison pills,"" such as the worker provision, which Clinton said undermines worker rights.
\
At his news conference Wednesday, Dole said Clinton ""talks about gridlock and breaking the logjam and poison pills. We think what we've offered is good medicine. It might be hard to swallow but it is good medicine.""
\
Dole suggested that if Clinton wanted to end the impasse in Congress, he should call Democratic leaders Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Senate minority leader, and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), who has pushed to raise the minimum wage.
\
Asked how he could usher in a new era of cooperation with the GOP, Clinton said: ""First of all, you haven't heard me up there condemning the speaker and Sen. Dole in the kind of intense personal terms that they have used.""
\
Clinton apparently was referring to accusations by House Speaker Newt Gingrich that the president had lied by suggesting the GOP wanted to cut the Medicare program, and to Dole's speeches questioning his credibility. On the other hand, the Democratic National Committee has spent millions of dollars in commercials that attack Dole, just as the Republican National Committee is running anti-Clinton ads.
\
Clinton has been an active fundraiser and political critic of Republicans in recent weeks.
\
After raising $2 billion in New Jersey on Tuesday, he attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser Wednesday night where officials expected to raise $11 billion.
\
The president said he wasn't suggesting that he and Dole suspend their campaigns or that Dole and other Republicans refrain from politics. But he added that ""when we have worked together in a bipartisan fashion, we've gotten progress.""
\
In one area, a balanced budget, Republicans on Wednesday presented a fiscal 1997 plan that moved closer to the president's position on taxes and spending.
\
Like their fiscal 1996 version, House and Senate leaders said the new proposal would balance the budget by 2002, cut taxes and trim the growth of Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and other domestic programs--but by less than Republicans sought last year.
\
""It's a very reasonable, very responsible budget,"" Dole said.
\
But White House chief of staff Leon Panetta countered that the spending blueprint ""seems like just more of the same.""
\
""While there are some signs of movement away from the extreme positions they took last year, they are once again calling for unacceptable cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, education and the environment as well as increased taxes on working families,"" he said.

226,"On the first weekday of what could have been ""doomsday"" for transit riders, buses and trains on Monday are running, and breaking down, as they normally do in a bitterly cold January across the Chicago area.\The repeated threats of service cuts are finally silenced, at least for the foreseeable future, which is not plotted very far out.\Fare hikes are on the immediate horizon, starting next month for Metra riders and possibly next year at the Chicago Transit Authority -- in part to pay for Gov. Rod Blagojevich's gift of free rides for life to senior citizens.\While much attention was focused in Illinois last week on whether the General Assembly would approve new state funding to prevent the dismantling of the CTA and Pace bus systems, the future of the nation's transportation system took center stage in Washington.\Officials released a long-awaited study commissioned by Congress that examined all types of ground transportation in the United States, where to invest maintenance and modernization dollars and how to pay for it.\The study, undertaken by public- and private-sector officials over the last two years, called for the biggest expansion of transportation in the U.S. since the interstate highway system was created during the Eisenhower administration.\""Now we have outgrown this system and it is time for new leadership to step up with a vision for the next 50 years,"" said the report, titled ""Transportation for Tomorrow: Report of the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission.""\It said an investment of at least $225 billion annually is needed over the next half-century, in part to accommodate a projected increase in the U.S. population of 150 million over the same period.\""We are spending less than 40 percent of this amount today,"" the study said.\It also recommended narrowing 108 federal surface transportation programs into a list of 10 goals.\They include rebuilding roads, the freight railroad system and urban mass transit; embarking on new efforts to relieve traffic congestion in metropolitan areas; improving connections between smaller cities and rural areas; reducing highway accident deaths; building a fast and reliable intercity passenger rail network; and protecting the environment as well as the nation's energy security.\In addition, the report suggested ways to shave years off the time it takes for design, approval and construction of projects.\But nationally as well as locally, reaching agreement on funding sources represents the often elusive moment of truth.\The widespread expectation among experts and elected officials had been that the report would fine-tune the discussion on setting national transportation policy, leading up to the reauthorization of federal transportation legislation in 2009.\Timing seemed to help the cause of spending more money on upgrading transportation infrastructure. As if to validate the frequent dire warnings over the years about the decay and neglect of American roads and bridges, the Interstate Highway 35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River Aug. 1.\Government critics quickly said, ""We told you so!"" Then last week, the National Transportation Safety Board threw a wrench into that argument. The NTSB released a preliminary report highlighting design issues that might have weakened the structural integrity of the I-35W bridge.\Opponents of tax increases jumped on the issue.\""The work of the NTSB shows further that last summer's knee-jerk reaction to increase the gas tax ... before knowing what caused the collapse made no sense,"" concluded U.S. Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.).\Meanwhile, the Bush administration blasted the transportation study. The administration's key objection was the recommendation to raise the federal gasoline tax, by a total of 40 cents a gallon over the next five years. After that, the tax would be indexed to inflation.\It would be the first hike in the federal gas tax, which is now 18.4 cents per gallon, since 1993.\""Ultimately, the commission report chooses to take the path of higher taxes, more wasteful spending, more congestion and greater pollution,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said Thursday in testimony before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\Peters, who was a member of the commission, declined to sign the report. She submitted a ""minority views statement"" outlining her disagreements over raising the gas tax and the study's recommendations on how responsibility over central planning should be reallocated.\Few people involved in the transportation field expected the study to kick-start any substantive action until after the November presidential election.\The report will be placed on a shelf for now, beside other blue-ribbon panel studies, awaiting the next threat of doomsday, the next bridge collapse or the next call for a national vision to benefit everyone who depends on transportation.\----------\Contact Getting Around at jhilkevitch@tribune.com or c/o the Chicago Tribune, 435 N.

227," Transportation is a vital part of the Illinois economy.\ When it comes to interstate highways, Illinois has the third most interstates in the nation. New York has 31 interstates, while California and Texas both have 25. Illinois comes in third with 24 interstates. There is no question that Illinois, with its location in the center of the country, is a transportation hub in the Midwest.\ Funding our roads and infrastructure is important not just to the Illinois economy, but in the national economy as well. Funding transportation needs, though, should be handled responsibly.\ Unfortunately, Illinois' track record on responsible spending is abysmal.\ Does anyone really trust Springfield politicians to put real priorities over political priorities? We certainly do not.\ The capital plan the House and the Senate approved at the end of the legislative session has very little specifics on where the money is going, while simultaneously doubling the gas tax on poor and middle-class families and raising the license plate renewal by $50 on Illinois drivers.\ Illinois taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent, and legislators who voted for these tax hikes without specifically knowing how the money would be allocated have done a disservice to these taxpayers.\ It is especially discouraging to see many Republican leaders not only vote for these tax increases, but then promote false narratives that are constantly perpetuated by the tax-and-spend Democrats in order to excuse their votes.\ To hear some Republican leaders talk about how we have to raise taxes because Illinois taxpayers don't currently pay enough to cover our spending programs is shocking. These are Democrat talking points, and they are embarrassing. We hear them say, ""We haven't raised the gas tax since 1990."" What they fail to mention is that Illinois taxpayers are already burdened with a gas tax that is top 10 in the nation.\ We are willing to work alongside the Republican leaders as we tackle tough issues in the future, but these kinds of policies were exactly what our voters sent us to Springfield to oppose.\ Illinois taxpayers deserve political leadership that is willing to find solutions that deal with the real underlying issues.\ Watching as our party blindly accepts that raising taxes is the only way forward is an injustice to the taxpayers and constituents that sent us here, and we won't be any part of it.\ As fiscally responsible Republicans, we should be talking about why the state needs such a higher percentage of our money to deal with infrastructure. Why does it cost so much more per mile to build roads and bridges in Illinois compared to many other states?\ Like so often is the case, in Illinois, we suffer under heavy mandates and an adversarial regulatory environment that drives costs upward.\ We have onerous prevailing wage rates, and our taxpayers potentially pay up to five times what taxpayers in neighboring Indiana pay for workers' compensation.\ We should be talking about how Illinois taxpayers are getting robbed by Springfield politicians on behalf of the powerful special interests. Why should more taxpayer dollars be spent to prop up special interests?\ We should be demanding that Springfield prove they can be trusted to deal with the big cost drivers in government. That is the only way to ensure that we are maximizing taxpayer investments.\ Middle-class taxpayers are being forced to pay more because Springfield politicians will not deal with the tough issues.\ The Republican Party is supposed to be the party of fiscal responsibility. If infrastructure is indeed the priority everyone says that it is -- then why are we not budgeting for it every year instead of coming around every decade with a massive spending proposal that is funded by borrowing and tax increases?\ The truth is we can't budget for this every year because the state is saddled with debt from unpaid bills, excessive mandates, job-killing regulations, crushing pension and Medicaid burdens, and record-setting numbers of government taxing bodies. Once we deal with these issues, then we will be able to properly get our funding priorities in line.\ Instead, we hear career politicians opining about how courageous they are to take more of our hard-earned money to pay for their mismanagement and out-of-control spending. We are told that raising taxes is ""a tough but necessary vote.""\ Raising taxes in Illinois is not courageous. It is just business as usual in Illinois.\ Select Republicans may have curried temporary favor with the Springfield special interests with this vote, but it has come at the high cost of losing credibility with the middle-class taxpayers.\ Speaker Madigan, Gov. Pritzker and the special interests can chalk up a big win by getting some Republican leaders to recite their talking points and vote for another tax increase without specific and measurable reforms.\ Once again, Democrats feast like kings while ""Republicans"" are happy begging for the crumbs and the persecuted Illinois taxpayers take yet another uppercut to the gut.\ This op-ed was submitted by Republican Illinois Representatives Blaine Wilhour (Effingham), Brad Halbrook (Shelbyville), David McSweeney (Barrington Hills), Darren Bailey (Xenia), Chris Miller (Oakland), Allen Skillicorn (Crystal Lake), Dan Caulkins (Decatur) and John Cabello (Machesney Park)."

The City of Champaign has a chance to help turn a blighted downtown street corner into a viable economic enterprise.
\
A 2008 fire in downtown Champaign that destroyed the Metropolitan Building was a disastrous setback for redevelopment efforts there.
\
Work was under way to turn that old, majestic building into a residential and commercial showpiece, but it all went up in smoke in a fire whose cause never was officially determined. Left in its place for the past four years has been an unsightly hole in the ground, a grim reminder of what might have been.
\
But it looks as if change for the better is in the offing.
\
City council members this week gave their tentative approval to a plan that would provide up to $3 million in subsidies as part of a nine-story, 150-room hotel project at the corner of Neil and Church Streets. The money would come from property tax revenue generated by a tax increment finance district that's been in place for years as well as reimbursement of city taxes.
\
From a policy standpoint, the city is well advised to approve this plan.
\
It represents a quality development in the downtown location badly in need of improvement. Although the city will pitch in up to $3 million over seven years to encourage the hotel's economic success, the city would have never gained that anticipated income without the hotel's development.
\
This proposal comes under the credo that ""you've got to spend money to make money."" Essentially, it's an investment in the city's future.
\
""This is an opportunity to make something good out of that (fire disaster),"" said City of Champaign Planning Director Bruce Knight.
\
Council members voted to authorize Knight to negotiate a development agreement with hotel developer Hans Grotelueschen, who owns YG Financial Group at 115 W. Church St., C, a site adjacent to the building site.
\
Knight said he hopes to have the negotiations complete ""within a month"" so the council members can give their formal approval. Grotelueschen has indicated that he wishes to begin construction in June and be finished by July 2013.
\
A successful hotel in the downtown would be a terrific addition. It would mean more people, more activity and more tax revenue generated by spending from visitors.
\
This is not a venture without risk. Operating a hotel can be a tricky business, and Grotelueschen still has to reach an agreement with a franchise operator. Knight said three potential franchisers are interested.
\
The goal is to establish an urban hotel in which guests will find their various needs met within walking distance.
\
""We feel pretty good that it will succeed,"" said Knight. ""Visitors want a unique environment.""
\
There are, however, appearance problems that ought not be ignored.
\
Champaign resident Bill Glithero, no doubt, spoke for many at Tuesday's council meeting when he pointed out the inconsistency of the council's recent decision to raise gasoline taxes by 4 cents per gallon followed by another decision to spend up to $3 million to subsidize a hotel development.
\
To many citizens, the council's decision represents profligate spending and indifference to raising taxes to support profligate spending. That the two decisions represent separate issues intended to address separate problems from separate tax funds (tax increment finance funds versus motor fuel tax funds) won't persuade these critics.
\
Feeling that current economic malaise is a poor time to raise taxes, The News-Gazette opposed the recent gas tax increase. But the council decision to approve the tax hike in no way affects our support for the city's role in the hotel project.
\
A successful downtown Champaign would be good not just for downtown, but the entire city, and council members are correct to give it support.

With the Middle East standoff playing havoc with the world oil situation, you might think energy would be a top concern among the American populace.
\
Not so, according to a nationwide survey conducted after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Energy ranks 9th out of 11 issues facing the nation.
\
Only 12 percent of Americans consider energy one of the top three issues facing the country, trailing far behind education, rising health costs, crime, the environment, the deficit, defense and other issues, the management consulting firm Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. found in a survey conducted in August and September.
\
Only trade and transportation ranked lower than energy.
\
The survey also found that few Americans realize how dependent the country is on imported oil, and that most assume economically viable alternative sources simply will appear.
\
The results show the ""American public is complacent and unwilling to sacrifice,"" said Bruce Pasternack, who leads the global energy practice of Booz Allen.
\
Energy's low ranking was a big surprise, Pasternack said, because the survey was conducted during a time of rising energy prices, threats of shortages and fears of war.
\
The firm surveyed 3,600 people and found that most say they don't trust government, electric utilities, oil companies or the media to tell them the truth about energy information. Their most reliable source of information on energy? Environmental groups, according to the survey.
\
Chicagoans were far more mistrustful of energy information coming from utilities than people in New York or Los Angeles, a possible reflection of anger at Commonwealth Edison Co.'s recent string of summer outages in portions of the city, Pasternack said.
\
Seventy-two percent of the people surveyed said they are concerned about possible gasoline shortages, but 78 percent said they would not be willing to pay more than an additional 5 cents in gasoline taxes that was just passed as part of deficit reduction legislation. And 28 percent said they aren't willing to pay any more in gas taxes.
\
Residents of Los Angeles were much more opposed to increases in gasoline taxes than people in New York, where alternative transportation is more avilable. Only 2 percent of Los Angeles residents surveyed would support a 50-cent gas tax hike, compared with 16 percent of New Yorkers.
\
An overwhelming majority believe economically viable alternatives to gasoline will be available by the turn of the century.
\
Seventy-five percent of the electricity generated for home use comes from the two sources-nuclear and coal-that most Americans believe are the most harmful to the environment. Sixty-five percent believe nuclear is harmful and 56 percent said coal is harmful.
"
230," Before voters in the Lake County board's 21st District head to the polls Tuesday, they'll probably have to take part in a rapidly growing American tradition: traffic.\ It's a point not lost on the four candidates - two Democrats and two Republicans - squaring off in the primary election.\ The candidates say they support easing congestion and more funding for Metra and Pace services.\ But, from Route 53 to a new tax to pay for road improvements, there are differences among them, based on interviews with the candidates, public statements and a Daily Herald questionnaire.\ On the Democratic side, Greg Jackson, 40, a political consultant from Buffalo Grove, will face Pam Kerpec, 56, a onetime Mundelein trustee who now lives in southwestern Waukegan and leads the Lake County Soil & Water Conservation District.\ Republican voters will choose between Green Oaks Mayor Tom Adams, a 63-year-old retired insurance executive, and Lincolnshire Trustee Ann Maine, a 43-year-old college biology professor.\ The district includes portions of Riverwoods, Lincolnshire, Buffalo Grove, Bannockburn, Mettawa, Green Oaks, Libertyville and far southwestern Waukegan. It's a newly formed district, the result of the once-a-decade remapping process following the census.\ The boundaries combine much of the current districts of veteran Republican would-be incumbents Martha Marks of Riverwoods and John Schulien of Libertyville, both of whom are not seeking re-election\ Nearly half the major east-west roads, and several major north- south routes, in the county pass through the district.\ Although the county board has limited control over state and federal roads, lobbying for state funds and coordinating local road improvements with state ones are seen by many as keys to loosening traffic clogs.\ One such clog is on Route 22 as it passes through Lincolnshire.\ As Lincolnshire trustee, Maine has fought hard against the state's plan to widen the road to four lanes. Instead, she and other village officials have counterproposed an improvement project that keeps the road two lanes for a mile-long stretch.\ ""There definitely needs to be improvements to Route 22,"" she said. ""What I am opposed to is the state's plan. We're only asking for modifications to their plan.""\ Adams says the plan supported by Maine simply isn't as good as the state's plan, which he supports.\ ""I do take a little issue with my opponent because she's so dead- set against it,"" he said. ""It's clear to me that we need to do something on 22, and so far, the best thing I've seen is the state's approach.""\ The Tenerife subdivision across from Stevenson High School where Jackson lives empties onto Route 22, and he says there is a need for four lanes all the way.\ ""It's important for the whole regional road system,"" he said. ""You hear people say it all the time: The problem isn't going north and south, it's east and west.""\ Kerpec says the county board needs to do a better job of lobbying the state for money to improve such roads - but not the priciest proposition out there, the proposed extension of Route 53 from Lake- Cook Road to Route 120 in Grayslake.\ ""I would impress upon the state legislators to refocus and reallocate money now to improve and widen existing roads and increase rail service as an alternative to completing the costly Route 53 project,"" she said.\ Jackson also opposes Route 53 and Maine describes herself as a ""skeptic,"" each on the grounds that it will cost too much and be too harmful to the environment. Adams has been a longtime supporter of the project.\ All four candidates support a pavement project slated to begin this spring in Green Oaks: The long-awaited expansion of the intersection of St. Mary's Road and Route 176.\ But they agree that new pavement should stop there. None of the candidates support widening St. Mary's to four lanes from Route 60 to Route 137.\ The candidates disagree over one proposal about how to fund road improvements.\ The county board has lobbied the General Assembly to give it permission to ask voters for a .25 percent countywide sales tax hike in a future referendum. If voters want the tax, it would generate between $15 million and $20 million a year to expand county- maintained roads.\ Maine says the referendum is a good idea.\ ""Residents consistently cite traffic congestion as a concern,"" she said. ""This allows voters to decide if the problem is so great that they want to pay for solutions.""\ Adams also supports it, although he says it's not the best approach.\ ""I think a user fee or gas tax is a better solution,"" he said. ""However, this appears to be politically a problem, so I would support the sales tax. I fear opposition to this from business organizations.""\ Kerpec is the most skeptical.\ ""Taxes should be increased only as a last resort, only if all other avenues for funding have been researched,"" she said.\ Jackson says the tax plan may be the only solution.\ ""The (county) board needs the tools to correct this problem, and in this case, it is additional capital,"" he said, adding the state's budget crunch will likely lead to the Springfield revenue stream drying up."
231,"Wrong system\Steve Chapman's column about the No Fly List was right on the mark (""A radical idea for airline security; The government shouldn't decide who can fly,"" Commentary, July 18). If we forget the fact, for a moment, that the No Fly List is a waste of time, it's important to remember that in our country it's fundamentally wrong. We do have the right to travel freely without having to worry that we might be prevented from doing so without ever having committed a crime.\The column makes an essential point that, ""If those on the list are truly dangerous, the government should arrest and prosecute them, with their guilt decided by the courts. If they are not dangerous enough to arrest, they should have the same freedom to travel as everyone else.""\Now for the waste-of-time part: In the fearful environment we live in today, I can see how some people may be fooled into feeling more secure by the fact that they have to show their ID 10 times to get on a plane. But if we're going to subject everyone to such measures, and step on some people's rights while we're at it, why are the airports the only places it's happening? If the TSA swears it works every once in a while, then what about on subways, bridges and trains? Other than the fact that planes seem to be the trendy way to wreak havoc right now, what's the difference between the prospective casualties from a plane crash versus the Brooklyn Bridge at rush hour?\-- Lyndsey Stemm, Chicago\Life without Dad\Half my lifetime with and half without him. Twenty five years ago, my father died. He didn't finish high school, read books, follow sports or ponder the cosmos. What's his legacy? Six kids. His profession was fatherhood. He was a dad, pure and simple.\It could be overwhelming and all-consuming. His first thought in the morning and last at night were his family. He supported us, educated us and set us on the path.\He didn't stay to enjoy all the fruits of his labors: five more grandchildren and the pending birth of his sixth great grandchild.\When I graduated from college and started interviewing for a job, he decided I needed handshake lessons. A girl should have a good handshake, he told me. I had to introduce myself and extend my hand. He would grasp it like a vise grip. I tried to respond in kind. My fingers were numb.\All my training was for naught. No one shook my hand; they patted it. Maybe they were afraid it would hurt. They didn't know I had been trained by the crusher.\He painted the living room, including the brick fireplace, orange. The paint must have been on sale. With a white ceiling, it was like living in a Dreamsicle. Being the late 1960s, when gauche colors were in, my parents found furniture to match. Until a few months ago, the last remaining piece, a gold velvet chair, had survived.\I've heard that your parents never leave you. When I die, my inbox will be full of messages from my parents. I'm hoping for tons of praise and few admonishments. I'll settle for fifty-fifty.\-- Kathy Sullivan, Lisle\Careless walking\As a 23-year Chicago resident, motorcycle rider, bike rider, pedestrian and car driver, I have concerns about the recent letter writer who thinks that the city charging fees of and testing ecologically minded bikers will create a utopia where one can blindly cross streets and exit stores without the basic rule our parents taught us: to look both ways (""Biker lawlessness,"" Voice of the People, July 17). This person walked obliviously into the path of not one but two bikes -- something most of us don't do. Perhaps this person should sign up for a big-city walking course and donate a fee to a worthwhile charity.\-- Steve McCall, Chicago\Laws of the street\It seems that every summer the Tribune publishes several letters of motorists criticizing bicyclists and visa versa. Your newspaper could save a lot of space if it restricted its letters to drivers who never have speeded and to bicyclists who have never coasted through a stop sign. We all need to be a little more tolerant. Nobody obeys all the laws all of the time; everyone could be more careful.\-- Richard Hudson, Chicago\Harassed travelers\I wholeheartedly agree with Steve Chapman, who wrote about what is now required to fly under the name of security. I am an elderly lady, and by the time I have to figure out how to get a little bottle and put in a small amount of what I need, added to the fact that I am completely stymied about where to put my jewelry, I now opt not to fly anywhere.\I have two grandsons who are having ""destination weddings."" I would have to fly both places. Consequently I am not going to either one.\My additional complaint is this: Since I was born and raised in Chicago, have all the necessary IDs, and have a sweet but slightly wrinkled face, when I had to fly a while ago, why did I have to take off my shoes when I can hardly bend down to put them back on?\As Chapman indicates it's time to develop a better protocol and let people fly without all the harassment.\-- Sylvia Bush, Chicago\Other choices?\With all the financial difficulties in the state of Illinois, maybe this would be a refreshing opportunity to do something quite extraordinary. Voters, Democrats and Republicans alike, should admit that we made mistakes in the primaries and have the wrong people on the tickets. It's not the first time we voters have made such mistakes, but why not do something about it?\It is obvious that Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn does not have the political will-power to change our situation in the next four years; too many interests are pulling his strings. Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Brady, on the other hand, has had to dump half of his agenda because it's so ""out there,"" miles from even the right shore of the mainstream.\In the matter of our Senate race, it's just as sad. One candidate has an inability to tell the truth about even the smallest incidents; the other has an unenviable record in his bank dealings and other money matters. Will either of these people reflect well on our state?\So here's a plan: Let's write in four candidates for these two offices, with the stipulation that they not actively run for the offices. They should keep their day jobs until two of them are chosen by the electorate. Sure they should travel about and get on the evening news across the state, but let's not have them amassing war chests.\-- Fred Hadley, Rockford\Raise gas tax\I'm convinced that we should gradually raise the gas tax. It would reduce our consumption and our dependence on foreign oil, and provide funds for developing new energy technologies, repairing our infrastructure and lowering the deficit. Gradually raising the gas tax makes sense if the federal government specifically designates a percentage of the new revenue for these purposes.\-- Tom Minnerick, Elgin\Alternatives to petroleum\The Gulf of Mexico oil spill is a reminder that the United States needs to get serious about developing alternatives to petroleum, not just reducing reliance on foreign oil.\A flawed study from the Congressional Budget Office inflates the costs to taxpayers of support for cellulosic biofuels by claiming they would be produced and used even without current subsidies. But cellulosic biofuels have been unable to attract needed investment during the current economic recession in part because federal support programs have been implemented poorly.\The CBO study fails to mention billions of federal taxpayer dollars that support continued investment in fossil fuels.\Notably the budget tables that the CBO report relies on show more than $1.6 billion in direct payments to support oil exploration, which includes the deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that produced the biggest environmental catastrophe in U.S. history.\With a trillion-dollar deficit, Congress may find it expedient to allow a few billion dollars in biofuels tax credits to lapse.\But Congress should look to the future and redirect federal money to a more serious, concerted effort to help biofuel producers rapidly deploy cellulosic and algae production technology, bridge from first- to next-generation biofuels and bring new advanced biofuels to consumers.\-- Brent Erickson, executive vice president, Biotechnology Industry Organization, Washington\Cost of elections\This is in response to ""Quinn pushing for open primaries; Governor using veto to try to spur voting law change"" (News, July 14).\I have a better idea for the manner in which political parties choose their candidates.\Let them pay for it themselves, either through caucuses, conventions or self-financed elections.\Neither the U.S. nor the Illinois Constitution mandates such publically financed elections.\What we are doing is, in effect, subsidizing private entities.\The state is deep enough in debt as it is without this waste of taxpayer dollars.\-- Harry Byrd, Naperville\----------\VOICE OF THE PEOPLE\For online exclusive letters please visit chicagotribune.com/letters.

232,"On the January day that George Ryan was sworn in as governor, he warned new U.S. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert that he and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley were ""going to be in Washington, D.C., to pick your pocket on occasion.""\The first occasion will occur later this month.\Ryan and Daley are tentatively scheduled to travel together to Washington on March 11 to deliver to the state's congressional delegation a generic wish list for more federal money for transportation, education and social services.\""There has to be some money for mass transit,"" Daley said Tuesday. ""You can't put everybody in a car. It's just impossible to put more and more people in cars. . . . All the rush hours are backing up earlier and earlier and that affects the economy, it affects the environment.""\Daley said it was better ""politically and governmentally"" for him and Ryan to travel together because many issues, like transportation, affect both the city and the state.\The trip is another example of the relationship between the new Republican governor and the Democratic mayor, which is in sharp contrast to the way Daley and former Gov. Jim Edgar treated each other during Edgar's eight years in office.\Even though Edgar left office almost two months ago, Daley continued to criticize him Tuesday, noting that one of the first things Edgar did when he took office in 1991 was eliminate an $8 million state subsidy for the CTA.\""That was kind of a message that he really didn't care for mass transit in the city of Chicago,"" Daley said.\Aides to Ryan said the governor was working with the mayor's office to push an agenda to find ways to increase the return of federal money to the state for highways, mass transit, schools and a host of social programs.\During his gubernatorial campaign, Ryan made no secret of his desire to increase the flow of federal money to Illinois, which has routinely ranked near the bottom among states in receiving tax money from Washington.\Last month, during the Washington meeting of the National Governors' Association, Ryan convened a reception with the chiefs of staff of the state's 20 U.S. representatives and two senators to establish lines of communication between the state and its congressional delegation.\And state agencies under Ryan's control have begun reviewing programs that would require the state to put up money to gain matching federal funds. Edgar's cost-conscious administration shied away from those types of programs, which traditionally involved social service funding.\Ryan and Daley each see a financial opportunity for state and city governments because of the growing clout of the Illinois congressional delegation's members. Besides the ascension of Hastert, a Yorkville Republican, to the speaker's post, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and new U.S. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.) is a member of the Republican majority in the Senate.\Still, Hastert has warned Illinois officials not to expect a flood of federally funded pork-barrel projects to come to the state as a result of his new post. And some officials believe it will be difficult for Illinois to try to bypass or reopen federal law for distributing funds for highways and bridges.\But Daley said the state's deteriorating transportation system needs to be addressed.\""(Ryan) knows he has a problem,"" Daley said. ""Illinois is the worst in funding for education and the worst for funding in mass transit and highways.""\And Daley again declined to say whether a state gasoline-tax increase was needed to help pay for transportation improvements. The mayor, who originally supported a gas-tax hike, backed away from that position when Ryan indicated his opposition to an increase.\Daley appeared to diminish expectations of what the new governor could accomplish.\""George Ryan is not a miracle man,"" Daley said. ""We've elected him because we were just in the doldrums for eight years."""
233,"
A BTU tax with heavy hidden costs In calling for a broad-based energy tax, President Clinton hoped to achieve the policy equivalent of a four-cushion pool shot: raise revenues for deficit reduction and help the environment without impeding the fragile economic recovery or upsetting voters.
\
Without question, taxing the heat content of fuels, as Clinton has proposed, would generate significant new revenues-$71.4 billion over four years. Higher energy prices also would promote conservation and reduce pollution. The White House says, for example, that oil usage would decline about 2 percent by the year 2000.
\
But when there's growing concern about job creation, economic growth and the competitiveness of American manufacturers, it is highly risky to drive up production costs for energy-intensive industries and farmers. And it could depress consumer spending to raise energy prices for homeowners and motorists.
\
The benefits of the energy tax have to be carefully calibrated against its potential downside. The danger is that the tax might slow growth and add to inflation. If companies can't pass along higher energy costs, it also might lower profits and destroy jobs. It could be especially onerous to agriculture, steel, airlines, autos and chemicals-industries vital to the Midwest's economy.
\
During the presidential campaign, many people, including Ross Perot, advocated raising the federal gasoline tax. Clinton opposed the idea because a gas tax is a special burden to people-particularly in western states-who frequently must drive long distances.
\
Still, the idea of taxing energy to raise revenues and promote conservation, even a small amount, was appealing. So the administration settled on an excise tax based on the heat content of fuels measured in British thermal units (BTUs) or the equivalent. (A BTU is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.)
\
A BTU tax spreads the burden more evenly and broadly than a targeted gasoline tax. It has additional political allure because it's largely a ""hidden"" levy whose indirect costs are scattered through the production process and are less visible.
\
In order to level regional impacts, Clinton would tax coal, natural gas, nuclear power and hydropower at 26 cents per million BTUs; the levy for oil would be 60 cents for every million BTUs.
\
Clinton says the tax would add $17 a month in energy costs for a family of four earning $40,000 a year. And to make sure higher energy prices don't hurt the poor, he would spend more on the Earned Income Tax Credit, food stamps and heating assistance.
\
But Clinton understates the effect of the tax by focusing only on its direct costs. When inflation and other indirect costs are added, the tab for a middle-class family becomes more like $35 to $40 per month.
\
The impact on production will be consequential. Farmers estimate they'll pay $600 million more a year in taxes, steelmakers about $400 million and chemical manufacturers about $1.15 billion. At least some of those added costs will be passed onto consumers.
\
There is no risk-free way to raise the revenues that will be needed to lower the deficit. The question on the BTU tax is not unlike the one that must be asked of Clinton's economic package as a whole: Do the benefits justify the potential costs?
"
234,"
""Desert Storm"" may have been the official title of the campaign to liberate Kuwait and its 500 oil wells, but unofficially it was dubbed ""The First Oil Crusade"" by the troops.
\
""We are here because of the failure of our country's energy policy,"" remarked an officer of the 197th Mechanized Infantry Brigade as we stood in the blazing sun at the port of Damman, Saudi Arabia, watching his outfit's armored vehicles drive ashore. That was in the buildup phase, in the fall of 1990.
\
Among his gripes: the resurgent popularity of eight-cylinder engines in American autos.
\
Why not? Unleaded regular gasoline that sells for $1.19 a gallon in this area is cheaper than the $2.84 price for a gallon of major-brand soda pop. Unlike cola, ever more of the crude oil for gasoline is imported.
\
""We are losing control of our destiny,"" declared Joseph Romm, a scientist at Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think-tank in Snowmass, Colo. For details, read his book out this month, ""The Once and Future Superpower,"" where Romm makes a strong case that energy, the environment and jobs are not in conflict. It's a myth that hazards all three, he asserts.
\
You get the short version of his thesis here. In a telephone interview, Romm said that before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the U.S. was importing about 2 million barrels of oil daily from the Persian Gulf.
\
""In the seven months prior to the gulf war our total imports (worldwide) reached 50 percent of consumption, the highest ever,"" he said.
\
Today, America imports about 1.8 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf, and its overall dependency on foreign crude is a shade over 50 percent.
\
The annual fuel bill is about $45 billion, about $10 billion of which flows to the princes of Araby. They live in palaces veneered with marble on the outside, while potholes here have become the jarring symbol of a nation deep in hock.
\
Under the Bush energy strategy, America's dependence on foreign oil grows to around 60 percent by the end of this decade. This could be ""best case.""
\
""The Bush plan assumes that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (in Alaska) is open for exploration and that oil is found,"" Romm said.
\
If so, the imported-energy bill grows less slowly, to ""only"" $80 billion a year in scarce capital siphoned out of the country. For the total diversion of resources, add another $60 billion per annum for the cost of military forces earmarked for Persian Gulf contingencies.
\
""It is a grotesquely inefficient strategy,"" said Romm.
\
If we think of America as a person with a heart condition, the plan is to ream out the arteries every so often to keep the pipelines open, but the patient is never urged to change his diet.
\
In fact, all talk of an energy diet has been dropped. Romm pointed out that in February 1991, then-Secretary of State James Baker highlighted the need for reduced American dependence on foreign oil among the five big challenges he saw for the postwar new order.
\
In President Bush's victory speech to Congress a month later, he listed just four post-gulf-war challenges.
\
Romm said, ""The fifth challenge-reducing energy dependence-had quietly vanished.""
\
We must begin somewhere, and Romm suggested a gas tax of 25 cents a gallon to encourage conservation and fuel efficiency. Income taxes could be slackened to compensate. Romm's proposal seems positively modest compared to the dollar-a-gallon hike suggested by a recent Carnegie Endowment agenda, pointedly titled ""Changing Our Ways,"" to stimulate greater energy productivity.
\
Productivity includes wasting less. For example, Romm said the Energy Department could establish School Energy Banks to fund energy retrofits. He cited the case of the Iowa school district that recently invested $44,000 in energy improvements and saved $23,000 the first year-enough money to hire another teacher.
\
Government-funded research could be accelerated to develop more energy-efficient appliances, machines and autos. That could stimulate private capital, where a $1 million investment to manufacture these products would generate nine jobs, compared to 1.4 jobs for the same money invested in the oil and gas industry, Romm estimated.
\
The extra tax money paid at the pump stays here, funding the re-establishment of American scientific and manufacturing leadership, which in 1980 led the world in every renewable energy technology, and now leads in none. Zero, according to Romm.
\
Absent such steps, the price of soda pop relative to gasoline suggests that Americans value caffeine more than energy security, and they're prepared to fight the Second Oil Crusade to prove it.
"
235," State tollway officials enjoying rare glad tidings\ Plans to raze the Deerfield toll plaza are drawing smiles from many commuters.\ These newly discovered warm feelings toward the state Toll Authority, however, may not run much deeper.\ A poll of drivers and elected officials suggests that most consider the proposal at most a first step down a long and winding road to recovery.\ The Toll Authority's long tradition of gaffs and bad publicity is still far too fresh in the minds of many. Earlier this year alone, the former executive director of the tollway was convicted of theft, and it took a ruling from a federal judge to block a proposed North- South tollway extension that critics said would have damaged the environment.\ But tollway officials point to a number of reforms implemented in recent years, claiming much of the good they are doing is going unrecognized.\ Asked about a plan to get rid of the Deerfield toll plaza, commuter Barry Ferguson smiled and gave a thumbs-up, adding, ""You can quote me on that.""\ News that the toll plaza might be scrapped put smiles on the faces of a lot of drivers Wednesday. The rare good publicity for the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, however, may not extend much beyond that.\ A sampling of drivers and politicians found consensus that the proposal is only one step toward alleviating what they consider a huge headache in getting around the Chicago area.\ ""It's certainly a good PR move for them,"" State Rep. Lauren Beth Gash said. ""It's also good policy. That doesn't mean they're doing right in every other area of concern.""\ Some lawmakers, like Gash, are still hungry to sink their teeth into the budget of the tollways.\ ""One is not related to the other,"" Gash emphasized. The tollway has a history of bad publicity to overcome. Just this year: - The former executive director of the tollway, Robert Hickman, was convicted of theft and official misconduct on charges he got the tollway to pay $240,000 for an unnecessary land sale fee. Most of the bogus commission, $190,000, went to his friend, state Rep. Joseph Kotlarz.\ - A wide variety of reforms were proposed by state lawmakers, but got nowhere, attributed in part to opposition by Senate Republican leader James ""Pate"" Philip of Wood Dale.\ - The tollway also shelled out $30,000 in drivers' coins for a glossy annual report, $130,000 for the use of a high-tech pothole finder to check road conditions, and $100,000 for a recommendation that its administrators be paid more.\ More importantly, a federal judge in January blocked a planned extension of the North-South Tollway into Will County. The judge ordered more extensive analysis of the environmental impact of the roadway.\ To cap it off, another judge in June gave until Dec. 15 for tollway spending to be overseen by state lawmakers.\ Any 300-mile system that serves one million vehicles daily and collects nearly $300 million a year is bound to make some enemies. Tollway administrators say they've made a number of reforms in recent years, including the elimination of double pensions, implementing a code of ethics and expanding its internal audits.\ They also boast of other well-received changes: - Night repaving of I-88 to avoid traffic jams in the day.\ - Numerous meetings to improve communication with lawmakers and the public.\ - Completed installation of electronic I-PASS toll collection at all toll plazas by the end of next year.\ As for the welcome given the Deerfield plan, tollway spokesman David Loveday said, ""The only thing it can do is help.""\ ""In the past, we might've said, 'We're going to do what we want,' "" Loveday conceded. ""Clearly, this is a step in the right direction. It's because we're listening.""\ Nevertheless, the tollway is appealing the court orders threatening its budget and the I-355 extension.\ And rather than appeasing critics, the end of the Deerfield plaza shows what can be done.\ ""You never know with the General Assembly,"" said Rob Michaels, attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center in Chicago. ""But when you put this positive PR in the context of the general frustration people are feeling with this agency, this would whet the appetite of the public for more comprehensive reforms.""\ The ultimate goal, Michaels said, is to return the tollway to its original duty of eliminating tolls.\ A random sampling of tollway users found great support for dropping the hated Deerfield toll.\ Motorists were generally willing to pay for the roads, but wanted a better means of doing so.\ Several called for tolls to be paid at on- or off-ramps, rather than stopping all traffic at plazas. Others said they would gladly pay a gas tax rather than tolls.\ Still others complained that Illinois is dragging its feet toward getting electronic toll collection, which about a dozen other states are doing, some since 1989.\ New York City and Florida, for example, have attracted hundreds of thousands of drivers who pay electronically, while in Illinois there are only 37,000. Electronic toll collection can let through 1,800 cars an hour, rather than about 500 an hour with manual booths and coin baskets.\ Mike Davis, who works in sales and was visiting from Houston, offered an outsider's view.\ ""These are the least expensive but most numerous toll booths I've ever seen,"" he said. ""I would rather pay one larger toll.""\ ""The fewer tolls the better,"" agreed Rich Nolan, a Wheaton sales manager. ""Don't abolish them, but get a more efficient system.""\ The tollways had at least one staunch defender among the driving public. One 38-year-old woman from Bolingbrook, who declined to giver her name, called I-355 ""a great tollway.""\ ""I live on that tollway,"" she said. ""You save a lot of time and gas. The toll systems are really good."""
236,"The generally decayed and decaying condition of Illinois roads is evident to anyone who uses them, and without more transportation revenue, it’s clear things are only going to get worse. Finding that revenue, of course, is the challenge.\The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning offered some alternatives in a release last week, including an increase in the gasoline sales tax and a test of a tax based on how much of the roadway a vehicle uses.

The letters section has been overflowing with complaints about high gasoline prices. Local politicians are demanding that Gov. Blagojevich authorize a gas tax holiday, and the editors have thrown their support behind this misguided idea.
\
Adjusting for inflation, the price of gas remains below its historic peak, and the gas tax is still too low to cover the true environmental and social costs of our addiction to oil.
\
We have the technology necessary to transform our economy from one based on the dirty and inefficient technologies to cleaner energy sources. But our leaders lack the vision to facilitate the needed changes.
\
Maybe a few oil price spikes will precipitate a free-market solution to the problem. There are some encouraging signs. Japanese- built hybrid cars are selling like hotcakes, and Detroit has belatedly begun to take notice. More people are parking their sport utility vehicles and walking, biking, or discovering the convenience of our much-maligned MTD. If such trends continue, we'll have a cleaner environment, healthier lifestyles and fewer body bags returning from the Middle East.
\
Let's quit whining and view the high price of gas for what it really is - a blessing in disguise.

242,"Tax hike for public transit is justified\My friends, we have to fix the transit/transportation mess in Chicagoland and unfortunately it will cost money - ours. We need transit for our economy to thrive. It is both effective and efficient and costs less in time, environmental impact, lives and dollars than our current reliance on auto-based sprawl. Letting our current imperfect but workable transit system go under will cost lots in the long run.\What about a gas tax dedicated to transit? I know, nobody wants to pay more for gas. That strategy was proposed and rejected as too costly when gas cost 30 cents per gallon. Yet we are already paying $3 per gallon and could soon pay more, totally at the mercy of the oil giants. Also consider that Europeans pay about $5 per gallon.\The fact is that we have been subsidizing gas prices. We don't pay at the pump for the environmental and health costs of burning fossil fuels or for the two naval fleets it takes to protect our imported oil supply or the thousands of lives and over $1 trillion for the Iraq war (at least partly started over oil).\For just our northeastern Illinois area, I want to propose a gradual change that will allow us to finance and improve our transit system, which would provide an alternative to the auto and which would move us toward freedom from the oil exporters.\Why not start with a small amount, such as 5 cents per gallon, and raise the rate every six months until we have enough to support transit on an ongoing basis? We would still need to decide how best to save and improve our transit system, but we would have a workable funding solution.\Dan Bailey\Wheaton\Coming together to help environment\Ms. Elizabeth Pearson's letter to the editor (Dec. 29, 2007) in which she raised concerns about global warming and the role of government in its alleviation, got me thinking how magnificently people have come together, often taking action through their governments, in order to correct damage we have caused the environment.\In the more recent past, the USA, in conjunction with other nations, eliminated the use of CFC's in the use of refrigerants and as manufacturing cleaning agents in order to remove the threat these CFC's posed to the ozone layer. In the decades of the 60s and 70s, government action through the Environmental Protection Agency cleaned the air and waters of America from the pollution caused by private companies depositing their chemical and metal wastes directly into the air, lakes and rivers.\Many decades ago, the New Deal government of Franklin D. Roosevelt planted millions of trees from Wisconsin to Georgia where private interests had denuded the landscape, allowing massive erosion of farmland.\In addition to saving the environment from destruction, government educates our children and provides for the retirement income of ourselves and our parents.\God willing, Ms. Pearson, the USA will within a year or two join with other nations of the world to reduce the release of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide gases which are warming the planet to dangerous and destructive levels. Most of this work will be accomplished through the auspices of the United Nations, the one world body which has brought people together from all countries to suppress and counter our worse tendencies of selfishness and destructiveness.\Man has always had control over the earth's demise, and fortunately its advancement.\Tom Teune\Wheaton"
243,"Cryptic roadside signs atop rusting yellow poles throughout central Lake County for decades have marked more than the potential route of a new highway.\The ""FAP 342 ROW"" signs are reminders of conflict over the proposed extension of Route 53 north 12.5 miles from Lake-Cook Road in Long Grove -- an emotional battle between those who fear its effect on natural areas and those who embrace it as a way to improve transportation and grow the economy.\Traffic congestion has worsened significantly during the half century since the notion of a major route into central Lake County first surfaced.\Suburbs grew without the ability of existing roads to keep up.\Advocates say an extended Route 53 and improved Route 120 would carry a maximum traffic volume of 62,000 vehicles per day by 2040 -- about the same as now travel on I-94 north of Great America. A trip from Grayslake to Schaumburg would take 68 minutes with the road, compared to 98 minutes without it, according to estimates.\On the other side of the coin is Lake County's strong sense of environmental stewardship. The natural areas are what attract many of those who call it home.\A Route 53 advisory panel in 2012 noted Lake County has the greatest number of unique and threatened natural resources, including lakes, wetlands and native prairie remnants, of any county in Illinois. Historically, that has been a rallying point for environmentalists and conservation groups.\But a make-or-break decision is in the works with a new proposal that hinges on balancing the interests of environmental protection, transportation access and economic development.\""This is our last best chance. We've gotten further with this project than any of the other efforts,"" said Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor, co-chairman of the Route 53/120 Project Blue Ribbon Advisory Council.\After generations of often bitter debate, such cautious optimism is due, in part, to a more transparent and inclusive planning approach than in the past. It has led to recommendations that include a host of road design innovations and other measures to protect the environment.\Support comes from a new alliance that has engaged traditional opponents in the planning. Their support, though, hinges entirely on whether long-sought protections for natural areas are financed and followed.\Construction of the one-of-a-kind toll road would forever change the landscape of central Lake County as it crosses sensitive environmental areas and likely leads to development of thousands of new homes and millions of square feet of businesses.\It would mean families along Harrison Avenue in Mundelein's Cambridge Country subdivision -- and other neighborhoods along the road corridor -- could see their view of open spaces beyond backyard fences disappear.\""It's quiet. That's why we like it,"" said Virginia Biegel, whose family of five moved to Cambridge Country nearly two years ago. She said it's hard to envision the road, and she isn't sure if her family would move if it is approved.\Others potentially could lose more than a view.\""It goes straight through the house,"" said Helga Ziegler, who with her husband, Josef, built a home in 1973. They operate an apple orchard on 16 acres between Bacon and Cedar Lake roads south of Route 120 near Grayslake. ""We had people who wanted to buy it, but when they find out ... "" Josef added.\Many hurdles remain before officials will know if this project has a future. Specifics, such as how and precisely where it will be built, will begin to emerge only if the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority board decides, possibly next year, to proceed with a more detailed study for a 4-lane, limited-access, 45 mph parkway.\There are plenty of challenges: how to pay the $2.35 billion to $2.65 billion tab, whether environmental protections are to be followed, and how to control the expected ripple effect of development.\Will the groups studying financing and land uses find acceptable answers? That depends on whether all parties are satisfied the end result is fair and sustainable.\Recommendations for financing are expected to be ready for the tollway board to consider early next year and for land uses possibly by late 2015.\Tollway leaders say they are committed to advancing the project but warn it must be in line with principles created for the rest of the tollway system: shared local cost, consensus and political support.\""We have no interest in building a road people don't want,"" said Paula Wolff, chairwoman of the tollway board.\Funding\The project is envisioned with a smaller footprint than traditional highways to minimize environmental effects. It would extend north 12.5 miles from Lake-Cook Road in Long Grove to south of Route 120 in Grayslake, where it would split east and west. The split would bypass Route 120 from east of Route 45 to west of Route 134 or west of Fairfield Road. This top of the ""T"" would stretch 12 miles from near Route 12 in Volo to I-94 in Waukegan.\A 300-foot-wide corridor was defined long ago, and the Illinois Department of Transportation has acquired about two-thirds of the needed right of way. IDOT made its last land purchase in 2011, acquiring 886 acres for $48.3 million.\While the exact configuration is not final, swaths of vacant land splitting subdivisions are evident at various points along the route.\The immediate need is for funding because tolls on the new road won't be enough. There is an estimated gap as large as $2.4 billion that must be closed by other sources.\Suggestions include a 4-cent-per-gallon Lake County gas tax to be split between the project and other local transportation needs, and a large special financing district. Both would require state legislation to establish. New or higher tolls on I-94 in Lake County, and congestion pricing and annual toll increases as a potential test program for the entire tollway system are being considered.\Cash-strapped Illinois is expected to be asked to make a big contribution, such as land already acquired.\The special financing district would encompass property within a mile of the road and two miles from intersections. Taxing bodies, such as school districts, would get 75 percent of property taxes from any new nonresidential development. The working group that studied the option suggests the other 25 percent be used for a long-term environmental stewardship fund to help mitigate possible effects of the extension.\""We felt this was a very politically acceptable approach to go with this. We know that with the road, there will be a significant amount of commercial and industrial development,"" said Mundelein Mayor Steve Lentz, who headed the group.\The local contribution has to be significant enough -- perhaps up to 20 percent of the overall cost -- for the project to move forward.\Cost-sharing has become standard for big tollway projects, beginning with the I-355 extension in DuPage County, and most recently the $3.4 billion Elgin-O'Hare western access spanning Elmhurst, Bensenville and other communities in DuPage and Cook counties that included a $300 million local commitment.\Participants say Route 53/120 could become a national model of how major road projects are selected and built. As such, this effort has a different feel compared to previous attempts because local officials are shaping the project and providing suggestions for funding.\Long Grove, which used to budget funds annually to fight Route 53, is among the longtime opponents now participating in the project.\""If the road is going to go through, let's not put blinders on (but) make sure the concerns are heard and taken seriously,"" Village President Angie Underwood said.\Environmental concerns\Lake County is considered especially vulnerable to disruptions from a new road, so environmental interests are demanding costly features intended to make it fit the landscape and protect natural resources.\The guide for the ongoing research and discussion is a 109-page report crafted by a diverse volunteer panel of community leaders, environmentalists, planners and others appointed by the tollway authority. In May 2012, after nine months of study, the advisory council recommended pursuit of the roadway.\So far, that alliance has held. How environmental requirements are funded and how closely they are followed are among the challenges to continued agreement.\""I would say it's still fragile. They (environmentalists) are still watching closely,"" said George Ranney, co-chairman of the advisory panel. ""They're waiting for the first shoe to drop to see if the recommendations aren't followed.""\Hawthorn Woods Village President Joe Mancino said village officials see the potential traffic and economic benefits but are wary of to-be-determined specifics of design and alignment through his town.\""If it is done exactly like that (advisory) committee envisions it, the environmental stakeholders will go along,"" Mancino said.\Design innovations, such as building portions of the road below grade to block noise or elevated sections through wetlands, are meant to protect those areas.\The total cost of all innovations -- beyond those of tollway policy or state and federal requirements -- stands at $325 million to $400 million.\Some $81 million of that is the environmental stewardship fund, a nonnegotiable part of the recommendation, officials say. It would protect and enhance the natural resources within 2 miles of the roadway, protect and restore at least 750 acres beyond, deal with any unintended consequences and provide oversight for 50 years. Specifics have yet to be determined.\""They're not going to throw pavement through the middle of a wetland and call it a day,"" Lake County Administrator Barry Burton said.\Spurring development?\It's clear that construction of a Route 53/120 extension would trigger big changes by stimulating and unlocking business and residential development. If not coordinated, traffic on existing roads would increase dramatically and damage ecological areas, say those involved in the process.\Skeptics contend new commuters and shoppers will flood local roads and spoil the area's character.\""The small traffic relief expected will then be erased as tens of thousands of new commuters and shoppers crowd into Lake County's open space, clogging local roads that access the new tollway and spoiling the rural character we all love,"" said Evan Craig, chairman of the Sierra Club Wood and Wetlands Group.\Because a new road alone won't solve traffic congestion, the panel called for a land use plan and strategy for the corridor. The study area extends 2 miles from the road, or about a quarter of the size of Lake County. It is proceeding separately but in tandem with the groups studying financing.\The purpose is to work with corridor communities to plan in a way that blends land uses, transportation, economic development and open space, said Jason Navota, principal with the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which is coordinating that aspect.\Part of the work will be to identify areas likely to undergo significant change because of development, and important natural areas that merit special attention. The objective is to outline a broad land use strategy and specific plans for about a dozen areas expected to change because of the road.\Participants in the land use study say that for the traffic and economic benefits to last, communities must change their approach to development. If not, the problems the 53/120 project aims to solve could resurface.\How or if that can be accomplished remains to be seen. Plans of the corridor communities collectively are out of scale with the road design and call for much more development than is feasible, said Lawlor, co-chairman of the land use committee. If the corridor is developed based on municipal plans, 6,868 acres of agricultural land and 9,160 acres of open space would be lost, preliminary data show.\Communities farther from the road will want to protect their investments; those closer will want to parlay the advantage. Still, the land can only hold so much.\""We want this road to be successful so if we allow unrestricted development along the corridor and dump all those cars (onto adjoining roads), 53 won't be successful,"" Lawlor said.\Coming Monday: The stories of people along the possible route\See Road on Page 4\Cryptic roadside signs atop rusting yellow poles throughout central Lake County for decades have marked more than the potential route of a new highway.\The ""FAP 342 ROW"" signs are reminders of conflict over the proposed extension of Route 53 north 12.5 miles from Lake-Cook Road in Long Grove -- an emotional battle between those who fear its effect on natural areas and those who embrace it as a way to improve transportation and grow the economy.\Traffic congestion has worsened significantly during the half century since the notion of a major route into central Lake County first surfaced.

Specifics, such as how and precisely where it will be built, will begin to emerge only if the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority board decides, possibly next year, to proceed with a more detailed study for a 4-lane, limited-access, 45 mph parkway.\There are plenty of challenges: how to pay the $2.35 billion to $2.65 billion tab, whether environmental protections are to be followed, and how to control the expected ripple effect of development.\Will the groups studying financing and land uses find acceptable answers? That depends on whether all parties are satisfied the end result is fair and sustainable.\Recommendations for financing are expected to be ready for the tollway board to consider early next year and for land uses possibly by late 2015.\Tollway leaders say they are committed to advancing the project but warn it must be in line with principles created for the rest of the tollway system: shared local cost, consensus and political support.\""We have no interest in building a road people don't want,"" said Paula Wolff, chairwoman of the tollway board.\Funding\The project is envisioned with a smaller footprint than traditional highways to minimize environmental effects. It would extend north 12.5 miles from Lake-Cook Road in Long Grove to south of Route 120 in Grayslake, where it would split east and west. The split would bypass Route 120 from east of Route 45 to west of Route 134 or west of Fairfield Road. This top of the ""T"" would stretch 12 miles from near Route 12 in Volo to I-94 in Waukegan.\A 300-foot-wide corridor was defined long ago, and the Illinois Department of Transportation has acquired about two-thirds of the needed right of way. IDOT made its last land purchase in 2011, acquiring 886 acres for $48.3 million.\While the exact configuration is not final, swaths of vacant land splitting subdivisions are evident at various points along the route.\The immediate need is for funding because tolls on the new road won't be enough. There is an estimated gap as large as $2.4 billion that must be closed by other sources.\Suggestions include a 4-cent-per-gallon Lake County gas tax to be split between the project and other local transportation needs, and a large special financing district. Both would require state legislation to establish. New or higher tolls on I-94 in Lake County, and congestion pricing and annual toll increases as a potential test program for the entire tollway system are being considered.\Cash-strapped Illinois is expected to be asked to make a big contribution, such as land already acquired.\The special financing district would encompass property within a mile of the road and two miles from intersections. Taxing bodies, such as school districts, would get 75 percent of property taxes from any new nonresidential development. The working group that studied the option suggests the other 25 percent be used for a long-term environmental stewardship fund to help mitigate possible effects of the extension.\""We felt this was a very politically acceptable approach to go with this. We know that with the road, there will be a significant amount of commercial and industrial development,"" said Mundelein Mayor Steve Lentz, who headed the group.\The local contribution has to be significant enough -- perhaps up to 20 percent of the overall cost -- for the project to move forward.\Cost-sharing has become standard for big tollway projects, beginning with the I-355 extension in DuPage County, and most recently the $3.4 billion Elgin-O'Hare western access spanning Elmhurst, Bensenville and other communities in DuPage and Cook counties that included a $300 million local commitment.\Participants say Route 53/120 could become a national model of how major road projects are selected and built. As such, this effort has a different feel compared to previous attempts because local officials are shaping the project and providing suggestions for funding.\Long Grove, which used to budget funds annually to fight Route 53, is among the longtime opponents now participating in the project.\""If the road is going to go through, let's not put blinders on (but) make sure the concerns are heard and taken seriously,"" Village President Angie Underwood said.\Environmental woes\Lake County is considered especially vulnerable to disruptions from a new road, so environmental interests are demanding costly features intended to make it fit the landscape and protect natural resources.\The guide for the ongoing research and discussion is a 109-page report crafted by a diverse volunteer panel of community leaders, environmentalists, planners and others appointed by the tollway authority. In May 2012, after nine months of study, the advisory council recommended pursuit of the roadway.\So far, that alliance has held. How environmental requirements are funded and how closely they are followed are among the challenges to continued agreement.\""I would say it's still fragile. They (environmentalists) are still watching closely,"" said George Ranney, co-chairman of the advisory panel. ""They're waiting for the first shoe to drop to see if the recommendations aren't followed.""\Hawthorn Woods Village President Joe Mancino said village officials see the potential traffic and economic benefits but are wary of to-be-determined specifics of design and alignment through his town.\""If it is done exactly like that (advisory) committee envisions it, the environmental stakeholders will go along,"" Mancino said.\Design innovations, such as building portions of the road below grade to block noise or elevated sections through wetlands, are meant to protect those areas.\The total cost of all innovations -- beyond those of tollway policy or state and federal requirements -- stands at $325 million to $400 million.\Some $81 million of that is the environmental stewardship fund, a nonnegotiable part of the recommendation, officials say. It would protect and enhance the natural resources within 2 miles of the roadway, protect and restore at least 750 acres beyond, deal with any unintended consequences and provide oversight for 50 years. Specifics have yet to be determined.\""They're not going to throw pavement through the middle of a wetland and call it a day,"" Lake County Administrator Barry Burton said.\Spur development?\It's clear that construction of a Route 53/120 extension would trigger big changes by stimulating and unlocking business and residential development. If not coordinated, traffic on existing roads would increase dramatically and damage ecological areas, say those involved in the process.\Skeptics contend new commuters and shoppers will flood local roads and spoil the area's character.\""The small traffic relief expected will then be erased as tens of thousands of new commuters and shoppers crowd into Lake County's open space, clogging local roads that access the new tollway and spoiling the rural character we all love,"" said Evan Craig, chairman of the Sierra Club Wood and Wetlands Group.\Because a new road alone won't solve traffic congestion, the panel called for a land use plan and strategy for the corridor. The study area extends 2 miles from the road, or about a quarter of the size of Lake County. It is proceeding separately but in tandem with the groups studying financing.\The purpose is to work with corridor communities to plan in a way that blends land uses, transportation, economic development and open space, said Jason Navota, principal with the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which is coordinating that aspect.\Part of the work will be to identify areas likely to undergo significant change because of development, and important natural areas that merit special attention. The objective is to outline a broad land use strategy and specific plans for about a dozen areas expected to change because of the road.\Participants in the land use study say that for the traffic and economic benefits to last, communities must change their approach to development. If not, the problems the 53/120 project aims to solve could resurface.\How or if that can be accomplished remains to be seen. Plans of the corridor communities collectively are out of scale with the road design and call for much more development than is feasible, said Lawlor, co-chairman of the land use committee. If the corridor is developed based on municipal plans, 6,868 acres of agricultural land and 9,160 acres of open space would be lost, preliminary data show.\Communities farther from the road will want to protect their investments; those closer will want to parlay the advantage. Still, the land can only hold so much.\""We want this road to be successful so if we allow unrestricted development along the corridor and dump all those cars (onto adjoining roads), 53 won't be successful,"" Lawlor said.\Continued from Page 1\Credit: First of a two-part series By Mick Zawislak mzawislak@dailyherald.com First of a two-part series By Mick Zawislak mzawislak@dailyherald.com"
244," Chicago aldermen Thursday urged their constituents to take advantage of programs designed to soften the impact of soaring natural gas bills, at the same time leveling new criticism at Peoples Energy.\ Meanwhile, administration officials acknowledged the city treasury is expected to collect at least $81 million from the 8 percent city tax on gas bills this year, up from $63 million in 2000, as political activist Pat Quinn called on Mayor Richard Daley to suspend collection of the tax through April ""to extend a helping hand"" to beleaguered consumers.\ Ald. Ginger Rugai (19th), chairman of the City Council's Committee on Energy, Environmental Protection and Public Utilities, joined eight of her colleagues at a City Hall news conference to encourage homeowners to enroll in Peoples' budget plan to spread out the skyrocketing cost of heating this winter.\ They also urged low- and moderate-income families to seek grants under federal and local assistance programs.\ As the city pressures Peoples for relief on other fronts, ""We want to reiterate the action [consumers] can take right now,"" Rugai said.\ Rugai's committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on rising prices next Tuesday when City Council members are expected to put hard questions to Peoples officials.\ At Thursday's press conference, the aldermen took shots at the company on several fronts, saying consumers seeking information are subjected to busy signals and long waits on ""hold."" They also accused Peoples of ""changing policies in the middle of the season"" by readjusting the amount budget plan customers must pay as often as every month.\ Over the last six months, Peoples has increased the number of customer service operators by a third, said Desiree Rogers, a company spokesman. But 300 patrons a week are being enrolled in the budget plan, and many others are calling to inquire about assistance programs, she said.\ ""Those calls take time,"" she said. ""We ask customers to be patient.""\ Rogers denied any midstream policy changes on the budget plan, saying the required payments are changed whenever costs rise by at least 25 percent. Under more typical conditions, adjustments sometimes are needed on a quarterly basis, she said. But with sharply rising prices, they now take place monthly in some cases.\ To hit a customer with a ""huge bill"" at settlement time at the end of the 12-month budget period would be ""irresponsible,"" Rogers said.\ Despite Quinn's call for a suspension of the city's gas tax, city officials denied any windfall. They insisted Thursday additional revenues collected this year will be needed to pay the increased cost of heating city buildings and to cover the cost of winter-related services, from snow plowing to city workers who check on the well- being of senior citizens.\ ""Every dollar that comes into the city will go back out to the citizens for cold weather assistance,"" said city Environment Commissioner William Abolt. Abolt said that Daley will introduce a proposal to the City Council next week that would add $2.75 million to a $5.5 million city fund that provides grants to help qualified homeowners replace old furnaces and make other energy-efficient improvements to their properties.\ The higher-than-expected gas tax revenues could go even higher if actual collections outstrip original projections for the final nine months of 2001."
245,"It's not often that races for the Lake County Board produce the kind of heated accusations about incumbent board members that are making their way around the County Building in Waukegan this year.\For instance, a maverick Republican member of the board was recently accused in a not-so-quiet whisper campaign of shoving a regular GOP member of the board during a confrontation in the women's washroom.\Speculation is rampant that former board chairman Robert W. Depke of Gurnee is working behind the scenes to oust any incumbent board member who ever disagreed with him--even though he's been in Florida most of this winter.\Maverick Republicans are accusing the ""machine"" members of their party of supporting their pro-development challengers and of conducting stealth-like telephone campaigns to gauge public opinion on a number of issues.\""They (the regular Republicans) don't even know what the issues are and how people feel, so they need to survey to figure out what their campaign platforms are going to be,"" said incumbent Carol Calabresa (R-Libertyville), a leader of the mavericks who has two challengers in the March 17 primary.\There's good reason, though, that this year's board races would be generating the type of hype and gossip that's normally left to the politicians on Capitol Hill.\Fourteen of the board's 23 sitting members are up for re-election. A 15th seat on the Republican-controlled board is open due to the departure of 12-year board member Robert P. Neal of Wadsworth.\The 14 incumbents are seeking re-election to four-year terms at a crucial time in the board's history.\Decisions to be made as early as next year are whether the county will increase its existing sales tax by a quarter-cent to pay for housing a burgeoning jail population.\The County Board also wants to adopt a new zoning ordinance that will control the pace and type of development expected to occur in Lake County for years to come.\The issue of whether to institute a 4-cent gas tax increase to help pay for road improvements also could take on new life, as more and more people move to Lake County.\And in 2000, the County Board will review its district boundaries to reflect the new population figures supplied by the U.S. Census Bureau. Redistricting is often used by those in power to increase their clout.\Although the general election is not until November, winning the GOP primary in Lake County is usually tantamount to winning the seat outright because of the strength of the local Republican Party.\The GOP is so strong, in fact, that many of the GOP winners in the March primary won't even face any Democratic Party opposition in the fall general election.\An exception to that rule this year is in Waukegan-based District 8, where incumbent Republican Jim Stanczak has no opposition in March but will face Democratic candidate Robert Sabonjian Jr. in November. Sabonjian, the son of Waukegan's longtime mayor of the same name, also is without opposition in the primary.\Besides Stanczak, only two of the remaining nine Republican incumbents up for re-election are unopposed in the primary. They are Finance Committee Chairman David Stolman of Buffalo Grove and Planning and Zoning Committee Chairman Pamela Newton of Vernon Hills.\Of the remaining seven GOP board members seeking re-election, six are considered pro-environment incumbents who frequently clash with their GOP board colleagues on such hot-button issues as development, transportation and the environment.\To many of the ""regulars"" on the board, though, the mavericks represent nothing more than obstructionists who have cried wolf one too many times.\""I just have a feeling the public is being hoodwinked,"" Stolman said. ""They're always claiming everything is Bob Depke's fault. But Depke hasn't been involved in county government for months. And the sky isn't falling on every issue, and they're not victims.\""The reality is they're being questioned about their loyalty to the Republican Party. There's evidence they've supported Democratic candidates in the past. If they're Republicans, then they should be helping Republicans' efforts, because that's why they got elected.""\Calabresa, however, and her fellow mavericks believe they are more in tune with the wishes of Lake County residents, who two years ago ousted Depke and two of his key pro-development allies on the board.\""Hopefully, the voters will continue to say that they want to take back control of our local government and that they don't want the home builders controlling it,"" she said.\The mavericks also are hoping they can add a pro-environment member to their ranks in District 2, where Neal's retirement has sparked a three-way race between Larry Jones, a real estate agent endorsed by Neal; Betty Rae Kaiser, Neal's former campaign manager; and political newcomer Loretta McCarley, who has the endorsement of local conservation groups.\Three Democrats do have primary opposition. The incumbents are Angelo Kyle of Waukegan, who chairs the Law and Judicial Committee; Audrey Nixon of North Chicago, who chairs the Forest Preserve District's Finance Committee; and Debra Halas of Waukegan, who chairs the Health and Human Services Committee.\The challengers say the incumbents have become too closely aligned with the regular Republicans.\Meanwhile, Robert Buhai (D-Highland Park) is unopposed."
246," As Chicago area motorists face rising gasoline prices and the prospect of a second consecutive summer of budget-busting highs, the Daley administration on Tuesday called on consumers to strike back.\ Top aides to Mayor Richard Daley avoided using the word ""boycott,"" but their advice to Chicagoans was clear: Get the attention of the big oil companies by depending less on cars and more on public transportation, bicycles and even shoe leather.\ ""There are options that Chicagoans can use to reduce their reliance on gasoline to keep money in their pockets and to send a clear, strong message to gasoline producers,"" declared city Environment Commissioner William Abolt. ""We have to do something about reducing demand for the product.""\ Meanwhile, Daley on Tuesday sent a letter to President Bush questioning the reason for skyrocketing prices and asking for federal help to bring them down.\ An industry survey of 8,000 U.S. service stations found that prices in Chicago rose faster than anywhere else in the country over the last few weeks, jumping 23 cents a gallon.\ Prices here averaged $1.86 a gallon Monday, according to the American Automobile Association.\ As she visited a Chicago station Tuesday, Dena Pavlopoulos said it now costs $50 to fill the tank of her Range Rover sport utility vehicle.\ ""I think everybody is disgusted,"" declared Pavlopoulos, 34, who said she plans to get a more fuel efficient car when the lease on the Range Rover expires.\ Gas prices ""are already at high rates that we saw in the middle of the summer last year,"" Abolt said at a press conference at a Chicago Transit Authority rail station in the Loop. ""Given this dramatic rise and given the fact people are still reeling from the outrageous prices of natural gas this winter, Mayor Daley is very concerned about the toll another season of high energy prices will have on Chicagoans and on the economy.""\ But there was no indication that Daley is considering direct relief to consumers by lowering the city's nickel-a-gallon tax on gas.\ When gasoline prices climbed steeply a year ago, he squelched a proposal by one alderman who called for a temporary reduction in the city's tax to a penny a gallon.\ ""We are not focused on the gas tax,"" Abolt said Tuesday. ""The gas tax has not changed. It is cents on the gallon.""\ What has changed dramatically are prices charged by gasoline producers and zooming earnings of oil companies, Abolt asserted.\ On Monday, Exxon Mobil Corp. reported a $5 billion first quarter profit, up more than 40 percent from the year-earlier total.\ Higher prices could prompt people to try the alternate modes of transportation touted by city officials, said Andre Shakom, 27, an avid bicyclist.\ ""There's no reason to drive a car in the city because of the excellent [alternate] transportation,"" Shakom said during a stop at Rapid Transit, a bicycle shop at 1900 W. North Ave.\ But no matter what happens with gas prices, some people simply will be forced to cope and keep driving.\ Natic Akinbiyi, a veteran cabdriver, said he now works more than 14 hours a day to cover increased costs.\ ""Before the rise in prices, I used to fill up for $18 to $20,"" he said. ""Now it's up to $30 or $35. It's really cutting my profit."""
247,"Top Democratic congressional leaders cast aside a brewing showdown over presidential oversight Monday and pitched President Donald Trump on a ""big and bold"" infrastructure bill ahead of a White House meeting on the issue, insisting there are ""significant majorities in both the House and Senate"" ready to act. \House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are set to meet Trump on Tuesday, joined by other leading Democrats. In a letter sent Monday, the pair asked Trump to entertain infrastructure legislation with ""substantial, new and real revenue"" -- as opposed to previous GOP plans that have focused on using smaller amounts of public money to leverage private investments. They did not specify a dollar figure for the package, though many have discussed $1 trillion as a bare minimum.\Paying for such an investment is the major challenge, and potential revenue sources all carry political risks. Lawmakers from both parties have discussed increasing the federal gas tax for the first time since 1993, but Democrats are eyeing a rollback of the Republican tax cuts that Trump signed in 2017.\A Democratic official close to Schumer said the Senate leader would not consider a gas tax hike -- which would be a disproportionate burden on working-class voters -- unless Republicans consider undoing some of their tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity.\""We look forward to hearing your ideas on how to pay for this package to ensure that it is big and bold enough to meet our country's needs,"" the leaders wrote to Trump on Monday.\Pelosi and Schumer also said any infrastructure bill must address ""clean energy and resiliency priorities"" and expand ""beyond transportation and into broadband, water, energy, schools, housing and other initiatives."" They also call for ""strong Buy America, labor, and women, veteran and minority-owned business protections.""\The Democratic leaders' emphasis on bipartisanship comes at a time when relations between the White House and congressional Democrats could hardly be worse, with Trump determined to resist virtually every effort on Capitol Hill to investigate and check his administration. For instance, Attorney General William Barr's scheduled testimony this week before the House Judiciary Committee is in question amid a dispute over the format of the hearing.\But Pelosi and Schumer have insisted on making legislative entreaties to Trump -- particularly on the issues of infrastructure and prescription drug pricing, where they see a path to a bipartisan deal.\Regarding infrastructure, the two wrote Monday: ""This bipartisanship is a reflection of the American people's recognition of the need to rebuild our infrastructure to promote commerce, create jobs, advance public health with clean air and clean water, and make our transportation systems safer -- indeed, to improve the quality of life of all Americans.""\Reversing any part of the 2017 tax law could be a red line for Trump and congressional Republicans, who consider the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the crowning legislative accomplishment of the administration. Undoing the cuts, some fear, could undermine a strong economy.\Democrats, meanwhile, see that revenue as crucial to any deal, and any Republican willingness to engage in that conversation stands to be an early indicator of whether Tuesday's talks are fruitful.\White House officials on Monday played down the prospect of a breakthrough at the meeting.\Press secretary Sarah Sanders suggested the meeting could touch on topics far afield from infrastructure.\""Look, the primary purpose of that meeting is to discuss infrastructure, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised at all if immigration comes up,"" she said on Fox News. ""It's a major problem in this country, and so far Democrats have refused to acknowledge it and address it.""\The House Democrats expected to join Pelosi at the meeting include Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland; Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina; Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico; Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio of Oregon; and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts.\The Senate Democrats set to join Schumer are Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois; Assistant Minority Leader Patty Murray of Washington; Democratic Policy and Communications Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan; Thomas Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee; and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.\CAPTION: Photo: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are set to meet with President Trump on Tuesday.

248,"After four years of fiscal austerity and the pro-business, anti-union agenda of former Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, Illinois lawmakers took a sharp turn to the left during the just-completed legislative session, passing a budget with more than $1 billion in new spending and a host of new social policies.\Those social policies include raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, legalizing recreational marijuana and sports gambling and declaring access to reproductive health services, including abortion, a ""fundamental right.""\""This one has been unlike any I’ve ever served in,"" Rep. Michael Zalewski, a Democrat from Riverside, said during an interview in the final days of the session. ""Both in action and the substance of the issues, and the importance of the issues, this has been the craziest session I’ve ever been a part of.""\Although many of the initiatives enacted this session were debated for years in Illinois, most observers credit first-year Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker for pushing them through. Pritzker had help from Democratic supermajorities in both chambers of the General Assembly — majorities that resulted from a ""wave"" in the 2018 election that changed the course of Illinois politics.\Christopher Mooney, who teaches state politics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said Illinois has always been something of an outlier in the Midwest.\""We have a different kind of economy,"" he said. ""We have Chicago as basically a third of the state, and if you count the metro area, it’s basically two-thirds of the state.""\Rauner’s election in 2012, Mooney said, was largely the result of the unpopularity of his predecessor, Democrat Pat Quinn. He added that much of Rauner’s true conservative character was not revealed to voters until after he took office in 2013.\For Republicans in the General Assembly, the 2019 session was anything but a cause for celebration.\""The last four years under Gov. Rauner, we were able to stop some things because we had more seats,"" said Rep. Tony McCombie, a Republican from Savanna who is heading up the House Republicans’ 2020 election strategy. ""And they had to have conversations with Republicans, and that’s the most important thing.\""I believe that that really upset them, that they lost a little bit of control, and they really are showing us and reminding us who they are, what their agenda is, and they’re really giving it to us.""\Here is a summary of the major legislation that passed this spring: Budget The rookie governor achieved bipartisan support for his first operating budget, accomplishing in six months what it took Rauner nearly two years to achieve.\The budget spends just over $40 billion, increases K-12 education funding by $375 million, raises higher education funding by 5 percent and adds $567 million to human service agencies decimated by Rauner’s cuts.\The bill also makes the state’s full $8.4 billion statutorily-mandated pension payment and increases funding for the beleaguered Department of Children and Family Services budget by $100 million.\Graduated income tax Pritzker’s marquee campaign proposal — changing Illinois’ constitution to allow the General Assembly to tax higher income earners at higher amounts — will be on the 2020 November election ballot.\The governor also signed a rate structure proposal that would take effect upon the amendment’s approval by voters.\That structure would bring in an estimated $3.5 billion while lowering taxes on those earning less than $250,000 and raising the rates on those making more than that amount.\Sixty percent of those voting on the question or the majority of those voting in the election must support the change for it to become law.\Capital plan Lawmakers approved the state’s first capital infrastructure plan in over a decade.\The plan will invest $45 billion in Illinois’ infrastructure, with $33.2 billion for transportation, $3.5 billion for schools, $4.3 billion for state facilities, $1.2 billion for environment and conservation, $420 million for broadband deployment, $465 million for health care and human services, and $1.9 billion for economic and community development.\The plan is funded by a variety of new taxes and fees.\Gas tax, fees Beginning July 1, the state’s gas tax will double to 38 cents and the diesel fuel tax will get bumped 5 cents to 45.5 cents.\For cars and passenger trucks, registration fees will go from $101 to $151 beginning Jan. 1, 2020, while electric vehicles will be charged a $248 registration annual fee, up from $35 every two years.\Other title fees will go from $95 to $150, while motor home registrations will cost $250.\Registration fees for certain buses, trucks and trailers will increase by $100.\Abortion rights The Reproductive Health Act, which repeals and replaces Illinois’ current abortion law, was a source of controversy this session, but it ultimately gained approval from both chambers.\Supporters and critics agree it would make Illinois one of the most progressive states with regards to abortion rights.\Recreational marijuana Those over age 21 will be able to purchase and smoke marijuana recreationally beginning Jan. 1.\The measure includes expungement language for those affected by the war on drugs and allows for several new grow and retailer licenses over the life of the program, which could bring in $500 million annually when fully matured.\CREDIT: By Peter Hancock, Jerry Nowicki, Rebecca Ansel and Grant Morgan"
249,"SPRINGFIELD — Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers, business leaders and labor representatives in Springfield Friday as he signed a package of bills enacting a $45 billion statewide infrastructure plan in one of four stops on a tour of Illinois.\Pritzker stood in front of the state capital’s historic Lincoln Depot as he defended a 19-cent per-gallon increase to the state’s motor fuel tax while highlighting the economic and employment benefits of the massive construction plan.\He said the six-year capital plan could create 540,000 jobs while investing in roads, bridges, railways, universities, early childhood centers, a state crime lab and veterans homes, among others.\""With these investments, we’re creating and supporting hundreds of thousands of new jobs in our state,"" Pritzker said. ""This is more than an infrastructure plan. This is a job cre ation plan the likes of which our state has never seen.""\House Bill 62, the infrastructure plan dubbed by Pritzker as ""Rebuild Illinois,"" allocates $33.2 billion for transportation, including $11 billion for the Illinois Department of Transportation’s multiyear plan and $14 billion for other road and bridge projects. It also includes $4.7 billion for mass transit, $1 billion for passenger rail and millions for ports, aeronautics and other projects.\Higher education will see $2.9 billion in infrastructure spending while K-12 and early childhood education will see a combined $526 million.\State Sen. Andy Manar, a Democrat from downstate Bunker Hill, co-chaired a series of statewide committee hearings leading up to the passage of the bill. He said those meetings showed the need for an infrastructure plan.\""Every community that we heard from — both urban and rural, conservative and liberal — every single community told us their story of crumbling infrastructure and told us in very clear terms that it was time for us to act,"" he said.\Pritzker said all of Illinois will benefit from the plan as he defended a portion that dedicates about $6 million to each Democratic state senator for projects in their districts, compared to $3 million for each Republican senator. Democrats and Republicans in the House would each see about half those amounts respectively.\""The fact is that a majority of the funding in the infrastructure bill goes to downstate Illinois,"" Pritzker said. ""Universities around the state are mostly, almost entirely, in districts represented by Republicans. And that’s where hundreds of millions of dollars, in fact billions when you add it all up, are going to. The money is getting distributed I think very fairly across the state.""\Pritzker also touted a statewide expansion of broadband internet infrastructure which will receive $420 million in funding.\""When big swathes of our state have no high speed internet, we miss the opportunity for new businesses and jobs in areas of the state that badly need it,"" he said.\The plan additionally allocates $4.4 billion to deferred maintenance at state facilities and $1 billion on environment and conservation projects for hazardous waste, sewer and park projects among others. Health care and human services will see $465 million in funding for affordable housing, hospitals, health centers and other grant programs.\Another $1.8 billion is allocated to various ""community and economic development"" projects such as education and scientific facilities and projects in economically depressed areas. Another $50 million provided by the funding bill will be set aside for bicycle path projects.\Mark Denzler, president of the Illinois Manufacturer’s Association, touted career and technical education measures such as a pre-apprenticeship program that will receive $25 million in funding to ""help address the skills gap and workforce challenges facing manufacturers across Illinois.""\Revenues for the capital plan come from a pair of bills — Senate Bills 690 and 1939 — one raising the motor fuel tax and transportation-related vehicle fees, the other enacting a massive expansion of gambling in the state.\The gaming bill — which allows for six new casinos, expansion of gambling at racetracks, added video gaming machines, higher taxes and maximum bets on video gaming machines and the legalization of sports gambling — is expected to generate at least $350 million annually at full implementation and will support vertical capital debt service.\Upfront revenues from license fees would fund ""pay as you go"" projects. Other revenue would be generated by a $1 per-pack increase to the state’s cigarette tax and a new tax on electronic cigarettes.\Senate Bill 1939 doubles the motor fuel tax to 38 cents to generate $1.3 billion in annual new revenue; increases title fees from $95 to $150 for regular titles and from $95 to $250 for mobile homes; and increases annual registration fees from $101 to $151. Electric vehicle registration fees will increase from $34 every two years to $251 annually.\The title and registration fee increases are expected to generate $529 million in new annual state revenue.\While the gas tax hike had a strong bipartisan roll call in each chamber of the General Assembly and Pritzker said the increase will fund projects that will help drivers save money on vehicle maintenance, not everyone was on board with the change.\State Rep. David McSweeney, a Barrington Hills Republican, said in a statement the governor’s signature on the plan marked ""a bad day for Illinois.""\""Doubling the gas tax and increasing vehicle registration fees will hurt Illinois’ low income and middle income families and kill jobs that have been created by small businesses,"" he said.\CREDIT: BY Jerry nowicki capitol news illinois"

252,"The race for Illinois governor took an unusual turn recently when paying for maintaining the state's highways actually found its way into the debate. \One candidate's ad accuses his opponent of planning a mileage-based fee for use of the road system. Whether this was proposed or opposed by either candidate, the idea of charging directly for the use of the roads is a pretty good one for at least three reasons: We've massively underfunded transportation infrastructure in Illinois for decades; the current gas tax won't cut it; and mileage-based fees are more fair for all road users.\The first thing to be clear about is that the roads we use every day aren't free. We've just created a system that makes us think they are free, and the public, by and large, has accepted the ruse. We pay for building and maintaining highways through taxes on all that gasoline we put into our cars. In Illinois, the gasoline tax is now 19 cents per gallon (21.5 cents for diesel fuel) -- a tax rate that hasn't changed since 1990. And there's a federal excise tax, 18.4 cents a gallon (24.4 cents for diesel), also dedicated to surface transportation, that was last increased in 1993! (Ryne Sandberg, who turned 59 on Sept. 18, was the Cubs' big star in 1990.) Consumer prices have gone up by almost a factor of 2 since then. The Illinois Economic Policy Institute reports that total revenue collected from our state's fuel tax started to decline in 2007, a trend that has continued every year since.\That's because our cars have become much more energy-efficient, allowing us to pay less for each mile we drive. The fleet average fuel economy (all cars, SUVs and light trucks) has increased 18 percent over the past 28 years; new car fuel economy has gone up by 35 percent. At the new car rate of 38 miles per gallon, you are now paying Illinois a half cent per mile to use the roads; combined with federal fuel taxes, you are paying about a penny per mile. In 1990 you were paying 36 percent more per mile. More recently, the hybrid fleet has grown rapidly, and there are a growing number of electric vehicles on the road. That's great for the environment, but those drivers in battery-powered cars aren't paying anything to use Illinois roads. For them it really is free.\It costs money, and lots of it, to maintain the roads -- to fix the bridges, resurface highways and fill the potholes. And the older the infrastructure gets, the faster the burn rate of that ever-declining pot of maintenance money. It is not just a question of fixing what we already have. That fuel tax money also goes to relieving bottlenecks and adding to roadway capacity. Some of it supports mass transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, whose users pay nothing for the roads.\One solution to the shortfall is to raise the motor fuel tax. In the past five years alone, more than half the states have increased fuel taxes to ensure that they have the transportation infrastructure necessary to compete in the global economy. Still, that is a short-run approach, because fewer and fewer vehicles will depend on liquid fuels as we move to all -- or mostly -- electric fleets. In the long run, a better option is to replace the fuel tax with a mileage-based fee, a charge for the use of the road network based on miles driven: Pay for what you use.\But won't we need to track your vehicle to do this? Yes, and there is a lot of vehicle tracking going on right now, and most of us have accepted it with little or no pushback.\The overwhelmingly favorable response to open road tolling by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority and tolling agencies across the country shows that tracking vehicle movements to assess charges is acceptable and can be done accurately and securely. There are thousands of video cameras watching the streets and parking lots in our major cities. Remember the 10 o'clock news stories about surveillance videos used to track criminals? They can track your car too. And through your smartphone, Waze, Google, INRIX and even Amazon all know where you are and where you've been.\We can protect privacy with a road user fee system, recording only distance driven by highway type and time of day, and dumping those data periodically after computing your road use fee. The mileage charge would replace the motor fuel tax, not sit on top of it.\But be forewarned -- it is likely to grow over time, something the gas tax should have done all along if our political leaders were honest with us about the true cost of providing transportation infrastructure. Those mileage fees would be fair -- pay for what you use -- and fees collected on busy roads would show decision-makers where the market is and where new investments may be needed.\In Illinois, it has been just one more issue, or nonissue, in a heated race for governor. But when serious discussion begins, remember that a mileage-based road user fee is not a new charge for what had been free. It is a different, better and more efficient way to pay for what we have been secretly charging you for at least 90 years. The inescapable fact, testified to by crumbling bridges and congested highways, is that drivers have not been paying the true cost for their roads. There is no such thing as a free highway, and there are better ways to pay for them.\This scheme probably seems pretty radical -- especially if that's a Tesla, Leaf or Volt in your driveway. But it would be familiar to people in Oregon, California, Minnesota, Nevada or Delaware, where experimentation with mileage-based road user fee systems is underway or under study.\Do not be misled by myths that promise to eliminate the need for us to pay for transportation infrastructure: Self-driving cars will still need roads. Private-sector investments to pay for our transportation infrastructure are indeed investments. The banks, bondholders and equity partners are in the game for the money. They want it back, with some profit. Where does that money come from? Us, the road users, train riders and taxpayers. Paying by the mile simply makes good sense.\----------\Joseph L.

253,"There is little dispute across our nation that we have infrastructure needs that must be met. What should be included when we talk of infrastructure? The very definition in the Cambridge Dictionary is ""The basic systems and services that are needed to support an economy."" There are examples of physical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and transportation and utilities systems. There are examples of social infrastructure: schools, hospitals and housing. The Biden Administration has proposed improvements in both physical and social infrastructures in its expansive American Jobs Plan, which proposes investments of over $2 trillion in many areas of our economy.\The Biden plan includes around $621 billion for transportation, including roads, bridges, ports, mass transit and electric vehicle charging stations. Improved drinking water systems, power grids and broadband internet access is included for $111 billion. There is $300 billion targeted for manufacturers and small businesses, including access to financing and clean energy investment and critical goods like semiconductor manufacturing. Funding for home- and community-based care for the elderly and disabled is included for $400 billion; $213 billion is slated for creating and improving and more than 2 million units of public housing. Workforce training is included in the plan for $100 billion, and upgrading public schools for another $100 billion. Those are the largest proposals in the plan, and all investments will create countless jobs.\There are those on the other side of the aisle who would prefer to see a more restrictive approach, focusing on a more limited physical infrastructure. They initially suggested an investment of about a quarter of the Biden proposal. The president has met with leaders from both sides of the aisle in hopes of trying to garner support for a bipartisan approach. It is quite obvious that getting something as comprehensive as the president has proposed is not going to happen on a bipartisan basis — even if there is significant movement.\The President has noted that politics is the art of the possible, and also stressed that doing nothing on the Jobs Plan Infrastructure proposal is neither an option nor acceptable. He appears to be receptive to trying to get implementation by dividing his plans into two parts: one part to get as much as he can on a bipartisan approach if he can get significant movement, and pushing for the remainder through reconciliation.\Such an approach will serve the country well if he can get the Republicans to include a package that covers close to half his proposal, and if he can keep all segments of the Democratic side united to pass the remainder through reconciliation. The Republicans need to accept a more expansive approach than they are used to. They need to realize that things like expanded broadband are critical, and all parts of the country should have access to the internet. Likewise, getting rid of lead pipes and having a safe water system is essential to ensuring healthy communities for all, even though such projects have not been part of infrastructure projects in the past. There needs to be realization that having a viable, thriving electric vehicle capacity is key not only to the environment, but also to remaining competitive in the world economy where China is producing millions of electric vehicles already.\Similarly, we need the R and D and manufacturing support for things such as semiconductor chips, which are essential for so much of what we need in todays economy. It is a good sign that Mitch McConnell just said that Republicans could accept a package as high as $800 billion. When it comes time to pass the social components of infrastructure that are not likely to get into any bipartisan bill, or any aspects of our infrastructure needs that can’t get approved in a bipartisan bill, the Democrats must stand together to ensure all of these needs are met. The American people want to see results. Let’s not let them down.\There remains a stumbling block, regardless on how the proposals are funded. The president has proposed that the best approach is to have the Trump Corporate tax reduction of 35% to 21% partially reversed — getting back up to 28% — and changing the tax code for corporations that shift profits and jobs overseas to ensure they will be required to pay a minimum tax and not continue dodging them. The Republicans want to keep the corporate tax reduction and want to see an alternate approach to financing, including user fees such as the gas tax. Even on the Democratic side, Sen. Joe Manchin and others think the corporate tax increase could be lower — closer to 25%.\The president does not like the idea of the gas tax since it will be, in effect, a tax increase.\Others have suggested that significant dollars could be generated by strengthening our program on uncollected taxes. It has been suggested that could bring in as much as $700 billion. The payment approach is where there needs to be compromise by all, including the President. There needs to be a mix of these various approaches. New concepts like a vehicles miles travel tax needs to be in the mix in terms of user fees, especially as we see a promoted shift to electric vehicles. The change to stop tax avoidance by those multinationals who are shifting profits and jobs offshore should be in place for fundamental tax fairness, as should going after tax collection from those who rightfully owe taxes. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, while arguing for the Jobs Plan before the Chamber of Commerce, noted that the US has not maintained its infrastructure nor modernized it and that the proposed investments along with tax changes as a package would enhance profitability and competitiveness of American corporations and create jobs.\The fact that earmarks are back on the table should also help to get infrastructure bills passed, since legislators will be able to demonstrate tangible benefits to their constituents. Of course they need to be meaningful projects, but such give-and-take in the political process need not be a bad thing as long as impactful legislation can be facilitated through the process. The bottom line is there needs to be give-and-take on all aspects of needed infrastructure legislation, keeping in mind that all these needs are important. Compromise and give-and-take is needed on what should be included in the bills, and likewise open-mindedness and flexibility is needed on what approaches are used to pay for the projects.\Like the president said, doing nothing cannot be an option.\* Elliott Hartstein of Northbrook is an attorney and former village president of Buffalo Grove.\CREDIT: By Elliott Hartstein Speaking Out"
254,"Two candidates will compete for the nomination for Kane County Board District 18 in the March 21 primary.\Dave Hart, 50, has been a carpenter for 25 years and a vocational instructor for 5 years. He is active in his community, working with several volunteer organizations including Habitat for Humanity, the Dundee Historical Society and as a coach for Little League baseball. He lives in Elgin with his wife, and has three children.\Donald S. Wolfe, 50, is the incumbent Kane County Board District 18 representative. He is a real estate appraiser with R.J. Schmitt and Associates, and has been involved with economic development in Elgin and the chamber of commerce. He lives in Elgin.\Why are you running for this office, whether for re-election or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you? If so, what?\Hart: I feel I will be a good representative for my district and the taxpayers of Kane County, by maintaining high priorities in an effort not to overburden the taxpayer of their hard earned dollars.\Wolfe: I enjoy public service in this manner. I am interested and involved in what is going on.\If you are the incumbent, describe your main contributions. Tell us of any important initiatives you've led. If you are not the incumbent, tell us what contributions you would make. Describe any shortcomings in the current board that you would help remedy and explain how.\Hart: I will use teamwork and emphasize long-term planning instead of quick fixes or solutions.\Wolfe: I will try to keep employment levels in Kane County at reasonable numbers, for example, an increase of 35 +/- over four years as opposed to 400 prior four years. On finance committee that pushed for a five-year financial plan, that demonstrated, or pointed out to the board where our finances would be if we didn't have a plan and stick to it.\I am also very involved in economic development at the county level, vis-a-vis riverboat funds. We need to share, each of us, as much information as possible regionally across the county to promote quality growth.\The county jail is severely overcrowded. What short- and long- term solutions would you support to ease the overcrowding?\Hart: The long-term solution is that it is imperative to build a new addition, a place to hold those waiting to go to trial. The short- term solution is to farm the overflow out to other jails, then transport them back. The additional cost and loss of productive policeman hours is staggering.\Wolfe: This is a multi-faceted problem. Ninety percent of the people in the jail are awaiting trial. Why is this? Judges and defense bar coziness? We need to wring some efficiencies out of the system before we go to the people and ask for money.\DIST. 18: Candidates agree that bridge is needed on Stearns Road Bridge projects have created much controversy in Kane County. Which of the proposed bridges do you support? Why?\Hart: I support the Stearns Road Bridge, as it is the most useful and logical solution for entire county. It should have been built years ago.\Wolfe: I support the Stearns Road (regional), Bolz Road (regional) and the Red Gate (local) as long as we are not funding any major portion of it.\Do you support a leaf-burning ban throughout the county? Only in restricted areas? Stricter enforcement of the existing ordinance? Or no change from the status quo? Why?\Hart: Undecided, the additional cost of trash pick-up - biodegradable trash bags. I am looking into the long-term effects.\Wolfe: Yes. East of Route 47 or another north-south line somewhat further east. Depending on what we can work out.\Should the Kane County Forest Preserve Commission and the county board be separate entities with unduplicated members? Why or why not?\Hart: There could be a separate forest commission to report and make recommendations to the board. For example, the $70 million for the forest lands and environment should not be foolishly spent on purchasing wetlands that are already protected by federal law against development.\Wolfe: We would need to go to a referendum to split it up. The present forest preserve district managerial and administration needs to be modernized and brought out of the 1960s. We have made strides toward a more rational approach to acquiring land, but need more. And more sunshine on the process or people will become disillusioned and want to split it up.\Should the county board put a referendum on the ballot to eliminate the office of county coroner in favor of a medical examiner? Explain why or why not.\Hart: No, not at this time. The board needs to do a survey through the news media to get voter's opinions.\Wolfe: I am told that right now it would cost more to have a medical examiner than a coroner. I don't think this needs to be a political office anymore. And when the cost savings justify it, we should make the switch.\Should the county board vote to increase the county gas tax from two cents to four cents a gallon to pay for future transportation needs? Explain why or why not.\Hart: No, I don't believe additional money is needed at this time. The transportation department needs to reassess how and on what it is spending the money it has already.\Wolfe: Gas taxes are user taxes, and if we ought to increase any tax, it ought to be a user tax. If you look at our long-range transportation plan, which is not grandiose, it is going to require raising the gas tax. We should have done it when gas was $1 a gallon.\Is the county board the right size at 26 members or should it be downsized?\Hart: Probably should be downsized somewhat. Some of the urban districts in Elgin and Aurora are so small that they could be merged with other districts. This is a census year, and the issue might just resolve itself.\Wolfe: I'm a status quo guy on this. (Hard to believe from an incumbent!) I think our county is very diverse, and I worry what group gets left out if we shrink. I think the efficiencies to be gained are illusory. I also like the democratic nature of part-time people.\What matters of concern to your particular district do you plan to address if you're elected (or re-elected, as the case may be)?\Hart: How the western sprawl will affect the traffic situations that already exist around Route 20, Randall Road and Plank Road.\Wolfe: My district is entirely within the city of Elgin. There are individuals with specific concerns, but on the whole I believe the people in my district want efficient use of their tax money and no increases."

256," The Daily Herald sent questionnaires to the candidates seeking election to represent District 10 on the Kane County Board. Howard Katz, 50, and Thomas Van Cleave, 55, are seeking election to the open seat that serves most of Batavia and a small part of Geneva.\ Van Cleave, a Republican, is marketing director at the Holmstad retirement community. He is Batavia school board president.\ Katz, a Democrat, is Batavia Township clerk and the St. Charles Township general assistance caseworker. He also is a computer lab assistant at National-Louis University.\ Q. Why are you running for this office? Is there a particular issue that motivates you? If so, what?\ Katz: I am running to continue service to the community and to extend my abilities to the district and county. Growth and protection of the county's open areas are of concern to me. Also of concern is the way current budgetary processes are handled for individual departments.\ Van Cleave: I am not running because of a single issue. I feel that I can contribute to the county board from my broad community involvement over that last 20 or more years.\ Q. Tell us what contributions you would make. Describe any shortcomings in the current county board that you would help remedy and explain how.\ Katz: A broad and open question. I believe that my broad-based experiences, especially in the medical insurance field, will allow me to work effectively on the board and contribute to the overall effectiveness of running the county. One shortcoming that needs to be addressed is the number of committees that currently exist - several could be combined to bring board operating costs down.\ Van Cleave: My 20 years on the Batavia Plan Commission and 12 years on the Batavia Board of Education give me a vast area of experience that will be very helpful to the county board. I hope to bring a cohesive feeling to the board.\ Q. Many argue that one of Kane's biggest problems is traffic. With several high-volume county roads cutting through your district, including Randall Road, what proposal or ideas do you have to raise the amount of money the county collects for improvement of transportation infrastructure. Higher gas taxes, sales taxes or some other options?\ Katz: A sales tax for the businesses that are impacting Randall Road are an option, but not a favorite one. Gas taxes, with the current price of fuel, is not an option.\ Van Cleave: I agree that traffic has become a very serious issue in Kane County. I do not support a gas tax to pay for roads although I would support a general sales tax increase. I feel that imposing a gas tax puts the burden on one retail segment of our community while a general sales tax would spread out the burden more evenly.\ Q. Related to the previous question, the city of Batavia is one of several communities calling for changes to the transportation impact fee system. Do you see the formula as it exists now as fair? Do you support the city's attempts (including threatening legal action) to get an overhaul of that formula?\ Katz: I believe that the impact fee originally was set up to be considered fair to all. The city's plan to change the formula does at least deserve to be reviewed by the board.\ Van Cleave: The present formula is unfair and I support the City of Batavia's efforts to make the formula fair. I hope that it does not become an issue for the courts to settle. I hope the city and the county board can work together to reach a resolution.\ Q. As part of the so-called urban corridor under the terms of the county's 2020 (and soon 2030) land use management plan, Batavia has grown to about its maturity. As a representative of a community that has had its growth spurt what actions would you take as a board member to foster controlled growth in smaller communities looking to expand?\ Katz: Limit housing development based on road ability to handle traffic. Work to define housing density per development. Make sure that watershed and land usage plans are properly followed and defined. And in some cases, decline to approve some developments. Foster funding for the farmland trust program.\ Van Cleave: The county board must develop a good working relationship with its smaller communities to teach them the benefits of reasonable growth. The community has the control over growth and the county must work closely with those communities to make sure they understand all the factors associated with growth and development. Growth and development bring in tax dollars but they also can bring extreme stress on an undeveloped infrastructure.\ Q. Bridge projects have and likely will continue to create much controversy in Kane County. Which of the proposed bridges do you support and why? More recently, the board chairman called for a stop to engineering work on the bridges in favor of land acquisition. What course and speed do you believe the county should take in regard to future bridge development and construction?\ Katz: Bridges are a must. The Tri-Cities absolutely needs a new bridge, and the Stearns Road bridge is necessary. Unfortunately, the ""NIMBY"" mentality has stopped proper transportation route growth in the county.\ Van Cleave: As fast as possible. We need to look at more river crossings to ease the traffic congestion throughout the county. I am very concerned about the traffic situation in downtown Batavia.\ Q. As a county board member you also serve as a forest preserve commissioner. During the last five years, the forest preserve has used public money to strongly pursue and purchase land throughout the county. The board has used other public money to back farmland conservation and open space. Do you support continuing that practice or even setting aside more money for property purchases?\ Katz: Absolutely!\ Van Cleave: Yes, I support these efforts to be continued if the county can afford farmland conservation. One of the most beautiful assets that Kane County treasures is its beautiful farmland.\ Q. Batavia has been a hotbed of debate concerning the future of Fox River dam. The Kane County Forest Preserve owns the south dam which continues to crumble into the Fox as a sort of preview of what could happen to the north, where the state controls the dam. What role do you see the county or the forest preserve taking on in the ongoing debate over the river's health?\ Katz: If dams are crumbling, then the debris will cause problems downstream. We put the dams there and changed the natural ecology of the rivers in the first place. Removing them only makes sense, in cases where they're going to crumble away, anyway.\ Van Cleave: The health of our river must be the most important consideration. I know that both sides of this issue feel that their solution is the ""healthy"" approach to the life of the river. I am an active fisherman and want to protect the health of the fish life. I have not been convinced that dam removal would accomplish a healthier environment, although I have not studied the issue in detail.\ Q. What matters of concern to your particular district do you plan to address if you're elected?\ Katz: I wish to promote a balanced plan for managing land use and it's concurrent impact on water usage and aquifer management. I want to support improvements in the district's road, bridge and commuter transportation systems. I would like to see programs such as the coroner's office offers for education expanded. I would like to see the county's health department have an expanded role in residents' care, especially for the noninsured portion of the population. I also would like to see the county revamp its wage system to be competitive with other counties and private industry in order to retain quality employees.\ Van Cleave: Transportation especially traffic congestion, and reasonable countywide growth.\ Q. The state has allowed the collar counties to impose a 7 percent cap on tax assessment increases for the next three years. A decision must be made within the next few months. What's your position on the cap? Would you vote for it? Why/why not?\ Katz: As I currently serve as the Batavia Township clerk, and the township's fundings are affected by this cap, I would recuse myself from this vote.\ Van Cleave: I do not feel the equalized assessed valuation cap will reduce the amount of taxes each homeowner will pay. Each taxing body (schools, park districts) levies for the amount of money they are authorized. Therefore an equalized assessed valuation cap will only increase the rate and the tax bill will adjust accordingly. Homeowners will not see any relief. I will not vote for the implementation of the 7 percent equalized assessed valuation cap."

They are traditionally known for being moderate-to-conservative in their policies and slow in making big, sweeping changes.\""We’re not Iowa. We’re not Wisconsin. We’re not Michigan,"" he said in a phone interview. ""We have a different kind of economy.

Pat Quinn. He added that much of Rauner’s true conservative character was not revealed to voters until after he took office in 2013.\Because of that, Mooney said, the election of Pritzker and a supermajority of Democrats in 2018 and the sharp turn to the left that followed can really be seen as a kind of course correction for Illinois rather than a long-term reversal.\""After four years with a Republican governor, and under the crazy fiscal situation that we had, and the sort of self-inflicted wounds, problems don’t stop in situations like that,"" Mooney said. ""It’s like, if you have a bad infection on your foot. If you break your leg, you’ve got to fix that quick because it hurts.

Rauner, we were able to stop some things because we had more seats,"" said Rep. Tony McCombie, a Republican from Savanna. ""And they had to have conversations with Republicans, and that’s the most important thing.

The budget spends just over $40 billion, increases K-12 education funding by $375 million, raises higher education funding by 5 percent and adds $567 million to human service agencies decimated by Rauner’s cuts. The bill also makes the state’s full $8.4 billion statutorily-mandated pension payment, and increases funding for the beleaguered Department of Children and Family Services budget by $100 million.\Graduated income tax Pritzker’s marquee campaign proposal — changing Illinois’ constitution to allow the General Assembly to tax higher income earners at higher amounts — will be on the 2020 November election ballot. The governor also signed a rate structure proposal that would take effect upon the amendment’s approval by voters. That structure would bring in an estimated $3.5 billion while lowering taxes on those earning less than $250,000 and raising the rates on those making more than that amount. Sixty percent of those voting on the question or the majority of those voting in the election must support the change for it to become law.\Capital plan Cranes will soon be in the air and construction crews on the roads after approval of the state’s first capital infrastructure plan in over a decade. The plan will invest $45 billion in Illinois’ crumbling infrastructure, with $33.2 billion to transportation, $3.5 billion to education infrastructure, $4.3 billion to state facilities, $1.2 billion for environment and conservation, $420 million for broadband deployment, $465 million for health care and human services, and $1.9 billion for economic and community development. The plan is funded by a variety of new taxes and fees detailed below.\Gas tax, fees Beginning July 1, the state’s gas tax will double to 38 cents and the diesel fuel tax will get bumped 5 cents to 45.5 cents total. The measure also shifts 1 percent of Illinois’ sales tax on motor fuel to the road fund every year beginning July 1, 2021. For cars and passenger trucks, registration fees will go from $101 to $151 beginning Jan. 1, 2020, while electric vehicles will be charged a $248 registration annual fee, up from $35 every two years. Other title fees will go from $95 to $150 under the plan, while motor home registrations will cost $250. Other registration fees for certain buses, trucks and trailers will increase by $100.\Sports gambling and casino expansion Just about all gambling options will be expanded in the state and new ones added under a sweeping proposal to make Illinois the gambling capital of the Midwest. The bill adds six casinos, expands video gambling and allows sports betting. The state’s casinos, horse race tracks, and professional sports arenas — such as United Center and Wrigley Field — would be eligible to buy a sports betting license. Sports betting will also be allowed online or through mobile applications. Gambling expansion is expected to produce $660 million in its first year due to licensing fees and taxes.\Other new taxes The gambling expansion also included several new taxes, such as a $1 per-pack cigarette tax increase, bringing the total tax to $2.98. This will produce an estimated $159 million in revenue. A 6 percent daily and 9 percent monthly tax on parking lots and garages will produce an estimated $30 million. The bill would also subject electronic cigarettes, including e-cigars, vapes and hookahs, to taxation as tobacco products at 15 percent wholesale. The bill would also remove a sales tax exemption on traded-in vehicles valued above $10,000, producing $45 million in revenue. Sales tax would also be collected on online purchases made through remote or out-of-state online retailers. All new money, along with all revenues from the gambling expansion bill, would fund a $45 billion capital infrastructure program.

260,"SPRINGFIELD — After four years of fiscal austerity and the pro-business, anti-union agenda of former Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, Illinois lawmakers took a sharp turn to the left during the just-completed legislative session, passing a budget with more than $1 billion in new spending and a host of new, more liberal social policies.\Those social policies include raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, legalizing recreational marijuana and sports gambling and declaring access to reproductive health services, including abortion, a ""fundamental right.""\""This one has been unlike any I’ve ever served in,"" Rep.

""And they had to have conversations with Republicans, and that’s the most important thing.

The budget spends just over $40 billion, increases K-12 education funding by $375 million, raises higher education funding by 5 percent and adds $567 million to human service agencies decimated by Rauner’s cuts. The bill also makes the state’s full $8.4 billion statutorily-mandated pension payment, and increases funding for the beleaguered Department of Children and Family Services budget by $100 million.\Graduated Income Tax Pritzker’s marquee campaign proposal — changing Illinois’ constitution to allow the General Assembly to tax higher income earners at higher amounts — will be on the 2020 November election ballot. The governor also signed a rate structure proposal that would take effect upon the amendment’s approval by voters. That structure would bring in an estimated $3.5 billion while lowering taxes on those earning less than $250,000 and raising the rates on those making more than that amount. Sixty percent of those voting on the question or the majority of those voting in the election must support the change for it to become law.\Capital Plan Cranes will soon be in the air and construction crews on the roads after approval of the state’s first capital infrastructure plan in over a decade. The plan will invest $45 billion in Illinois’ crumbling infrastructure, with $33.2 billion to transportation, $3.5 billion to education infrastructure, $4.3 billion to state facilities, $1.2 billion for environment and conservation, $420 million for broadband deployment, $465 million for health care and human services, and $1.9 billion for economic and community development. The plan is funded by a variety of new taxes and fees detailed below.\Gas Tax, Fees Beginning July 1, the state’s gas tax will double to 38 cents and the diesel fuel tax will get bumped 5 cents to 45.5 cents total. The measure also shifts 1 percent of Illinois’ sales tax on motor fuel to the road fund every year beginning July 1, 2021. For cars and passenger trucks, registration fees will go from $101 to $151 beginning Jan. 1, 2020, while electric vehicles will be charged a $248 registration annual fee, up from $35 every two years. Other title fees will go from $95 to $150 under the plan, while motor home registrations will cost $250. Other registration fees for certain buses, trucks and trailers will increase by $100.\Sports Gambling and Casino Expansion Just about all gambling options will be expanded in the state and new ones added under a sweeping proposal to make Illinois the gambling capital of the Midwest. The bill adds six casinos, expands video gambling and allows sports betting. The state’s casinos, horse race tracks, and professional sports arenas — such as United Center and Wrigley Field — would be eligible to buy a sports betting license. Sports betting will also be allowed online or through mobile applications. Gambling expansion is expected to produce $660 million in its first year due to licensing fees and taxes.\Other New Taxes The gambling expansion also included several new taxes, such as a $1 per-pack cigarette tax increase, bringing the total tax to $2.98. This will produce an estimated $159 million in revenue. A 6 percent daily and 9 percent monthly tax on parking lots and garages will produce an estimated $30 million. The bill would also subject electronic cigarettes, including e-cigars, vapes and hookahs, to taxation as tobacco products at 15 percent wholesale. The bill would also remove a sales tax exemption on traded-in vehicles valued above $10,000, producing $45 million in revenue. Sales tax would also be collected on online purchases made through remote or out-of-state online retailers. All new money, along with all revenues from the gambling expansion bill, would fund a $45 billion capital infrastructure program.

263,"Cryptic roadside signs affixed to rusting yellow poles throughout central Lake County for 50 years have marked more than the potential route of a new highway.\The ""FAP 342 ROW"" signs are reminders of battles over the extension of Route 53 north from Lake-Cook Road near Long Grove -- a long, emotional fight between those who fear its effect on natural areas and those who embrace it as a way to improve transportation and grow the economy.\It's no secret traffic congestion has worsened significantly because of population growth and longer commutes in the decades while the project has floundered.\Advocates say extending Route 53 and improving Route 120 will boost travel and access across the region while carrying a maximum traffic volume of 62,000 vehicles per day by 2040 -- about the same as now travel on I-94 north of Grand Avenue. A trip from Grayslake to Schaumburg would take 68 minutes with the road, compared to 98 minutes without it, according to preliminary information.\It's also true there's a strong sense of environmental protection among Lake County residents.\A Route 53 advisory panel in 2012 noted Lake County has the greatest number of unique and threatened natural resources, including lakes, wetlands and native prairie remnants, of any county in Illinois. Historically, that has been a rallying point for environmentalists and conservation groups.\But a make-or-break decision is in the works with a new proposal that hinges on balancing the interests involving environmental protection, improved transportation and economic development.\""This is our last best chance. We've gotten farther with this project than any of the other efforts,"" said Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor, co-chairman of the Route 53/120 Project Blue Ribbon Advisory Council, on whose direction the fragile alliance is based.\The proposal involves a one-of-a-kind tollroad with environmental protections that would forever change the landscape of central Lake County as it crosses sensitive environmental areas and likely leads to thousands of new homes and millions of square feet of businesses.\It would mean families along Harrison Avenue in Mundelein's Cambridge Country subdivision -- and other neighborhoods along the corridor -- could see their view of open spaces beyond backyard fences disappear.\""It's quiet. That's why we like it,"" said Virginia Biegel, whose family of five moved to Cambridge Country nearly two years ago. She said it's hard to envision the road and isn't sure if her family would move if it is approved.\Others potentially could lose more than a view.\""It goes straight through the house,"" said Helga Ziegler, who with her husband, Josef, built a home in 1973 and operate an apple orchard on 16 acres between Bacon and Cedar Lake roads south of Route 120 near Grayslake. ""We had people who wanted to buy it but when they find out ... "" Josef added.\Many hurdles remain before officials will know if this project has a future. Specifics, such as how and where it will be built will begin to emerge only if the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority board decides, possibly next year, to proceed with more detailed study for a 4-lane, limited access, 45 mph parkway.\Among the challenges to the alliance are how to pay the $2.35 billion to $2.65 billion tab, whether promised environmental protections will be followed and how to control the expected ripple effect of development.\Will the groups studying financing and land uses find acceptable answers? That depends on whether all parties are satisfied the end result is fair and sustainable.\Recommendations for financing are expected to be ready for the tollway board to consider early next year and for land uses possibly by late 2015.\Tollway leaders say they are committed to advancing the project but warn it must be in line with principles created for the rest of the system, such as shared local cost, consensus and support.\""We have no interest in building a road people don't want,"" said Paula Wolff, chairman of the tollway board.\Funding\The project is envisioned with a smaller footprint than traditional highways to minimize potential affects and protect the environment. It would extend north 12.5 miles from Lake-Cook Road near Long Grove to south of Route 120 in Grayslake, where it would split east and west. The split would bypass 120 from east of Route 45 to west of Route 134 or west of Fairfield Road. This top of the 'T' would stretch 12 miles from near Route 12 in Volo to I-94 in Waukegan.\A 300-foot wide corridor was defined long ago and the Illinois Department of Transportation has acquired about two-thirds of the needed right of way. IDOT made its last land purchase in 2011, after acquiring 886 acres for $48.3 million. While the exact configuration is not final, swathes of vacant land splitting subdivisions are evident at various points.\The immediate need is for funding because tolls on the new road won't be enough. There is an estimated gap as large as $2.4 billion that must be closed by other sources.\Suggestions include a 4-cent-per-gallon Lake County gas tax to be split between the project and other local transportation needs and a large special financing district -- both would require state legislation to establish. New or higher tolls on I-94 in Lake County, and congestion pricing and annual toll increases as a potential test program for the entire tollway system are being considered.\Cash-strapped Illinois is expected to be asked to make a big contribution, such as land already acquired.\The special financing district would encompass property within a mile of the road and two miles from intersections. Taxing bodies, such as school districts, would get 75 percent of property taxes from any new nonresidential development. The working group that studied the option suggests the other 25 percent be used for a long-term environmental stewardship fund to help mitigate possible effects of the road.\""We felt this was a very politically acceptable approach to go with this. We know that with the road, there will be a significant amount of commercial and industrial development,"" said Mundelein Mayor Steve Lentz, who headed the group.\The local contribution has to be significant enough -- perhaps up to 20 percent of the overall cost -- for the project to move forward. Cost-sharing has become standard for big tollway projects, beginning with the I-355 extension in DuPage County, and most recently the $3.4 billion Elgin-O'Hare western access spanning Elmhurst, Bensenville and other communities in DuPage and Cook counties that included a $300 million local commitment.\Participants say Route 53/120 could become a national model of how major road projects are selected and built. As such, this effort has a different feel compared to previous attempts because local officials are shaping the project and providing suggestions for revenue sources.\Issues are hashed out in public meetings, not behind closed doors. Environmentalists have a seat at the table and the new-look project has cautious support from traditional opponents.\Long Grove, which used to budget funds annually to fight Route 53, is participating.\""If the road is going to go through, let's not put blinders on (but) make sure the concerns are heard and taken seriously,"" Village President Angie Underwood said.\Environment\Lake County is considered especially vulnerable to potential disruptions of a new road, so environmental interests are demanding costly features intended to make it fit the landscape and protect natural resources. They are conditions of continued support.\The guide for the ongoing research and discussion is a 109-page report crafted by a diverse volunteer panel of community leaders, environmentalists, planners and others appointed by the tollway authority. In May 2012, after nine months of study, the advisory council recommended pursuit of the Route 53/120 extension.\So far, that alliance has held. How environmental requirements are funded and how closely they are followed are among the challenges to continued agreement.\""I would say it's still fragile. They're (environmental community) still watching closely,"" said George Ranney, co-chairman of the advisory panel. ""They're waiting for the first shoe to drop to see if the recommendations aren't followed.""\Hawthorn Woods Village President Joe Mancino said village officials see potential traffic and economic benefits but are wary of to-be-determined specifics of design and alignment through his town.\""If it is done exactly like that (advisory) committee envisions it, the environmental stakeholders will go along,"" Mancino said.\Design innovations, such as building portions of the road below grade to block noise or elevated sections through wetlands, are meant to protect those areas.\""This is an incredibly complex project,"" said Mike Sands, a senior associate with the Liberty Prairie Foundation and adviser to the panel on environmental matters. ""The richness of Lake County's natural resource base is exceptional and presents a particular challenge for any road project.""\The total cost of all innovations -- beyond those of tollway policy or state and federal requirements -- stands at $325 million to $400 million. It includes roadway design and environmental mitigation and a stewardship fund.\Valued at $81 million, the environmental stewardship fund is a nonnegotiable part of the recommendation, officials say. It would protect and enhance the natural resources within two miles of the roadway; protect and restore at least 750 acres beyond; deal with any unintended consequences; and provide oversight for 50 years. Specifics have yet to be determined.\The aim is to minimize disruption to people and communities and enhance the environment, supporters say.\""They're not going to throw pavement through the middle of a wetland and call it a day,"" Lake County Administrator Barry Burton said.\Development\It's clear that construction of a Route 53/120 extension would trigger big changes by stimulating and unlocking business and residential development. If not coordinated, traffic on existing roads would increase dramatically and damage ecological areas, say those involved in the process.\Skeptics contend new commuters and shoppers will flood local roads and spoil the area's character.\""The small traffic relief expected will then be erased as tens of thousands of new commuters and shoppers crowd into Lake County's open space, clogging local roads that access the new tollway and spoiling the rural character we all love,"" said Evan Craig, chairman of the Sierra Club Wood and Wetlands Group.\Because a new road alone won't solve traffic congestion, the panel called for a land use plan and strategy for the corridor. The study area extends two miles from the road, or about a quarter of the size of Lake County. It is proceeding separately but in tandem with the groups studying financing.\The purpose is to work with corridor communities to plan in a way that blends land uses, transportation, economic development and open space, said Jason Navota, principal with the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which is coordinating that aspect.\Part of the work will be to identify areas likely to undergo significant change because of development, and important natural areas that merit special attention. The objective is to outline a broad land use strategy and specific plans for about a dozen areas expected to change because of the road.\Participants in the land use study say that for the traffic and economic benefits to last, communities must change their approach to development. If not, the problems the 53/120 project aims to solve could resurface.\How or if that can be accomplished remains to be seen. Plans of the corridor communities collectively are out of scale with the road design and call for much more development than is feasible, said Lawlor, who co-chairs the land use committee. If the corridor is developed based on municipal plans, 6,868 acres of agricultural land and 9,160 acres of open space would be lost, preliminary data shows.\Communities farther from the road will want to protect their investments; those closer will want to parlay the advantage. Still, the land can only hold so much.\""We want this road to be successful so if we allow unrestricted development along the corridor and dump all those cars (onto adjoining roads), 53 won't be successful,"" Lawlor said.\Coming Monday: The stories of people along the possible route\Credit: By Mick Zawislak mzawislak@dailyherald.com First of a two-part series"

Illinois is the transportation hub of America where waterways, interstates, railroads, pipelines, fiber optic networks and global air travel converge. The foundation of Illinois's economy is built on transportation.
\
We have more interstate miles than any other state with the exception of Texas and California. More freight and passenger rail networks meet in Chicago than anywhere else in the country. The Chicago region has the second-longest and third-busiest transit system in the country, handling 1.6 million trips per day. And the Mississippi River crossings in southwestern Illinois continue to be the Gateway to the West 200 years after Lewis and Clark departed from the Illinois shore near Alton.
\
The combination of these transportation systems has allowed Illinois businesses to grow and flourish due to the ability to move people and goods quickly and efficiently.
\
But the quality, reliability and reach of Illinois' transportation infrastructure are in jeopardy as both the state and federal government programs to fund capital construction projects will expire next year. The ""Illinois Jobs Now"" program approved in 2009 ends in July. The federal funding for MAP 21 ends simultaneously with the federal fiscal year on Oct. 1, 2014.
\
In Illinois, it is projected road and bridge funding will collapse by $2 billion. The impact will be a reduction in the number of annual construction projects by two-thirds and is expected to reduce construction-related employment by nearly 20,000 jobs.
\
Neither of the last two federal surface transportation bills have had sufficient funding to fulfill the nation's construction needs. The Congress has found it necessary to shore up the U.S. Department of Transportation's Highway Trust Fund with transfers from the general funds because the 18.4 cents per gallon federal tax on gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon federal tax on diesel fuel in effect since 1993 have demonstrated no sustained revenue growth and there have been no revenue increases to bolster the fund.
\
Too many people take our transportation infrastructure for granted. Even though almost everyone uses the transportation networks every day, little thought is given to the expense associated with building or maintaining the extensive systems we rely upon. Matters of connectivity, speed, efficiency, reliability, modernization and safety are important to assure user confidence and continued private sector investments to sustain economic growth.
\
Data recently released by the Federal Highway Administration ranked Illinois interstates the fifth-busiest in the nation with over 31 billion miles traveled just on those highways in 2011. The Illinois Department of Transportation is responsible for 16,000 miles and 900 bridges. Illinois local governments are responsible for 123,000 road miles and thousands more bridges. Without a renewed financial commitment on the part of the governor and the General Assembly, it is anticipated that one in every three Illinois road miles and one in every 10 bridges will deteriorate to an unacceptable standard. (The Illinois Toll Highway system of nearly 300 miles is self-sustaining; it is user fee-based and receives neither state nor federal funds.)
\
Most transportation infrastructure is designed with a lifespan of 30 to 50 years. During that time, basic upkeep and maintenance are enough. Once that lifespan is reached, simple repairs are no longer sufficient and a complete rebuild is required. That is the status of much of Illinois' infrastructure. Large segments of Illinois' interstate system have reached their 50-year design life and need complete reconstruction. Transit systems across the state continue to operate with older equipment in constant need of repair when new buses and trains are in order. Much of the population in the Chicago region is dependent upon commuter rail. The presence of safety-related slow zones, resulting in longer times to get to work, is an indicator of efficiency and productivity challenges that employers and their employees experience.
\
Access to public transit service has increasingly become important to metro areas throughout the state and even in rural counties where access to public transportation is critical to serving an aging population.
\
The CREATE rail construction program has provided some relief for Amtrak and Metra trains and has also reduced the time it takes freight rail to pass through the Chicago region, but more than half of the projects remain to be completed. Over the last few months, the CTA has been working on a $1 billion complete rebuilding of the south branch of the more than 40-year-old Red Line. This rebuilding will decrease commute times by 20 minutes along that corridor, improving travel times for many of the 250,000 riders of the Red Line.
\
Earlier this year, the American Society of Civil Engineers released its Report Card for America's Infrastructure, awarding a ""D+"" to the overall condition of America's infrastructure. Also receiving a ""D+"" was the state of Illinois, the same grade it received when the last report card was issued in 2010. Maintaining such a poor performance is not a good thing as the report identified that 8.7 percent of Illinois' bridges are considered structurally deficient, 7.5 percent of Illinois bridges are considered functionally obsolete, and 73 percent of our almost 140,000 miles of public roads are in poor or mediocre condition.
\
While the report card is just a letter on a web page or piece of paper, the impact of that grade is felt every day through congestion and vehicle wear. According to a report by the Chicagoland Operators, the costs of traffic congestion in the Chicago area result in more than $8 billion in lost productivity each year. For consumers dealing with congestion, adding insult to injury is an additional $292 in extra vehicle repairs and operating costs due to poor or mediocre roads each year.
\
Earlier this year, the Washington Post reported poor infrastructure is the result of declining investments from a variety of areas, but the main drop in investment came from states and local governments cutting back on spending since 2008. Historically, states and local governments were the primary drivers of investing in roads, highways and bridges.
\
Illinois is no exception to this as identified by an article from the Chicago Tribune in May 2012. This article discussed a drop of almost 20 percent in six-year funding. The original 2012-2017 transportation plan was over $3 billion more than the 2013-2018 plan, which shows reductions impacting highways and state-maintained local roads. We're not the only state to do this either. California saw a 31 percent decline in transportation spending while Texas' fell by 8 percent.
\
But in an era where millions struggle economically, fewer people seem to care about deteriorating infrastructure until disasters like the high-profile bridge collapses in Washington and Minnesota. The loss of life due to lack of modernization or failed maintenance is not an experience Illinois highway users or elected officials should wish to flirt with, let alone share.
\
How to finance infrastructure investments
\
Historically, most transportation funding is paid for by gas taxes and other ""user fees"" that people only pay if they use the system. However, the Illinois Jobs Now! program was financed primarily from the introduction of video poker machines across the state, fees associated with privatizing the state lottery operations, and higher taxes on alcohol, candy, soft drinks and beauty products. Only increases in driver's license costs and license plate fees were user-related. Collectively, these revenues are dedicated to make the debt service payments on construction bonds for the next two decades.
\
The 2009 program did not commit any revenue to annual routine maintenance of the existing roads and bridges. And therein lies a fundamental problem that must be addressed. In 2012, the federal government passed the most recent surface transportation bill, MAP-21, which authorizes spending of federal fuel tax dollars on transportation projects in all the states. Surface authorizations prior to MAP-21 were typically passed every five or six years and identified what programs and projects federal money could be spent on. The multiyear authorizations also allowed state and local governments -- and businesses -- to plan long term. This allowed businesses stability to hire people long term, purchase equipment knowing what projects would pay for it, and allow for a constant flow of projects. In contrast, MAP-21 is a two year bill and expires in September 2014, right before the next election.
\
Before MAP-21, there were nine temporary extensions of the previous federal transportation law. Each time an extension was about to expire and there was uncertainty on a new extension, state and local governments had to prepare to end projects regardless of where they were in the planning or construction phase. This extended period of uncertainty regarding congressional commitment to financing the nation's transportation networks also impacted private businesses and construction professionals who work in an environment where planning, permitting, engineering and construction often dictate a process that frequently extends 10 years or more.
\
As in many other areas of national importance, Congress has failed to offer a deliberate and stable approach to meeting the nation's needs. While the Chinese are investing 9 percent of their GNP toward infrastructure and the European Union dedicates 5 percent towards transportation needs, the United States is currently devoting only 1.6 percent of GNP to building and maintaining the transportation networks that have made our country's economy the envy of the world. A June 2012 report by the Council on Foreign Relations stated that the rest of the developed world on average spends 52 percent more of its GDP on transportation than the U.S.
\
Clearly, the message to state and local officials is that they should no longer look to the federal government to finance the majority of their infrastructure programs. The most successful states and regions going forward are going to be those where the elected officials and citizens accept responsibility for meeting their own needs. Waiting for Congress has proven to be a failed strategy.
\
Today, Illinois Jobs Now! is reaching the end of its life. In Illinois, the typical funding cycle for publicly funded transportation construction work begins again every five to six years. That moment has arrived.
\
A new state capital plan is needed, one that doesn't rely on uncertain tax revenue from video poker or other gimmicks. Both Illinois' gas tax and the federal gas tax have been unchanged for over 20 years. The lack of growth in road fund taxes is insufficient to meet the needs for state and local roads and transit systems.
\
Today's vehicles are far more fuel-efficient than those operating 20 years ago. Today's motorists are paying a far smaller percentage of the price of fuel for road work than was paid in the early 1990s, while the costs of materials, equipment and labor have only increased. The anticipated growth of hybrid, electric and other alternative-fuels vehicles will further suppress the impact on construction funds from traditional highway user fees.
\
In a Transportation for Illinois Coalition report released earlier this year, an assessment of Illinois' transportation needs was conducted. Over the next five years, Illinois will need $63.5 billion on the low end and $74.4 billion on the high end just to maintain our existing road and transit networks in a state of good repair. Despite the need, taxpayers will not support that level of funding, but some reasonable amount must be raised to sustain our fiduciary responsibilities to sustain the systems our predecessors have provided for us.
\
The good news with all of this is that we have the ability to improve our transportation infrastructure. In May, legislators introduced TFIC-supported legislation that would eliminate the flat rate per gallon tax on gasoline and replace it with a 9.5 percent tax on the wholesale price of fuel. While this approach is more volatile and harder to predict receipts, the wholesale approach is expected to guarantee an increase in tax revenue, while reflecting market pricing that has consistently grown over the years.
\
The state of Virginia adopted this approach earlier this year -- and under a Republican governor. This is not the only option for increased funding for transportation. Just this year, over a dozen states have passed, attempted to pass or seriously considered legislation to increase taxes to pay for transportation infrastructure.
\
While Virginia is the only state to move to a wholesale tax, other states are considering it. Meanwhile, Wyoming (10 cents per gallon), Maryland (indexed to inflation), Massachusetts (also indexed to inflation) and Vermont have simply chosen to raise their existing motor fuel taxes.
\
Oregon, which was the first state to tax gasoline, has initiated a pilot program of collecting taxes by vehicle miles traveled. This pilot program is the successor to a previous test and will include 5,000 volunteers using several methods to record how many miles they travel.
\
A new state capital bill needs to do more than just increase funding. Even though the amount of money diverted continues to shrink, we need stronger protections to prevent future diversions and ensure that motorist's user fees intended for transportation are actually spent on transportation. Ideally, this philosophy of taxation should also include the state sales tax that is applied to fuel purchases, but directed to the state's general fund instead of the road fund or highway construction fund. While desirable, it is probably not practical to expect such a change while the state's general fund remains in such a dire condition.
\
The next state transportation program also needs to include a pay-as-you-go component to ensure that ongoing maintenance and repair programs have a steady stream of investment. Without pay-as-you-go provisions, regular maintenance and repair are not only delayed but result in higher costs when they are performed. According to the American Association of State Highway Officials, $1 spent to repair a highway while it's in fair condition prevents costs of $6 to $14 to rebuild the same highway once it has reached poor condition.
\
Investing in infrastructure creates jobs, and not just for engineers and construction workers. Businesses rely on transportation. Warehousing, logistics, manufacturing and service industries alike locate in Illinois because of our infrastructure. Transit throughout the state increases the access employers have to their workers and potential employees. Interstates and railroads help move finished goods and agricultural products across the country while connecting us to international markets. However, all of these things rely on certainty. The certainty that an employee can arrive and leave from work at the same time each day along with the certainty that a truck can make it across the region in the same amount of time are strong economic contributors to Illinois' economy.
\
Maybe because highways and trains aren't sexy and thus are frequently taken for granted, they appear to get little attention from policymakers until they collapse or gridlock brings commerce to a halt. If we lose our edge in transportation, the state will squander one of its greatest competitive advantages.

Saddam Hussein would have loved Stephen Chapman's Feb. 24 column ""Empty subway cars and other triumphs of mass transit."" Mr. Chapman has demonstrated that many Americans have not learned the dangers of being addicted to cheap, foreign oil.
\
He claims that the automobile is the best way to move people ""cheaply, quickly and conveniently,"" and he made this claim in the midst of a bloody war aimed at preventing Saddam Hussein from gaining control over a large part of the world's oil reserves. Our fanatical dependence on the automobile has turned oil into a potent weapon that we have risked in the hands of the likes of Saddam Hussein.
\
Let's face some painful facts: The automobile is neither cheap nor quick and is rapidly becoming inconvenient in metropolitan areas. Those of us who advocate decreasing our dependence on the automobile do so not because we look upon cars as ""our own Golden Calf,"" but because we recognize that the automobile is, by far, the biggest single cause of our dependence on Mideast oil and is wreaking havoc on the environment.
\
All forms of transportation, from sidewalks to space shuttles, are subsidized, and no form of transportation has received more taxpayer support than the automobile.
\
Gas tax revenues (user fees) do not begin to cover the real costs of building, operating and maintaining our nation's vast highway system, and even if gas taxes were raised enough to cover highway costs, does it make good sense to continue covering the countryside with concrete? Using gas taxes to build more highways is like using liquor tax revenues to build more distilleries.
\
Mr. Chapman and many people of like mind employ a double standard when contemplating our transportation system. He complains about tax dollars being used to purchase buses and subway cars that sometimes operate with light loads, but he ignores the fact that most automobiles on the subsidized highways contain only one person-the driver.
\
The Illinois Association of Railroad Passengers, a non-profit consumer group, advocates reinvesting in rail transportation, not because of nostalgia for the days of steam engines, but because the steel wheel on steel rails is the most efficient method ever devised to move people and freight with little or no damage to the environment.
\
A Tribune editorial that ran on the same day as the Chapman column correctly pointed out some of the major flaws in the administration's recently announced national energy strategy. The Tribune said, "" . . . the war has underscored the nation's vulnerability to unstable oil supplies and aroused many politicians who believe the time is right to rethink the country's energy policy.""

President Bush summoned the nation's governors Monday to a summit on education reform and touted the major domestic policy initiatives of his new administration as the basis for ""a national consensus in spite of overriding budget difficulties.""
\
Members of the National Governors' Association gave Bush an E for effort, but many expressed skepticism that the President can make good on a pledge to assist state governments while vowing not to raise taxes.
\
Bush, who campaigned last year on a promise of becoming ""the education president,"" invited the governors to confer with him Sept. 27-28 on a $441 million education reform package he offered to Congress last April and ""to share ideas and to explore options for educational progress.""
\
Illinois Gov. James Thompson immediately began lobbying to have the governors and President return to Chicago for the September education summit.
\
Thompson, a Republican who last month signed into law a 20 percent state income tax increase largely earmarked for schools, said there was symbolic importance in having a President sit with the nation's governors to forge a reform plan on education.
\
""The presidency is expected to lead the way and point the way,"" Thompson said.
\
Using his speech at the governors' annual meeting in Chicago to praise their mutual leadership roles, Bush told the governors, ""We've got to find our collective will as a nation"" to fight illiteracy, drug abuse and crime.
\
""First and foremost are our children and their education,"" Bush told the governors' meeting in the Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel. ""Working together, you and I can raise the level of learning in the classrooms of America.""
\
Bush listed domestic policy initiatives in his six-month administration that have been warmly received by governors. But they nevertheless question how the President would pay for them.
\
Bush cited suggested revisions in the Clean Air Act, get-tough proposals for battling crime, federal waivers for states' welfare reform experiments and child-care initiatives.
\
""I have to applaud his positive efforts,"" Democratic Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota said afterward. ""But a tragedy is that the President painted himself an impossible corner with his `Read my lips: No new taxes' campaign pledge.""
\
Following his speech, Bush personally greeted each of the governors and among the first with whom he shook hands was the vanquished Democratic presidential nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
\
Dukakis applauded Bush's initiatives on the environment, education and child care but admonished the Republican administration and Congress as having been ineffective in reducing the budget deficit.
\
""For eight years (Democrats) told the American people that . . . there were real problems with education and drugs and day care and the environment,"" said Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.
\
""The political genius of (Ronald) Reagan was that he denied it all. He said that trees caused acid rain. Once you deny something, you don't have to pay for it. In less than a year, by acknowledging the (problems), Bush has done more for us than we could do for ourselves. He's joined us in the circle.""
\
The governors also were heartened by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner's assurance that the administration will work with them to release funds held in trust for transportation projects, but used instead as an accounting ploy to make the deficit appear smaller.
\
Skinner pledged to lobby Congress to free gasoline and air-fare surcharge revenues from the deficit accounting process. He reiterated the administration's opposition to a proposed one-time gas tax for erasing the deficit.

While President Bush proclaims a new world order abroad, Americans have been practicing a New Patriotism at home. The New Patriotism is characterized by the ratio of high visual impact to low personal cost.
\
The New Patriot does sport a flag lapel pin, tie a yellow ribbon on his garage door and hang a flag outside his window. The New Patriot does not forgo that extra trip to the mall in order to conserve gasoline, organize a car pool for commuting or increase his use of mass transit.
\
The New Patriotism, in other words, consists solely in symbolic display that is irrelevant to the underlying causes of the war in the Persian Gulf.
\
We fought Saddam Hussein because he threatened our supply of oil. Americans feel good about themselves and their country because our trillion-dollar military has shown itself able to crush a Third World dictator without breaking a sweat. But now that we have routed Hussein, how strong are we in victory? We will have spent billions on a war to preserve an energy status quo that leaves us still vulnerable to oil politics in the Middle East.
\
Although Bush asked nothing of Americans as part of the war effort, we could best have supported the fight against Hussein, as well as prevent a similar war in the future, not by waving flags but by significantly reducing our consumption of energy.
\
The power Hussein could have gained from the control of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia is directly proportional to our dependence on Middle East oil. We could have taken away his power long ago without shedding a single drop of blood had we kicked our oil addiction.
\
Instead, the Reagan and Bush administrations rolled back the conservation measures implemented after the oil shocks of 1973-74 and 1979. Reliance on market forces alone for a de facto energy policy has left us dependent on foreign oil for over half our energy needs. Unless we impose stiff tariffs on imports, our need for oil will continue to mean reliance on foreign oil.
\
Bush's new energy policy-the so-called National Energy Strategy-is the perfect counterpart to the New Patriotism. It requires no action from Americans. It contains no measures to curb consumption or imports of oil. It imposes no new mileage standards for cars, nor any gas taxes. It asks only our silent complicity in opening up to oil exploration the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and previously untouched offshore areas.
\
If the potential oil in such areas were essential to our economic survival, then the environmental destruction attendant on drilling perhaps could be justified. But we possess another untapped energy source that is environmentally benign and far more economic in the long term than the consumption of fossil fuels: conservation.
\
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is expected to contain, at most, six months' worth of oil. Just increasing automobile fuel economy standards from 27.5 miles to 40 miles a gallon would save more energy by the year 2005 than the Arctic coastal plain could possibly yield. And unlike oil deposits, conservation resources are never depleted. Yet President Bush has vowed to veto any congressional energy policy that does not provide for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
\
In the name of the free market, the Bush administration scuttled the conservation measures proposed recently by its own Energy Department. But the market does not work properly in the case of most pollution-generating commodities or activities.
\
Neither the producer nor the consumer of fossil fuels, for example, pays directly for the human health costs of the air pollution that results from the consumption of such fuels, or for the destruction of ecosystems in polluted areas, the increase in greenhouse gases or the environmental damage caused by the extraction and refining of oil and gas. The market price of fuel and other polluting commodities, therefore, is far lower than their true cost to society.
\
This underpricing encourages overuse. Conservation measures such as a gas tax serve as market correctives to bring the price of pollution-generating activities closer in line with their true cost to present and future generations.
\
Bush's failure to ask Americans to reduce their use of oil in the wake of a multibillion-dollar war fought over its control is a national tragedy. He is squandering the power of the presidency and his enormous popularity. There simply are no good reasons not to aggressively pursue a national program of conservation and development of renewable energy. Our great thirst for oil unnecessarily drains the economy, ravages the environment and skews international politics.
\
But Americans are free to act in the absence of presidential leadership. We can voluntarily cut back on our use of nonrenewable energy by driving less, buying fuel-efficient cars and appliances, installing energy-efficient light bulbs and turning lights off and the heat and air conditioning down when not needed. And we can demand that our representatives in Congress pass pending legislation to mandate conservation and encourage development of renewable energy sources.
\
Bush's new energy policy assumes that Americans value their high-performance cars and cheap gasoline more than they do America's environment, security and international competitiveness. If the president is right, then our New Patriotism contains a good deal more love of self than love of country.
"
268,"
The OPEC oil ministers have scheduled a meeting Monday in Switzerland to discuss how high the price of oil should go now that Iraq has been chased from Kuwait.
\
It was time, then, to talk once more with Daniel Yergin, the energy expert and best-selling author who has spent most of his adult life thinking about oil and America's future.
\
We met at the same restaurant where we had talked before, in the summer of 1982. Then the U.S. economy still was reeling from oil price spikes caused by the fall of the Shah of Iran, the taking of hostages in Tehran and the outbreak of fighting between Iraq and Iran. The price of crude was more than $30 a barrel and unleaded was going for the then-astonishing price of $1.30 a gallon.
\
Yergin that summer had a new book, a collection of essays he co-edited called ""Global Insecurity: A Strategy for Economic Renewal."" In the lead essay, he argued that unless America curbed its growing appetite for oil, especially imported oil, the nation was doomed to ride the roller coaster of Middle Eastern politics until some future interruption in supply plunged the nation into a second Great Depression.
\
I remember telling Yergin that the timing of his book could not have been better. I was wrong. The timing of his newest work-an 877-page blockbuster on the political history of oil-has been nothing short of miraculous.
\
Yergin submitted his manuscript, seven years in the making, July 28, just five days before Saddam Hussein grabbed Kuwait. Alert to opportunity's knock, the publishers at Simon & Schuster gave him another two months to beef up his discussion of Iraq and Kuwait and what the invasion might mean. Their forbearance paid off, and by last week ""The Prize-The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power"" had reached the top of the Publisher's Weekly best-seller list for non-fiction.
\
So much for Yergin's timing. Where does he think the price of oil is headed?
\
""There is a consensus forming around $20 to $21 a barrel,"" said Yergin, who, since our last meeting, has left the political science faculty at Harvard University to form a consulting firm called Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
\
""For consumers that's $1.05 a gallon, or pretty cheap compared to what gas cost after the oil shocks of '73, '79 and last fall.""
\
I reminded him that Midwesterners are by nature paranoid about the price of oil, living as we do at the wrong end of the pipeline and wedded as we are to an economy of energy-intensive factories and farms. Won't the OPEC sheiks try to drive the price of a barrel back to $30 or more, especially now that several desperately need our dollars to rebuild?
\
""They could try,"" he said, ""but OPEC can't go against the world market of supply and demand. They can affect the range, but they no longer control it.""
\
What if George Bush helped them do it? Didn't he make his millions as a Texas oil man?
\
""He did,"" said Yergin, ""but now Bush's main concern is ending the recession and getting re-elected. I'm almost certain you won't see him support prices above the mid-$20 level, at least not before 1993.""
\
Now that prices are down again, Yergin was asked, how about a tax on oil imports or on consumers at the pump?
\
""We might see a 10- to 15-cent federal gas tax,"" Yergin said. ""Fifteen cents would be enough to pay America's cost of the gulf war. And a $1.20 gallon wouldn't be outrageous, not after what we've been through.""
\
""Import taxes I don't see, not when you're on the verge of a diplomatic breakthrough with the Arab states.""
\
Does he still think, as he did in 1982, that America needs to break its imported oil habit or face economic ruin?
\
""To some extent, yes,"" Yergin said with a circumspection that was missing nine years ago. At 44, he seems less the committed academic, more the don't-pin-me-down consultant.
\
""I came out of this book realizing that the Age of Oil will last longer than I originally thought,"" he said. ""Now the more reasonable question is whether we can slow the increase in demand, not whether we can cut back.""
\
""That's especially true at the global level. During the 1990s, the world population will grow by 20 percent, or by 5 billion to 6 billion people. So it would take an enormous effort to just hold the line on consumption. One could argue that it will be easier to cut back in the United States because we're close to the saturation point. Did you know we now have one car for every American old enough to drive?""
\
Yergin identified four things America can do to throttle back its demand for imported oil, which is approaching half of what we use: speed the conversion of industry and automobiles to cleaner, more readily available fuels such as electricity and natural gas; keep the price of oil above $20 a barrel so our domestic oil industry can compete; spend more on energy research and development; get serious about conservation.
\
Reminded that former President Jimmy Carter once hurt himself politically by donning a cardigan sweater and urging the latter, Yergin insisted times have changed.
\
He said there is a widening constituency for conservation, not because of geo-political concern but because of the environment. Perhaps that explains the groan that seemed to greet the Bush administration's recently announced national energy policy, which called for more drilling offshore and in the Arctic wilderness.
\
""The big energy battle of the '80s was over price,"" Yergin said. ""The battle of the '90s will be about the environment.""
\
And, he added darkly, we will experience more wrenching surprises that no one could have predicted, surprises such as the invasion of Kuwait.
\
Just now, for instance, Yergin is much more concerned about the growing chaos in the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer, than about anything the OPEC ministers might decide this week in Geneva.
\
""What you're left with is a great problem for which I have no answer,"" Yergin said as we parted. ""The American people want cheap energy. They want clean energy. They want secure energy. Those are all contradictions in terms.""

269,"
Mom, apple pie and green architecture. An unlikely trio, to be sure, but not in the minds of the idealistic crusaders for environmentally sound design. They were in this most pragmatic of cities last week, suggesting to a conclave of 5,000 architects from more than 85 countries that it would be practically un-American-or un-British, un-Japanese or un-whatever-not to join their save-the-planet cause.
\
Put the guilt trip on hold for a minute: Who wouldn't be in favor of a world without waste? A world without toxic materials? Who wouldn't want workplaces that offer a healthy, stress-free environment for workers? Or buildings that consume less energy than conventional structures? Or new developments that reduce sprawl, traffic congestion and air pollution?
\
These were among the principles that emerged from the World Congress of Architects, a joint convention of the American Institute of Architects and the International Union of Architects held at McCormick Place and the Auditorium Theatre. The tough questions few seemed to be debating at the four-day gathering were: How much will this environmental wish list cost to implement? And who's got the political clout to turn the wish list into reality?
\
""Architecture at the Crossroads: Designing for a Sustainable Future"" was billed as the largest gathering of architects in history. Given its high-minded environmental agenda, the Congress was laced with irony. It began with a parade that stopped traffic in downtown Chicago, causing idling cars to spew pollutants into the air. Its first three days were at McCormick Place, a great black gash on the green swath of Chicago's lakefront that is unreachable by mass transit.
\
Nevertheless, the convention ended with the issuance of a ""Chicago Declaration of Interdependence,"" conceived by organizers as a logical extension of last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. A sustainable society, said the declaration, ""restores, preserves and enhances nature and culture for the benefit of all life, present and future."" Architects, it added, will ""place environmental and social sustainability at the core of our practices and professional responsibilities.""
\
Put aside the question of whether the declaration constitutes the equivalent of a Hippocratic oath for the design profession (it probably won't be binding on those who signed it, organizers said). The more significant question seems to be: Will the principles of the declaration work their way into the economic and cultural mainstream or will they become the foundation for a relatively insignificant niche market, the architectural equivalent of organic food?
\
The importance of the declaration's principles is difficult to dispute. Half the world's energy is spent constructing, tearing down, heating and lighting buildings, according to officials of the International Union of Architects. It only stands to reason that by rethinking how they design buildings-specifying materials that require less energy to produce than conventional materials, for example-architects can lessen the impact of such scourges as the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming.
\
Two developments last week indicated that green architecture was moving into the mainstream. President Clinton announced the creation of a new council that will be devoted to developing sustainable development policies that can be implemented by U.S. businesses and governments. And Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, opened a 120,000-square-foot environmental demonstration store in Lawrence, Kan.
\
The store, which is likely to end up costing 10 to 20 percent more to build than a conventional Wal-Mart, includes wooden beams fabricated from selectively harvested, rather than clear-cut, timber. It has a solar-powered sign in front, a parking lot of recycled asphalt and skylights outfitted with electronic daylight sensors that regulate fluorescent lights in response to the amount of daylight coming inside. In the long run, savings from such measures are expected to offset part of the higher initial construction costs, Wal-Mart officials say.
\
Perhaps emboldened by these developments, leaders of the convention told architects that, despite a worldwide economic slowdown, it is their responsibility to be the shock troops in a global war against pollution and waste. The designers were further informed that they had the power to win this war, just as architects who ventured forth from the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 changed the face of the American city with Beaux-Arts train stations, libraries and art museums.
\
Yet for any number of reasons, these assertions-offered by Susan Maxman of Philadelphia, president of the American Institute of Architects, and leaders of the International Union of Architects-were hard to give much credence, no matter how noble the impulse behind them.
\
First, 1993 is not 1893. The Chicago world's fair of 1893 was a real, live spectacle of an event, not a revolutionary idea in search of a constituency. The fair's White City-a carefully orchestrated fantasyland of neo-classical buildings planned by Daniel Burnham-drew millions of people to Chicago, thus establishing a political constituency for the City Beautiful movement of grandly scaled structures and civic monuments. In contrast, the World Congress was a closed-to-the-public affair; the closest its stylishly dressed attendees got to real people were the thousands of tie-dyed Grateful Dead fans passing through McCormick Place to Dead concerts at Soldier Field.
\
Second, even in healthy economic times, architects are political wimps compared to the powerful professions of doctors and lawyers. Now, in the very moment when they are at their weakest economically, architects were being asked to save the world.
\
How would you like to be the struggling architect telling some chief executive officer that your bid came in 20 percent high, but that it will save money over time because of higher productivity and reduced energy costs? There may be some rare, enlightened CEO who will go for such long-term logic. Most will not.
\
Third, the theme of the convention was the right message conveyed to the wrong audience-old wine in a new, green bottle. For years, architects have been inveighing against suburban sprawl, arrogantly telling people to stop driving and start walking so there would be less congestion and less pollution. And what have Americans done? However foolishly, they've kept spreading their suburbs farther and farther from downtowns in search of the impossible dream of peace and quiet. To be sure, recycling is making a dent in our throwaway society, but let's see if President Clinton can increase the gas tax before getting too optimistic about an America that is about to turn red, white, blue and green.
\
The closest thing to genuine debate offered by this oh-so-polite convention occurred Sunday during a five-person panel discussion, when Chicago's Helmut Jahn-cast as the guy in the black hat even though he wore a spiffy white suit-mixed it up with New York architect William McDonough, a leading green guerrilla who sported a blue bow tie.
\
Jahn put down green architecture as a passing fad, but McDonough countered that it was part of a fundamental shift in cultural values. Jahn said the overriding issue of good design is intelligent planning, which makes climate and the environment part of a broader range of economic and social concerns. McDonough compared today's steel-and-glass boxes to smoke-belching steamships-energy-wasting relics of an industrial age that romanticized the machine and created ""machines for living,"" not his ideal of a ""living machine.""
\
Jahn said that advocates of green design were trying to make the architect into ""the saint who saves the world,"" but McDonough responded that architects shouldn't just accept conventional materials, such as clear-cut timbers; they must seek out new, energy-saving or environmentally sound ones, as at the Wal-Mart store.
\
Who's right? It matters little. Both Jahn and McDonough would probably agree that if it has any chance to be broadly accepted, green design must not become an end in itself, but part of a larger framework that incorporates the essential elements of space, light, structure, human scale and responsiveness to surroundings, whether natural or man-made. That way it's not architecture that's green for green's sake, but green for our sake.

270,"It wasn't long ago that the forecasting arm of the Wisconsin legislature was predicting that state government by mid-2015 would be flush with a surplus topping $1 billion, which Gov. Scott Walker could have showcased in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\Today, that projected surplus has morphed into a $2.2 billion budget deficit that Republican lawmakers are struggling to fix. Sharp divisions between Walker and legislators about how to solve the problem have complicated his plans for formally entering the already crowded field of GOP presidential hopefuls. When he does, his financial stewardship may prove more political vulnerability than bragging point. \Once in lockstep with Walker, GOP lawmakers are flashing some independence as they struggle to make ends meet. They have refused to go along with the governor's proposed cuts in money for elementary and secondary schools and his plans to finance a big boost in road construction solely by borrowing. They have also forced him to moderate his proposed reductions in funds for higher education. \Dale Knapp, research director for the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the state's current budget woes are in great measure ""self-induced."" Walker and Republican allies in the legislature gave themselves no cushion for error in their bet that broad tax cuts would jump-start the state's economy and more than pay for themselves. \""When the new projections didn't materialize, we put ourselves into a hole,"" Knapp said. \State Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, that chamber's Republican majority leader, laid blame for Wisconsin's financial problems not on tax and spending cuts but on a still-sputtering national economy. ""We're still waiting for it to kick in, and I think we're better positioned to be successful when it does,"" said Fitzgerald. \That said, Fitzgerald acknowledged that a round of tax cuts lawmakers enacted last year has made it more difficult to reach agreement on a new budget. ""It's got us boxed in,"" he said. \Spokeswomen for Walker's campaign-in-waiting did not respond to questions about Wisconsin's economic performance during his tenure. \Just days after taking office in 2011, Walker launched a high-profile drive to lure business from neighboring Illinois. It featured highway billboards and an opinion page piece in the Chicago Tribune contrasting his less-is-more approach to taxes and business regulation with that of Illinois Democrats. \Walker then capped his first month in office with a State of the State speech that summed up his pro-growth manifesto with the words of a home-state Green Bay Packers icon. \""Coach Vince Lombardi once said, 'Success demands singleness of purpose,' "" Walker declared. ""We are defining success for this administration by our ability to shape an environment where 250,000 jobs are created. Every action of our administration should be looked at through the lens of job creation."" \Viewed through that lens, Walker significantly missed. Federal data show Wisconsin added a little over 119,000 jobs over Walker's first term, less than half his goal. \From 2011 to 2014, the pace of private-sector employment growth in Wisconsin ranked 36th among the states and the District of Columbia, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker's state ranked behind all its Rust Belt neighbors, Illinois included. Wisconsin even trailed Kansas, which has been the focus of national attention after steep tax and spending cuts pushed by Republican Gov. Sam Brownback produced big government deficits but little economic pop. \The number of jobs in the private sector grew by 5.7 percent in Wisconsin over the last four years, federal numbers show. Nationally, the growth rate was 9.3 percent. \Walker won a second term last year with 52.3 percent of the vote after an initial four years marked by huge and raucous protests against his anti-union policies as well as a 2012 recall vote that he survived. His stare-down with organized labor raised Walker's profile in national conservative political circles and clearly has played a role in his presidential ambitions. \As he ran for that second term in 2014, Walker assured voters that the state was in the best financial shape in years and would begin this year with a surplus. \Instead, even before he could take the oath for a second time, Walker's own Department of Administration warned that expected tax revenues and spending requests were out of whack and the state budget was headed for a more than $2 billion deficit over the next two years. \In response, Walker's budget for the 2016-17 biennium proposed significant cuts in aid to elementary and secondary schools and the University of Wisconsin system. At the same time, he wanted to spend $220 million to help the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team build a new stadium. He also proposed putting $1.3 billion in new road spending on the state's credit card with no added source of revenue to cover the increased borrowing costs. \By April, a poll conducted by the Marquette University Law School showed Walker's job approval ratings had taken a big hit. Just 41 percent of Wisconsin registered voters surveyed said they approved of the way he was handling himself as governor, with 56 percent expressing disapproval. \""His notion that we fixed everything and it's all hunky-dory just isn't holding up,"" said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette poll. \In early 2014, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the bipartisan financial scorekeeper for the Wisconsin legislature, had forecast a budget surplus that would reach $1.04 billion by the end of this June. \Jon Peacock, director of the Wisconsin Budget Project, a liberal group, said Walker and Republican lawmakers spent that projected surplus by engaging in a new round of tax cutting after already slashing taxes in previous years. \""There are lots of conservatives who truly did believe that we would grow our way out of any predicament,"" said Peacock. ""But the economy in Wisconsin has slowed down and we continue to lag behind the national recovery."" \The Legislative Fiscal Bureau has estimated that tax cuts during Walker's first term sliced state revenues by more than $1.9 billion. \As they try to dig out of the problems, legislative Republicans have quarreled with Walker over several issues, including the basketball stadium. Walker has significantly scaled back his original spending plans for the arena, but some Republicans remain uncomfortable with imposing budget austerity while helping finance a stadium largely for private interests. \Another big sticking point is Walker's budget for roads, with fiscal hawks in the Republican caucus balking at the governor's plans to finance it solely through borrowing. \With a presidential campaign looming, Walker remains opposed to raising the state's gas tax or vehicle license fees -- common means to defray the costs of borrowing for transportation spending. \Without creating such a new source of revenue, one out of every $4 in the state road fund would be spent on loan interest and principal rather than on actual construction, budget experts warn. \Republican lawmakers now find themselves haggling over which road building projects to delay or eliminate, even though highway spending typically produces jobs and is popular with voters. \The road building industry, which has much to gain from robust construction, finds itself between concrete and a hard place. \""We have been consistent from the beginning of this process that if leaders aren't willing to raise the needed revenues to pay for transportation investments, then we need to live within our means and not rely on an excessive amount of borrowing,"" said Pat Goss, executive director of the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association. \Walker's camp has sought to downplay the budgeting friction as well as the subpar employment figures, highlighting instead an alternative set of federal numbers showing that the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is better than the national average. That is a turnabout for Walker -- during his 2012 recall battle, he cast doubt on the reliability of that federal jobs data when it indicated employment in the state was shrinking. \Such rhetorical moves may be contributing to Walker's declining popularity with Wisconsin voters. ""It's hardly surprising that he minimizes problems,"" said Franklin, the Marquette pollster, ""but there are problems, and his minimization is not compatible with the difficulty we see ourselves in."" \---------- \bsecter@tribpub.com\Credit: By Bob Secter, Chicago Tribune"
271,"
Regarding Stephen Chapman's Feb. 24 column, ""Mass transit takes the taxpayer for a ride to nowhere"": Automobile commuters are reimbursed for their tax contributions to transit by shorter commutes.
\
Traffic congestion is an exponential function. Just a one or two percent increase in the number of vehicles is sufficient to totally jam an expressway. Currently, about 1.5 million people ride CTA trains and buses every workday. If all these people were to drive to work, the added number of vehicles on the road would create the mobility conditions of a permanent blizzard. Time is money.
\
This assumes that everyone could afford a car, residential garage space, insurance, etc. If we were not subsidizing transit, we would have to increase the subsidies government now provides private automobile operation. The result would be much greater transportation subsidies.
\
User fees such as the gas tax do not cover the expense of building, maintaining and policing the expressways. There are many hidden subsidies to automobile use. Companies deduct their cost of providing employee parking.
\
Improved transit service can increase ridership. For a University of Chicago research project, I conducted the first survey on the new Orange Line. The survey was taken of passengers boarding at Pulaski station. Eighteen percent were new transit riders who drove to work before the line opened.
\
The survey also showed a 12 percent increase in patronage of a nearby strip mall among riders. These riders had a solid median household income in 1992 of $30,000 to $40,000. In effect, this new transit facility has created a kind of enterprise zone with real economic benefit for adjacent business. This was in spite of the placement of the shopping mall, out of sight from the station entrance and separated by a hard-to-cross, five-lane street.
\
Part of the reported drop in overall CTA rides is due to population decline in the service area. Could another reason be that the immediate surroundings of transit stations are not exactly inviting, attractively designed, pedestrian-friendly environments?
\
The Orange Line survey showed that people living within easy walk of the station are four times more likely to take the train than others living a little farther away who can take a bus to that station. Current CTA policy ignores the pedestrian-transit relationship and seeks to place stations on renovated lines at least one mile apart.
\
Chicago has no city planning policy to improve the transit station/neighborhood interface. Transit planning here is limited to the intellectual parameters of engineering calculations.
\
Rail transit stations are an unexploited urban resource in Chicago. They could become neighborhood focal points, people-oriented places generating prosperity. Mass transit coordinated with visionary city planning could even encourage more people to get on board.

272," Even though I do not agree with the removal of the gas tax until after the election, the July 2 editorial ""Gas and the ethanol connection"" gives a negative impression of ethanol.\ One fact is clear: Ethanol is a cleaner-burning fuel than gasoline.\ Containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, the products of the burning of ethanol are only products of those elements--mainly carbon dioxide and water.\ There are none of the sulfur-containing compounds that result from burning gasoline.\ So over all, our environment is better.\ Ethanol is also a renewable fuel.\ It is commonly made from things that grow, like corn or even whey, which is the byproduct of the cheesemaking process.\ Every gallon of ethanol burned in an automobile is a gallon of gasoline that we do not take from the ground or purchase from a foreign country. We must use the technology available today to help reduce our usage of petroleum until alternate sources of energy can be found and commercialized.

279," The clear liquid slowly coursed through the exhaust system of the bus parked on LaSalle Street and dripped, drop by drop, into a glass placed on the pavement.\ As reporters watched, Mayor Richard Daley took the glass, hoisted it to his lips, and drank.\ ""It's not bad,"" he declared.\ And on that day, Sept. 11, 1995, Chicago just may have gotten a glimpse of the future of transportation in America. At least, that's what the Bush administration is betting. The Energy Department has announced that it will launch a partnership with U.S. automakers to develop a commercially viable fuel cell to power American cars and trucks.\ That clear liquid Daley sipped--at a press conference announcing the Chicago Transit Authority's participation in a fuel cell pilot program--was harmless. It was water, the only emission from the bus' power plant.\ But a cleaner environment is only one of the benefits offered by fuel cell technology. Fuel cells have no moving parts, for example, and roughly one-sixth the number of total parts of a conventional internal combustion engine. Moreover, while parked in the garage, a fuel cell car could generate enough electricity to handle a home's power needs.\ More important, fuel cells offer the joyous prospect of dramatically less dependence on foreign oil.\ That's because the devices run on hydrogen mixed with oxygen in the air. A chemical reaction produces a flow of electricity to a motor that propels the vehicle.\ But a number of problems must be solved before fuel cells are able to take the place of the traditional engines that now power millions of vehicles. For example, the cost of producing a fuel cell powerful enough to operate a car or light truck is an estimated two to three times the price of a traditional power plant. Moreover, a new fueling infrastructure would have to be installed nationally to dispense hydrogen or other fuels, such as methanol, from which hydrogen can be derived. (Hydrogen can be produced from gasoline, but only with difficulty, and pollutants are created in the process.)\ The new federal program should help address the technological and financial challenges of fuel cell development.\ One sign that the interest from Washington is well placed is that automakers already appear committed to the new technology.\ Ford Motor Co., for example, announced last September that it will launch its first commercial fuel cell vehicle in 2004. Honda plans to have a vehicle on the market by 2003. A General Motors executive, meanwhile, said he expects his company to mass produce cars powered by fuel cells by the end of this decade.\ Encouraging as this may be, however, experts believe it will take years for the new technology to be perfected and to replace the old technology now on the streets and highways of America.\ That is why the government, as it motors ahead on the fuel cell front, also must pursue strategies to open up new sources of oil-- and force much more aggressive conservation. Increasing federal fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks should be considered, and so should a significant increase in the federal gas tax--so long as there is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in other federal taxes."

If we wanted to live near Gurnee Mills or Hawthorn Center, we would have moved there.\While it is true that Highways 83 and 45 are busy during the rush hours, so is every other highway in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. \A recent University of Toronto report called ""The Fundamental Law of Road Congestion: Evidence from US Cities,"" concludes that the extension of interstate highways is met with a proportional increase in traffic in the U.S.\Other studies more than 30 years ago have said that commercial development costs more than the tax revenue it generates due to the costs of roads, fire, police, building and maintenance departments, public service pensions, and, of course, tax breaks given to businesses.\Businesses have a tendency to shop other municipalities for breaks once their tax breaks expire. Politicians should look beyond the projected tax revenues and consider expenses since development leads to higher taxes, environmental destruction, and more traffic congestion for residents.\Harry and Carol Georgas\Long Grove"

283," WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) - President-elect Clinton's promise of a middle-class tax cut may be postponed because of the larger-than-expected deficit and worries about the strength of the economic recovery, congressional leaders said yesterday.\ ""I'm not sure in the light of the present circumstances, that (a tax cut) shouldn't be rethought,"" said House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., who in the past favored such a cut.\ Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., another member of the House Democratic leadership, said he too supports a tax break for middle-income Americans, but ""whether we can afford it under these circumstances is questionable.""\ Clinton and his economic advisers are wrestling with how to handle last week's news from the Bush administration that this year's deficit may hit a record $327 billion - as much as $60 billion larger than had been believed.\ Yesterday's comments by leading Democrats appeared to pave the way for Clinton to back away from one of his central campaign promises.\ Clinton transition officials acknowledged last week that in light of the new deficit estimates, proposals for a middle-class tax cut are being reviewed and that an increase in the gasoline tax - a broad levy that would affect middle-income people - is being viewed more closely.\ Foley, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" said because of the growing deficit any decision on a tax cut should be studied carefully, perhaps limiting benefits to middle-class families with children.\ On the same program Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that while he favors tax code changes to help the middle class it may not be possible this year.\ ""If we can do it this year, fine. If we can't because of the deficit ... then at the earliest opportunity in the future,"" said Mitchell, who argued that middle-income Americans have seen their taxes increase in recent years while high-and low-income people benefited from tax breaks.\ Although Clinton repeatedly has said his first priority as president will be an economic plan addressing recovery and the deficit, the process has slowed because of the changing deficit numbers and questions over whether economic recovery is taking hold.\ As a result, some campaign promises may be threatened, the lawmakers acknowledged.\ ""Some of (the Clinton promises) may have to be deferred. Some of them may not be carried out in the time frame that was originally thought,"" said Fazio, appearing on ABC's ""This Week With David Brinkley.""\ Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., was more blunt.\ ""It could be `read my lips' all over again,"" said Dole, alluding to President Bush's campaign promise in 1988 not to raise taxes, which Bush later abandoned.\ On the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" Dole said there is ""no way"" Clinton will be able to fulfill a campaign promise to cut the deficit in half over the next four years. He also characterized new gasoline taxes as a tax on the middle class.\ As for middle-income Americans, Dole said, ""They may end up, instead of getting a tax cut, may get a tax increase.""\ An increase in gasoline taxes reportedly has gained popularity among Clinton advisers who see it as a way to help cut the deficit and also spur energy conservation and help the environment.\ But such a tax nevertheless is politically controversial.\ Mitchell said he does not expect a gas tax increase to be approved this year. ""With the state of the economy ... it is important that we not have too substantial a tax increase at this time,"" said Mitchell.\ But Foley has urged higher gasoline taxes for some time and said he plans to raise the issue again with the incoming president."

The plan will be available online Monday morning at www.lakecorridorplan.org.\""It's information to help decision making -- good suggestions, good data, good maps,"" said Jason Navota, principal with the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which is guiding this aspect of the Route 53 work.

However, individual communities are not required to get on board.\""There's no requirement municipalities adopt it,"" said Barry Burton, Lake County administrator. ""Whether they do or not, they (will) have other ideas, a broader vision,"" to consider in their planning, he added.\Modifications already were made to the plan after wary communities along the path, including Hawthorn Woods, feared a loss of local control over development.\""We've heard very clearly this needs to give guidance, but it shouldn't be prescriptive on a parcel-by-parcel basis,"" Grove said.\A to-be-determined intergovernmental agreement among corridor members could be a stumbling block.\""The ideas are great, the work is terrific, but unless we know the gums and teeth it's going to be a tough sale,"" said Hawthorn Woods Mayor Joe Mancino.\The Route 53 extension is envisioned as a four-lane boulevard style toll road, but the exact configuration has not been determined. Earlier this year, a committee of public officials and other stakeholders forwarded to the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority a list of recommendations, such as a 4-cent per gallon gas tax, to fund the local share of the $2.35 billion to $2.65 billion project.\Lake County has asked the tollway to advance the project by commissioning an environmental-impact statement.

285," Bush has thrown away all of Clinton's gains\ This letter is in response to all the recent blame Bill Clinton letters. How soon we forget that when Clinton presented his economic plan to Congress, not a single Republican voted for it, saying it would lead to a recession. It passed only because the Congress had a Democratic majority.\ Bill Clinton inherited a $290 billion deficit and turned it into a $250 billion surplus.\ If the current administration had retained Clinton's policies, the national debt would have been eliminated by 2009, and there would be enough in the Social Security fund for baby boomers to retire.\ It took President Bush less than two years to blow it all away. Not only is the surplus gone, but we also are going back into deficits and borrowing from the Social Security fund.\ The war cost $17 billion - where is the rest? Republicans just don't get it. They keep giving our hard-earned tax money to the wealthy and corporations like Enron who never paid any taxes and yet receive a $250 million refund under their stimulus.\ Clinton invested in people. He cut taxes for the working poor, expanded the earned-income tax credit, raised the minimum wage and gave the middle class a $500 per child tax credit. He increased taxes on those making more than $250,000, increased the gas tax less than a nickel and taxed Social Security benefits of those whose average wealth was more than a million dollars.\ His administration created 22.88 million new jobs more than any other single administration. And more than 8 million Americans were lifted out of poverty.\ A typical family's income increased by more than $7,000 and unemployment was down to 3 percent, as opposed to G.W.' s high of 6 percent.\ Clinton gave people hope. All of the above is well-documented in Paul Begala's new book, ""It's Still the Economy Stupid.""\ Under Clinton, we had eight years of peace and prosperity. Bush has brought us to the brink of war; he is ruining the environment and the economy; and he has done more to denigrate the presidency than Clinton ever could.\ Cecile Powell\ Schaumburg\ O'Malley's service to state appreciated\ State Sen.

286,"
For Democrats worried about a rising tide of anti-incumbent feeling among voters, the changing face of the Washington budget spectacle is providing some comfort as Election Day nears.
\
Until George Bush's presidency began careening around a failed budget summit last week, the pervasive feeling among political professionals was that angry voters would direct their rage at Democrats.
\
After all, Democrats control both houses of Congress and most state legislatures. And Democrats understand that for all his travails, Bush in not on the ballot in November.
\
Certainly there are GOP incumbents who could be swept out by disaffected voters, but it has been Republicans who have been feeding the fires of anti-incumbent feeling and who have signed on with popular anti-politician notions like limiting terms of office.
\
Three weeks ago, Republicans were strutting. Charles Black, chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee, saw it this way:
\
""The combination of a clear Republican message (on deficit-reduction) and the anti-incumbent fever rising in the electorate will defeat Democratic congressmen and senators who today have no idea what's in store for them.""
\
That clear Republican message was lost in the dramatic events of the last two weeks, with national monuments shut down and Congress dithering all night on cable television.
\
Voters witnessed an internal Republican revolt over the budget agreement and were confused as Bush's mind appeared to wander on taxes.
\
Before the GOP debacle, Democrats comforted themselves with a well-established rule of American politics.
\
""Our polling shows what it always shows,"" said Howard Schloss of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ""Voters may be unhappy with the institution, but they're pretty happy with their own guy.""
\
That brand of thinking, as well as the considerable benefits of incumbency, is what sets the latest re-election rate for the House at 98 percent. But some observers think it may be changing.
\
""With just a few weeks to go, we're starting to get worried about real problems for incumbents,"" said one Democratic operative. ""People really are unhappy with government, with the antics they saw on C-span during the budget debate.
\
""We think incumbents who have credible (Republican) challengers for the House and Senate may have real races before it's over. What works for us is that most of the challengers aren't very good and don't have any money.""
\
Voter anger has already manifested itself in every part of the country.
\
Maverick Republican David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, lost to a three-term Democratic incumbent in Louisiana's Senate primary last weekend, but won 59 percent of the white vote.
\
He did it with a campaign targeting affirmative-action programs, minority set-aside contracts and welfare, along with a reflexive populist attack on his opponent's incumbency.
\
Democrats in Massachusetts picked a college president over the party favorite in the recent gubernatorial primary, choosing a self-proclaimed outsider who placed himself as far as possible from outgoing Gov. Michael Dukakis.
\
Oklahoma voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot initiative to limit state legislators' terms, and voters in California and Colorado are expected to do the same next month.
\
But the concerns of Democrats, the party with the most to lose in the current environment, have been eased in recent days. The battle over a deficit-reduction package has been transformed into a wrangle over taxes.
\
When 105 of 176 House Republicans voted against the original deficit agreement, their number included incumbents who felt abandoned by the presidential retreat on taxes, like Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
\
For their part, Democrats walked away from Bush and their own leadership in the face of a gas tax and increased Medicare costs.
\
By week's end, even Bush's closest advisers were searching for the presidential position on taxes and what has come to be called ""burden-sharing.""
\
Republicans, meanwhile, were concerned that continuing budget anarchy would hurt them rather than Democrats on Nov. 6. And Democrats now think Bush has put his party at risk by moving around on taxes, the most volatile of political properties.
\
""Right now, this argument is about who pays,"" said an aide to Democratic congressional leadership, ""and we think we're pretty well positioned on that.""

288,"
In response to a federal threat to cut off $350 million in highway funds, an Illinois legislator proposed Wednesday that the state's vehicle emissions testing program be expanded to the western halves of Du Page and Lake counties.
\
The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Patrick Welch (D., Peru), is the first sign that the General Assembly will grapple with ways to change the much-criticized testing program in the spring session, rather than risk the loss of vital federal dollars.
\
Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency told the state that it had to beef up the emissions tests by the end of the spring session or it would lose $350 million in federal funds for Chicago-area highway construction projects.
\
The agency wants the state to cut vehicle emissions by a further 20 percent by expanding the boundaries of the testing area or by toughening the tests with additional inspections, such as a check to make sure vehicle pollution-control equipment has not been removed.
\
Welch said his bill could be amended to include steps to toughen the test if they are deemed necessary to placate the federal government.
\
""We've got a hammer over our head,"" Welch said, predicting that his bill will win approval. ""I don't think anybody wants us to lose highway funds.""
\
Welch, who is chairman of the senate Energy and Environment Committee, said that widening the area included in the program ""will bring us a long way toward meeting the federal requirements.""
\
A more comprehensive testing program is part of the EPA's strategy for fighting ozone in the area of Chicago, one of nine cities with the worst air pollution in the country.
\
Vehicle emissions contribute almost half of the airborne chemicals that cook in the atmosphere on hot days to form ozone, which threatens the health of infants, the elderly and people with respiratory ailments.
\
Under Welch's proposal, up to an additional 325,000 vehicles would be required to have annual emission tests starting in 1991. Including the currently exempted portions of Du Page and Lake Counties would increase by 12 percent the number of gasoline-powered vehicles covered by the program.
\
Under existing regulations, about 2.6 million cars in Cook County and the eastern portions of Du Page and Lake counties now must have yearly emissions tests. The expanded testing area would add as much as $3 million to the cost of the program, which currently costs $22 million a year.
\
The state gas tax, which funds the project, could absorb the increase, Welch said.
\
The current dividing line in both of the collar counties zigs and zags by ZIP codes. In Du Page, Downers Grove, Lombard and Glen Ellyn are in the testing area, but Wheaton, parts of Naperville, and West Chicago are not.
\
In Lake County, the lakefront communities of Highland Park, Lake Forest, and Waukegan are inside the area, but Lake Zurich, Hawthorn Woods, and North Barrington are outside.
\
The western portions of both counties have grown rapidly since the General Assembly established the program. Including them in the testing program is seen as one of the easiest ways of complying with federal demands for a tougher testing system.
\
""One of the reasons that I'm doing this is because if highway funding for Chicago goes, the state will make the up lost money from Downstate projects,"" said Welch, who will formally announce his proposed bill Thursday at a Chicago press conference.
\
""It's in our interest to make sure we don't pay a secondary price for the failure of the state to do anything about this program.""
\
The inspection program has been unpopular in Springfield since the beginning. It was set up in 1986 only after the federal government threatened to withhold highway money and last spring the Senate voted not to renew it. The House did not follow suit, which kept the program alive.
\
Maggie Catt of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that her agency is preparing its own plan to expand the emissions testing program. The agency's proposal must be submitted to the federal government by Tuesday to keep the EPA from initiating the process that could result in the loss of highway funds.

290,"
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas behaved like jittery front-runners Friday night, while former California Gov. Jerry Brown flailed away at both Democrats and the political process in a one-hour TV forum aired in Chicago and Detroit.
\
With presidential primaries set for Illinois and Michigan on Tuesday, the three major Democratic candidates tangled over tax fairness, jobs and economic growth, and often over Clinton's record in Arkansas.
\
Clinton and Tsongas, running one-two in the polls in Illinois and Michigan, continued to spar over the wisdom of a proposed middle-class tax cut, an issue that has dominated every Democratic TV debate from New Hampshire to Texas.
\
As he has at every stop, Tsongas insisted that his opposition to the tax cut reflected the gravity of his White House campaign, which has focused on the establishment of an industrial policy and an expanding manufacturing base.
\
""This country needs a leader who will say, `No more candy, no more Santa Claus,' "" Tsongas said.
\
Citing newspaper endorsements, he continued to portray himself as the Democrat with the serious, no-nonsense message.
\
His rivals have suggested that the Tsongas model smacks of trickle-down economics.
\
Acknowledging that he and Tsongas agreed on many issues, Clinton argued that his economic plan was hinged on tax fairness, insisting that his plan ""put people first.""
\
He unleashed a pointed attack on Tsongas' oft-stated economic strategy, which includes a proposed 50-cent increase in the gas tax over 10 years and a reduction in the capital gains tax.
\
""He wants to continue to grind the middle class and lower middle class into the dirt,"" Clinton said of Tsongas' economic notions. ""He wants to give the rich something and punish the middle class.""
\
Tsongas insisted that Clinton had raised the most regressive of taxes, including gas and sales, while serving as governor, but Clinton argued that the revenue from the increase was aimed at education and improving infrastructure.
\
Arkansas, he said, enjoyed one of the nation's lowest rankings in state and local tax burden.
\
Brown, who has concentrated his effort among the beleaguered automobile workers, in Michigan, attacked Clinton's labor record while serving 11 years in Little Rock.
\
He lashed out at the Arkansan's support of ""fast track"" legislation, which allowed the president to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
\
""Gov. Clinton went to Korea and begged . . . `Come over here, we've got slave labor here . . . ,' "" Brown said of a number of economic-recruitment trips Clinton has made as governor.
\
""That's what they're doing in Mexico.""
\
Brown continued to argue for scrapping the federal tax code and replacing it with a 13 percent flat income tax.
\
He cited a ""living family wage"" and ""enterprise zones"" as the centerpiece of his economic strategy, and urged supporters, including those in organized labor, to help him ""break the gridlock"" of special-interest politics.
\
Brown did not respond when moderator Bill Kurtis asked him about financial contributions from labor unions.
\
Health-care reform and the state of the environment, staples of earlier TV debates, barely got a mention Friday as candidates wooed Midwestern voters hit hard by a slumping economy.
\
Clinton, who swept last Tuesday's round of Southern primaries, was clearly the target Friday night. On a foreign-policy question, Tsongas suggested that Clinton had waffled in saying he backed President Bush's use of force in the Persian Gulf last year.
\
""I said I would not have voted to deny the president the authority to follow the United Nations resolution,"" Clinton insisted.
\
The debate aired on Chicago's WBBM-TV-Ch. 2 and was shown simultaneously on WXYZ-TV, the CBS affiliate in Detroit.
\
A second TV forum will be broadcast Sunday at 6 p.m. on WLS-TV-Ch. 7, and will air simultaneously in Michigan.

291,"Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked the advancement of a transportation bill, a piece of legislation that traditionally has enjoyed broad bipartisan support.\The vote was 52-44, short of the 60 needed to take up the bill. \""I don't know why everything we do has to be a fight,"" lamented Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the parties are close to an agreement on amendments that would be considered. \Last week, Republicans tried to tack on a measure that would have allowed employers, on religious grounds, to opt out of new federal rules requiring insurance companies to offer certain services, including contraceptive care. \Advancing the legislation in the Senate was seen as a crucial step, as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, struggled to corral votes in that chamber in the face of a backlash against federal spending. \Democratic leaders are portraying the standoff as another showdown led by right-flank conservatives. \""What we're seeing on the highway bill is a repeat of the payroll tax cut debate,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., referring to the recent battle to extend the reduction in Social Security payroll taxes for the rest of 2012. ""It's time for Republicans to stop letting the far right call the shots."" \Transportation bills have traditionally been among the most popular legislation, often passing with strong bipartisan support. \This year's efforts have been seen by supporters as crucial to boosting the nation's still-sluggish economy by saving or creating as many as 3 million jobs. \But detractors, particularly conservatives, are resisting the costs at a time when lawmakers are focused on deficit reduction. Though the legislation is a priority for Boehner, Republicans have been forced to rewrite their bill after a rebellion within their ranks over a variety of issues, including its five-year, $260 billion price tag. \""The bill before the Senate spends more than we can afford,"" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., wrote Tuesday in The Washington Post. ""If we fail this small test, how will we ever pass a sweeping agreement to cut the deficit?"" \Republicans in the Senate said Tuesday they had agreed to a ""reasonable"" list of amendments, according to a GOP leadership aide, but Democrats had not yet signed off on the deal. \A major challenge facing congressional leaders is to maintain the current level of funding for popular road projects without adding to the federal budget deficit. \Because consumers are buying more fuel-efficient cars, the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax isn't raising enough money to maintain current funding. \And with Congress ending the practice of lawmakers earmarking funds for pet projects, leaders have limited opportunities to dole out incentives to bring in votes. Earmarking helped win votes for bills in the past but sparked an outcry after the last big transportation bill, in 2005, was filled with thousands of earmarks. \""Do any of you have any idea how difficult it is to do a transportation bill without earmarks?"" House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., said this year. \""It's a lot harder to win votes when you don't have goodies to pass out,"" Boehner recently acknowledged. \Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who as chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is leading the bill through the debate, recently told her colleagues that with support from organizations including labor unions and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ""There is no reason for us not to get this done."" \----------\rsimon@tribune.com\Credit: By Richard Simon and Lisa Mascaro, Tribune Newspapers"
292," As thousands of delinquent Peoples Gas customers face the threat of service shut-offs, the city and the utility Tuesday announced a new program designed to help low-income residents pay overdue bills.\ Initially, $2 million will be available under the program, including $1 million contributed by City Hall and $1 million by the gas company. Officials acknowledged it will not be a cure-all for Chicagoans who have seen their gas bills skyrocket.\ Nevertheless, the program will provide a measure of relief that otherwise would not have been available. Additional funding is also being sought from other sources, said William Abolt, city environment commissioner.\ Mayor Richard Daley is expected to ask the City Council to appropriate the city's $1 million at a council meeting Wednesday.\ The goal is to help as many people as possible become current with the gas company so they can concentrate on taking other measures, including enrolling in the company's budget payment plan and making energy conservation improvements to their homes in advance of next winter's heating season, Abolt said.\ Under the program, customers will pay one-third of their outstanding bills. Another third will come from the city's funds and the remainder will come from Peoples' contribution to the program.\ Qualified senior citizens and customers with disabilities will be given the first chance to participate. Additional information, including income eligibility requirements, is available by calling 866-556-6001.\ The program mirrors a proposal made March 12 by activist and former Illinois state treasurer Pat Quinn.\ ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,"" Quinn said Tuesday. ""This is a good blueprint to help people ... who have nowhere to turn.""\ Quinn asserted that the city should ante $10 million from a ""windfall"" of as much as $40 million from its 8 percent tax on gas bills, and he said Peoples should match that contribution.\ Abolt said extra gas-tax revenue this year will be about $12 million, which is being used to pay the city's own high gas bills, meet other expenses related to cold weather and fund a variety of energy-conservation and homeowner-assistance programs, including the one announced Tuesday.\ City and Peoples Gas officials said their program was under discussion before Quinn made his proposal.\ About 18,500 utility customers who have paid nothing toward their gas bills since at least Dec. 1 face service termination beginning April 2. In May, customers whose accounts are more than 90 days delinquent will be shut off.\ Meanwhile, the city Water Department announced Tuesday that it will delay termination of water service to severely delinquent customers until May 1 because of the financial strain caused by other utility bills. Shut-offs usually begin April 1.\ ""There's no reason why the accounts of the average Chicago homeowner shouldn't be paid in full,"" said Water Commissioner Richard Rice. ""But we know that budgets are tight, and if people are having trouble paying their bills, they need to work with us to get into a payment plan."""
293,"The next mayor should have a chief mobility officer to handle issues like ride-share regulation and self-driving cars, as technology continues to change how we get around, according to a new report. \The report from Mayor Rahm Emanuel's mobility task force also recommends a pilot program this year for electric scooters, and an increase in the state gas tax.\""Look, somebody's got to pay for this,"" said former U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray La Hood, who chaired the task force. ""Transportation is not free.""\The Emanuel administration formed the task force back in September. Its 20 members include academics, government officials and members of the private sector.\The group developed guidelines to manage a multi-modal transportation system, with old technology like CTA buses interacting with new ways to travel like Uber and Lyft. Among the goals of the task force was a system that is better for the environment, reduces dependence on single-occupant vehicle trips and makes the city easier to live in.\The task force came up with 50 separate recommendations, covering concerns such as accessibility, congestion and the drop in public transit use.\For example, the task force proposed that the city try an electric scooter pilot this year, within a defined area instead of all over the city. Scooter speed would be capped at 15 mph, to help prevent some of the injuries seen in other cities. Chicago would collect information on how scooter rental companies manage sidewalk clutter, and how scooters could affect other transportation choices, like transit, the report said.\Scooters have been a source of contention in other cities because of concerns that they can litter sidewalks and pose a safety hazard to riders and pedestrians.\Emanuel said in an interview that the next mayor needs to learn from other cities what works and what doesn't. He suggested that scooters could be integrated into the bike share system, and there should be someplace for scooters to be docked.\""People are just dumping it as if the sidewalk is their bedroom, and that's not appropriate,"" Emanuel said of the scooter programs in other cities.\The city also must modify its laws to allow for scooters and electric bikes in bike lanes and clarify where they should not be used, like on sidewalks, the report said.\The task force also proposed a uniform requirement for data from all ride-share companies -- such as information about where passengers are picked up and dropped off -- which would help the city figure out how ride-share is affecting traffic. The ride-share industry has exploded in the city, from 2 million monthly trips in 2015 to 9 million in 2018, and has been blamed both for increased congestion downtown and lower use of transit, the report said.\The report suggested that the city could adjust its fee structure to encourage high-capacity, less-polluting trips. This could mean lower fees for pooled-ride share trips over individual trips, or dropping lease payments for bike-share.\Another proposal is that individual ride-share drivers could get tax credits for going into lower-income neighborhoods, instead of having that credit go to the company.\The report also suggested creating a pilot to find the best way to handle curb management for short-time users like cabs and delivery trucks; expanding Ventra to include more modes of transportation; and creating more bus rapid transit. The CTA could aim for an all-electric bus fleet by 2040, the report said.\""The next mayor and the new City Council will really be the ones to act upon these recommendations,"" said Ron Burke, executive director of the Active Transportation Alliance, who was on the task force. ""I think the report points us in the right direction and I hope the next mayor considers it.""\Emanuel said the next mayor ""would be smart"" to adopt the recommendations, and that he is leaving the city's transportation system in better shape than it was when he found it. He pointed to more than $8 billion in projects on the CTA, 115 miles of protected bike lanes and other achievements.\The candidates for mayor, former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, have not yet received copies of the report, according to the mayor's office. Both have agreed in the past with some of the ideas in the report, such as expanding bus rapid transit.\----------\mwisniewski@chicagotribune.com\Twitter @marywizchicago\CAPTION: Photo: Mayor Rahm Emanuel's mobility task force developed guidelines to manage a multi-modal transportation system, with old technology like CTA buses interacting with new.

294,"Without quick action by Congress, the U.S. Transportation Department may begin scaling back or halting work on thousands of roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects at the height of the construction season this July, when the nation's Highway Trust Fund is expected to run dry.\As recent spending battles in Washington have shown, finding bipartisan cooperation to prevent the fund from becoming insolvent will be no easy task, particularly in an election year. \The standoff is the latest example of partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill, reminiscent of similar battles over the budget. Some are already referring to the transportation funding deadline as the ""highway cliff,"" a reference to the 2012 ""fiscal cliff"" fight over expiring tax rates and the debt ceiling. \On Wednesday, President Barack Obama prodded Congress to move quickly, calling infrastructure investment essential to the nation's economic future. \""First-class infrastructure attracts first-class jobs,"" Obama said, standing against the backdrop of one of the nation's most ambitious projects -- New York's aging Tappan Zee Bridge and its partially built $4 billion replacement. \Failure to agree on new funding sources for the Highway Trust Fund will put at risk more than 112,000 highway projects, 5,600 transit programs and nearly 700,000 jobs, the White House warned. \In addition to keeping federal money flowing, lawmakers must come up with a longer-term solution to close a projected $16 billion annual shortfall in the fund. But key figures on Capitol Hill remain at odds over how to make up the gap. \Washington is in this jam because taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, which provide 90 percent of the revenues for the Highway Trust Fund, no longer raise sufficient money to support the programs, in part because cars have become more fuel-efficient. \Congress last passed a major transportation bill in 2012, authorizing spending on everything from public transit to safety programs. Major business groups and labor unions are pushing lawmakers to pass a longer-term package. Some lawmakers are also eager to renew the bill because it would give them an opportunity to trumpet the role of the federal government. \Lawmakers are only now taking their first steps. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, announced a bipartisan proposal this week that would keep highway spending at existing levels, indexed for inflation, for six years. But the plan was silent on the key question of how to replenish the trust fund, leaving that to the Senate Finance Committee. \The previous two-year transportation bill relied on tapping funds from the Treasury to make up for a projected gap, but it ran dry faster than anticipated. \One proposed solution would increase the current 18.4-cent-per-gallon gas tax. Federal fuel taxes have not been raised since 1993, but doing so this year seems unlikely when the entire House and more than a third of the Senate is up for election. \Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House transportation committee, has yet to put forward a proposal. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., the departing chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called for dedicating $126.5 billion to the trust fund as part of a major overhaul of the nation's tax code, which would fully pay for highway projects for eight years. \The White House has also called for replenishing the trust fund through an overhaul of the corporate tax system. \""This is an area where there is bipartisan interest,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters this week. ""It's just that we have to play this out and work hard every day to make progress on it."" \But prospects for a major deal on tax reform are dim, and time is running out for other proposals to emerge. \""The uncertainty is troubling,"" said David Parkhurst, staff director for the National Governors Association's office of federal relations, noting that states are likely to bear the brunt of the impact if the funding lapse is not avoided. \""The states have spent the money. The states have paid the bill,"" Parkhurst said. ""If the trust fund shortfall goes down to zero and the federal government is unable to make those cash reimbursement payments to the states for work already done, the states are on the hook."" \---------- \khennessey@tribune.com\Credit: By Kathleen Hennessey and Michael A.

295,"In today's partisan environment, many politicians tend to hew close to their base and not worry about angering their opponents, but Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder possesses a rare talent for raising hackles on both sides.\In early December, the Republican governor angered the state's powerful labor unions by signing right-to-work legislation allowing workers to opt out of union membership. \Then this month, Snyder annoyed Michigan's small-government conservatives with a plan to expand Medicaid and raise the gas tax for road repairs. \Snyder, 54, smiles when asked about this knack. \""I'm here to deliver results to my customers,"" he said. ""My customers are the citizens of Michigan."" \Now he has in his hands the fate of 700,000 customers -- the residents of Detroit. \A Snyder-appointed review panel said last week that the city is in financial crisis and needs outside help, leaving it to the governor to decide whether he will name an emergency manager to take over its finances. \Snyder said if he decides to name an emergency manager for Detroit, that person must have experience in difficult financial situations such as restructuring and bankruptcy. \""There is very limited political upside to appointing an emergency manager,"" said University of Michigan political scientist Michael Traugott. \""But I think Snyder is prepared to do it."" \He might have gotten additional incentive Friday, when Detroit topped Forbes' list of most miserable cities in the U.S. \A CEO-turned-politician, Snyder does not easily fit into an ideological slot. \Many of those who know him describe a long-term thinker who approaches politics through the eyes of a businessman and does not avoid tough decisions. \Vic Strecher recalled that when Snyder's venture capital firm invested $2.5 million in 1998 for 30 percent of his fledgling online health care coaching business HealthMedia Inc. (now owned by Johnson & Johnson), Snyder took a hands-off approach, telling Strecher to get on and run the firm. \When ""dot-com turned to dot-bomb"" in 2000, Strecher said Snyder was ""always a steady force"" with a vision for his firm. \For Snyder's foes on the left such as United Auto Workers President Bob King, the governor has pursued a right-wing agenda after running as a moderate in 2010. \King says his goal in 2014 is to prevent Snyder from gaining a second term. \""He told people he was a moderate, and he has done the exact opposite, passing some of the most extreme right-wing legislation,"" King said. \""We'll back a candidate (in 2014) who is for 100 percent of the people, not just the top 1 percent."" \Conservatives have opposed Snyder for taxing pensioners and supporting a health exchange for Michigan that is part of President Barack Obama's health care reforms. But they like the fact he has fixed the state's budget mess. \Long-time conservative operative Jack Hoogendyk says Snyder is a ""bit of an enigma."" \""He does a lot of things true conservatives support and a lot of things conservatives disagree with,"" he said. \""But I think he views the state's problems through the lens of a businessman and has taken a level-headed approach to running Michigan Inc."" \When Snyder, formerly CEO of venture capital firm Ardesta, decided to run for governor in the 2010 election, he was a political unknown. \Snyder's campaign, much of it self-funded, included a 2010 Super Bowl ad in Michigan describing him as ""One Tough Nerd"" who could fix Michigan's fiscal mess. \Snyder says his decisions are based on the simple question of what is best for Michigan, not partisan politics. \Medicaid expansion, he said, will save the state money because it will provide primary care to poorer Michiganders rather than force them into expensive emergency care that drives up premiums for everyone. \As for a second term, Snyder seems ready. \""I haven't formally announced,"" he said. ""But I've got more work I'd like to do."" \On the issue of Detroit, Snyder reiterates a statement from his 2010 campaign that ""Detroit needs to be a great city."" \He highlights transportation investments and the need for a new bridge to boost trade and create jobs. \""So let's get the city government's finances fixed,"" he said. \""And we are going to get them fixed.""\Credit: By Nick Carey, Reuters"
296," McCoppin was wrong\ Ignorant stereotypes such as Bob McCoppin's comment about Hispanics and children not having the luxury of driving should not be printed in your newspaper.\ Hispanics have been a part of this country for almost 400 years. Most of us have achieved the same standard of living as other Americans.\ Hence, we also drive cars.\ So, let's leave racist comments such as McCoppin's in barrooms and out of the Daily Herald.\ Hubert Morales\ Geneva\ Gas-price fighting ideas\ I have been reading and seeing on the news the talk about the gas prices here in our area.\ I would imagine that like myself, most other John and Jane Q. Public are really getting quite angry and upset about this state of affairs, particularly as it's only here in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas.\ It's just completely outrageous to the point where a couple of days ago, I actually saw a man beating a gas pump with the nozzle. Somebody needs to really wake up and take notice because folks are getting ticked.\ When I say somebody, I mean everybody from the oil people to the EPA.\ I realize that a number of politicians are trying to do their bit, but so far, it just doesn't seem to be enough.\ As just one citizen, I'd like to suggest a few actions:\ 1. I don't know if the governor has any more out-of-country trips planned, but now would not be a good time.\ Actually, any time in the foreseeable future would probably not be a good time.\ 2. Repeal or temporarily lift the state gas tax, like Indiana's governor has done.\ I'll tell ya, Georgie, it might only be 10 cents a gallon for each taxpayer, but for right now, anything will help (and be remembered come voting time).\ 3. The EPA should seriously look at grandfathering their mandate to the oil companies for this new fuel. Not so much for the benefit of the oil people, but for the common man and woman.\ I believe in the environment and all, but I also like to be able to drive and see it.\ Also, being able to buy groceries isn't bad, either.\ 4. Now, to the oil companies. In this day and age of crooked politicians and big-business types, is it really that much of a stretch for people to think there's price fixing and gouging going on? I don't think so.\ Perhaps in order for these conglomerates to take notice, the taxpaying citizen could commence a boycott - not for just a day or two, but for a full week or even a month.\ I realize we couldn't go without gas for that amount of time and still make it to our jobs and so forth.\ My thought is that for one week all of us boycott a particular oil company and their gas stations throughout the Chicago-Milwaukee area or maybe even statewide.\ It could be done alphabetically starting with oil companies that begin with ""A"", then on to the ""Bs"" the next week, and so on.\ If they insist on hurting us in our pockets, let's hurt them in theirs.\ Tom Steveley\ Elgin\ Learn without dissection\ Thanks to support from numerous young people, their parents, teachers and animal advocates, Gov.

297," While it won't solve all of Lake County's traffic problems, extending Route 53 north from Lake-Cook Road is the ""most significant and responsible alternative,"" says Roger Byrne, Republican candidate for state representative in the new 59th District.\ The Vernon Hills village president Monday announced a six-step plan to deal with traffic congestion. The plan includes more train and bus service and improving other roads. But the controversial Route 53 extension - which could cost between $800 million and $1 billion and has been around in one form or another for decades - topped his to-do list.\ ""Personally, I think we have to make a stronger push and organized effort to get federal funds,"" said Byrne, 53. ""There's been enough studying done. It's time to make a decision and build a road.""\ Democratic opponent Kathy Ryg, 50, a Vernon Hills trustee and chief deputy at the Lake County recorder of deeds office, says the proposed Route 53 extension is a matter of dealing with what you've got.\ ""I'm not against it,"" she said. ""I'm against holding it out as the solution when there's no funds to follow through.""\ That doesn't mean 53 should be dropped from the list of possibilities, she said. But it has to be realistically considered in a bigger picture presented with a unified front.\ Instead of chasing dollars that don't exist, Ryg has proposed a summit with the Illinois Department of Transportation, Illinois Toll Highway Authority, local elected officials and representatives from the Sierra Club and Lake County Conservation Alliance to discuss a comprehensive plan to include expansion of major east- west roads and other improvements.\ ""The new roads like 53 are the long end of the continuum - you have your plan in place and as you have your resources, you apply them to the plan,"" she said.\ Byrne said he is ""prepared to fight"" for the construction of the new highway north from Lake-Cook Road more than 12 miles to south of Route 120. The new road, with three lanes in each direction, would then continue another 14 miles to connect with Wilson Road on the west and Route 41 on the east.\ He said the 53 option would save travel time, cost less and be less disruptive to the environment and residents than other plans.\ The Lake County Contractors Association backs that position. On Monday, the group unveiled a semitrailer with ""Build 53"" painted in huge letters on the side. The trailer was placed in the parking lot at Hawthorn Center mall and will be moved to other locations throughout the county as the campaign progresses. The election is Nov. 5.\ Whether it would be built as a freeway or tollway is uncertain, said Byrne, who was joined at a press conference by state Reps. Mark Beaubien of Barrington Hills and Suzanne Simpson of the Gurnee area.\ ""We feel there's federal funding available. We'd have to make an organized effort,"" said Byrne.\ ""I'm convinced that promoting it now without the plan to pay for it raises people's expectations and you can't deliver,"" Ryg countered, saying Byrne has been chasing the Route 53 project for years without success.\ With other wish list projects higher in priority, it is unlikely Route 53 would be on the state radar for many years, said Beaubien, leaving federal or Illinois Toll Highway Authority funds as the only option.\ Byrne's plan for traffic relief draws on information from the Lake County Transportation Improvement Project, a joint effort of state, tollway and local transportation planners as well as the Chicago Area Transportation Study and the Regional Transportation Authority.\ As it stands, extending 53 north or improving existing roads are the two options still on the state's table, with the final decision to be made by either Gov. George Ryan or his successor.\ Byrne says nearly 50 communities as well as municipal organizations, business interests and others have support a 53 extension. Byrne also is a board member of the Citizens to Protect Quality of Life Through Better Transportation, a pro-53 group founded three years ago by Libertyville businessman Jack Martin.\ A telephone survey by that group found two-thirds of respondents supported extending Route 53. Opponents, including the Environmental Law & Policy Center, say the results were biased and wouldn't be supported by a toll increase to pay for the project.\ As for other transportation improvements, Byrne said he would support an increase in the gas tax. Ryg said she favors letting voters decide in a referendum.\ The 59th District includes all or portions of Wheeling, Buffalo Grove, Vernon Hills, Lincolnshire, Riverwoods, Mettawa, Green Oaks, Gurnee, Park City and Waukegan."
298,"BLOOMINGTON — U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis thinks Democrats could do tremendous economic damage if they don't act fast on the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USCMA).\""If you want a recession, don't pass the USMCA,"" said the Taylorville Republican.\""It's all up to (House) Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi. She could put that bill on the floor the moment we get back to Washington, and I think you'd see an overwhelming bipartisan passage,"" he said. ""The only excuse I can see for not putting it up is ... pure partisan politics heading into a presidential election.""\Democrats, including Pelosi, have been negotiating for stronger protections for workers and the environment in the deal, the Associated Press reported.\Davis joined U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Dunlap, to discuss USMCA and other issues, many of them economic, during the McLean County Chamber of Commerce's State of Congress event Tuesday at the Holiday Inn & Suites Bloomington-Airport in Bloomington.\Enid Schlipf, a McLean County Farm Bureau representative who owns a farm near Gridley, said he was encouraged by the discussion, but he remains concerned about the USMCA and a trade war between the U.S. and China.\""The congressman (LaHood) pointed out 40 percent of our exports flow into Canada or Mexico, so trade is critical, particularly in agriculture. That drives the engine in McLean County and Central Illinois,"" said Schlipf.\""The bigger challenge is the ongoing trade war with China, and I'm glad they addressed that. Agriculture has spent 30 years developing a market with China, to where they were using 27 percent of U.S. soybeans, and we have lost that market,"" he said. ""That's not going to be easily regained.""\Davis and LaHood both told the Chamber they continue to disagree with Republican President Donald Trump on tariffs — fees on imported goods, which LaHood called ""a tax on consumers"" — though LaHood also defended Trump punishing China for failing to crack down on market abuses.\""If we can't pass a deal like (USMCA) in the House of Representatives, do the Chinese officials really believe that we're going to pass a bilateral Chinese-American agreement? Come on. There's no incentive for them,"" said Davis.\LaHood said he's also concerned China is prepared to fight longer than the administration expects.\Both said they hope to see the federal government pass an infrastructure initiative like Illinois did this spring, though Davis said it needs to include more than a gas tax increase. LaHood noted Illinois and several other states, including some with Republican governors, have hiked that tax recently.\Davis and LaHood said they don't foresee federal action, however, on two other issues Illinois changed this spring: recreational marijuana and a minimum wage increase. LaHood said he prefers to let lower-level governments set a minimum wage if they want, and neither sees federal marijuana laws changing soon.\""There is more student debt in this country than all credit card and auto debt combined,"" Davis said. ""If you don't think we have to do something about that, IO think you're putting your head in the sand.""\Both said they hope to act on a looming crisis for multiple-employer pension plans, which are insured by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. That's a relief for John Penn, vice president and Midwest regional manager for Laborers' International Union of North America.\""A couple big funds are in trouble that could bankrupt that PBGC if we do nothing,"" said Penn, including a Teamsters fund, ""so the fact Congress is aware of that and looking at that is key.""\Contact Derek Beigh at (309) 820-3234.

299," Gas-price fighting ideas\ I have been reading and seeing on the news the talk about the gas prices here in our area.\ I would imagine that like myself, most other John and Jane Q. Publics are really getting quite angry and upset about this state of affairs, particularly as it is only here in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas.\ It is just completely outrageous to the point where a couple of days ago, I actually saw a man beating a gas pump with the nozzle. Somebody needs to really wake up and take notice because folks are getting ticked.\ When I say somebody, I mean everybody from the oil people to the EPA. I realize that a number of politicians are trying to do their bit, but so far, it just doesn't seem to be enough.\ As just one citizen, I'd like to suggest a few actions in addition to the legislature's recent six-month suspension of the state gas tax:\ 1. I don't know if the governor has any more out-of-country trips planned, but now would not be a good time. Actually, any time in the foreseeable future would probably not be a good time.\ 2. The EPA should seriously look at grandfathering their mandate to the oil companies for this new fuel. Not so much for the benefit of the oil people, but for the common man and woman. I believe in the environment and all, but I also like to be able to drive and see it. Also, being able to buy groceries isn't bad either.\ 3. Now, to the oil companies. In this day and age of crooked politicians and big-business types, is it really that much of a stretch for people to think there is price fixing and gouging going on? I don't think so.\ Perhaps in order for these conglomerates to take notice, the taxpaying citizen could commence a boycott - not for just a day or two, but for a full week or even a month.\ I realize we couldn't go without gas for that amount of time and still make it to our jobs and so forth.\ My thought is that for one week all of us boycott a particular oil company and its gas stations throughout the Chicago-Milwaukee area or maybe even statewide.\ It could be done alphabetically starting with oil companies that begin with ""A,"" then on to ""B"" the next week, and so on.\ If they insist on hurting us in our pockets, let's hurt them in theirs.\ Tom Steveley\ Elgin\ Flag worth a little noise\ This is in regard to the noisy flag article of June 14. I'm sure if the neighbors who are concerned with noise would just take a moment to reflect, they would reconsider their thinking.\ Thomas LaBarbera of Grayslake is displaying Old Glory, an emblem of strength, peace and hope to millions all over this earth.\ He is to be commended for taking the time to display the flag in the appropriate manner and rightfully giving her the respect she deserves.\ This flag represents the many men and women (not to mention their families) who have sacrificed by losing either their lives or limbs so those of us who are left can enjoy the many freedoms we are beginning to take for granted:\ - Living in nice homes.\ - Shopping centers and strip malls a few miles away, where we can go and purchase ""things"" we need for our homes and families.\ - Fast-food chains to cater to our every whim, whether it be organically grown veggies for that just-right salad or a big, juicy hamburger.\ - Barbecuing with the family and friends on special days.\ - Driving the SUV of our choice.\ - Freedom from tyranny.\ Take a moment and consider that we are a free people because there were those who disrupted their lives to fight for it.\ Talk about noise - how about constant bombardment from enemy fire, missiles and large-caliber weapons.\ Our soldiers didn't have the luxury of complaining about the noise. They went and did their duty to this country.\ Some of them didn't come back to nice homes, shopping malls, fast- food chains, barbecuing with their family and friends or driving an SUV.\ Think about it, folks.\ Maybe there are some things more important in life than losing a little sleep.\ Cynthia P. Haase\ Elburn\ Abandoning safe sex?\ Today's Health Bulletin column reports that gonorrhea climbed 9 percent in 1998.\ In true government fashion, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""speculates"" that the populace is abandoning ""safe sex"" practices because of the introduction of more effective drugs.\ How ridiculous can the CDC get? Can you imagine a couple saying, ""Let's not practice safe sex because there are more effective drugs available in the event either one of us is a carrier of a sexually transmitted disease.""\ Of course, any explanation is OK as long as the CDC refuses to promote abstinence or conjugal fidelity as the logical solution for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.\ Alfred E.

300," All hail to President Bush for how he has conducted the war against Osama bin Laden. Bush has emerged a far better commander in chief than anyone predicted. In the war on terrorism he has shown steely resolve, imagination, leadership and creativity. Thank you Mr. Bush.\ And now, I wish Al Gore were president.\ Why? Quite simply because instead of showing resolve, imagination, leadership and creativity on the domestic front, Bush has done just the opposite. He has tried to use the tremendous upsurge in patriotism, bipartisanship and volunteerism triggered by the tragedy of Sept. 11 to drive a narrow, right-wing agenda from Sept. 10 into a Sept. 12 world. It's wrong. It won't work. It sells the country short and it will ultimately sell the Bush presidency short.\ I have no problem with nation-building in Afghanistan, but what I'm really interested in is nation-building in America--using the power of Sept. 11 to make our country stronger, safer and a better global citizen in the world of Sept. 12, beginning with how we use energy.\ But so far, all that's happening is that we've made the world safer for Saudi Arabia and OPEC to raise oil prices again. In case you missed it, last Friday the Saudi-led cartel cut production by 6.5 percent to boost oil prices, while the world is struggling to get out of a recession induced in part by the terrorism of Osama bin Laden and 15 Saudi hijackers.\ Frankly, the thought that U.S. taxpayers, who have had to bail out the airline industry (which was devastated by Sept. 11 and by higher gas prices) and to finance the $1 billion-a-month war against bin Laden, will now have to pay more for oil because the Middle East regimes we're protecting want to hike the price is an outrage.\ You'd think maybe the Saudi king would say: ""America, we're as upset as you that Osama bin Laden and 15 Saudi youth were involved in the terrible attack on your shores. So we want to help America--the engine of the global economy--recover, as well as the developing world. As such, we're going keep oil prices extremely low for the next six months, then we'll slowly lift them back to the $24-$28 range. It will cost us, but that's our tax cut for the world.""\ Is that too much to ask? Well, it seems so--which leads me back to Bush.\ The most obvious bold national project that Bush could launch now- -his version of the race to the moon--would be a program for energy independence, based on developing renewable resources, domestic production and energy efficiency. Not only would every school kid in America be excited by such a project, but it also would be Bush's equivalent of Richard Nixon going to China--the Texas oilman weaning America off of its dependence on Middle East oil. That would be a political coup!\ It would also be Bush's best response to foreigners who are enraged by America's refusal to join the Kyoto treaty to stop global warming. Bush could say that by weaning America away from oil gluttony he would be doing more for the environment than Kyoto ever would, which would greatly improve America's standing as a global good citizen.\ There are lots of ways Bush could go. ""Today one out of every seven barrels of oil produced in the world is consumed on American highways,"" says the respected oil consultant Philip Verleger. ""We could cut that by a third in five years if Washington were to offer tax incentives for manufacturers to produce more efficient vehicles and for consumers to buy them. Such tax cuts could be paid for with a higher gas tax, gradually phased in. Then we could replace all those American flag bumper stickers with ones that read: `I cut my oil use by a third, how about you?""'\ I don't want to be dependent on Mideast oil anymore. Countries in that region haven't had a good century in 700 years--and they're not going to soon. Oil is their curse, as well as ours. It's corrupted their rulers, enabled them to keep their women backward and out of the work force, and prevented them from developing innovative economies that make things instead of just take things from the ground. They have a lot of homework to do before they will be stable allies.\ We will all benefit if they succeed, but for now we have to look after ourselves. So, Mr. Bush, ""Let's roll."" Ultimately, presidential greatness is measured by what you do at home. If this war on terrorism ends with nation-building only in Afghanistan and not in America, it will be no victory at all."
301,"
How, one may ask, does it happen that a man who is unknown to most Americans, one of 100 senators and a freshman at that, can dictate energy policy and much of fiscal policy as well to the entire nation?
\
The short answer is that President Clinton, desperate for votes for his budget, cannot afford to lose any more of the 49 Democrats who supported it in the earlier round of voting, when Vice President Gore cast the tie-breaking vote to keep it alive.
\
So when Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.), one of the 49, announced that he would accept no gas tax hike higher than 4.3 cents a gallon, it didn't matter what Clinton or the rest of Congress thought. That was it.
\
Thus, an ambitious plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil, improve the efficiency of energy use and help clean up the environment went down the drain-and a $49 billion hole was ripped in Clinton's budget, forcing higher taxes on a few and deeper program cuts for many.
\
Kohl was far from alone in using the leverage the situation offered him to impose his personal policy and political agenda on the nation. Other senators also set a policy price for their votes. Kohl's press secretary says the senator just wanted to ""draw the line"" on middle-class taxes, and his stand is popular with voters in Wisconsin, where he faces re-election next year. But it is a striking example of how the legacy of Roger Sherman has come, in our time, to make the United States Senate a body that defies contemporary understanding of democracy.
\
Sherman was the delegate to the Constitutional Convention who in 1787 devised the ""Connecticut Compromise."" It made membership in the House of Representatives proportional to population but decreed that each state, regardless of size, would have two senators. It was a brilliant piece of statecraft, which ended a bitter big state vs. small state battle and sent the Constitution on to ratification.
\
Through more than two centuries, the principle of federalism embodied in Sherman's plan, in Article IV and in the 10th Amendment, has served this country superbly, enabling us to achieve flexibility in our system without disunity. But like everything else in politics, it comes with a price-and Kohl's power play last week dramatizes that price.
\
With very little notice, the Senate has become increasingly unrepresentative of the United States.
\
As population has concentrated in 100 or so major metropolitan areas and a dozen megastates, the disparity between the House and Senate has grown. In this Congress, a majority of senators-actually 54 of 100-come from states that collectively elect only 87 representatives, one-fifth of the members of the House. That is the major reason why measures like the energy tax can command majorities in the House but be killed in the Senate.
\
While large- and medium-sized states like Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Washington, Missouri and Georgia provide the leaders of the two parties in the House, their counterparts in the Senate come from smaller states like Maine, Kansas, Kentucky, Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi.
\
All this may simply reflect modern application of Sherman's famous compromise. But there are other changes inside the Senate not contemplated by the Founders-changes which make it even less representative than it might otherwise be.
\
For one thing, it has become a haven for the wealthy. No fewer than 27 of the hundred senators, including Kohl, are millionaires, according to a compilation of their financial disclosure forms by the Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call. Only seven of the hundred are women. Only one is an African-American. Latinos are totally absent.
\
Economically and sociologically, this is an elite group-whose members can easily afford to defy presidents, parties or even public opinion.
\
Just as important is the political independence of today's senators. Originally, senators were elected by state legislatures, which meant their tenure depended on staying on good terms with their counterparts back home. When the popular election of senators began 80 years ago, political parties were still strong enough to exert some real influence on the selection of Senate nominees.
\
But nowadays, senators mount their own campaigns and essentially operate as individual political entrepreneurs, not to say prima donnas. One indication of this trend can be found in the fact that one-fifth of today's senators held no elective office of any kind before coming to the Senate.
\
Like Herb Kohl, they simply saw the Senate as a place where they could make a mark-and went for it. Kohl financed his election in 1988 with $7.5 million of his own money, wiping out his primary- and general-election opponents with the most expensive campaign Wisconsin had ever seen. Still, his Senate seat cost him substantially less than the $18.5 million he spent on his basketball team, the Milwaukee Bucks.
\
This is not a plea for abolishing the Senate-or neutering it, like the House of Lords. It remains a great theater for politics, comedy and occasional drama. But when a single senator, operating solely by his personal compass, can set policy for the whole country, the great design of the Constitution has gone awry.
"
302,"Buffalo Grove Village President Jeffrey Braiman admitted recently that his town once considered Long Grove the ""evil empire"" for its staunch opposition to extending Illinois Highway 53 north into Lake County.\If so, ""then I'm the evil empress,"" joked Long Grove Village President Maria Rodriguez. \Braiman and Rodriguez were making light of a bitter dispute over Highway 53 that has divided Lake County since the 1960s. But now the two sides -- pro-extension as well as environmentalists and ""quality of life"" stalwarts -- have reached an accord on the future of the project. \Rodriguez told the Illinois Tollway board last month that she ""wholeheartedly"" endorses the extension. \The project's fate now rests with members of the Illinois Tollway board, which named the special advisory council that worked nine months to reach a consensus. \The recommendations call for a 121/2-mile extension of Highway 53 running north from Lake-Cook Road and forming a ""T"" with a 14-mile corridor along east-west Highway 120 (Belvidere Road) near Grayslake. \While tollway officials said they will study the council's proposal, they have not indicated they will endorse it or whether the tollway will agree to fund the potentially multibillion-dollar project. \According to the leaders of the advisory council, the breakthrough came after intense negotiations among dozens of representatives from local governments, civic groups, environmentalists and others. \The meetings, guided by independent outside consultants on land use, the environment and transportation, brought together ""all the disparate groups who had pushed one way or another and opposed progress in the past,"" said council co-chairman George Ranney. \Added co-chairman David Stolman, the Lake County board chairman: ""This shows the collaborative process can work and should be the basis of any highway planning."" \Twenty-three of the 25 participating organizations have signed off on an in-depth report recommending the project. The report is available at tinyurl.com/cswzcg4. \The key to the breakthrough, the co-chairmen said, was agreement on some non-negotiable design standards. The plans call for a ""parkway"" four lanes wide to minimize its footprint, with a top speed of 45 mph. Much of it would be built below grade level, with landscaped earthen berms 5 to 7 feet high on either side. \The next big question is how the project would be paid for. Estimates range from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion. \The advisory council's report recommends that the extension be part of the tollway system, because little or no state and federal funding would be available. And tolls might be significantly higher, 20 cents per mile, than are charged on other parts of the system. \The parkway would not pay for itself, the report concluded. Charging tolls for cars and trucks at current rates over the next 15 years would produce only $40 million to $105 million, depending on which alignment through environmentally sensitive areas along the Highway 120 portion is chosen. \That results in a significant shortfall -- as much as $2 billion. \One strategy that would help is ""congestion pricing."" That is, tolls would vary depending on the level of traffic -- the more traffic, the higher the toll. Tolls also would be indexed to rise with inflation. \Another option calls for levying tolls on existing Highway 53 from Lake-Cook Road south to the Jane Addams Tollway (Interstate Highway 90), a suggestion that already sparked controversy. \Opponents of that idea gave Illinois Tollway board members an earful at the June 28 meeting at which the council's report was presented. \Even tollway directors showed hesitancy about the recommendations. \Board member Tom Weisner, the mayor of Aurora, called the report ""admirable"" but questioned the rationale for a 45 mph speed limit. Director Jeffrey Reddick, also a member of the DuPage County Board, said the speed limit ""sounds counterintuitive to me."" \The massive $12.1 billion capital program that the tollway launched with this year's 87.5 percent toll hike does not include any construction money for the Highway 53/120 project. \Tollway board Chairwoman Paula Wolff acknowledged that the agency had some ""difficult decisions"" coming in the next several months. \The report proposes several options that could raise local revenue but could also spur controversy. \These include creation of special taxing districts along the route. The idea is that nearby property will rise in value as it benefits from construction of the new highway. Other options include raising Lake County's sales tax and imposing a county gas tax. \Another longtime foe, veteran State Sen. Terry Link, acknowledged he had a change of heart. \""I want to see this (project) done in my lifetime because this is a necessity,"" the Waukegan Democrat said. \Braiman of Buffalo Grove said he was concerned at first that the two sides wouldn't be able to come together on a solution. \""The whole process,"" he said, ""showed me the two groups could work together, that you can build roads and be environmentally sensitive."" \The road will bring economic development not only to the corridor in Buffalo Grove but elsewhere in Lake and Cook counties, he said. \""It's going to make people's lives much better,"" he said. ""Right now, there's gridlock."" \Long Grove's Rodriguez said the new proposal isn't so much a compromise as a coming together of both sides to find a new solution. \The new plan addresses environmental issues, including noise mitigation and wetlands preservation. ""Lake County is a unique place in Illinois, and that has to be preserved,"" she said. \Rodriguez agreed with Braiman that the road would spur economic development and help retain existing businesses that might otherwise move to a more convenient location across the border in Wisconsin. \""What's good for Lake County is good for the state of Illinois,"" she said. \----------\rwronski@tribune.com \Twitter @richwronski\Credit: By Richard Wronski, Tribune reporter Tribune reporter Jeff Danna contributed."
303," Diplomacy best bet on Beijing-Hong Kong\ The Australian, Sydney:\ Hong Kong's first post-colonial government will be neither democratically elected nor democratically run . . . the regrettable result of the Sino-British conflict over the capitalist enclave. Every bump in the 13-year transition from the new master to the old signaled that Britain's belated reforms, introduced against China's strident opposition, should not be expected to survive the reversion of Hong Kong's sovereignty to the mainland.\ London thus finds itself in the inevitable position of having to boycott the swearing-in of the new legislature. Washington, consistent with Bill Clinton's megaphone-style of diplomacy on human rights, has joined with London.\ The British and American concerns are well-merited: a legislature selected through Beijing's processes is bound to reflect China's own dictatorship. This is a worrisome issue, but it is best dealt with by diplomacy. The need now is not for a boycott but for constant pressure on Beijing to move to an elected council.\ G-8 summit merits world's attention\ Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo:\ As the G-7 club is transformed into the G-8, its summit meeting will have a stronger political streak than before. As the character of the summit meeting is transformed in Denver, we hope the meeting will no longer issue the text prepared by bureaucrats as an official ""declaration.""\ The agenda at the Denver summit ranges far and wide--from politics and economics to such global problems as the environment. There will not be enough time for the leaders to discuss the entire agenda from scratch. Even so, the key part of the talks by the leaders of the major powers should be revealed to the public.\ As the G-7 becomes the G-8, political discussion will assume far greater importance. Of particular interest will be the talks on topics such as preventing regional conflicts and terrorist acts. This is especially pertinent given the participation at the summit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.\ If their talks are publicized in their entirety, it will contribute to disseminating awareness about global problems and make people around the world think about them together.\ Privatization next stop for Amtrak?\ Clovis (N.M.) News Journal:\ Like one of the hungry dinosaurs in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park,"" the nation's Amtrak passenger rail system keeps chewing up taxpayers--and their tax dollars.\ In the 25 years since it was created as a government-run train system, Amtrak has devoured $13 billion in subsidies--but still can't turn a profit.\ Now Amtrak officials have said they expect to run out of money within a year. Bailout proposals include that of Republican Rep. Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, who suggests a half-cent national gas tax to raise about $500 million a year for the beleaguered system.\ What would serve Amtrak best is privatization. A private Amtrak could cut costs in a variety of ways. It could restructure staffing and eliminate unprofitable routes. A better-managed Amtrak could make a winning case to Wall Street and refinance its debt at lower interest rates (now as high as 17 percent).\ Computer sales to China pose threat\ Ft. Worth Star-Telegram:\ In his insatiable enthusiasm to curry favor with China through trade, President Clinton has rationalized its human-rights abuses, weapons proliferation and questionable adherence to protecting intellectual property rights, but the sale of supercomputers to Beijing should give Clinton pause about national security.\ The administration has argued in the last two years that the high-powered systems were being sold for civilian use. Such assurances ignore the pervasive influence of the Chinese military throughout critical sectors of China's economy. For instance, one laboratory devoted to peaceful research also works for the army to develop long-range missiles.\ The record of Beijing's non-compliance with accepted international behavior in several areas should raise general skepticism in Washington, but Clinton's unqualified embrace of free trade to allow U.S. technology to be turned toward long-term Chinese military advantage represents alarming official negligence.\ Keep Pennsylvania Avenue closed\ The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa:\ It's not clear whether he was motivated by the conviction of Timothy McVeigh or merely is tired of detouring around the White House, but House Speaker Newt Gingrich says it's time to remove the barricades and reopen Pennsylvania Avenue to motorists.\ That's a lot of hooey. McVeigh's conviction notwithstanding, a lot of kooks are out there--domestic and imported--who would relish the opportunity to blow another huge hole in American complacency by wiping out all or part of the White House.\ Commercials out of place on public TV\ The Seattle Times:\ There are certain expectations that come with watching public television. Shows are supposed to be high quality. Viewers are likely to be exposed to different cultures and ideas. And programs shouldn't be interrupted by advertisers hawking $99 mattresses.\ At least we thought so. But now PBS stations in Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis and Miami have announced their intentions to ask the FCC for permission to air commercials two nights a week. The reason: money, or specifically, the difficulty of getting it from traditional sources like government and public donations.\ Broadcasting commercials on public TV is in direct opposition to its very charter."
304,"Glenn Adams: Candidate profile Bio Name: Glenn Adams City: Rolling Meadows Office sought: 5th Ward Alderman Age (on Election Day): 61 Family: My Wife, Carol. I have three adult children, Amie, Mike and AJ Occupation: I work for a small company that sells water conditioning salt and ice melt salt products. I am Government Bid Manager. I am also involved with customer service, local logistics. I have also assisted purchasing and some light accounting functions Education: Bachelor of Science in Business Management from the University of Wisconsin -Stout Civic involvement: Chairman of the City of Rolling Meadows Economic Development. In the past I had volunteered with humane societies. I was a swimming official for park district teams which I continued to do for a few years after my children could not be on the team when they entered college. I was a soccer referee when my daughter was involved with the sport. I was chairman of the City of Rolling Meadows 50th Anniversary Committee. I also volunteered with the City’s 60th Anniversary Committee. I currently volunteer with the Illinois Route 66 Preservation Committee. This group works on various iconic buildings along Route 66 in this state to make sure they are maintained and preserved for travelers along the mother road.\Previous elected offices held: I was 5th Ward Alderman from 1997 to 2011 Issue questions What are the most important issues facing your community and how do you intend to address them?\Economic Development is the most important issue facing the City. This is a challenge due to the financial problems with the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago giving incentives for businesses to relocate to downtown Chicago. I am a member of the City of Rolling Meadows Economic Development Committee. Between this committee and City Council we have taken steps to create a positive business environment. A focus has been placed on making sure we keep existing businesses in Rolling Meadows. The Economic Development Committee also recommended the City participate in the Next Level Northwest which is an organization that helps evaluate small businesses and assist them with business plans to help them grow into larger companies that we hope will eventually move into larger facilities in our City and create additional jobs. We have worked with businesses on available incentives from Cook County. We are having discussions on other incentives the City may be able to offer businesses looking to move to our City. The other major issue is the former shopping center that is now vacant property. It’s a challenge of finding the right development that makes a project financially feasible and pleasing to the neighborhood.\What makes you the best candidate for the job?\I served as the 5th Ward Alderman from 1997 to 2011 so I have the experience of serving the residents in this area. During this time we faced a major recession that led to unfortunate circumstances for the City and tough financial decisions. I and other members of City Council learned some valuable lessons that we applied to City finances for the duration of the recession. With an uncertain global economic future, I can take the lessons learned from the past and apply them, if we see another economic downturn. In addition to this experience, I have volunteered, as mentioned above with the City of Rolling Meadows Economic Committee. I currently serve as Chairman of this committee. I was also a resident representative years back on an ad hock committee that was looking into the issue of keeping City Garbage Collection or outsourcing the service to try and save residents money. On a lighter note, I served as the Chairman of the City’s 50th Anniversary Committee and volunteered with the City’s 60th Anniversary celebration Describe your leadership style and explain how you think that will be effective in producing actions and decisions with your city council.\The best approach to leadership in City government is to be a team player and work as a group with other council members and City staff. I have always tried to understand opposing opinions when discussing issues. More importantly, when I was on City Council in the past I would reach out to the people of the 5th Ward and got their opinions. On a couple of occasions, I changed my vote based on feedback from the people of the 5th Ward or the people reinforced my vote on a specific issue.\How would you describe the condition of your community’s budget, and what are the most important specific actions the town should take to assure providing the level of services people want?\Overall I think the City Budget is good. The City of Rolling Meadows has always been known as a community that provides superior services. That has once again been demonstrated with recent snow falls. I pulled out of my driveway and the street was plowed. When I got on Algonquin Road and Route 53 the State Snowplows had not even plowed yet. Thankfully I have not had a need to use them lately, I have heard positive things about our fire department and police department. One major lesson I have learning from past experience as an alderman is having the right person as City Manager and Finance Director. It is important to have people with high integrity and honesty. I feel the City has that with our current Staff.\What’s one good idea you have to better the community that no one is talking about yet?\I have never been a fan of any taxes outside of property taxes. I did not vote for the electric tax when I was an alderman and did not vote for the gasoline tax as well. When a natural gas tax was discussed I said I would not support it. If you have a business that closes down you may faced lower property tax revenues plus you lose electric tax and now Natural Gas utility tax revenues which means triple deficits to the revenue streams. Once a tax is put in place it is very difficult to remove it. If we ever have a chance to repeal or reduce utility taxes I would love to make that move."
305,"When state Sen. William Mahar, an Orland Park Republican, unveiled the latest version of a plan to deregulate the state's electric companies on Wednesday, he said just about any special interest group could pick out any one piece of the proposal and call it flawed.\But, as a whole, Mahar said the huge bill was as good as the state is going to get, especially if people are eager for the 20 percent rate cut it provides customers of Illinois Power and Commonwealth Edison.\Right?\Let's apply that rationale to something a little less complicated than the 260-plus pages of legalese that Mahar was referring to. How about a Sunday dinner, in which Mahar is the guest of honor and meatloaf is the main course?\Sure, the ground beef was tainted with e-coli, but the oregano and eggs were fresh. The bread crumbs were fine and, geez, the expiration date on the ketchup was only a couple of days past.\""But as a whole, Bill, the thing's pretty darn tasty."" Power surge\Meanwhile, groups that help distribute millions of dollars in federal funds to help poor families pay for their electricity are singing the praises of state Sen. John Maitland.\In one of the little publicized details of the massive deregulation plan, Maitland is credited with successfully lobbying for a provision that would impose a 45-cent fee on everyone's electric bills to help finance a program for low-income energy assistance.\The Bloomington Republican applied his political muscle to the effort from his perch on the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, which sent the bill to a successful vote on the Senate floor Thursday.\While the overall deregulation plan will cut rates and eventually allow consumers to choose their electrical supplier, the fee will be tacked on to all power bills.\""He (Maitland) championed the cause,"" said Mark Driscoll, a spokesman for a coalition of community groups across Illinois.\Currently, the program that serves the poor is funded with federal dollars that are often delayed or pared back on the whim of folks in Washington D.C. Last year, the total allocated statewide was about $65 million.\Often, though, money is doled out by the feds in the midst of a crisis - a big cold snap or heat wave - making it seem as if they view their role as knights riding to the rescue.\Driscoll says the 45-cent fee will stabilize the program and inject an estimated $76 million into the kitty, with an aim on helping at least 200,000 families.\Last year about 192,000 were served, while more than 225,000 people applied.\Of course, the provision still must be passed by the Illinois House as part of the deregulation legislation. A vote is expected in mid-November when lawmakers return to the Statehouse for the final three days of the fall veto session.\But, its chances of staying in the huge bill appear almost a lock. As lawmakers have negotiated the overall deregulation plan, Driscoll said the measure was among a handful of details that have remained intact and virtually unchallenged since earlier this year. Lock 'em up\State Sen. Kirk Dillard pierced the long-held belief that Republicans are for less government intrusion into people's lives.\The Downers Grove lawmaker last week introduced obviously pressing legislation that would force kids under 18 to have parental consent before getting anything pierced - like bellybuttons, eyebrows, tongues and, yes, earlobes.\In fact, under his proposal, it not only would be a Class C misdemeanor if you pierced a youngster without the permission slip, but you could get nailed for merely offering the service.\We're sure police will get around to nailing violators right after they get done punishing kids for breaking another proposed law: riding a bike without a helmet.\At least that one was introduced by someone you'd expect: a Democrat. Moving on up?\Anyone who suffered through the first three days of General Assembly's fall veto session may have noticed that state Rep. Dan Rutherford was somewhat bee-like in his busy-ness.\The Chenoa lawmaker was spinning around the House floor like a top dressed in a suit, here, there, everywhere, talking up a storm with his Republican colleagues.\We'll assume he was gauging support for some important policy issue - like a gas tax increase or something - and not just pestering people, mainly because of an announcement that is coming down at 4 p.m. today in the northern Chicago suburb of Grayslake.\At that time, right after the Bears lose again, state Rep. Robert Churchill, R-Lake Villa, will kick-off two days of stump speeches in his quest to become the next secretary of state.\By jumping into a race for statewide office, Churchill will have to give up his seat in the Illinois House, where he serves as assistant minority leader, which, for nonpolitical types, means he is basically second in command of the House GOP caucus behind Minority Leader Lee Daniels, R-Elmhurst.\What does this have to do with Rutherford?\Since being elected in 1992, Rutherford has risen rapidly in the House Republican heirarchy. He is the top member on his side of the aisle of the powerful House Executive Committee. And, last year, he ascended to the post of co-chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee, which doles out cash to GOP candidates during the campaign season.\Churchill's exit opens even more powerful spots on the Daniels team, which is angling to take back control of the House from Mike Madigan's Democrats in the 1998 elections.\Rutherford, as it appeared during last week's veto session, is either already on his way to assuming one of those openings, or is positioning himself by being really busy in case Daniels' hasn't yet decided.\But judging by Rutherford's forays around the state with Daniels in recent weeks, we're figuring an announcement will be forthcoming."
306,"Many to thank for heart attack survival\On the morning of Feb. 17, I suffered a heart attack at my place of business, JB Winterberry. Sounds pretty cut and dry. But due to the incredible efforts of the Wheaton Fire Department Engine 31 Geoff, Nathan and Tom they somehow were able to lift me up 23 steps from the ""Secret Garden"" into our hallway and out into the street where the ambulance awaited me. I understand my vitals were weak and they immediately set forth their lifesaving skills and saved my life. Also that morning, LaVelle Davis, a retired nurse and one of our part-time employees, urgently set me down before the paramedics arrived, checked my vitals and gave me that all-important aspirin, again warding off a more severe heart attack. A friend and customer, Denise Kennedy stood by me with diligence and more or less scolded me into going to the emergency room, as I was being a horrible patient and did not want to go, believing these symptoms would pass (tightness in the chest and pain in my jaw). Denise kept insisting, and I wanted my partner/daughter Julie to drive me. I thank God that everything went according to Gods plan and the ambulance did take me to Central DuPage Hospital. The paramedics were equipped to handle the situation; without them and my other ""guardian angels"" that day, I wouldnt have made it. Women, please listen to the signs. I am a very healthy, active baby boomer with no family history of heart disease, no high blood pressure, cholesterol in check and a healthy diet. The doctors said it just happened. Please dont ignore any unusual symptoms no matter how small and remember, carry aspirin in your purse. I was lucky ... will you be as lucky too?\Barb Mueller\co-owner, JB Winterberry\Wheaton\Support DuPage Childrens Museum\I am writing this letter in support of the DuPage Childrens Museum. I have been an educator for 40 years. I have been connected to the museum as both a school district administrator and a community member. Knowing that early education is the key to lifelong learning, I see how DCM plays a crucial role in the early development of young children. Anne Haas Dyson, an education professor at the University of Illinois says in a recent study, ""Preschoolers and kindergartners need playtime for proper development. Play is where children discover ideas, experiences and concepts and think about them and their consequences."" What a treasure we have in DCM. It provides the critical opportunity for children to ""play"" as they explore math and science. Children need to ""play to learn."" In the DCM environment, play is structured in order to scaffold that learning. It is developmentally appropriate. DCM also provides critical resources to schools and teachers. Having DCM as a part of a childs learning journey is a valuable resource for our community. I encourage the city of Naperville to partner with DCM to financially support the museum for the students in DuPage. It would be a shame if we lost this marvelous community asset. Lenore Johnson\DCM board member\Naperville\Of government\and gullibility\There is a big ""G"" written on the forehead of March 1 Fence Post writer Tom Rajcan. It stands for ""government"" and ""gullible.""\On the government side, he thinks that we arent being taxed quite enough. Another 50 cents or a dollar federal tax added to the cost of a gallon of gasoline to fund energy research is needed. That money should go into a ""special fund,"" not to be co-mingled with general revenue. Sounds like the infamous Social Security ""lockbox."" By a years end he thinks there would be enough revenue to pay for a whole bunch of government-funded research programs. Like most who would rather tax first and ask questions later, that is the same theory liberals had when they enacted a high tax on luxury yachts to bring in a bounty of revenue. What was overlooked is that tax policy influences spending behavior, and that selfish rich class just decided not to buy yachts. Ultimately, those employed by the yacht makers lost their jobs. Hence, no tax revenue ""windfall"" coupled with workers who were removed from the tax rolls.\The ""gullible"" portion is a failure to understand behavioral changes from tax policy. Unfortunately, good intentions often fail because of unintended consequences. Lets not add to the potential failure list; we seem to have enough of those coming out of Washington.\Instead, how about trying things not requiring new taxes. Consider the expansion of nuclear power (hey, if its good enough for the French, it passes the liberal smell test!). How about digging for oil in our own backyard, for real this time, and remember, oil exploration often come as a ""twofer"" with natural gas.\The most gullible part of this gas tax plan is his conviction that ""all Americans would support such a program."" Mr. Rajcan, speak for yourself.\Lori Carlson\Glen Ellyn\Spare us your\indignation, liberals\Please, Paul Owen and Thomas Madigan, recent Fence Post contributors, spare us your biased, selective indignation over opinion writer Robert Graham, Rush Limbaugh and millions of other patriotic Americans wanting Obamas European socialist agenda to fail. And if he fails, along with his radical leftist policies, ""bring it on."" This country will not survive eight years of Obamanomics. These people must have been stranded on Gilligans Island for eight years. They conveniently missed the disease that permeated the left, ""The Bush Derangement Syndrome."" Owen had the audacity to write, ""I am truly frightened when I think that people like him (Limbaugh) and the letter writer (Graham) have such anger and hatred in their hearts."" Were you ""truly frightened"" with the repulsive, repugnant, putrid treatment of a president, a truly good man, George Bush? Were you ""truly frightened"" when leftist cowards hurled insults, bottles, tomatoes at him and his lovely wife during Bushs inauguration parade? This demonic behavior continued unrelenting for eight years, with comparisons to Hitler, a chimp, an idiot, ad nauseam.\A roaring start for Obama. How do you get Democrats to pay their taxes? Appoint them to Obamas administration. Tim Geithner, a tax cheat, responsible for the IRS? Nancy Killefer, with a tax lien on her estate, appointed ""performance czar?"" This is Saturday Night Live material. Obamas parade of morally challenged Democrats continued with Daschle, Richardson, Lynn, TBA. An attorney general announcing to the world that we are all a bunch of race ""cowards?"" Coming from our first black attorney general appointed by our first black president. Liberal hypocrisy ""you can believe in."" The stock market is impressed with Obamas acute business acumen. A 12-year low.

307,"Illinois Tollway officials gave the go-ahead Wednesday to launch a multimillion-dollar study into the feasibility of extending Illinois Route 53 north into Lake County, a major step forward for a project that's been stalled for decades because of fierce local opposition.\The action by the customer service and planning committee almost certainly will get final, formal approval from the full Illinois State Toll Highway Authority board next week. \Advocates say the project will alleviate acute congestion on local roads and unlock economic development throughout Lake County. Foes maintain the project will be a huge boondoggle with a prohibitively high price tag, ruin quality of life, and destroy rare habitats and wetlands. \The environmental impact study, if favorable, could serve to advance a decision by the Tollway to build the proposed highway, which could cost as much as $2.65 billion. \Tollway Chairman Robert Schillerstrom called the study a ""good next step"" in evaluating the feasibility of building the highway as a part of the Tollway system. \Board member Craig Johnson, mayor of Elk Grove Village, said the study will give the Tollway information to make an ""informed decision"" on whether to eventually adopt the project. \""We need to have a full, thorough vetting before we make a decision,"" Johnson said. \More than a dozen people addressed the Tollway board prior to the committee's unanimous approval. Most expressed opposition. \Hawthorn Woods Mayor Joseph Mancino, one of the project's most outspoken opponents, said the Tollway will likely face a lawsuit challenging approval of the environmental impact study, estimated to cost from $40 million to $50 million and take four to five years to conduct. \Mancino said he was not surprised by the Tollway's action, saying most opponents believe ""the fix is in"" on behalf of the controversial project. He called the process by which local advisory panels have evaluated the project ""flawed,"" in that some communities, such as his, were not included. \""This road as contemplated would bring elevated roadways through a pastoral village,"" Mancino said. ""This would profoundly change my village."" \Barbara Klipp, who represents the Illinois chapter of the Sierra Club, also warned of a legal fight against Route 53. \""We have our legal team in place,"" Klipp said. ""We will fight this in the courts. ... I promise you (the challenge) will be formidable."" \But supporters of the Route 53 project insisted the study was necessary to make an informed decision on the project. \Steve Park, of Gurnee, said the study is the best way to answer many questions raised by proponents and opponents of the project. \""Let's find those details and make sure we're doing things right,"" Park said. \Lake County Administrator Barry Burton said the study was endorsed by 40 county mayors and was ""an important next step to having an informed public discussion."" \Proponents say they envision ""the most environmentally and context-sensitive roadway plan ... ever seen in the area and would be a national model."" \If the project is not built, it would be necessary to widen existing highways through downtown areas or build bypasses through environmentally sensitive areas without the safeguards included in current plans, supporters say. \The Tollway's 2016 budget allocates about $6 million for such a feasibility study. To pay for a study that could cost as much as $50 million, tollway officials said more money will be available in future Tollway budgets. \The agency is in the midst of a 15-year, $12.1 billion rebuilding and widening program called Move Illinois. While the program does not allocate money specifically for Route 53 construction, it does include $100 million for ""emerging project"" studies, officials said. \To fund Move Illinois, truck tolls increased 40 percent this year and passenger car rates rose 87.5 percent in 2012. \Plans call for extending existing Route 53 for 12.5 miles north from Lake Cook Road to Grayslake. There, it would form a ""T"" with a 12-mile east-west stretch of Illinois Route 120, which would be upgraded. \Approval of the Route 53 extension could have political implications for Gov. Bruce Rauner, who controls the Tollway. Rauner's office has not indicated whether the governor supports the project. \Randy Blankenhorn, Rauner's appointee as head of the Illinois Department of Transportation, is also an ex officio member of the Tollway board. Blankenhorn was former executive director of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which listed Route 53 among its top priorities in its master plan for northeastern Illinois. \CMAP staff facilitated the work of a land-use committee, which completed a two-year study of the Route 5 3/120 corridor in November. The study did not outright recommend the extension be built but concluded that the corridor ""will be a catalyst for economic development"" in Lake County. \A blue ribbon advisory council composed of representatives from Lake County governments, civic groups and others issued a report in 2012 that envisioned a four-lane ""parkway"" with a maximum speed of 45 mph. \Advocates describe it as ""a modern boulevard with a small footprint to protect the natural environment and preserve the character of Lake County."" \An advisory finance committee recommended in March that Lake County residents bear a major portion of the construction costs, with a new county gas tax and creation of a special taxing district. But the project's cost would be shared by everyone who uses the tollway system. \If the Route 53 extension is built as a tollway, it could end up being the most expensive highway to drive in the Chicago area, with a base toll of 20 cents per mile. Tolls could double during rush hours under a concept known as ""congestion pricing."" \Critics contend that many motorists won't pay these tolls. Systemwide, Tollway users currently pay an average of 6 cents per mile. \----------\rwronski@tribpub.com \Twitter @richwronski\Credit: By Richard Wronski, Chicago Tribune"

310,"Although a short-term bailout has put off a Chicago-area transit ""doomsday"" that was scheduled to start Sunday, this much is clear: The national infrastructure crisis -- the one that became so glaringly evident in New Orleans, with its floods and failed levees, and in Minneapolis, where an interstate highway bridge last month crumbled into the Mississippi River -- now sits menacingly on the doorstep of ""The City That Works.""\It has been easy to brush off or even ignore this crisis because Mayor Richard Daley has cunningly plotted ways to fix roads and bridges, plant thousands of trees, and generally make his city shine despite a federal spigot that no longer pours out money like it used to.\But that was not so easy last week, not with the scourge of planned CTA service cuts and fare increases ready to lash hundreds of thousands of people in the city and its suburbs, which also depend on the agency's bus and rail service. The short-term $24 million funding advance engineered by Gov. Rod Blagojevich and accepted Friday by the Regional Transportation Authority may only put off the pain until November.\With its potential to disrupt daily routines and psyches, the CTA's predicament reveals how nearly every aspect of modern life is interlaced with anonymous networks of transportation, water, communication and power -- and how shortsighted politicians from Washington on down have let those networks fall apart. The CTA blames a $110 million state funding shortfall for the transit mess.\What exactly is infrastructure? It is a vast array of public works -- airports, bridges, dams, flood-control tunnels, parks, railroads, roads, schools, transit and wastewater treatment plants -- whose price tags typically boggle the mind and that sometimes are all but invisible. Woe to the politician who throws his weight behind a multibillion dollar project that no one can see but that drives up property taxes.\Little wonder, then, that when the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a national infrastructure report card in 2005, the grades were not exactly ""Head of the Class"" material. Nothing higher than a ""C+"" (which went, by the way, to municipal landfills). An overall grade point average of ""D."" Through 2010, the report card projected, the nation's total infrastructure investment needs are $1.6 trillion. And that's just to maintain existing infrastructure.\A case in point: The CTA's beleaguered Blue Line, which includes a 17.5-mile leg from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport. That leg once was a modern marvel, combining truly rapid transit with attractive, even architecturally dazzling, stations by such top design talent as Helmut Jahn and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill's Myron Goldsmith. In 1984, when it was completed, the trip from downtown's skyscrapers to O'Hare terminals took just 35 minutes.\Yet last Tuesday, under ideal conditions -- the sun was shining, the morning rush was almost over and the trains were practically devoid of people -- Blue Line Run No. 209 made the journey in 53 minutes, the end of the trip a painfully slow, herky-jerky ride over defective tracks leading to O'Hare.\As the Blue Line's ups and downs suggest, infrastructure is not an act of God. For better and for worse, people design it, execute it, pay for it and maintain it (or they don't). Modernist architects have celebrated the idea of the city as a machine, but machines can be cruel things in the wrong hands. When the Dan Ryan Expressway opened in 1962, it was, infamously, much more than an expressway. It was a multilane trench of asphalt that walled off the white ethnic neighborhoods to its west from the largely black public housing projects to its east.\Ever since the Minnesota bridge collapse, the airwaves and editorial pages have been full of debate about America's aging infrastructure and whether the federal gas tax should be raised to fix it. Many Democrats have supported the increase, while President Bush and other Republicans have argued that congressional ""earmarks,"" which direct funds to be spent on specific projects, are diverting money from highways and other pressing needs.\But to frame the debate that way, as though it is simply about technical problems and how to fix them, ignores infrastructure's far-broader impact on the way we live.\A bridge, for example, isn't just something we drive across. As the handsome, neo-classical Roosevelt Road bridge that links Chicago's Near West Side to the Museum Campus reveals, we might also value a bridge for how it looks, whether we can walk or bike across it, the impact it has on the neighborhoods on either side of it, and, of course, how it affects real estate values. Ideally, as this span shows, a bridge isn't just an artery. It's connective tissue. It doesn't do just one thing. It gives the public a multidimensional bang for its buck.\To take aesthetic issues out of the public policy equation, observes Gregory Dreicer, curator of the exhibition ""Me, Myself and Infrastructure,"" now at the Chicago Architecture Foundation, is itself an aesthetic choice -- one that wrongly assumes that engineers are objective technocrats who can single-handedly solve society's problems.\Americans learned the fallacy of that view in the 1950s and 1960s, he says, when engineers rammed highways through the delicate fabric of vibrant city neighborhoods, essentially destroying them.\In bridges, as in buildings, one size should not fit all. But then, customization does not necessarily come cheap. When Chicago's Department of Transportation began a model bridge renovation and replacement program in the mid-1990s, the thinking was that spans like the one at Roosevelt Road would cost anywhere from 10 percent to 20 percent more than standard designs pulled out of an engineer's manual. However, a simple modernist bridge, free of classical slipcovering or visual pyrotechnics, will cost considerably less.\""It is possible to make things look better without spending any extra money,"" said structural engineer and bridge designer R. Shankar Nair, a senior vice president and principal at Teng, a Chicago-based architecture, engineering and development firm. ""It might even save money too.""\""For most of us,"" Chicago-based designer Bruce Mau once wrote, infrastructure ""is invisible. Until it fails.""\Now, confronting New Orleans after Katrina, Minneapolis after the bridge collapse and a Chicago that has temporarily stepped back from the brink of a mass-transit ""doomsday,"" Americans have no excuse for overlooking infrastructure.\The question is whether they look at it with blinders or through lenses that recognize that our environment shapes our destiny.\----------\bkamin@tribune.com\Credit: By Blair Kamin, the Tribune's architecture critic"
311,"
Tough new anti-pollution standards pending in Congress could cost the Chicago area transit system more than $150 million in capital expenses. And they threaten to undercut an aggressive program to rebuild aging stations, crumbling viaducts and other components of a tired bus and rail infrastructure that needs a $6 billion rescue, according to local transit officials.
\
Yet local environmentalists are cheering the measures that could help clean up a bus fleet that releases 75 million pounds of pollutants a year into the air.
\
The exact impact of the Clean Air Act will not be known until congressional conferees work out differences between House and Senate versions. But officials here fear that the measure will force the Chicago Transit Authority and Pace to purchase more costly buses powered by such ""alternative"" fuels as compressed natural gas (CNG) and methanol as aging diesel vehicles are retired.
\
Negotiations over the new bill follow by a matter of days congressional approval of another measure that is expected to cost the transit system here millions of more dollars. The Americans with Disabilities Act mandates the purchase of wheelchair-equipped rail cars by Metra and requires increased accessibility at key CTA rail stations.
\
""What it begins to mean is that the capital (funding) we got in Springfield will have very little effect on what it was intended to do, to begin to repair our existing system,"" said RTA Chairman Gayle Franzen.
\
After a long and arduous lobbying campaign, the RTA last year persuaded the Illinois General Assembly to provide $1 billion to begin the task of repairing the neglected infrastructure of the CTA, Pace, and Metra.
\
Franzen said he is in favor of both clean air and improved accessibility, but he decried the lack of help to comply with costly federal requirements.
\
""It's another instance of mandating programs for which there will be no dollars,"" he said of the new environmental law. ""Unless they start seriously talking about funding these programs through a gas tax increase out of Washington, they're going to see mass transit agencies becoming less and less able to do what they're supposed to do-move massive numbers of people.""
\
The RTA estimates that fleet conversions from diesel to CNG or methanol at the CTA and Pace would add $15,000 to $20,000 to the cost of a bus, and from $4.6 million to $5.6 million per facility to convert garages and maintenance shops to handle the new equipment.
\
Those figures assume that no additional land would be required for fueling stations. In fact, remote facilities may be required in some cases, according to the CTA.
\
A Chicago ordinance that became effective last year prohibits indoor fueling when buildings are ""erected, altered or converted.""
\
CTA officials estimate that purchase of land and construction of one outdoor fueling facility to serve each of its nine garages would cost $58 million for CNG, $87 million for methanol. That doesn't include the cost of any changes that might be required to permit safe storage of buses containing the alternative fuels.
\
""We can handle converting the bus fleet,"" said Tulla Constantinou, head of management analysis for the RTA. ""But conversion of garages and training people represents a mammoth expense.""
\
An RTA capital cost estimate of up to $155 million for the CTA and Pace to convert to alternative fuels is conservative. The CTA predicts that its expense alone of switching would run between $269 million and $319 million.
\
Capital costs aside, local transit officials say that a fuel conversion also would push up operating expenses.
\
At the CTA, where money shortages threatened service cuts earlier this year, officials have estimated that costs would rise by $37 million annually to operate a CNG fleet of 2,200 buses and by $42 million to run a methanol fleet.
\
The increase presumably would have to be covered by fare increases, increased subsidies, service reductions, or other cost-cutting measures.
\
Though local transit officials consider CNG and methanol to be the most practical of a list of alternative fuels that also includes ethanol and electricity, a variety of operational problems are associated with both CNG and methanol.
\
The CTA and RTA say, for example, that:
\
- Both of the fuels are less efficient than diesel, meaning that fuel tanks would have to be enlarged. The increased weight would put limits on the number of passengers that could be carried on a bus, creating the need for more vehicles to serve the same number of riders. Heavier weights also would result in lower fuel efficiency, faster tire, brake, and chassis wear, and the possibility of shortened transmission life. A CNG-powered bus would be heavier by at least 2,000 pounds, the weight of about 15 people, CTA officials say.
\
- Methanol is very corrosive and would require corrosion-resistant tanks, pumps and fuel lines.
\
- CNG carries with it a higher possibility of explosion and fire than diesel. Methanol, which is more flammable than diesel, also can be very dangerous if touched, inhaled, or ingested.
\
- It takes about five minutes to fuel a bus with CNG or methanol compared to three minutes with diesel, and at least two or three additional minutes would be eaten up if fueling stations were located away from garages. This would require the CTA to hire about 25 additional bus servicers at an annual cost of $875,000.
\
Even if the CTA and RTA cost estimates for alternative fuel conversion are correct-and some would question whether they are-clean air advocates insist it is time for change.
\
The average CTA bus burns 41 tons of diesel fuel a year and produces about 17 tons of pollutants, said Scott Bernstein, president of the Center for Neighborhood Technology. That comes out to nearly 75 million pounds of pollutants a year pumped into the environment by the authority's fleet.
\
Illinois environmental officials are asked constantly by motorists why their clean-burning cars must get annual emission tests ""when diesel buses blow black smoke in their faces,"" said Maggie Robbins, associate director of environmental and occupation health for the Chicago Lung Association. ""It is high time diesel gets addressed better.""
\
The cost of reducing the bus pollution is worth it, Bernstein contends.
\
But he agreed that mass transit is underfunded, and he asserted that it is time to consider transferring to transit 10 or 15 percent of the money that now goes to highways every year.
\
""I think it's doable,"" Bernstein said of clean buses. ""The money is sitting in Washington in the Highway Trust Fund . . . We just have to recognize that the more we invest in roads, the worse transportation and environmental problems get.""

312,"Route 53 land-use plan readied for public comment\LAKE COUNTY -- With recommendations of how local communities could help pay for the extension of Route 53 into Lake County under consideration, the less known review of how the road would impact surrounding land is moving ahead.\A 170-page draft of the land-use strategy for the Route 53/120 corridor was recently revealed, and will soon be available for review from communities, residents, organizations or other interested parties.\Public open houses also are being planned for Oct. 14 and 15, at locations to be announced. The plan is available online at www.lakecorridorplan.org.\The report outlines and identifies a variety of issues associated with a road of this magnitude. It uses market forecasts for 2040 to recommend land use approaches in different areas, and provides guidance and recommendations for a corridor-wide strategy designed to stimulate economic development while protecting the environment and enhancing transportation options.\The Route 53 extension is envisioned as a four-lane boulevard style toll road, but the exact configuration has not been determined. Earlier this year, a committee of public officials and other stakeholders forwarded to the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority a list of recommendations, such as a 4-cent per gallon gas tax, to fund the local share of the $2.35 billion to $2.65 billion project.\Portillo's announces opening plans, date in Lake County\GURNEE -- Portillo's announced that it will open its Gurnee location on Tuesday, Nov. 3. According to the website of the popular restaurant, the eatery will open at 10:30 a.m. at 6102 W. Grand Ave. on Ring Road, northeast of Bass Pro Shops at Gurnee Mills.\The Lake County location will be the 41st Portillo's in the United States and is the farthest north for the company. Founder Dick Portillo is scheduled to attend the opening.\While Portillo is still active with the company, he no longer owns it. He sold his restaurants to Boston-based Berkshire Partners, but he owns the real estate where the restaurants are located and collects rent from Berkshire.\Italian steakhouse planned for downtown area\GRAYSLAKE -- Grayslake trustees have approved an economic incentive deal for an Italian steakhouse proposed in the village's downtown that officials say could create at least 40 jobs.\Village board members formally approved granting $200,000 to assist the Bowes family with their plan for a currently vacant site at 127 and 129 Center St.\About $3.5 million in private investment is expected for the establishment that would have a 250-seat capacity. Bob Bowes and his family have been on Lake County's dining scene for about 37 years with Emil's Pizza and Sports Bar in Mundelein. Emil's Tavern on Center was opened by the family in downtown Grayslake in 2010. Taylor said the village was able to offer an extra $100,000 for the economic incentive to the Bowes family because plans fell through for a renovation of the 99-year-old Cupola building at 2 S. Lake St. in downtown Grayslake.\Can grants help village fill its empty storefronts?\MUNDELEIN -- A relatively new program that provides financial assistance to business owners improving their properties is gaining steam, with grants totaling $28,108 going to local entrepreneurs just in the last four months.\And most of the recipients are businesses establishing themselves at locations that had been vacant space.\The newest grant was approved last week. Trustees agreed to give nearly $12,208 to an entrepreneur turning a former art studio on Lake Street into a showroom for his cabinetry business.\Tony Ciucci, owner of Cabinet Creations Plus, said the grant was a key reason he chose to set up shop in Mundelein instead of Grayslake, Vernon Hills or other communities he scouted.\Village Administrator John Lobaito believes Mundelein's investment in local businesses will pay off as those operations create local jobs and generate cash for the town, via sales taxes and fees.\Sale of park for townhouse development delayed again\LIBERTYVILLE -- The long-planned sale of a Libertyville park for residential development again has been delayed, but the deal is expected to be finalized next month.\Village officials approved the 10th change to a real estate contract with Swanson Development LLC of Lake Forest for the property and facilities that comprise Bolander Park, 625 Winchester Road. The closing date for the $2.05 million sale has delayed about a month until Oct. 28, as a new investor has become involved.\Swanson is pursuing plans for an upscale development of 56 townhouses on the 5.3-acre site. The developer requested the extension because the original investor, Rialto Homes, is being replaced by K. Hovnanian Homes.\The village board informally approved various aspects of the development plan and is expected to adopt the enacting ordinances on Oct. 13 or Oct. 27.\New restaurant planned, but hot dogs remain on the menu\LIBERTYVILLE -- A new operator wants to rekindle the family-owned hot dog joint concept at the former Slott's Hots, which operated for more than 30 years on the north side of Libertyville before closing abruptly early this year.\The plan for Jack Straw's hot dog and pizza restaurant at 1124 N. Milwaukee Ave. involves a hefty investment to include a complete remodel and upgrade of the building and grounds. It would be the second Jack Straw's store, which has operated since 1982 in Wheaton.\""I've been looking to open a second location for some time,"" said Sam Hood, who has run the operation for his father, Bill, since 2002. ""I've looked at many sites but nothing stood out like Libertyville.""\According to information provided to the village, Hood built a new home in Wadsworth in 2012 and since has been looking for a location closer to home. While the former Slott's suits the business, the building and site have been neglected and will require extensive work, according to Hood.\Hood says he plans to invest about $400,000 to upgrade the building and grounds and $100,000 on equipment."

Democrats also tout constitutionally guaranteed human rights, e.g., the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment in their opposition to the death penalty.\The above renders their position on abortion hypocritical. Rather than relying on science and constitutionally guaranteed rights to inform their abortion policy, they insist only a mother’s decision matters throughout an entire pregnancy up to and including the last moment prior to natural birth, labeling it ""a women’s health care choice.""\Yet medical science unanimously agrees that at between 18 and 20 weeks and as early as 16 weeks, a fetus is, for all intents and purposes, a human, responding to all manner of stimuli including recoiling from pain, laughing, crying and even dreaming. Indeed, a 19-month-old fetus was recently birthed and nursed to full health.\While ""heart beat laws"" are too stringent, given a heartbeat does not signify a cognizant ""life"", it is scientifically irrefutable that a brain, indeed a mind, developed to the point of consciousness constitutes a ""unique and distinct life,"" a human. And as such, constitutionally guaranteed human rights attach.\The only scientifically and constitutionally consistent position is: a woman shall have 16 weeks to make a ""proceed or terminate"" decision on her pregnancy, after which the fetus is scientifically certified as a human to whom all constitutional rights accrue. The mother then has the legal responsibility, as all parents do, to care for that child and deliver it. After 16 weeks, only a qualified doctor and medical review board can decide on the necessity to terminate the pregnancy to save the life of the mother. Any other position renders its holder a ""flat-earther.""\John Kauck Grayslake Towns should send a message on marijuana So, recreational marijuana will soon be legal in Illinois. But as the Daily Herald helpfully reminds us in their lead article on June 17 and in their editorial on June 19, there’s nothing to stop local cities, towns or villages from outlawing the sale of marijuana within their own city limits.\Communities have done just that with things like video gambling and various ""adult"" businesses, so why not add marijuana to the list?\Wouldn’t it be great if a significant number of Illinois communities chose not to profit from this deadly trade? If you are a city council member and have opposed the legalization of marijuana, why not do the courageous thing and vote against allowing its sale in your jurisdiction?\As for the rest of us, let’s let our city officials know where we stand. One of the worst things about legalizing marijuana is the message it sends to young people, that getting high is no big deal. Keeping it off the store shelves in your municipality may mean foregoing a few tax dollars, but it will get the message to your children that smoking dope is not a good thing.\Bill Deckard Winfield Chamber’s position on climate change welcome The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, no liberal organization, recently issued a statement, ""Addressing Climate Change."" In the statement, the Chamber acknowledges that the ""climate is changing and humans are contributing to these changes.""

Unfortunately, technological innovation alone will not solve the climate crisis — meaningful, targeted regulation is also needed.\However, I laud the Chamber on its acceptance of the reality of human-caused climate change.

316,"My column last Sunday touting the virtues of a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax for Illinois drew more thoughtful and constructive responses from readers than any of my columns in memory. \Briefly, the idea is that since politicians haven't had the will for nearly 30 years to raise per-gallon gas taxes and cars are getting better and better gas mileage, we need a new way of funding the infrastructure repair and construction that gas taxes helped pay for.\Putting GPS devices into cars and charging by the mile, as is being tried in other places, is an imperfect but creative and flexible solution that deserves serious thought. Democratic gubernatorial candidate J.B. Pritzker has been roundly attacked for merely suggesting Illinois ""should look at"" testing such a tax and has since been running like a scalded dog away from that suggestion, but he was onto something.\I have answers -- not necessarily rejoinders! -- for most of the points readers raised.\* Sticking with a per-gallon gas tax is better because it rewards those who buy and drive fuel-efficient cars that benefit the environment.\True, but raising it to necessary levels -- we'd have to double it to 38 cents just to keep up with inflation since the per-gallon state tax was last raised to 19 cents in 1990 -- would fall hardest on low-income drivers and exempt those with the means to buy electric cars.\* For a government agency to track and record citizens as they drive would be an Orwellian invasion of privacy.\Most of us willingly carry tracking devices with us at all times as it is. Our cellphones leave digital breadcrumbs wherever we go in the physical world, and our browsers record our travels through cyberspace.\Many of us also enjoy the economy and convenience of tollway transponders that preserve partial driving records.\Still, I get the reluctance some have to 24/7 vehicular tracking that can't be disconnected, even if the government promised to purge the records after 30 days and hide them under a cloak of confidentiality similar to the IRS privacy laws that have kept President Donald Trump's tax records secret all these years.\To gain public acceptance, a VMT tax system would have to contain an opt-out provision allowing for billing based on annual odometer readings.\* To make up for gas taxes being lost to fuel-efficient vehicles, why not just charge the owners an extra annual registration fee to make up the difference?\I'd worry that this would discourage the purchase of high-mileage cars, cars that could theoretically be given extra per-mile tax benefits under a GPS-based system.\* What about interstate traffic? Those who commute from northwest Indiana or southern Wisconsin to jobs in the Chicago area would skate on a VMT tax if only cars registered in Illinois were required to pay it. Yet they would still be using our roads and bridges.\True. If VMT taxes don't spread to nearly every state, they'll always be subject to the freeloader problem.\* Straight gas taxes are simple and, because they're hidden in the pump price, relatively painless. Tracking and then billing individual motorists based on data fed into a central system by GPS devices would be costly, complex and provocative.\Costly to set up, certainly, though in the long run probably no more complex than computerized tollway billing using credit-card accounts. The line-item amount might be galvanizing or outrageous, but it would have the virtue of being transparent.\* With GPS devices sending the government a continuous stream of information, we might as well be under the eye of ticket-issuing speed cameras at every moment. There'll be nothing to stop police from fining us for every transgression.\Nothing but public pressure. Which seems to have worked so far in preventing toll roads from spitting tickets at cars that get from one plaza to the next too fast for posted speeds.\* Why not scrap the GPS idea and simply require everyone to get an odometer reading at plate-renewal time, then charge by the miles driven and the size and weight of the vehicle? Such a system could also include special breaks for low-income and rural residents, and for vehicles used primarily by charitable institutions.\A whole new bureaucracy would need to be created to record odometer readings, and such a system wouldn't be fair to those who travel a lot out of state -- most of the miles on my car these days are trips to visit family in Michigan and West Virginia, for instance.\But my guess is that if we ever do get a VMT tax it will at least start with a non-GPS version like this.\* You liberals always think of ways to raise taxes! Why not cut spending for once?\This response wasn't particularly constructive, but it was common. As usual, however, such input lacked suggestions of program and service cuts sufficient to keep our roadways in good shape.\* Why not charge a hefty increase in the tax on new tires instead? Tire wear is proportional to and a proxy for miles driven.\A substantial tire tax would create a number of perverse incentives, such as rewarding motorists for driving on old, bald tires and incentivizing them to wait until they're out of state to replace their tires. The public safety and business implications for this idea appear grim.\* Why should we charge road, gas or mileage taxes at all? Infrastructure -- like K-12 education, parks, police protection etc. -- is a public good. Even those who hardly drive at all benefit from the network of pavement that keeps our stores stocked and our service vehicles moving smoothly. User-pays tax systems don't adequately assess the shared benefits. Roads should be funded through other conventional taxes, not a system that tries to turn every street into a tollway.\I found variations on this argument to be highly persuasive. If we were not living Trump's America where it's never OK to admit you were wrong, I might just change my mind on the VMT tax.\That which creates and provides for the general good ought to be paid for out of general funds.\On behalf of my most thoughtful readers, I bequeath this idea to J.B. Pritzker free of charge. \\Re:Tweets\The winner of this week's online poll for best tweet is a clever bit of wordplay by @LMHPhotog: ""People think 'queue' is just 'q' followed by 4 silent letters.

317,"The rest of the world is handing out subsidies and incentives to speed up adoption of electric cars. But in nearly half of U.S. states, driving a battery-powered car requires paying additional fees. \To date, 24 states have imposed special fees on electric vehicles, according to a national association of state legislatures. The money usually comes in the form of higher registration costs that can range up to $200 per year. More states are poised to follow. Last week, one Illinois legislator even proposed a $1,000 annual registration fee for electric cars.\It's a sharp reversal. When the new wave of plug-in cars hit the market in 2010, the federal government and a clutch of states adopted financial incentives to juice sales, seeing the vehicles as a way to fight global warming. Now even some states with incentives -- most notably California, home to roughly half of all electric cars in the country -- are turning to fees as a way to ensure that electric drivers pay their fair share to maintain roads and bridges. States typically support that infrastructure through gasoline taxes.\""My feeling is that people using the system should pay for the system,"" said Rep. John Forbes, D-Iowa, who backed recent fee legislation even though he and his wife drive a Chevrolet Bolt, one of about 1,000 electric cars in his state.\To EV advocates, fees to offset lost gas taxes look like a solution to a problem that does not yet exist. Some of the states that have imposed fees, such as Idaho and North Dakota, have fewer than 1,000 battery-powered cars on the road. The amount of tax revenue lost as a result remains minimal to EV supporters, who see the fees -- at least in some states -- as part of a broader political push-back against alternative energy technologies.\""I suspect that behind a lot of these state efforts, there is a bit of an oil-industry push to slow the increase of EVs in the market,"" said Simon Mui, a senior scientist and EV advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council. He pointed to support for the fees from the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a group that drafts model legislation and has often backed fossil-fuel interests. (An ALEC spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.)\Frank Macchiarola of the American Petroleum Institute lobbying group said the federal tax code ""unfairly favors"" EV owners. ""Like other consumers, electric vehicle drivers, who also cause wear and tear on our roads and bridges, should pay their fair share to help support American infrastructure projects,"" he said. API hasn't lobbied any states to adopt the fees.\Elsewhere there are generous incentives to car buyers willing to go electric, with sales rising rapidly as a result. Norway, for example, exempted electric car sales from taxes and offered drivers such perks as free parking in many cities; electric cars accounted for more than half of sales in the country in March. China's incentives and mandates have been powerful enough to boost sales to more than 1 million electric cars in 2018 alone.\Although U.S. sales are rising, EVs still represent a small fraction of the vehicles on the roads. By the end of last year, 565,032 battery-powered cars were registered nationwide, according to a tracking website sponsored by an auto-industry trade group. California, the headquarters and biggest market for electric automaker Tesla, had 273,656. No other state has crossed the 100,000 mark. The federal government offers a $7,500 tax credit to EV buyers, but that incentive phases out once an individual automaker sells 200,000 EVs. Both Tesla and General Motors Co., maker of the Bolt, have already passed that milestone.\If EV sales grow as expected in the U.S., it could take a significant bite out of gasoline tax revenue. So could fuel-mileage improvements in gasoline-powered cars. Together, those two forces could cut annual gasoline tax revenues 61% by 2040, compared to what receipts would otherwise be, according to a recent study by BloombergNEF.\But the problem won't set in until the late 2020s, said Nick Albanese, a BloombergNEF analyst specializing in advanced transportation. For the immediate future, he said, increasingly efficient gasoline cars will pose a bigger threat to tax receipts than EVs.\""We're not really starting to see significant impacts, even in states like California where there's been more EV adoption,"" Albanese said. ""Because of how slowly passenger vehicle fleets turn over, this won't be a problem for a substantial amount of time.""\To EV fee supporters, that simply means state governments should start preparing now. In Iowa, for instance, the legislature asked the state's Department of Transportation to project how much gas tax revenue could be lost as electric car sales grow. The resulting study estimated that fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids would likely cost the state's Road Use Tax Fund just $317,000 in lost receipts in 2018. But by 2030 the losses could reach as high as $45 million. Gas taxes are expected to pump $656 million into the fund during the current fiscal year.\""We want to make sure we're ahead of the curve, so that five or 10 years out, we're not seeing a shortfall,"" said Forbes, who serves on the transportation committee of Iowa's House of Representatives.\Iowa's legislature passed a bill this spring that would phase in a $130 annual fee for electric cars and a $65 fee for plug-in hybrids. If signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, it would bring in an estimated $185,000 next year. Iowa last raised its gasoline tax in 2015.\Forbes and his wife bought their Bolt in 2017, and he likes the car's snappy acceleration. He also drives a Chevy Suburban SUV, since the electric sedan can't easily accommodate their two Great Danes. ""I got some pushback from a few people on this bill, saying, 'Hey, I'm doing the right thing for the environment,""' Forbes said of the fee on EVs. ""In the end, if we don't have good infrastructure to drive our vehicles on, our economy is going to suffer.""\CAPTION: Photo: An electric vehicle is charged at a building in Westmont in January.

318,"A key ally of Rahm Emanuel's on Monday said the mayor will have to raise property taxes to cover ballooning city worker pension payments before trying to walk back the off-message statement in the heat of a tight mayoral campaign.\Ald. Carrie Austin, 34th, the City Council budget chairman, said she has talked to the mayor about his spending plans going forward. \Pressed on whether those plans included property tax increases, Austin responded: ""I believe we can truly say that it will happen, but it's all in the 'how much.' ... Nothing is off the table, and I think we should be honest with the people to let them know that everything is being considered."" \The property tax comment came at an Emanuel campaign news conference called so the mayor's allies could blast challenger Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia for a lack of specifics on how he will close the city's looming budget gap and make ballooning pension payments. \Emanuel has refused to rule out a city property tax hike in a second term to deal with Chicago's grave financial problems. During his first term, the mayor has raised a host of city taxes, fees and fines, and he has increased property taxes for Chicago Public Schools by the maximum amount in each of the past four years. \Against that backdrop, Austin, known for speaking off the cuff, quickly tried to qualify her property tax hike comment, saying she meant only that ""everything is on the table."" \Ald. Will Burns, 4th, stepped up to say there are too many uncertainties, including how the Illinois Supreme Court will rule on attempts to modify state and city pensions, to know exactly what will happen moving forward. \To balance budgets and address pension liabilities in his current term, Emanuel engineered reductions in pension benefits for two of four city pension funds, reduced some spending, and raised fees, fines and some taxes. \The mayor's mantra is that he has found ways to improve the city's finances ""without a property, sales or gas tax"" increase -- even though he initially proposed a $250 million property tax increase phased in over five years as his first choice for covering part of the city's pension burden. He later altered that plan for 2015 by instead increasing emergency service taxes on all cellphones and landlines billed to city addresses by $1.40 a month. \Like Garcia, the mayor has not specified how he'll cover a $550 million increase next year in payments to retirement funds for police officers and firefighters. \Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, who has endorsed Garcia, said Emanuel's only choice is a property tax increase because he put off finding a solution until after the election. ""He's basically going to have to raise property taxes this year because there's no other option on the table,"" Waguespack said. \The pro-Emanuel aldermen who criticized Garcia contend that the challenger's proposals -- keeping pension benefit promises, putting an end to borrowing in a way that pushes payments into the future at higher cost, hiring 1,000 new police officers and taking down all red light cameras -- would carry a high price tag. \""We are four weeks away from electing a new mayor, yet we have received no information whatsoever from Mr. Garcia on how we're going to pay for these things,"" said Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, vice chairman of the budget committee. ""I think we're at a time now -- the taxpayers certainly are -- where they want to see the beef, and so far all we've gotten from Mr. Garcia is a lot of baloney. ... Now is the time to explain to people how he intends to pay for it."" \Garcia has not offered a specific budget plan. Instead, he has suggested the unlikely possibility that the state would enact a graduated income tax and share additional revenues with the city. On Monday, Garcia again promised to release a financial plan this week that will offer more specifics. \Garcia got a boost Monday when the Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed him over Emanuel in the April 7 runoff election as both campaigns court African-American voters. Jackson cited Garcia's ""consistent track record of service,"" including his work with Harold Washington, Chicago's first African-American mayor. \""This is not about President (Barack) Obama and me, it's about Chuy and Rahm Emanuel. It's about whether there's a plan for reconstruction,"" said Jackson, who did not directly criticize Emanuel during his remarks. Garcia can be trusted to ""assume the burden of responsibility to work with us to reconstruct where we live,"" Jackson said. \Garcia and Jackson appeared at a trash-strewn Englewood lot as the challenger promised to revitalize city neighborhoods he argues Emanuel has neglected at the expense of downtown. \""Neighborhoods have been left behind by this administration,"" Garcia said during a news conference near Halsted Street and Marquette Road. \About the same time Garcia was getting Jackson's endorsement, the mayor appeared at a downtown event with Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro for the launch of the University of Chicago's new ""urban"" labs, which will use academic research to tackle problems related to poverty, health and the environment and energy. \Emanuel, who spoke on a panel with Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, touted his administration's work developing pre-university programs in Chicago high schools and providing work and mentoring opportunities for at-risk youths. He asked the gathered academics to help the city develop programs that would offer home health care support to new parents. \The mayoral race remained largely unmentioned, aside from a passing comment by U. of C. Urban Labs director Timothy Knowles about voting next month. \Although Castro referred to Emanuel as ""a rock star mayor"" before the panel, he declined to weigh in on the mayoral race. \""Obviously staying out of that,"" Castro said. ""In my role, as you can imagine, I'm staying out of as much politics as I can."" \---------- \hdardick@tribpub.com \jjperez@tribpub.com \cdizikes@tribpub.com\Credit: By Hal Dardick, Juan Perez Jr. and Cynthia Dizikes, Tribune reporters"
319,"Commuting from his downtown job at the Hennepin County Medical Center to his suburban home used to take Oge Alozie about 10 minutes. Now, it is often closer to 45 minutes.\Like tens of thousands of others, the internal medicine intern crossed the Interstate Highway 35W bridge twice a day before it collapsed one month ago this weekend.\With the bridge gone, Alozie said, life is more stressful as he experiments with side-street routes to get him to his daughter's day care on time in the evening. Now he also has a nagging feeling when he crosses bridges.\""There is trauma,"" he said. ""At the back of your mind, it's just there.""\As the Twin Cities move from mourning the 13 killed in the Aug. 1 catastrophe to trying to return to normalcy, area residents are just coming to terms with the new, long-term realities of daily life without a bridge that was the second-busiest in Minnesota.\Patience will be further tested Tuesday when the fall semester begins at the nearby University of Minnesota, bringing an influx of tens of thousands to the congested area.\Probe, recovery just beginning\With portions of the hulking bridge still blocking Mississippi River barge traffic, the collapse investigation remains in its infancy. Leading theories are focusing on heat, construction work and corrosion.\Even though they know reconstruction is what the area needs, some say it still feels awkward moving forward.\""That people died there, just makes you sad for your neighborhood,"" said Skott Johnson, president of a business association in the nearby Dinkytown neighborhood.\Even if the planned rapid construction schedule is successful, a new bridge -- at an estimated cost of at least $250 million -- will not be in place until late next year at the earliest, well after the Twin Cities host the 2008 Republican National Convention.\Already, there are signs of potential delays. Last week, one of the nation's largest general contractors said it no longer wants to be part of the project.\Still, some positive news arrived with the reopening of a nearby bridge closed since the collapse. The reconfigured 10th Avenue Bridge opened Friday, with two lanes of vehicle traffic -- down from four -- and a new pedestrian walkway for viewing the collapse site.\Almost immediately, it was filled with hundreds of curiosity seekers, most carrying cameras, getting a previously unavailable close-up view.\""It's hard to believe all that stuff could just collapse like that,"" Staci Gallahue said as she snapped photos from the new vantage point. ""On TV, it was hard to get a sense of how far cars actually fell. It's still hard to imagine.""\Kent Barnard, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said officials do not yet have hard data on how much commuting times have grown.\Shoulder repaving has added lanes to some nearby highways. ""We're trying to squeeze out some extra capacity,"" Barnard said.\Barge traffic is expected to start flowing again this month.\Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, meanwhile, said he would support up to a 5-cent increase in the state's gas tax to help fund road and bridge improvements.\That announcement arrived as he has come under increasing criticism for his administration's failure to do something before the disaster about what was known to be a troubled bridge.\Small-business owners are also feeling a pinch, as customers steer clear of an area riddled with closed streets and detours.\""I don't even really know how to give people directions,"" joked Mike Solac, who runs a furniture store near the bridge.\Long commutes not norm\While long commutes are common in big cities, many people in the Twin Cities, the nation's 16th-largest metropolitan area, consider short commutes and other quality-of-life benefits as a fair exchange for brutal winters.\Commuting from his home in a northern suburb to his job on the metropolitan area's southern end, Kris Slettedahl had crossed the bridge twice a day for the past decade.\The mortgage company auditor is now dealing with a significantly longer commute via a different route. ""Traffic is pretty tough,"" said Slettedahl, whose morning drive went from 40 minutes to 60 minutes.\Slettedahl is still mapping out how he will get to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, where he has season tickets for the upcoming University of Minnesota and Minnesota Vikings football seasons. The idea of driving there in the first snowfall seems almost unbearable.\""It's going to be ugly,"" said Slettedahl, who drove over the bridge about 45 minutes before it collapsed.\Before the bridge fell, it carried about 140,000 vehicles a day.\""That bridge was a major arterial to campus, so it has created some huge congestion issues,"" said Dan Wolter, a University of Minnesota spokesman.\Sam Fox, a photography student who has seen her commute grow, said she manages not to get angry.\""You know it's because of a bridge collapse, so you don't have road rage,"" she said. ""Minnesotans take things in stride.""\- - -\Why did bridge collapse?\The investigation will take months but here are the theories:\Construction work -- At the time of the collapse, 575,000 pounds of trucks and material were on the bridge as part of a deck-repair project. The bridge should have been able to handle that weight, but there are questions about whether it was concentrated in a relatively small area.\Heat -- Metal expands and contracts with temperature changes. Expansion joints were being replaced on the bridge. Previous inspections had shown bearings were sticking and not allowing the bridge to move with temperature changes. It had been a warm week before the collapse and was 89 degrees at the time the bridge failed.\Pavement thrust -- Related to heat, pavement thrust happens when the roadway on either side of a bridge expands and squeezes the span like a vise. Inspection reports from the late 1980s and '90s had noted that deck thrust was a problem.\Corrosion -- Years of winter road salts, an automated anti-icing system, pigeon droppings and a moist environment could have contributed to corrosion.\Design flaws -- Gusset plates that hold steel beams together are of interest.\----------\Source: St. Paul Pioneer Press\----------\mccormickj@tribune.com\Credit: By John McCormick, Tribune staff reporter"
320,"Selling the grass as greener in his dusty, drought-plagued state, Texas Gov. Rick Perry came to Chicago this week to paint his state as a commercial paradise and Illinois into a corner.\Perry is out to poach Illinois businesses and jobs. He says it's for our own good, as if those of us who live, work and invest here were somehow unaware of the lesser qualities of Illinois' business climate and merely needed some ads and the threat of lost commerce to spur action addressing long-standing state problems. \Using a calamity to rally the troops is a dog-eared page in the Texas playbook older than the state itself. Remember the Alamo? \""It's not personal. It's about competition,"" Perry said in an interview before meetings with business leaders at and around the BIO International Convention, a global conference for bioscience and related industries, the kind of booming sector every local, state and national government wants a piece of. \Perry is not the only governor out to siphon commerce this week. Wisconsin's Scott Walker on Tuesday attended the same Chicago conference, touting his state's business environment and standing as a bioscience leader. A day earlier, Florida's Rick Scott sent a ""Wish you were here"" letter to Illinois business owners, noting that his state is ""nipping at the heels of Texas every day"" as a place to do business and pointing out that ""Illinois' formula of more taxing and spending ISN'T WORKING."" (Never let it be said Scott is undercapitalized.) \Outwardly, these politicians are evangelists for their states. But they also are apostles of business-friendly agendas. \Perry isn't just selling Texas in a state weighed down by budget crises and the lack of political will to make the tough choices that solutions will require. He is on a trip financed by a public-private partnership to sell the concepts of lower taxes, less government interference, ""a legal system that doesn't allow for oversuing,"" lower workers comp rates. \""This is already successful because there are people talking about it, there are people writing about it, there are businesses that are having conversations,"" said Perry, who made a late entry and early exit from the race for last year's Republican presidential nomination. ""Success is the discussion of these principles."" \In this, pitting one state against another is good, Perry argued, in ""the same way that it's good for the White Sox and the Cubbies to compete against each other. If you don't have competition, you're not going to get pushed out of your comfort zone. That's the simplest form I can put it in. I think our Founding Fathers understood that you had these laboratories of innovation and the ones that were good at it would be successful."" \Founding Fathers or not, the message of Perry and others is clear: We may be one nation, indivisible, but not all tax rates are created equal. In the pursuit of life, liberty and better margins, however, there's always a price to pay. Every state has its drawbacks, to be sure. \""I hope people will come to Texas and see what works and see what doesn't,"" Perry said. ""We watch and see what happens in other places, and we compete against each other. Trust me, Rick Scott and Bobby Jindal, Susana Martinez, Mary Fallin, they are all governors that are looking for ways to make their states more competitive and they will come to Texas (firms) and say, 'Hey, listen, why don't you consider coming over?' "" \It may be coincidental, but Scott, Louisiana's Jindal, New Mexico's Martinez and Oklahoma's Fallin are, like Perry and Walker, Republicans. Illinois and California, where Perry launched a similar campaign to entice businesses to move or expand in Texas, are led by Democrats. \Perry contends that he went to Florida on the same mission, attending a conference there this month with Scott. But it was not the same concerted effort as waged in the states of Gov. Pat Quinn, who dismissed Perry here as ""a big talker,"" and Gov. Jerry Brown, who reportedly called a modest California ad buy to promote Texas ""a burp."" \It's all part of a conversation. Jindal has proposed eliminating Louisiana's personal income tax, which Perry said would make his eastern neighbor more attractive, pushing Texas to become even more hospitable. ""That's how I look at it,"" he said. ""And I hope the people of Illinois or California, or which other state we might end up in someday in the future, would look at it that way."" \Illinois' high taxes and budget woes, exacerbated by its unresolved state pension fiasco and the lack of political will in Springfield to address it, make this state inviting to appeals such as these. Even Chicago apparently has a target on its back, with a New York Times book reviewer on Sunday contriving to portray the city as little but a second-rate, hopelessly corrupt, not-quite ghost town in which no sentient person would ever take pride. Honestly. \That's why you might catch an ad for the business benefits of New York, hear about what Indiana has to offer or spy the rolling billboard advertising the charms of operating in New Jersey. Whether the efforts will gain traction is another matter. \""Illinois is a good place to have a business, but it could be better,"" said Dan Rutherford, Illinois' Republican treasurer, suggesting the state actually stacks up well against Texas and other rivals in many significant areas. ""By the time you ferret all of this out, I don't see Gov. Perry's net effect being a gain to Texas or a loss to Illinois. ... To the effect of having helped the Illinois economy by (Perry) spending money here, we say, 'Thank you.' It's inconsequential, but every little bit helps."" \Take a good look at how close the fertilizer factory that blew up last week was to a middle school and nursing home in West, Texas, and decide for yourself whether you endorse Texas' stance on zoning (""We respect local control,"" Perry said) or think the state should intervene. Laissez faire isn't always the way to go. \""When you really get down to it, this is about the issue of (Illinois) taxes, and it gets back to the spending at the Statehouse,"" he said of Illinois. ""There are hard decisions that this state has to make, and if they don't, the result will be that businesses ... will in some cases relocate. And it is almost assured they will not expand here."" \Texas has a nearly $12 billion emergency fund, raised in part through its natural gas tax, giving Perry economic latitude. He said he would like to invest some of that ""rainy day"" money in much needed improvements in surface transportation and water projects because, ironically, there's not enough rain. \Add water to the Texas dust, and he'll have even more mud to sling. \----------\philrosenthal@tribune.com \Twitter @phil_rosenthal"
321," Facing mounting criticism of his stewardship of county government, Cook County Board President John Stroger on Thursday proposed a 2004 spending plan that includes a sales tax increase and a new lease tax to close a gaping budget deficit.\ Although Stroger has long been accustomed to having his priorities rubber-stamped by the board, a newly emerging bloc of insurgents immediately vowed to fight the tax proposals and said they have rounded up enough votes to stop them.\ The release of the proposed budget came less than two weeks after the fatal fire in the Cook County Administration Building in the Loop, which has greatly increased scrutiny of the three-term president. And, in an acknowledgment of the fire's impact, Stroger preceded his budget remarks by asking for a moment of silence in memory of the six workers who died of smoke inhalation while trying to escape a locked stairwell.\ Despite the budget problems, Stroger pledged to spend whatever it takes to make sure county buildings are safe.\ ""I fully intend to provide the necessary funding to install ... life-safety systems, including sprinklers, to ensure a safe environment for our employees and the public,"" he said.\ The $2.99 billion budget he proposed for the fiscal year beginning Dec. 1 holds the line on the county's portion of the property tax levy but still represents a 4.3 percent increase over current spending, a rise that Stroger blamed largely on higher wages and health benefits.\ But several commissioners, including some of Stroger's fellow Democrats, said he had not done enough to squeeze out inefficiencies and cut costs.\ ""This is the `Groundhog Day' of budgets,"" said Democratic Commissioner Mike Quigley, who recently released his own study of how to save money by restructuring county government. ""It never changes. You wake up and the new budget is out, and it's the exact same thing as the old budget. And we learn nothing.""\ Stroger had said he needed to close a roughly $100 million budget hole. To do that, he asked commissioners to approve an increase in the county's portion of the sales tax from .75 percent to 1 percent. If they agree, that would bring the total sales tax on merchandise purchased in Chicago to 9 percent and to at least 8 percent in suburban Cook County, where overall sales tax charges vary from municipality to municipality.\ The sales tax hike would only generate an estimated $11 million in 2004 because it would not take effect until July 1 and there's a 90-day collection lag from the state.\ New tax on leased items\ If approved, the new 4 percent lease tax would take effect in January and generate an estimated $47 million. It would primarily affect those who lease automobiles and computers, but it would affect other personal property that may be leased.\ The tax is modeled after a 6 percent lease tax already levied in Chicago. City residents would be hit with both taxes on leases, Stroger said.\ He said the county expected to get an extra $32 million in federal health care funds in coming months and that would be used to close much of the rest of the deficit.\ ""These are difficult times that require some hard decisions and some difficult decisions,"" Stroger said in the address to commissioners.\ He pledged to hold the county's property tax levy at $720.5 million for the fifth straight year. He said his administration has not received the credit it deserves for reducing the county's reliance on property taxes since he took office in late 1994.\ Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a government watchdog, agreed that Stroger should be congratulated for keeping down the county portion of property taxes. Overall, however, Msall said the 2004 proposed budget falls short.\ ""We're disappointed that the county has not sought further operational efficiencies instead of tax increases,"" Msall said. ""We just think that difficult but necessary cuts in personnel are needed to balance the budget in these difficult economic times.""\ Msall said Stroger has addressed inefficiencies and cut personnel but that other elected county officials need to do the same. Stroger should take a page from Gov. Rod Blagojevich and force the other officials to slash their budgets, Msall said.\ ""This is not a revenue problem for the county, this is an expenditure problem,"" Msall said.\ Sheriff asked to make cuts\ The one with the biggest budget outside of Stroger is Cook County Sheriff Michael Sheahan, who had requested funding for 100 new guards at the Cook County Jail.\ Stroger rejected the request and said his budget also would seek a reduction in 40 other jobs from the sheriff's budget. Sheahan's staff bristled at Stroger's tone and said the sheriff had voluntarily agreed to cut 30 positions, including clerks, janitors and an elevator operator.\ ""The sheriff in recognition of the county's fiscal crisis agreed to the elimination of 30 non-sworn positions within his budget,"" said spokeswoman Sally Daly, adding that Sheahan will propose his own ideas for cost savings and revenue increases when he addresses the board. ""The bottom line is the sheriff has grown tired of being the bad guy every budget season.""\ Under Stroger's proposal, Sheahan's budget would grow 3.6 percent to $421 million. The budgets of State's Atty. Richard Devine and Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown would increase 3.7 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively.\ By far the largest budget under Stroger's authority is the Bureau of Health Services, which has a proposed increase of 6.9 percent to $884 million. Within that is Stroger Hospital, named after the board president, which opened in late 2002.\ At the time, Stroger promised that the new facility would run more efficiently than the old Cook County Hospital it replaced and save taxpayers money. But the proposed 2004 budget for the hospital is $461 million, a 7.1 percent increase. The new budget includes 32 more positions for the hospital than were included in the 2003 budget when Stroger unveiled it a year ago.\ Commissioner Larry Suffredin said Thursday he has told Stroger that he intends to comb the budget ""line by line,"" a level of scrutiny that has rarely happened under Stroger. Both Suffredin and fellow Democratic Commissioner Forrest Claypool say that they have lined up nine votes--representing a majority on the 17 member board- -to defeat the sales and lease tax proposals. Quigley estimated the number of sure ""no"" votes as eight, including all five Republicans on the board.\ Suffredin and Claypool were elected to the board last year, and the 2004 budget is the first they have had a hand in vetting.\ One key swing vote will be Commissioner Roberto Maldonado, a Chicago Democrat.

Long gone are the days when as hunter- gatherers, we could roam the land, cut or burn a few trees, throw our trash wherever we please and move on, leaving the land little disturbed.\Scientists (not hacks for oil companies) from widely varied fields of study, working on very different types of research, have come to the same conclusion via many paths: global warming is occurring and the release of greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels and other human activities is the culprit.\And yes, as the major emitter of greenhouse gases on the planet, the U.S. does bear responsibility if severe weather is getting out of hand across the world.\Let's look at the company Al Gore is associated with: Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield and Byers. According to its Web site, KPCB is about ""Greentech innovation and entrepreneurs,"" in other words, encouraging small businesses to come up with global solutions to the major environmental problems of clean water, clean power and clean transportation.\CNews on the Internet says Al Gore is not ""cashing in,"" but rather is donating his salary from KPCB to the Alliance for Climate Protection. It will be the work of countless entrepreneurs and inventors working with companies like KPCB that will change the current reckless course of our civilization.\To consider the vast amounts of heat-absorbing greenhouse gases and other garbage we put into the air and still believe that Mother Nature is the only influence on our climate is naive.

No matter how busy he is, Mike is always there for us.\Mike has a very social awareness of his responsibility to reach out to God's wounded people. This is true whether it is a person with mental and/or physical disabilities or injured players.\God bless Mike Ditka! He is a good and caring man!\Sister Rosemary Connelly\Executive Director\Misericordia, Chicago\Baseball deserves no fan following\Once upon a time, some 60 odd years ago, I was a baseball fan. It was a time when we called baseball players ""heroes"" before we knew the definition of the word.\And yet, fielders showed up for every game, pitchers occasionally pitched complete double-headers, and all were available to sign autographs free for kids after the game was played.\As television came upon the scene, so did money - big time! This changed ""America's Pastime"" forever. No longer did the average player earn 50-60 times the wages of ordinary Americans but were being paid much more - from this multiple to what is now 800-900 times the pay of an ordinary worker.\And by that time my interest in the game started to wane. Baseball left the world of sports and entered the world of big business.\As of this writing as baseball Commissioner Bud Selig is being questioned by sportswriters, he is hedging concerning his future actions even as he praises George Mitchell for his diligence and thoroughness.\Why? Because he is complicit as are the team owners, the baseball union and the players so named! Their collective benign neglect and permissive behavior in the pursuit of greater profit, bargaining power and salaries should be the content of Mitchell's report as well.\I abandoned the game with the baseball strike in 1994 when both sides in the dispute minimized the impact of fans on the game in pursuit of wealth and greed.\I have been vindicated in my judgment to leave what was once a wonderful game and now with this committee's report, unilaterally accusing only the players of league violations, the decision I made more than 13 years ago has become personally prophetic.\James D.

This heavy burden, accompanied by the tax cost of every hair-brained idea the politicians can dream up, have many gasping for breath already.\Isn't it about time the mass transit users pay their fair share of the cost of travel?\Not so long ago, with the collapse of the bridge in Minnesota, the powers that be were all clamoring for repairs to be made to our highway infrastructure. These repairs should have been made already with the gas tax that for years motorist have been paying, instead of these funds being siphoned off to provide cheap mass transit.\Mass transit in Illinois is already being subsidized.

323,"
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun a new regulatory campaign that will cost owners of underground storage tanks an estimated $50 billion. By the government's own calculations, that could put up to 41 percent of the country's small gasoline station owners out of business during the next 15 years.
\
The rules for underground tanks are meant to solve a problem that no one-not even the association that represents small station operators-disputes is in need of a solution. In Illinois, a new leak from an underground tank is reported every day. In the six-state Midwestern region of the EPA, more than 3,000 leaks have been reported.
\
But solving the problem will create an upheaval that promises to pile up stacks of winners and losers. The winners: the contractors, suppliers and consultants who will reap the $50 billion that compliance with technical and insurance requirements will cost nationwide, according to an EPA assessment. If the rules have the intended effect, the 50 percent of the U.S. population that relies on groundwater supplies should also benefit in having one less threat to their drinking water.
\
And the losers? The businesses that will go under in the face of those costs-and their customers. EPA estimates of the fallout range from 28 to 41 percent of small firms-those with annual sales of less than $4.6 million.
\
""People don't realize that this is going to hit them as hard as it will,"" said Bill Deutsch, vice president of the Illinois Petroleum Marketers Association, which predicts from a survey of small station owners that 1,000 stations-or about a fifth-will shut down in Illinois.
\
""It'll bring shortages-not of product but of places where you can get product. The worst thing is that they (the stations that will close) will be in the small towns where there's only one station. You'll have to go 20 or 30 miles to get your gas.""
\
The first deadline for tank owners comes at the end of the year, when tanks that were installed before 1965 or at an unknown date must have some kind of system for detecting leaks. All tanks must have such a detection device by 1993, and by 1998 all tanks must be rust-proofed and have protection against spills and overfills, common sources of small amounts of soil contamination.
\
Any new tank must have all of these protective measures before it can go into the ground.
\
For a typical gasoline station with three 10,000-gallon tanks, the cost of upgrading them will be $30,000 to $50,000, according to Gerald Phillips, head of the underground storage tank program in the Chicago headquarters of EPA's Midwestern region. Putting in three new tanks runs $80,000 to $100,000, he said.
\
Tanks that hold hazardous chemicals have to have even more protection, in the form of an outer tank wall or a lining for the hole where the tank rests. Some kind of leak detector must be installed between the tank and either the outer wall or lining.
\
""It's not my goal to put people out of business,"" said Phillips. ""But my job is to protect human health and the environment, and we're going to be spending a lot of money for a long time cleaning up what's already out there.""
\
An enormous number of leaking tanks await action. Studies have estimated that a quarter of the country's underground tanks are leaking. That would amount to almost 100,000 tanks in the Midwest. So far, 603 leaks have been reported in Illinois, but the average age of all registered tanks is 14 years, said John S. Moore of the state fire marshal's office. The life expectancy of a tank is 15 years.
\
""Most releases are small,"" Phillips said. ""Seventy or eighty percent are not major environmental threats, but even 30 percent of 100,000 tanks is a lot of big leaks.""
\
Most leaks are similar to a case in downtown Naperville, where the city plans to build its new City Hall. A portion of the land had been the site of a filling station since the 1920s.
\
Last summer, while workers were taking soil borings, they noticed the smell of gasoline rising from the drill holes. Gas had leaked from one or more of the tanks over many years and saturated the soil. Some samples of the groundwater showed that the gas had contaminated it, too.
\
Visions of cost overruns and delayed construction schedules began to haunt Bob Lovell, the city's facilities project manager. Groundwater contamination is unavoidably exorbitant to clean up. The cost of drilling wells, installing pumps and treating polluted water probably cannot be done for less than $250,000, Phillips said.
\
But, of all the things that petroleum leaking from an underground tank can do, contamination of the groundwater poses the greatest potential threat. Many of the constituents of gasoline are carcinogenic, even in minute quantities. Just 6 parts per billion of benzene, a known carcinogen, is enough to make water unsafe for consumption.
\
Fortunately for Naperville, the leak apparently occurred many years ago and the level of contamination was not so great as to require treatment. The city need only remove the old tanks and a few hundred cubic yards of soil, which will be trucked to a Geneva landfill. Cost: about $30,000.
\
""We're probably getting off lightly,"" Lovell said. ""We're reasonably lucky. I feel sorry for these mom-and-pop operations. I don't know where the money will come from for them.""
\
The prospect of costly cleanups led the EPA to adopt a financial responsibility requirement as part of the regulations on underground tanks. Smaller petroleum marketers have until April, 1990, to show that they are covered for $1 million in potential cleanup costs. Large operators-mainly the big oil companies-must have $2 million in coverage.
\
Insurance premiums on a $1 million policy would run into the thousands, oil marketers cried, so many states found ways to share the burden of the most expensive cleanups. In Illinois, an annual $100 fee per tank goes into the LUST (Leaking Underground Storage Tank) trust fund to pay for cleanups that cost more than $100,000 and less than $1 million. Homeowners and farmers with tanks of more than 1,100 gallons must pay the fee; for businesses, the fee applies to any tank that holds more than 110 gallons.
\
The fund's first payout began two weeks ago when the cost of work at a Crystal Lake gasoline station hit six figures. The Berkshire Marathon station in the village reported the leak in June. State officials have learned that about 7,000 gallons of premium-unleaded gas flowed through a quarter-size hole in the bottom of a tank. The hole was punched through the fiber glass wall when a worker dropped a wooden dipstick into the tank, said Jim Frank, manager of the Illinois EPA's cleanup programs.
\
Now the state figures it will take at least four years and perhaps $500,000 to clean up the site, which is only 250 feet from a public water well.
\
In emergencies, a federal cleanup fund that is financed through a 0.1 cent per gallon gas tax can be tapped, as it has been to protect residents near the Little Village Car Wash, 2600 W. Cermak Rd. Gas from two tanks on the site-once owned by suspected drug dealer Rene Villareal, who was murdered in July-had seeped into the basement of a nearby apartment building. The tenants were evacuated because of overpowering fumes and the threat of an explosion.
\
The fund is similar to the federal Superfund program for cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste dumps. But, notes Phillips, the underground tank problem is both less dramatic and more threatening than toxic dumps.
\
""We don't have a lot of biggies like Superfund sites,"" he said. ""But we've got a lot of small ones and they're everywhere.""

326,"CORRECTION: This story contains corrected material, published May 11, 2012.\The question has bedeviled Lake County for decades: Is there a way to relieve chronic traffic congestion while minimizing sprawl and protecting some of the state's most pristine natural areas?\Until now, the answer has been no, but this month, it might change to a more hopeful maybe. \After months of spirited discussions, a blue-ribbon advisory council is expected to report on the prospect of extending Illinois Highway 53 north through central Lake County, where it would intersect with a new bypass of Illinois Highway 120. \Envisioned as a low-profile parkway -- a ""stealth highway,"" as one council member called it -- the project would relieve congestion while promoting orderly development and ensuring environmental sensitivity. \Council leaders say they are closer than ever to reaching a regional consensus on the long-contentious issue. But the ambitious plan still faces two major roadblocks: lingering environmental concerns and a billion-dollar funding gap. \""My feeling is, this is the last, best chance to get this right,"" said George Ranney, longtime civic leader and co-chair of the council. ""If we do it, we will have a wonderful example of a 21st-century highway design. ... And if we don't get it right, it shouldn't be built."" \Specifically, the draft report calls for a 121/2-mile extension of Route 53 running north from Lake-Cook Road and forming a ""T"" with a 14-mile corridor along east-west Highway 120 (Belvidere Road) near Grayslake. \The 25-member council which comprises public officials, planners, environmentalists and labor and business leaders -- has developed three possible alignments for the east-west stretch. \Each would bypass Highway 120 and take different paths near two environmentally sensitive areas, Squaw Creek Complex and Almond Marsh. \Cost estimates for the project range from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion. \Although questions remain about how the project will be paid for and significant environmental opposition remains, Lake County Board Chairman David Stolman said he is optimistic the council will approve the project. \Here are some questions. \Why is the new highway needed? \State and local officials have sought to extend Route 53 into Lake County since the 1960s, but opposition from some communities and environmentalists stymied the effort. Proponents cite an April 2009 advisory referendum as a breakthrough. About 76 percent of voters supported the proposition. \Meanwhile, as the county's population has grown, so has congestion. The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning says the 53-120 project is needed to improve access and mobility not just in Lake County but in the region. \The draft report notes that extending Route 53 north would ease a notorious bottleneck where the existing highway ends at Lake-Cook Road. About 100,000 vehicles a day pass through the intersection. \How would the highway look? \Plans call for the parkway to be four lanes wide to minimize its footprint. Much of it would be built below grade level, with landscaped earthen berms 5 to 7 feet high on either side. \""The purpose is to make sure it doesn't overshadow the communities,"" Stolman said. ""People don't want to see a big monstrosity of an expressway."" \Stolman, the council's co-chairman, called the project a ""stealth highway."" \The report recommends a boulevard-type parkway in keeping with the agency's plan for a ""21st-century urban highway."" \""There is consensus that this should not look like a regular interstate highway,"" said Randy Blankenhorn, the agency's executive director and council member. ""It should fit into the context of the county. It should not look like the Tri-State."" \The lanes of at least one section of the Highway 120 portion would be widely separated to protect natural areas. \The corridor would include a trail for bikes and pedestrians, connect with existing trails and accommodate bus transit. \How would the project be paid for? \Since little or no state funding would be available, the project would be built as a tollway, the report says. \But the parkway wouldn't pay for itself. Charging tolls for cars and trucks at current rates over the next 15 years would produce only $40 million to $105 million, depending on which alignment is chosen. \That leaves a hefty shortfall -- as much as $2 billion. \Plans call for tolls to be ""congestion-priced,"" that is, the cost would depend on the level of traffic -- the more traffic, the higher the toll. Tolls also would be indexed to rise with inflation. \In a proposal sure to spark controversy, tolls would be levied on Route 53 from Lake-Cook Road south to the Jane Addams Tollway (Interstate Highway 90). \Stolman said he believes that the project should be funded as a part of the entire Illinois Tollway system, and not looked at as strictly a ""Lake County highway."" \The Reagan Tollway (I-88) ""doesn't pay for itself. I-355 doesn't pay for itself,"" he said. ""The people of Lake County shouldn't be put into a penalty box."" \The report proposes several options that could raise local revenue, including creation of special taxing districts along the corridor. The rationale is that nearby property will rise in value as it benefits from construction of the new highway. \Other options include raising Lake County's sales tax and imposing a county gas tax. \What are environmental concerns? \The panel recommends a ""comprehensive planning approach"" to reduce long-term and irreversible impacts to the environment. \The proposed highway would run near or through four prime wetlands: Long Grove Surry Marsh, Indian Creek Marsh, Almond Marsh and the Squaw Creek Complex. \To protect the wetlands, some sections would be built on pylons as an elevated, open causeway. \A stormwater management system would filter runoff. Instead of running into storm sewers, the water would be directed into swales planted with native prairie and wetland vegetation. \To control light pollution, the highway would have overhead lighting only at interchanges. \Alternatives to road salt, such as a sugar beet-derived formula, would prevent damage to the surrounding ecosystems. \Although environmentalists participated in the discussions, not all their concerns have been allayed. \Steve Barg, executive director Conserve Lake County, formerly known as the Liberty Prairie Conservancy, and other opponents say the highway should not run through Almond Marsh, home to a heron rookery. \""This (rookery) has statewide conservation significance,"" Barg said. ""It's not the herons versus the road"" (this sentence as published has been corrected in this text). \The Sierra Club and five other organizations contend that the proposed highway would ""destroy irreplaceable natural resources (and) contribute to new development, congestion problems and pollution."" \What happens next? \Since the draft report is still being refined, its final recommendations could change somewhat, according to the chairmen. \It is scheduled to be completed later this month, after additional comments are included from council participants and the public. \The draft is available at www.illinoistollway.com. \The council is scheduled to hold a final meeting on the document May 18. The report will be sent to the Illinois Tollway board for consideration. \What happens then hasn't been determined, tollway Executive Director Kristi Lafleur said. \The key question for tollway directors is deciding whether to take on the project -- and at what cost. \The agency has launched a massive 15-year construction program, paid for with the near-doubling of tolls Jan. 1. The work includes building a new bypass around O'Hare International Airport and expanding the existing Elgin-O'Hare Expressway, which would become a tollway. \The agency will pay most of the $3.4 billion cost, but about $300 million remains unfunded and is expected to come from local communities, mainly in DuPage County. \The tollway's capital program includes money for planning a 53/120 project, but no construction funds. \Asked last week if that could change, Lafleur said only that the tollway's $12.1 billion program has some funding ""flexibility."" \""If something emerges, there may be some opportunity to support additional projects over that 15-year period,"" she said. \---------- \rwronski@tribune.com \Twitter @richwronski\Credit: By Richard Wronski, Tribune reporter"
327," Fifty years ago this week Kenneth Gray, a congressman from southern Illinois, stood at the bedside of President Dwight Eisenhower to witness the signing of legislation creating the interstate highway system.\ The ceremony took place on June 29, 1956, at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, where Eisenhower was being treated for heart problems.\ House Speaker Sam Rayburn, U.S. Rep. Jim Wright and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, all Texans; Gray, from West Frankfort, Ill.; and U.S. Rep. John Dingle of Michigan helped write the Federal-Aid Highway Act.\ They shared the goal of bringing about unprecedented growth in mobility throughout the United States, envisioning Americans traveling across the entire nation without stopping for a single traffic light.\ Gray, Dingle and Wright are the surviving members of the original group, having lived through the transformation of narrow country roads into superhighways, toll roads and bridges that are engineering marvels.\ Yet today, experts see a 50-year-old highway system that is entering a mid-life crisis caused by previously unimaginable traffic congestion, inadequate funding for states and cities to build their way out of gridlock and an absence of policies and planning to balance the major modes of ground transportation: roads, mass transit and intercity passenger rail.\ Back in the 1950s, the primary issue to Gray was building better roads to create jobs and boost economic development in his dirt- poor district.\ ""The coal mines were beginning to close, and we had a lot of people out of work in southern Illinois. I took that urgent need for roads--which ranked even higher among my constituents than the need for better housing--back to Washington,"" said Gray, 81, who in 1956 was completing his first term in a 20-year career in Congress.\ Eisenhower used only one pen to sign the Federal-Aid Highway Act, and that pen is on display today at Gray's presidential and congressional museum in West Frankfort, about 300 miles south of Chicago.\ ""It started the greatest public works program in the history of the world, and it was the best thing that happened to this country since the ending of World War II,"" said Gray, a former military helicopter pilot who often transported Eisenhower, the commanding general of the Allied forces in Europe.\ The number of vehicle miles traveled annually since 1956 has increased almost 400 percent, and the rolls of licensed drivers have jumped more than 160 percent.\ But Gray, a Democrat, is quick to point out the potholes in historical accounts that credit Eisenhower, a Republican, with championing construction of today's almost 47,000-mile interstate highway system.\ Eisenhower, who is dubbed the father of the ""Ike Autobahns,"" modeled after the highways American troops had seen in Germany, advocated building a highway network spanning only about 20,000 miles, records show.\ Eisenhower's main objective was to connect military bases across the U.S. for mobilization of soldiers and supplies during the Cold War, with a secondary goal of evacuating civilians from urban areas that might be targeted by a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union.\ ""Eisenhower was a military man; that was all he could see. He and other Republicans thought the country couldn't afford to pay for a bigger highway system,"" said Gray, who on Saturday attended a 50th anniversary ceremony in Ottawa, Ill., commemorating a test roadbed that was the prototype to handle the weight of military vehicle convoys. The test road is near the current Interstate Highway 80.\ On Monday, Illinois transportation officials will greet members of a 20-vehicle convoy traveling coast to coast in honor of the 50th anniversary of the interstate system. About 2,100 miles of interstate highway run through Illinois, including the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate Highway 290) in the Chicago area. Only Texas and California have more interstate miles.\ The event, sponsored by the American Association of State Highway Officials, will be held near I-80 in Tinley Park. The convoy left San Francisco on June 16 and is scheduled to arrive in Washington, D.C., on Thursday.\ In the summer of 1919, a young Lt. Col. Eisenhower participated in the first Army transcontinental motor convoy on the old Lincoln Highway. It took two months to make the 3,251-mile trip from Washington to San Francisco on poor roads.\ Despite the many impassable roads Eisenhower encountered, legislation creating the federal highway system failed to pass Congress in 1955, Gray's freshman year in the House of Representatives.\ ""A year later, Jim Wright and I went to talk to Eisenhower at the White House and we told him we had the votes to override a presidential veto of the highway act,"" Gray said. ""He said, 'You are throwing away money, but OK, I will sign it.'""\ To fund the ambitious plan, the first gasoline tax--1 cent per gallon--was enacted. It raised $1 billion annually for highway construction.\ Even with increases in the federal gas tax and the imposition of state and local motor fuel taxes, the need for better roads and mass- transit services far outstrips the available funding.\ Government auditors warn that the federal Highway Trust Fund, which pays for a big part of highway construction and maintenance, transit infrastructure projects and transportation safety projects, could run out of money by 2009.\ ""One of the great holes in American transportation funding is that there is no systematic program to renew the interstate highways,"" said David Schulz, executive director of the Infrastructure and Technology Institute at Northwestern University.\ ""No one even pretends that the $286 billion in the current federal transportation funding bill is sufficient to simply maintain the current system,"" Schulz said. ""The 50th anniversary of the interstate system would be a good time to confront the reality that we must find more money to pay for roads and transit in the U.S.""\ Meanwhile, there are concerns about the environmental impact of urban sprawl and uncontrolled development that have sprung up around the interstate highways in many places, including suburban Chicago.\ ""Storm waters from the interstate highways run off into local sewers, forcing those systems to dump raw pollution into streams and rivers,"" said Michael Replogle, transportation director at Environmental Defense. ""Over the next 50 years we can produce a greener transportation system that does not put our mobility above our environment and our public health.""\ The organization advocates the use of better communications and traffic-information systems, off-peak travel time pricing incentives and public-private partnerships. The goal is to squeeze more efficiency out of existing and future transportation resources in an environmentally conscious way that wasn't recognized when the first highways were built.\ Toll rates that vary by the time of day on bridges and tunnels in the New York-New Jersey corridor across the Hudson River have cut peak traffic congestion by about 7 percent. The tolls help fund the PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) commuter rail service that operates between Newark and Lower Manhattan, Replogle noted.\ Experts also point to the conversion of high-occupancy vehicle lanes, which have not been successful in some locations, to high- occupancy toll lanes, allowing drivers traveling alone to pay a premium toll to escape the traffic congestion on freeways. In the San Diego area, the tolls help finance express buses serving the northern suburbs near Interstate Highway 15.\ Converting two lanes of unmanaged freeway into toll-managed lanes brings about the equivalent of creating a new traffic lane, without having to build the extra lane, some studies in Minnesota and California have shown.\ ""We cannot build our way out of congestion, but we can use smart approaches to better manage the system we have,"" Replogle said.\ ----------\ Contact Getting Around at jhilkevitch@tribune.com or c/o the Chicago Tribune, 435 N.

Tolls could double during rush hours, under a concept known as ""congestion pricing."" \Critics contend that many motorists won't pay these tolls. Systemwide, Tollway users currently pay an average of 6 cents per mile. \Plans call for extending existing Route 53 for 12.5 miles north from Lake Cook Road to Grayslake.

Adding a new tollway would appear to require another toll increase, but Lafleur said it all depended on ""how the board decides to move forward."" \As governor, Rauner appoints Tollway directors, and five members' terms expire May 1. They could be extended temporarily. \Rauner's spokeswoman would not answer questions about Route 53 and the Tollway. \A spokesman for IDOT, meanwhile, said acting Secretary Randy Blankenhorn, also a Rauner appointee, did not have time to discuss the project. \Blankenhorn previously served as executive director of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which listed Route 53 among its top priorities in its master plan for northeastern Illinois. \Blankenhorn's staff at CMAP recommended against construction of the Illiana, which would be an IDOT partnership with private investors and not part of the Tollway system. Rauner has put the Illiana on hold. \CMAP was also a partner in the Route 53 planning process, which produced the Lake County committee's recommendations. \The committee's feasibility study calls for raising about one-third of the project's funding from Lake County, including imposing a new county gas tax and creating a special taxing district. \That would still leave a shortfall of $1.36 billion to $1.91 billion, which would have to come from users of the rest of the Tollway system under the current scenario. \The committee's recommendations are expected to prompt questions of fairness from Tollway users outside Lake County. Chief among them is whether the project offers a great enough benefit for the Chicago area as a whole, rather than just for Lake County. \Why, for example, should Tollway users who travel along the Reagan Memorial Tollway (Interstate 88) from Naperville to Oak Brook subsidize motorists who drive from Grayslake to Buffalo Grove? \One critic, Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center, said the key question about the project comes down to ""Who will pay for it?"" \The proponents' plan ""isn't financially viable and seeks to rely on other people's money to pay the way"" for the new tollway, Learner said. \Lawlor contends the funding proposal for Route 53 is equitable. The Tollway network ""is a regional system,"" he said. \""This project was identified by CMAP as a regional priority.

This version may vary slightly from what actually appeared in the paper.; 1805 Treaty of Grouseland, circuit court
\
SPRINGFIELD As the dust settles after the hectic end to the spring legislative session, area General Assembly members can look back at both successes and frustrations.
\
Many bills they sponsored never made it through both chambers, let alone one of them. But other bills survived the whole process and now await Gov. George Ryan's signature.
\
Here's a look at how the area's lawmakers fared:
\
State Rep. Tom Berns
\
104th House District
\
R-Urbana
\
In his first spring legislative session, Berns spent most of his time learning about the process and meeting people, but he managed to send two bills to the governor's desk.
\
The first bill creates a licensing process and guidelines for speech-language pathology assistants, and the second relates to sustainable agriculture.
\
Both Lakeland and Parkland colleges have programs to train speech- language pathology assistants, Berns said.
\
""This was a way for the state to recognize them as a licensed field,"" he said.
\
The sustainable agriculture bill supports the new $3 million Agrifirst value-added program.
\
Berns also sponsored a bill that would require background checks on all prospective peace officers in the state, but that one failed to advance to the governor.
\
It passed the House, and the Senate passed an amended version. The House needed to approve the amendment before the bill could head to the governor, but the final version was never called for a vote.
\
""I was disappointed with that,"" Berns said.
\
He also attempted to pass bills to end the state's regulation of professional wrestling and to include Urbana's Carle Foundation Hospital in a pool of academic medicine money for teaching hospitals.
\
Berns was appointed to the Illinois Geographic Information Council and the Legislative Space Needs Commission, which owns and operates the state Capitol and its grounds.
\
""I felt very good as a freshman beginning to learn the people and the process and to get things done,"" Berns said. ""Obviously there's more to learn.""

\
State Rep. Bill Black
\
105th House District
\
R-Danville
\
Black sent the governor a bill that would give money for attorney costs to landowners defending their property against claims by the Miami Indians.
\
He also guided a bill through both chambers that exempts the Danville Correctional Center and other prisons from expensive enhanced 911 provisions in state law.
\
The anti-bestiality bill that earned him the most ribbing from colleagues sailed through the House, but didn't go anywhere in the Senate.
\
A bill that would have encouraged, but not mandated, school consolidation also passed the House, but lost momentum in the Senate.
\
One of the issues Black was most passionate about never even made it out of the House rules committee.
\
Black filed three separate pieces of legislation that would lift the state's gas tax from July 1 to Sept. 30.
\
Temporarily repealing the 19-cent tax on gasoline and the 21-cent tax on diesel would cost the state's road fund $300 million in lost revenue, which could be made up with Illinois FIRST or other bond funds, Black said.
\
""Given the fact that gasoline prices are higher today than they were last summer when we declared an emergency and temporarily lifted the state's 5 percent sales tax on gas, I don't see why we couldn't have the opportunity to debate it,"" Black said.
\
Another bill that got tied up in political games would have created a special license plate to raise money for hospice care.
\
Black said that he was so moved by the plea from Lonnie Dirks of the Iroquois Memorial Hospital in Watseka, he immediately refiled the bill on the last day of session so it could be considered as early as this fall when it became clear that the original version was irretrievably bogged down.

\
While she was again unable to get anywhere with her bill to eliminate General Assembly scholarships, Curry did send a bill to Ryan requiring better reporting of all tuition waivers, including those handed out by state lawmakers.
\
A recent state audit found that state universities have not been keeping close enough tabs on the tuition waiver process, which granted $142 million worth of free courses in Illinois in the 1999- 2000 school year.
\
Curry's bill would require each public university to report annually to the Illinois Board of Higher Education and the General Assembly.
\
Curry also sent a bill to the governor that would ban methyl tertiary butyl ether, an environmentally dangerous fuel additive.
\
In the United States, Illinois is the largest producer and consumer of ethanol, a corn-based alternative to MTBE.
\
The ban is important to public health, the environment and to the state's agriculture industry, Curry said.
\
However, she said she is most proud of her work to negotiate an increase in the per-student poverty grant amount for schools. That provision was included in the budget and in a major school finance bill passed on the final day of session.
\
The change will help downstate urban districts like Champaign, Danville and Decatur, Curry said.
\
""That is substantial for those school districts that have been struggling,"" she said.
\
Curry was not as successful with her efforts to ban smoking in restaurants, limit increases for health insurance premiums to the rate of inflation and stop age discrimination in vehicle rentals.

\
Myers sent several bills to the governor's desk this session, including one to require colleges and universities to inform students and their parents about the meningitis vaccine.
\
State colleges and universities would also have to offer the vaccine on campus but would not have to pay for the $75 shots.
\
The University of Illinois already offers the vaccine free.
\
In 1992, seven students at the UI contracted meningitis, an infection of the brain lining and spinal cord, and two of them died from it.
\
Other Myers-sponsored bills awaiting Ryan's signature outline the procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of regional superintendent of schools and block the elimination of an associate judge seat in her court district.
\
Myers also passed a bill that would give local emergency planning committees advisory powers over any emergency services and disaster agency engaged in their area, and she guided Black's defense fund bill for landowners in the Miami case to passage in the Senate.
\
Myers did not have as much luck with her bill to allow counties to raise a number of different fees.
\
She also failed to get anywhere with a bill to allow State Universities Retirement System members to retire at any age after 30 years of service.
\
Another bill Myers worked on, but did not pass, would have provided emergency mortgage assistance to families in disaster or crisis situations.
\
""It's tough for people who need help for just a tiny period of time until they can get back on their feet again,"" she said. ""I think it was the price tag that stopped it, but I want to work on it over the summer and try again.""

State Sen. Stanley Weaver
\
52nd Senate District
\
R-Urbana
\
Weaver could not get enough senators to vote for a bill to include Carle Foundation Hospital in a pool of money for teaching hospitals, but he managed to get the money in the budget anyway.
\
His bill to include Carle would have taken away money from teaching hospitals for UI schools of medicine at Rockford and Peoria and for Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in Springfield, plus several Chicago area hospitals.
\
They share a pool of state money that totals about $18 million.
\
As the Senate majority leader and a member of the powerful Senate appropriations committee, Weaver was able to get a provision in the final budget package that granted Carle $1 million as of July 1 and at least that much every year after.
\
By creating a separate pool of money for Carle, Weaver eliminated the resistance from lawmakers trying to protect the other hospitals' share of the $18 million.
\
Weaver said he was pleased the new approach worked.
\
""It's the fair thing to do,"" he said.
\
Weaver was very involved in the budget negotiations, which resulted in funding for a number of major projects at the UI.
\
He was also the Senate sponsor of House bills allowing beer sales at the UI Memorial Stadium during Chicago Bears games and enacting stricter tree-trimming guidelines for utilities, both of which were sent to the governor.
\
One House bill Weaver did not get as lucky with in the Senate would have granted full tuition waivers to children of university employees.
\
Employees of seven years or more can currently send their children to college for half-price, and that benefit will not increase in the near future.

State Rep. Rick Winkel

103rd House District
\
R-Champaign
\
The Winkel bill that got the most local attention would allow beer sales at Memorial Stadium during Chicago Bears games if the team comes to UI for the 2002 season.
\
A power play by House Democrats forced Winkel to add an amendment to his bill that allows alcohol sales at Cook County forest preserves. Once that happened, the bill sailed through the House and Senate, and now awaits the governor's signature.
\
The UI is the front-runner to become the Bears' home field while Soldier Field is renovated.
\
Bears officials have not made an announcement as to whether the team will come to Champaign-Urbana, but if it all works out, the area could see millions in extra tourism dollars.
\
Winkel tried to push bills through the House to eliminate the state sales tax on college textbooks, boost the minimum age for gambling and ban political contributions from gambling interests. Only the political contributions bill made it to the Senate, where it died.
\
Winkel did send the governor a bill creating an alternative- learning program for at-risk kids.
\
Under the bill, children as young as fourth grade who are deemed academically troubled could be pulled out of class for special instruction.
\
""I think rather than do nothing, we're looking to reach out and provide the services that children who are at risk academically need,"" Winkel said.
\
Parents would have to give permission for their child to participate in the alternative-learning program, which aims to get students back on track in their education.

\
Age: 48
\
Home: 1403 W. Green St.
\
Family: divorced, two children, Will and Chloe, seniors at Champaign Central High School
\
Occupation: facilities manager for School of Integrative Biology, University of Illinois
\
Academic degrees: high school graduate, 31/2 years of college (University of Illinois, Parkland College)
\
Political experience: elected mayor of Champaign, 2011
\
Campaign finance: had $3,561 in campaign fund on Dec. 31, 2014. Has since added $5,000. Largest contributor is bar and restaurant owner Carlos Nieto, $3,000. Has raised $12,100 since Jan. 1, 2014.
\
What is your highest priority for improving the city over the next four years?
\
Since 2011 we have managed to turn a structural deficit and severe cuts to city services into a balanced budget which avoided browning out a fire station, understaffing the police department and leaving roads in disrepair. If Illinois wishes to compete with other states, it is crucial we maintain this momentum and continue to grow our economy. I will work with our local legislators, UIUC and neighboring communities to keep the state and federal taxes we have paid coming back into our community to promote economic development, improve infrastructure and invest in human capital via agencies which address poverty, mental health and other social issues.
\
How would you promote economic development?
\
For the past four years, I have spent a great deal of time meeting with developers, investors, existing and potential tenants in Research Park, incoming and existing U of I and Parkland College administration and faculty as well as small business owners. Together we have created an environment which addresses the largest of employers, such as the Kraft expansion, as well as the smallest mom-and-pop businesses, including Huber's and Neighbors at the Icehouse, both of which may now conduct commerce seven days a week. We have had many successes with bringing in money from out of state -- e.g., $6.1 million to Champaign via a Terre Haute, Ind., developer -- as well as retaining our major tax base for the next generation as we did with the Worden Martin car dealership. We must maintain this momentum to compete with surrounding states.
\
Are there taxes or tax increases you would like to repeal? Why?
\
The city of Champaign's portion of property taxes, which has not increased in almost two decades, is currently about 17 cents out of every dollar, however, we have managed to create discretionary revenues which draw largely from those who visit or work in Champaign (the local motor fuel tax, for example). Unfortunately, despite the fact we've projected fairly robust tax revenues, even with the most conservative of estimates, the governor's proposed budget cuts could knock us back to recession-era budget sessions with cuts and more taxes to account for Champaign subsidizing the rest of the state including those cities who let venture capitalists ship jobs overseas. State leadership is calling for local legislators to ""give until it hurts,"" so instead of offering rebates I will be fighting to keep that to which we're entitled and have earned.
\
Are there any taxes you think should be increased? Why?
\
No. The majority of the city council made the politically unpopular choices to vote to create revenue sources to fund our police, fire, infrastructure, library and community programs. Heck, Kyle Harrison (GOP county chair) even voted in favor of the gas tax. If we are forced to increase taxes, it will be to subsidize the governor's plan to have us bail out the rest of the state. I am of the mind Champaign is carrying the water as it is and should be supported as that which will allow Illinois to compete with neighboring states as opposed to having our citizens -- who are paying their fair share to make our city great -- be asked to bail out the rest of the state which failed to make the difficult choices to be fiscally responsible.
\
Would you favor making Champaign a ""right-to-work"" zone as proposed by Gov. Bruce Rauner?
\
No. Dr. Robert Bruno, professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois, is not alone in his findings ""right-to-work"" systems mean lower wages and a weaker economy. ""There is a significant loss in income to the state -- in the billions of dollars -- as a result of right-to-work laws lowering wages,"" he said. ""Of course, when those workers, those citizens, have less money to spend, then it becomes a drag on the overall economy."" If we are to base a system on the political ideology of ""trickle-down economics,"" as opposed to actual facts and empirical data, Champaign will be yet another city failing to compete for businesses, industry, talent and investors. It is wrong for Champaign and wrong for Illinois.
\
Would you fight to keep the city's 8 percent share of the local distributive fund (state income tax), or do you think the city has an obligation to cut back its share to help the state government?
\
The Illinois Legislature has been nibbling away at the piece of the pie that rightfully belongs to the taxpayers in Champaign and now the governor wants to just steal the whole thing. It is shameful to think he will give himself a personal tax break to the tune of $750,000, after making billions in venture capitalism in Illinois, and then come and try to take $3.8 million from Champaign taxpayers. To come into a thriving community with balanced budgets and AAA bond rating, one which is competing with Boston and Silicon Valley for the best and brightest workforce, and tell us we have to subsidize the cities which had their jobs sent overseas is shameful. If Champaign falters, I don't see how we compete with other states as we're told we can.
\
What is the top financial challenge facing the city over the next four years?
\
The governor's proposed cuts to local governments' share of the taxes and cuts to the University of Illinois are frightening. Champaign experienced the second-most construction in the private sector ($244 million) in 2014 and sales tax revenue in Champaign (over $32.6 million) were more than Urbana, Danville and Monticello combined, and we are leading the country in many areas (livability, cultural and culinary options, private and public school options, etc.) which allow us to bring jobs, employers and investors into Illinois. If we can make the case Champaign needs to retain its resources and tools (including TIF and enterprise zones, with which the city has had great success in building our downtown, Interstate and UI Research Parks), our economy will continue to grow with the quality of life for all improving consistently.
\
What are your plans for infrastructure in the next term?
\
The work the city of Champaign has done with regard to storm water has spurred hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, providing a huge return to the taxpayer in terms of revenue generated by local businesses. As we proceed ""up the Boneyard"" with projects, we will see complete makeovers of entire neighborhoods as dry basements and streets will translate into increased property values. I am proud to have worked with Senator Dick Durbin, Congressman Rodney Davis, the Champaign County Chamber of Commerce, the MTD and local taxing bodies to secure a $17 million TIGER grant -- sending our federal tax dollars back to Champaign instead of Indiana, Wisconsin, etc., to improve our multimodal (buses, bikes, cars and pedestrian) infrastructure in key areas of the city. The LMFT was vital to the success of the Windsor Road bridge over Interstate 57 and will be key in other such projects.
\
Describe what you would do concerning race relations.
\
During my tenure, I have spent a great deal of time working to dignify everyone in the city to the point of being told by a very conservative friend, ""the Republicans feel like you're not doing anything for them because you're always in the black churches and neighborhoods."" I would say that was a bit of an exaggeration; however, it does reflect the change I have made in how the role of mayor is perceived. I am proud to have appointed an unprecedented number of people of color, women and young people to boards and commissions as I feel those bodies should reflect our community's population. I am proud to have been mayor as we welcomed Chief (Anthony) Cobb and believe his backing of the Community Matters program will help us all continue to bring together our entire community. We must keep moving forward together.
\
What is your plan for improving finances at the Champaign Public Library?
\
I have appointed a number of new board members, including Orlando Thomas (Unit 4 schools) and Martin Wolske (UIUC Graduate School of Library and Information Sciences), who are both keenly aware of the importance and value the library has to our community as well as the manner it must be managed to remain relevant and thriving in the 21st century. Historically, the library has been heralded by the community overall; however, not valued as a driver of commerce in the business community. I am hopeful as our local economy has grown so will private support from employers who benefit from having a world-class facility when recruiting ""millennials"" to the local workforce. I am confident the board will also seek and identify other revenue sources and continue to streamline the budget to help close the deficit.
\
If elected mayor, what would you do about Unofficial St. Patrick's Day?
\
I believe my record stands for itself with regard to the level of civil disobedience and unwanted incidents declining steadily over the past four years. While it is not the thing of which we should be most proud, it is important to remember this is America and we need to respect the rights of individuals as well as those of business. The key is to work to ensure those who have those rights also understand the responsibility which comes along. If I'm honest, it is almost to the point where we hope we have a football team which draws as many visitors to town every home game weekend.
\
Should Champaign police be allowed to use Tasers?
\
Were I campaigning to be the chief of police, I would likely be prepared to answer that question in greater detail. Chief Cobb, I'm sure, has thoughts on the pros and cons and, to his credit, he is spending a great deal of time scheduling meetings in the community to both garner input as well as provide information and education with regard to the police working with the community to make and/or keep our neighborhoods safe. I trust if the issue is brought before council we will be well-informed on the facts, opinions, pros and cons, etc. to make the right decision.
\
[Would you support a local minimum wage ordinance separate from the state law?
\
I am of the mind higher wages for all mean a greater economic climate for business, however, to be effective a wage increase would have to expand minimally at a county-wide level.
\
Does the city have any obligation to work to improve areas just outside the city limits but within its 1 1/2-mile extra-territorial jurisdiction, such as Dobbins Downs and Wilber Heights?
\
Poverty, crime and prosperity do not stop at the border, so it is important we continue to work closely with other communities and the county to help ensure these areas do not fall completely between the cracks.]

Candidate Q&A Don Gerard
\
How much time per week do you expect to devote to being mayor, a part-time position?
\
I spend my mornings, breaks, lunch hours, evenings and weekends ""being the mayor"" because it is what the city deserves and, if I'm honest, I have a lot of fun.
\
I enjoy being myself, both in person and on the social networks, and I think most people enjoy feeling personally connected to their local government as opposed to mistrusting or hating it.
\
Former U.S. Rep. Tim Johnson asked me to lecture in his political sciences honors class and he introduced me as ""one of the most significant and successful mayors in the Midwest, not just Illinois."" As Tim and I vote in different primaries, I take great pride in his comment as it tells me he respects the manner in which I relate to my constituents and the amount of time I invest in connecting with them.

\
What is your highest priority for improving the city over the next four years?
\
My highest priority is to continue the improvements to our stormwater and flooding issues throughout our city. I want to complete the West Washington Drainage project, get an engineering study for Garden Hills, and continue work on the Boneyard phases. I have seen the importance of managing stormwater through the first Boneyard phase completed in the 1990s on campus through the elimination of the designated floodplain in that area. Because the floodplain was eliminated, developers could begin projects along Green Street. Those new projects will benefit the city for many years to come. The other flood-prone areas that we are concentrating on will potentially save homeowners thousands of dollars. I served on the Stormwater Utility Fee Advisory Board for two years as we studied the impact of floodwater and how to lessen the impact on residents. This happens citywide, and that's why I see it as a high priority.
\
How would you promote economic development?
\
I would promote economic development by working to develop our small business and minority business incubators. They have been in the works for a couple of years, and it is time to move them forward. It may be that we partner with the Economic Development Corporation, but it is important to help more individuals achieve their goals for opening businesses. We need all sizes of businesses in our city, and by providing guidance and funds, the city can increase its tax base. I have in the past supported the incentives aimed at job creation when a company is expanding. Jobs must meet a certain pay level and must be kept for at least five years. I support TIF districts for businesses to expand or develop. I would like to see a TIF district formed around the Bristol Place neighborhood to help promote economic development in the northeast area of the city. I would continue to support projects where the city provides incentives to businesses to remodel unoccupied buildings in infill areas, such as the Gander Mountain store. I support projects such as the Hill Ford move to Anthony Drive that allowed a new hotel, grocery, hardware store and restaurant to be developed on that property.
\
Are there are taxes or tax increases you would like to repeal? Why?
\
In 2013, I supported the quarter-cent sales-tax increase to fund six new police officers, avoid browning out of an engine at Station 4, and support the library. I am supportive of this increase because it spreads the burden of increased taxes to the whole community and people who visit our city but don't live here, and not just property taxpayers. I similarly support the other votes that I made to either support or oppose a tax such as the gas tax. I also opposed the sewer tax increase of 6 percent that was on the same agenda as the quarter-cent increase because we had just voted to increase our sales tax. But I do not support a repeal of any tax at this time.
\
Are there any taxes you think you should be increased? Why?
\
There are no taxes that I feel should be increased at this time. I feel if there is a fee or tax that should be increased, it should be directly tied to a user. The city did a study in 2009 to determine how our fees line up with the costs associated with the service and council has been reviewing those and making proper adjustments to the fees for service. At this time I do not support any new taxes or increases.
\
Would you favor making Champaign a ""right-to-work"" zone as proposed by Gov. Bruce Rauner?
\
I do not support right-to-work zones.
\
Would you fight to keep the city's 8 percent share of the local distributive fund (state income tax), or do you think the city has an obligation to cut back its share to help the state government?
\
I feel that the city should be paid the 8 percent share of their local distributive fund. I realize that the state needs to find ways to bring the state's budget back to balanced, but not on the backs of the cities who have been struggling the last several years to make sure our budgets are balanced. Luckily, our city has a very conservative finance director and staff who prioritized the cuts that had to be made. We have cut staff and services, but cannot afford more without causing noticeable cuts in what our residents have come to expect from our city services. We have delayed capital improvement projects because of lack of funding after prioritizing which projects had the most impact on our citizens. So now that our economy is beginning to be on an upswing, I do not want to go backward.
\
What is the top financial challenge facing the city over the next four years?
\
I believe that our pension obligations will be the top financial challenge facing the city. I am confident that plans are in place to make sure that we will meet our obligations to our hard-working men and women who have given years of their lives to serving others. That is a top priority for me. But we are at a point where the payments will be large and we need to be sure that all financial needs are met. By refinancing our payments just recently on our parking-deck bonds, we are saving $30,000-some a year, which will help. I am committed to maintaining our core services while we amortize our pension debt.
\
What are your plans for infrastructure?
\
Without keeping our infrastructure in good condition, the city will start to deteriorate. We are over 150 years old and many parts of the city have repairs that are needed to update ancient materials. One of the most interesting facts that I learned while on the Stormwater Utility Fee Advisory Board is that the original pipes used for farmland between West Hill Street and Vine Street are still being used. Thank goodness we were able to add larger pipes to the area and helped to alleviate flooding. But it is up to the mayor and council to recognize the areas and conditions that need attention. We have over 600 miles of streets in our city. We also have master plans that show us where the streets are that need the most attention. After a winter such as in 2013-14, streets that may be further down the list had to be moved up because of the extra wear and tear that snow removal caused. So as mayor, I would continue to keep watch and prioritize infrastructure needs to keep our city moving forward. With so many events that come to our city, we need to be sure our best foot is forward.
\
Describe what you would do concerning race relations.
\
My strengths in building partnerships and community coalitions will play a key role in improving race relations throughout our city. Currently, I have been working with diverse groups in the city to listen to their concerns and work with city departments to help them. I believe a concentrated effort of economic development with small and minority businesses will create an environment of economic prosperity for all people. I would participate in the Community Coalition as an active member. I would continue to attend as many meetings and events as possible to be a presence so that citizens would be able to speak with me on an individual, less-formal level, if necessary. I believe that communication is the key, and I have excellent communication skills. Plus, I already personally know many of the minority community leaders, such as members of the NAACP, Community Coalition and others, which will serve as a pathway to address concerns as they come up and collaborate to find solutions to those issues.
\
What is your plan for improving finances at the Champaign Public Library?
\
At this time, I believe that the library has its own board that has announced plans for balancing its budget. The city gave an additional $276,000 last year to help. I would be open to discussing further actions, but would concentrate my energies on the whole city.
\
If elected mayor, what would you do about Unofficial St. Patrick's Day?
\
Coming right after a relatively calm Unofficial, I would like to discuss a few changes in how bars with restaurants could ease the 21-and-older admission rule on the Saturday after the event. In my conversations, I know they lose thousands because not all members of a group are 21. But the group may go to another establishment that serves liquor, but not an A license. This seems unfair, and I would pursue changes in Saturday restrictions. I feel that the university and police departments have worked very hard in the last few years to make students aware of the consequences, and people have been safer. I have participated in Walk as One on campus with students and police officers to distribute information to 4,100 apartments. I appreciate all the work that so many have done for the several months ahead of Unofficial to keep it under control.
\
Should Champaign police be allowed to use Tasers?
\
Tasers are already in our community. If a Champaign officer has a need for one, they have to call for a sheriff's deputy, U of I officer, or now an Urbana officer. This is a timely process, and if Champaign officers had one, that process could be shortened. Police officers work with so many different situations, and it is quite possible that a Taser would diffuse a situation. As mayor, I would look to police Chief Anthony Cobb to conduct a thorough analysis as to how Tasers can be implemented safely and effectively, and collaborate with the community as to how his recommendations can make our city safer.
\
[Would you support a local minimum wage ordinance separate from the state law?
\
At this time, I would not support a minimum wage ordinance. Even though I appreciate the fact that employees need to have a living wage to support themselves and/or their families, I feel that it is up to the businesses to determine their wages to their respective employees.
\
Does the city have any obligation to work to improve areas just outside the city limits but within its 1 1/2-mile extra-territorial jurisdiction, such as Dobbins Downs and Wilber Heights?
\
I believe that our obligation is to the boundaries within the city limits. The price tag is high for improvements to those areas. I do not think that the taxpayers of the city of Champaign should fund the improvements to areas outside of our limits. I would be open to discussing plans and ways that the city might be able to help, but at this time I am unaware of those.]

How much time per week do you expect to devote to being mayor, a part-time position?

Currently, I devote on average over 20 hours a week as a council person at-large. Some weeks are more and some weeks are less.

I plan to retire from teaching in May and would be available for regular office hours during the weekdays and, as always, available for calls and emails on the weekends and evenings.

"
333,"Cryptic roadside signs atop rusting yellow poles throughout central Lake County for decades have marked more than the potential route of a new highway.\The ""FAP 342 ROW"" signs are reminders of conflict over the proposed extension of Route 53 north 12.5 miles from Lake-Cook Road in Long Grove -- an emotional battle between those who fear its effect on natural areas and those who embrace it as a way to improve transportation and grow the economy.\Traffic congestion has worsened significantly during the half century since the notion of a major route into central Lake County first surfaced. Suburbs grew without the ability of existing roads to keep up.\Advocates say an extended Route 53 and improved Route 120 would carry a maximum traffic volume of 62,000 vehicles per day by 2040 -- about the same as now travel on I-94 north of Great America. A trip from Grayslake to Schaumburg would take 68 minutes with the road, compared to 98 minutes without it, according to estimates.\On the other side of the coin is Lake County's strong sense of environmental stewardship. The natural areas are what attract many of those who call it home.\A Route 53 advisory panel in 2012 noted Lake County has the greatest number of unique and threatened natural resources, including lakes, wetlands and native prairie remnants, of any county in Illinois. Historically, that has been a rallying point for environmentalists and conservation groups.\But a make-or-break decision is in the works with a new proposal that hinges on balancing the interests of environmental protection, transportation access and economic development.\""This is our last best chance. We've gotten further with this project than any of the other efforts,"" said Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor, co-chairman of the Route 53/120 Project Blue Ribbon Advisory Council.\After generations of often bitter debate, such cautious optimism is due, in part, to a more transparent and inclusive planning approach than in the past. It has led to recommendations that include a host of road design innovations and other measures to protect the environment.\Support comes from a new alliance that has engaged traditional opponents in the planning. Their support, though, hinges entirely on whether long-sought protections for natural areas are financed and followed.\Construction of the one-of-a-kind toll road would forever change the landscape of central Lake County as it crosses sensitive environmental areas and likely leads to development of thousands of new homes and millions of square feet of businesses.\It would mean families along Harrison Avenue in Mundelein's Cambridge Country subdivision -- and other neighborhoods along the road corridor -- could see their view of open spaces beyond backyard fences disappear.\""It's quiet. That's why we like it,"" said Virginia Biegel, whose family of five moved to Cambridge Country nearly two years ago. She said it's hard to envision the road, and she isn't sure if her family would move if it is approved.\Others potentially could lose more than a view.\""It goes straight through the house,"" said Helga Ziegler, who with her husband, Josef, built a home in 1973. They operate an apple orchard on 16 acres between Bacon and Cedar Lake roads south of Route 120 near Grayslake. ""We had people who wanted to buy it, but when they find out ... "" Josef added.\Many hurdles remain before officials will know if this project has a future. Specifics, such as how and precisely where it will be built, will begin to emerge only if the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority board decides, possibly next year, to proceed with a more detailed study for a 4-lane, limited-access, 45 mph parkway.\There are plenty of challenges: how to pay the $2.35 billion to $2.65 billion tab, whether environmental protections are to be followed, and how to control the expected ripple effect of development.\Will the groups studying financing and land uses find acceptable answers? That depends on whether all parties are satisfied the end result is fair and sustainable.\Recommendations for financing are expected to be ready for the tollway board to consider early next year and for land uses possibly by late 2015.\Tollway leaders say they are committed to advancing the project but warn it must be in line with principles created for the rest of the tollway system: shared local cost, consensus and political support.\""We have no interest in building a road people don't want,"" said Paula Wolff, chairwoman of the tollway board.\Funding\The project is envisioned with a smaller footprint than traditional highways to minimize environmental effects. It would extend north 12.5 miles from Lake-Cook Road in Long Grove to south of Route 120 in Grayslake, where it would split east and west. The split would bypass Route 120 from east of Route 45 to west of Route 134 or west of Fairfield Road. This top of the ""T"" would stretch 12 miles from near Route 12 in Volo to I-94 in Waukegan.\A 300-foot-wide corridor was defined long ago, and the Illinois Department of Transportation has acquired about two-thirds of the needed right of way. IDOT made its last land purchase in 2011, acquiring 886 acres for $48.3 million.\While the exact configuration is not final, swaths of vacant land splitting subdivisions are evident at various points along the route.\The immediate need is for funding because tolls on the new road won't be enough. There is an estimated gap as large as $2.4 billion that must be closed by other sources.\Suggestions include a 4-cent-per-gallon Lake County gas tax to be split between the project and other local transportation needs, and a large special financing district. Both would require state legislation to establish. New or higher tolls on I-94 in Lake County, and congestion pricing and annual toll increases as a potential test program for the entire tollway system are being considered.\Cash-strapped Illinois is expected to be asked to make a big contribution, such as land already acquired.\The special financing district would encompass property within a mile of the road and two miles from intersections. Taxing bodies, such as school districts, would get 75 percent of property taxes from any new nonresidential development. The working group that studied the option suggests the other 25 percent be used for a long-term environmental stewardship fund to help mitigate possible effects of the extension.\""We felt this was a very politically acceptable approach to go with this. We know that with the road, there will be a significant amount of commercial and industrial development,"" said Mundelein Mayor Steve Lentz, who headed the group.\The local contribution has to be significant enough -- perhaps up to 20 percent of the overall cost -- for the project to move forward.\Cost-sharing has become standard for big tollway projects, beginning with the I-355 extension in DuPage County, and most recently the $3.4 billion Elgin-O'Hare western access spanning Elmhurst, Bensenville and other communities in DuPage and Cook counties that included a $300 million local commitment.\Participants say Route 53/120 could become a national model of how major road projects are selected and built. As such, this effort has a different feel compared to previous attempts because local officials are shaping the project and providing suggestions for funding.\Long Grove, which used to budget funds annually to fight Route 53, is among the longtime opponents now participating in the project.\""If the road is going to go through, let's not put blinders on (but) make sure the concerns are heard and taken seriously,"" Village President Angie Underwood said.\Environmental woes\Lake County is considered especially vulnerable to disruptions from a new road, so environmental interests are demanding costly features intended to make it fit the landscape and protect natural resources.\The guide for the ongoing research and discussion is a 109-page report crafted by a diverse volunteer panel of community leaders, environmentalists, planners and others appointed by the tollway authority. In May 2012, after nine months of study, the advisory council recommended pursuit of the roadway.\So far, that alliance has held. How environmental requirements are funded and how closely they are followed are among the challenges to continued agreement.\""I would say it's still fragile. They (environmentalists) are still watching closely,"" said George Ranney, co-chairman of the advisory panel. ""They're waiting for the first shoe to drop to see if the recommendations aren't followed.""\Hawthorn Woods Village President Joe Mancino said village officials see the potential traffic and economic benefits but are wary of to-be-determined specifics of design and alignment through his town.\""If it is done exactly like that (advisory) committee envisions it, the environmental stakeholders will go along,"" Mancino said.\Design innovations, such as building portions of the road below grade to block noise or elevated sections through wetlands, are meant to protect those areas.\The total cost of all innovations -- beyond those of tollway policy or state and federal requirements -- stands at $325 million to $400 million.\Some $81 million of that is the environmental stewardship fund, a nonnegotiable part of the recommendation, officials say. It would protect and enhance the natural resources within 2 miles of the roadway, protect and restore at least 750 acres beyond, deal with any unintended consequences and provide oversight for 50 years. Specifics have yet to be determined.\""They're not going to throw pavement through the middle of a wetland and call it a day,"" Lake County Administrator Barry Burton said.\Spur development?\It's clear that construction of a Route 53/120 extension would trigger big changes by stimulating and unlocking business and residential development. If not coordinated, traffic on existing roads would increase dramatically and damage ecological areas, say those involved in the process.\Skeptics contend new commuters and shoppers will flood local roads and spoil the area's character.\""The small traffic relief expected will then be erased as tens of thousands of new commuters and shoppers crowd into Lake County's open space, clogging local roads that access the new tollway and spoiling the rural character we all love,"" said Evan Craig, chairman of the Sierra Club Wood and Wetlands Group.\Because a new road alone won't solve traffic congestion, the panel called for a land use plan and strategy for the corridor. The study area extends 2 miles from the road, or about a quarter of the size of Lake County. It is proceeding separately but in tandem with the groups studying financing.\The purpose is to work with corridor communities to plan in a way that blends land uses, transportation, economic development and open space, said Jason Navota, principal with the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which is coordinating that aspect.\Part of the work will be to identify areas likely to undergo significant change because of development, and important natural areas that merit special attention. The objective is to outline a broad land use strategy and specific plans for about a dozen areas expected to change because of the road.\Participants in the land use study say that for the traffic and economic benefits to last, communities must change their approach to development. If not, the problems the 53/120 project aims to solve could resurface.\How or if that can be accomplished remains to be seen. Plans of the corridor communities collectively are out of scale with the road design and call for much more development than is feasible, said Lawlor, co-chairman of the land use committee. If the corridor is developed based on municipal plans, 6,868 acres of agricultural land and 9,160 acres of open space would be lost, preliminary data show.\Communities farther from the road will want to protect their investments; those closer will want to parlay the advantage. Still, the land can only hold so much.\""We want this road to be successful so if we allow unrestricted development along the corridor and dump all those cars (onto adjoining roads), 53 won't be successful,"" Lawlor said.\Credit: First of a two-part series By Mick Zawislak mzawislak@dailyherald.com"
334," Act of hateful vandal deplored by Naperville\ I am writing to respond to the family who had their front lawn destroyed by the painting of a swastika this past week.\ I want them to know there are many of us here in Naperville who abhor such hateful, senseless acts, and we are ashamed that they have had to suffer such indignity. This can only be the act of someone who isn't mature enough to be aware of history and the tremendous amount of evil and hurt this symbol represents.\ There is absolutely no excuse for such insensitivity to be displayed here in Naperville, or anywhere.\ I hope this family can find it in their hearts to forgive such an ignorant act, and that they can get on with their lives and be able to put this awful gesture behind them.\ My prayer is that the perpetrator will somehow, someday, come to understand the cruelty and futility of such a despicable act.\ Rose Bagley\ for Pax Christi DuPage\ Naperville\ Recreation programs vital for Warrenville\ I recently had the opportunity to attend a focus group session in Warrenville. The purpose was to discuss a revised comprehensive plan for Warrenville. The city has hired a planning consultant to assist with this process, and public involvement has been invited. Although I applaud the city in its desire to get citizen, business and other stakeholders' input, I do have some concerns.\ It has been discussed that a developer has approached the city council requesting to build a 300-unit apartment complex on routes 56 and 59. A complex such as this probably would add 600 to 700 more residents to our city. This concerns me greatly, especially in regard to recreational services. Warrenville residents already are starving for additional recreational programming. The park district, in its desire to meet the needs of Warrenville citizens, has approached the city to release TIF funds so it may move forward on plans to build a recreation center. Thus far, to my knowledge, this has not happened. At a recent city council meeting, two aldermen even suggested that our local health club (which is part of a huge corporate chain) absorb the recreational needs of our citizens. This to me is like asking a bookstore chain to run our library or Andy Frain to police our city. Not wise decisions.\ As the city council moves forward with revising the comprehensive plan (a Herculean task that I do not envy), I ask that it keep in mind the needs of our current citizenry. Remember, our children need and deserve the opportunity to have recreational offerings in an environment that is competitive with other municipalities. Our park district deserves the opportunity to meet these needs (it truly works hard for all of us). All of Warrenville deserves quality parks, recreational programming and facilities.\ Linda L. Linford\ Warrenville\ Join District 200 forum about Hubble School\ This is to all residents of Warrenville, Wheaton and those areas of Winfield, Carol Stream and West Chicago served by Community Unit School District 200.\ Each year, the board of education of District 200 sets two or three high priority goals to address during the calendar year. This year, those goals are:\ Goal I - Develop a long-range plan for preparing District 200 high schools for increased enrollment and program improvements. (This is in process.)\ Goal II - Develop a process for reviewing and renewing the middle school program in District 200, which results in increased student academic achievement. (This is in process.)\ Goal III - Develop a process that identifies the best long-term use of the Hubble Middle School property to adequately address student academic, social and emotional needs.\ Goal III is the reason I am writing this letter.\ The board of education of District 200 will begin the process of addressing goal No. 3 at our 7:30 p.m. May 8 meeting at Wheaton North High School. I encourage you to attend and hear us discuss the various options, questions and concerns relative to the best long- term educational use of Hubble Middle School.\ I also wish to announce that District 200 was one of 65 Illinois school districts (out of a total of 894) honored with the Year 2002 ""Bright A+"" Award of Excellence. The award is given to those school districts with the highest academic performance in the state of Illinois. District 200 is among the top 5 percent of all Illinois school districts. The award was presented by SchoolSearch - an organization dedicated to helping families find the best schools for their children. We have excellent schools in District 200, committed staff members and dedicated families all striving to provide the best for our children.\ We should all be very proud, yet continue to work closely together to ensure continuous improvement and excellence. I hope you are able to join us May 8.\ Andy Johnson\ Board Member and President\ Wheaton Warrenville\ Community Unit\ School District 200\ Be on guard against colorectal cancer\ As we start our spring cleaning, your Illinois family physicians would like to remind adults of an important checkup to put on the ""to do"" list. Now is the time for an important preventative screening. Everyone over age 50 should be screened for colorectal cancer.\ Some people are at a higher risk for colorectal cancer and may need to be tested earlier than age 50. Anyone who has:\ - Personal or family history of benign colorectal polyps.\ - A personal or family history of colorectal cancer.\ - A personal or family history of inflammatory bowel disease - ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.\ - A personal or family history of ovarian, endometrial or breast cancer.\ In between regular screenings, you can reduce your risk of developing colorectal cancer through simple healthy lifestyle choices.\ 1. Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may help prevent colorectal cancer. In addition, whole grains from breads, cereals, nuts and beans also may provide protective effects.\ 2. Exercise. Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of several cancers - particularly colon cancer - in both men and women.\ 3. Smoking causes cancers other than lung. Several recent studies reveal that tobacco use may significantly increase your risk of developing colorectal cancer - in addition to several other cancers. The bottom line: If you don't smoke, don't start. If you do, quit to lower your overall risk.\ 4. Easy on the alcohol. Excessive alcohol use may increase your risk for colorectal cancer.\ Screening tests for colorectal cancer could save 30,000 lives each year by detecting colorectal cancer early. An estimated 148,300 people in the United States will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer this year, with as many as 56,000 dying as a result.\ Colorectal cancer is preventable and highly treatable if detected early. Help us help you stay healthy: Talk to your family doctor about colorectal cancer screening tests.\ Jim J. Vega, M.D.\ President\ Illinois Academy of\ Family Physicians\ Lisle\ Editorial missed point on the cigarette tax\ This is in response to the Daily Herald's April 8 editorial regarding the cigarette tax. Your opinion missed a major point, i.e. that Rep. Carolyn Krause and others have spelled out how the increase of revenues would be used to restore services cut to the mentally ill and developmentally disabled.\ You mention how smokers should not have to bear the burden; yet what burden are we asking our impaired citizens to bear? This is one of the worst situations I have seen in 25 years in community mental health. There will be no escape from adverse effects on services if all these cuts are left to stand. Every time cigarette taxes have been raised, in Illinois and other states, two things have always happened: an increase in revenues for health programs and a reduction in smoking - a truly win/win result!\ Denis Ferguson\ Executive Director\ Alexian Brothers Northwest\ Mental Health Center\ Arlington Heights\ No early release of drug offenders\ Gov. George Ryan has proposed freeing 4,500 prison inmates before their sentences have run to balance the state budget. That is 4,500 people who were arrested by the police for either possessing or dealing drugs, many of whom were prosecuted by my assistant state's attorneys.\ Court records show it takes an average of nine arrests before a defendant is actually sentenced to prison. That is nine times that a police officer has arrested a suspect and nine times that assistant state's attorneys prosecuted the cases.\ In each of these 4,500 cases, a judge has looked at the evidence, the amount of drugs involved and the criminal record of the defendant before deciding to send the defendant to prison.\ To send these legally convicted and sentenced inmates back to their community - and I know a high percentage of these inmates are from Cook County - is not only reprehensible, but also illegal.\ As the chief law enforcement officer of Cook County and the president of the Illinois State's Attorneys Association, I hope the governor's threat is an empty one. We have enough dealers and users on our streets without the governor circumventing the judiciary by unleashing a small army of drug offenders on our communities.\ Richard A. Devine\ Cook County State's Attorney\ Chicago\ So-called reform bill inhibits free speech\ I am concerned about the so-called campaign finance reform bill. It is a thinly disguised attempt to limit free speech in the critical weeks before an election when people follow politics and activities of candidates. By limiting free speech under the guise of campaign finance reform, people running for office can hide their voting record and conceal onerous activities from ""we the people."" This does not bode well for free speech!\ I also am concerned about the armed pilots provision that was signed into law by President Bush that has not been implemented. Arming pilots is a lot cheaper and more effective than some sky marshal who can easily be overcome by terrorists. It would be very difficult to hijack an airliner when fully trained pilots are carrying handguns. Most pilots flew in the military and are well- trained in the use of firearms and other weapons.\ Jack L. Eich\ Morrison\ Don't blame Clinton for Bush's mistakes\ A recent letter to the editor is a perfect example of someone going to extremes to justify a position. The letter writer says that if you add the time since Bush took over to the Clinton years, you would believe that ""W"" has nothing to do with the bad economy and the general poor state of our nation.\ Face the facts. Clinton was not the president; ""W"" was. You cannot just assign the first year of the Bush administration to Clinton and then say all the things that are going bad are Clinton's fault. Some people just cannot admit that ""W"" is doing a terrible job. If you honestly assess the facts of the past year unemotionally, you cannot believe that ""W"" is doing a good job. Look at the numbers of the markets, unemployment, our surplus (lack thereof), Social Security, bankruptcies (Enron included) and the value of your investment funds.\ The writer says the economy was in trouble in 2000. If Bush knew in 2000 that things were bad, then why didn't he do something about in his first year in office? If he did not know, then what kind of president is he that he was not aware of the problems facing this nation? Either way, he is doing a terrible job.\ Quit trying to blame Clinton and start putting pressure on the Bush administration to improve the economy. I would rather have someone in office who does a good job, but ruins his own life, than one who does a terrible job and ruins the lives of millions of Americans in the process. Incidentally, I did not vote for Clinton.\ Roger J. Bianco Sr.\ Elk Grove Village\ Franzen statement raises some questions\ I feel compelled to write in response to Gayle Franzen's recent Guest View regarding tollway critics (April 5). In it, he states, ""Only one tollway official since the creation of the toll road has ever made the statement that the tolls eventually would be eliminated. The person who made that statement did so in 1955-56 in an effort to pass the enabling legislation.""\ I, for one, would like a clarification of Franzen's quote and would like to know if the official in question was speaking at the time as an individual or as the spokesman of the tollway authority.\ This statement, which Franzen makes so casually, alarms me. It sounds suspiciously to me like another case of a public official being deceitful to get his way, the implication being that had the official honestly stated the tolls were to be permanent, the legislation would not have passed. Come to think of it, what relevance is any of this to the issue today? If current public sentiment is that tolls should be eliminated, perhaps that is what our current representatives should be working toward.\ Guy Schmidt\ Vernon Hills\ Call to stop proposed 90 percent toll hike\ After winning the Libertarian Party's nomination for governor, I thought it might be worthwhile to see the play about the knight Don Quixote, who dreamed an impossible dream and was scorned for tilting at windmills. Indeed, the Sun-Times asked if I were on a quixotic crusade.\ If that is so, today's windmill is the tollway. Republicans have proposed a 90 percent toll increase and a bonding scheme to borrow $5.5 billion on top of Illinois FIRST's $8 billion! It is a truly outrageous scheme whose real purpose is patronage for Republicans in DuPage County.\ To stop this Republican toll hike, call Jim Ryan. Tell him you expect him to stop the 90 percent toll increase and if he doesn't, you won't vote for any Republicans this fall.\ If enough call, the toll hike will be toast. Then, we can turn the tollways into freeways by bringing back gas tax dollars paid by tollway users and tollway-driven federal aid. Call me at (866) SHAKE UP to help get this campaign off the ground.\ Cal Skinner Jr.\ Crystal Lake\ Closing of prison would hurt youths\ Gov. George Ryan's proposal to close the Illinois Youth Center- Valley View will have a harmful impact on incarcerated youth.\ This facility has a longstanding history of providing quality treatment and rehabilitative services to juvenile offenders. These include educational programming, mental health and substance abuse treatment, as well as specialized treatment services for juvenile sex offenders. These are essential services for incarcerated youth.\ A majority of the youth at IYC- Valley View are receiving mental health services and many of these youth are prescribed some form of psychiatric medication. A significant number are monitored for suicidal behavior.\ The governor's proposal that two new juvenile facilities will be able to replace the loss of IYC-Valley View is contrary to the facts. The construction of the IYC-Rushville facility has not yet begun. The IYC-Kewanee's clinical and educational programs are seriously understaffed and operating at minimal efficiency. These new facilities are modeled after an adult correctional design that is inappropriate for many youthful offenders.\ The majority of the youth at IYC-Valley View reside in Cook and collar counties. Transferring them to facilities downstate will be detrimental to their community re-entry because this will make family contacts much more difficult.\ IYC-Valley View was identified in 2001 by the Illinois Office of the Auditor General as the most cost-efficient facility in the Juvenile Division of the Illinois Department of Corrections. Large fiscal expenditures on the facility will not be required over the next several years.\ We urge the state legislators to consider alternative solutions to the current budget shortfall that do not include the closing of IYC-Valley View.\ Dr. Matthew Galloucis\ Dr. Heidi Harlow\ Licensed Clinical Psychologists\ Certified Correctional\ Health Professionals\ AFSCME members\ Illinois Youth Center-Valley View\ St. Charles Township\ Durbin should check definition of hypocrisy\ Webster's II New Riverside Desk Dictionary defines hypocrisy as the feigning of qualities and beliefs that one does not actually possess or hold.

335,"Ease the overcrowding\On March 17, the residents of Glenbard High School District 87 will have the opportunity to vote on a referendum which would provide for critically needed additions and renovations to all four Glenbard high schools (East, North, West, South). The current crowded conditions at these schools have been much in the news and are attested to by the mobile classrooms outside Glenbard East. To this crowded situation will be added another 1,000 students district-wide in the next five to 10 years.\For our students, for our property values, for a major community resource (the schools themselves), we need to vote yes on the referendum. A yes vote will not increase taxes from their current level since bonds which are being retired would be replaced with new bonds at the same rate to support the construction.\Join us in a yes vote March 17. We all have so much to be proud of - our students and their accomplishments in the Glenbard system, and so much to invest in for the future - our students, and the schools which have provided a ""tradition of excellence"" for them. This is also what we have at stake in the referendum, so be sure to vote, and vote yes.\Steve and Ruth Sweetser\Martin and Barbara Kozi\Lombard\Mysterious mudslinger\As the primary race of Republican candidate for DuPage County board chairman proceeds, a mysterious, character-assassin, known only as ""Anonymous,"" has attempted, with varying degrees of success, to smear the apparent front-runner, Robert Schillerstrom.\The Daily Herald reported on Feb. 4 information about a land deal that was included in packages sent anonymously that week to members of the media. This referred to the sale of land by Schillerstrom to DuPage County for road widening in 1991. On Feb. 5 candidate Michael Formento expressed his outrage at the deal and announced that he had referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney and the state attorney general for investigation. Formento is quoted as having said, ""you might assume that I have a special interest in seeing that Mr. Schillerstrom's activities are thoroughly investigated.""\On the same day, Formento's long-time advisor and business partner, Glen Ellyn attorney William Jegen, warned of the dire consequences facing Schillerstrom. Shortly thereafter, the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission received a letter from an ""anonymous"" attorney charging that Schillerstrom's participation in the land deal violated canons of legal ethics and requesting that his license to practice law be revoked.\Schillerstrom was exonerated in the land deal by the U.S. Attorney, the Illinois Attorney General, the Chief Judge of the DuPage County Court and by Donald Zeilenga, who was chief of the county's transportation department in 1991.\""Anonymous"" struck most recently on Feb. 21. Minutes before a televised forum for DuPage County chairman candidates was to be broadcast, an unknown person approached a panel of reporters and handed them a packet of papers and requested that, ""... you ask this question."" The packet revealed that Schillerstrom, along with his three roommates, had been busted for possessing pot 21 years ago at a time when the four were all going to law school. Schillerstrom said the records are correct (and that he did inhale).\With the primary election not scheduled until March 17, ""Anonymous"" has plenty of time to strike again. Hopefully, ""Anonymous"" will be unmasked.\Jerold A. Morgan\Glen Ellyn\Vote for Schillerstrom\Bob Schillerstrom will make an excellent DuPage County board chairman. I have known Bob since we were assistant state's attorneys together. Bob is a hard worker who has earned the respect of law enforcement officials everywhere.\As a citizen of DuPage County, I support Bob because he has a vision and a plan to take DuPage County into the 21st century. This plan involves preserving open spaces, relieving traffic congestion and maintaining the quality of life we enjoy.\Bob is well respected among both the leaders and citizens of DuPage County. His leadership abilities have already been proven.\I urge you to vote for Bob Schillerstrom for DuPage County board chairman.\Blanche Hill Fawell\Glen Ellyn\Yes to good investment\A tax referendum on the March 17 ballot asks voters for funds to upgrade facilities and improve services for Glenside Public Library District in Glendale Heights. I urge district residents to make an investment in the community and vote ""yes.""\Currently, the library doesn't have enough space or funds to keep up with the information, technology and service needs of its district. Approval of the tax referendum would create new funds to pay for a facility expansion and renovation, as well as more books, computers, business hours and other services.\The referendum would raise the tax on a home valued at $130,000 approximately $7 per month. For the price of one paperback book per month, families could help fund the improvements, and allow the library to increase spending to a level more in line with neighboring communities.\There's no substitute for a quality library close to home with the resources families need to learn and be successful in life. Help the Glenside Public Library District obtain those resources. Vote ""yes"" on March 17.\Charles Simpson\Glendale Heights\Repairing the roads\The Daily Herald's Feb. 25 editorial (""Use road funds - to fix roads"") is right on the money.\As Congress debates the budget, and reauthorization of the all- encompassing Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), the real issue comes into light - our nation currently spends less money (adjusted for inflation) on roads and bridges than it did in the 1960s.\How can this be? Some 6.8 cents of the 18.4 cents per gallon federal motor fuel tax is being earmarked for deficit reduction. This equates to a diversion of more than $7 billion per year away from transportation funding. The remainder is then deposited into the Highway Trust Fund and mass transit accounts.\Essentially, the federal government takes billions of dollars generated from transportation user fees (gas taxes) and fails to reinvest these dollars in transportation. This diversion strikes a severe financial blow to Illinois, where transportation plays a key role in our economy.\To understand why our highways and bridges are deteriorating, consider this gap:\Since 1960, vehicle miles traveled in this country jumped 234 percent. The taxes motorists paid to fix highways shot up 155 percent. However, investment in our highways plummeted 50 percent.\To sum up the situation: Motorists are paying more taxes to drive more vehicles more miles over roads maintained with less money.\Under the existing federal funding formula, the Illinois Department of Transportation would stand to receive at least another $200 million annually from the Highway Trust Fund if the federal gas tax revenues were simply spent for their intended purpose. Coincidentally, this is roughly the shortfall IDOT is facing for the upcoming Stevenson reconstruction project.\What can our nation do to fix this problem?\- Stop spending gasoline taxes for non-transportation purposes.\- Take transportation trust funds off the budget to assure their use for transportation only.\- Not allow gasoline or airline ticket tax dollars to sit idle in trust fund accounts while U.S. highways and airway systems slowly deteriorate.\- Develop a long-term, comprehensive plan to address the infrastructure needs of the nation's highways and airways.\- In Illinois, we have to examine the odd system that allows gasoline to be taxed by all levels of state, regional and local government, resulting in Chicago gas taxes that are the highest in the nation.\Congress must act now if this country is to remain the most mobile nation in the world.\Brian J.

I still maintain close ties to the district. My children live here and my grandchild attends Jay Stream School. I do not believe there is anyone who knows District 93 or the schools better than I do.\I urge the residents of the district to attend informational meetings, especially the people in the older section of the district. This referendum does not appear to be to your benefit. Please do not take anything for granted. Do not assume anything. Some of the so- called benefits of the referendum are very carefully worded and do not mean what you might think. I plan to attend these meetings and ask very specific questions. I hope you will also.\Call the district office to find out the locations, dates and times of these meetings. Many people have asked me for my opinion regarding this referendum, but I will reserve additional comments until I am satisfied I have all of the facts.\Mary Haaraoja\Carol Stream\Right vote is yes vote\On March 17, we once again head to the polls (at least those who bother) for another referendum on our schools. District 87, which includes the four Glenbard High Schools, is asking our permission to spend $16 million to renovate and add on to the four existing schools to handle increasing enrollment, and improve the facilities at each school. The bonds issue will cause no increase in tax rates, rather they replace existing retiring bonds.\Six years ago, the District 87 board agreed with a group that wanted a new high school built in the north part of the district, to serve students in Glendale Heights and the surrounding area. This group was vocal and well-intentioned, but as it turned out, quite small. Despite a serious effort on the part of the board and the interested citizens, that referendum went down to defeat in a landslide of no votes.\Once again, a similar group is asking for District 87 to build a new high school, and is working hard to defeat the current referendum as a starting point. While we sympathize with their goal of a high school for their community, it is simply not realistic. The citizens of the district as a whole have spoken many times and over and over they have had two main messages: please do not raise our taxes and please do not change our attendance boundaries. The current board has heard the message and fashioned an approach to meet these wishes while still meeting the needs of future students in the district.\This starts to look a little like a nuclear standoff, with mutually assured destruction the only outcome. If the fifth-high- school proponents succeed in defeating this referendum and then cannot succeed in passing one of their own, then the schools just fall further behind in meeting the needs of the students. This is not a situation in which anyone wins.\The residents of the north part of the district have made some very good points about the long commutes and difficulty of participation in school life. These are issues that can be addressed by means much less expensive than building an entire new school and the board should work to do so.\Meanwhile, however, we should also get started equipping our facilities for the needs of the next century. This can be done with the four buildings we have. We urge voters to say yes to District 87's proposal.\Larry and Sarah Peck\Glen Ellyn\Yes to quality education\My husband and I have resided in Winfield School District 34 for 16 years. We have four children who are presently attending the Winfield schools. We have both worked closely with children; my husband as a Scout leader and myself as an educator. We know the importance of a quality program to gain success.\Throughout the years we have been impressed with the quality teaching staff and standards that have been presented to our children in District 34. The most recent referendum that we can recall took place 10 years ago. It becomes extremely difficult to maintain these high standards working with the same budget that was introduced 10 years ago.\It's amazing how the school has been able to stretch these funds. We are fortunate that we have an outstanding Parents Club that constantly volunteers and runs programs and fund-raisers just to help supplement the existing funds.\We would definitely like to see the music and arts programs in grades K-8 expanded to meet the Illinois Fine Arts Standards. Adding the study of a foreign language to the K-8 curriculum would enhance our students' knowledge and help them to better understand the cultures of other countries and better prepare them for further education. Offering band and drama as part of the school-day curriculum would definitely improve our existing extra-curricular programs and better prepare our children for the high school programs.\Also, routine maintenance and upgrades are needed to maintain our existing facilities to keep them a safe and comfortable environment in which to learn.\A school district cannot accomplish these needed improvements on an outdated budget set up 10 years ago. We need to remain current with the times.\Vote yes in favor of District 34's referendum and you'll be proud of the results.\Stan and Pat Smolucha\Winfield\Vote for a tax fighter\I applaud Judy Biggert for taking a stand and proposing a property tax relief bill. Judy's legislation will double the property tax deduction from 5 percent to 10 percent, effectively saving the average homeowner hundreds of dollars ever year.\Taxes are outrageous and I am glad we have a local tax fighter to represent us in Springfield - and hopefully Washington. On March 17, send a tax fighter to Washington. Vote for Judy Biggert\Quentin Wise\Downers Grove\Best choice for governor\Good things have been happening to our country the past five years, with the Democrats in office. We as Illinoisans should work hard to see that it happens in Illinois, now that we have a chance to put a Democrat in office for governor.\What we need is hard worker and an accomplished person. His history alone tells us he is the man for the job. He was in the U.S. attorney general's office under President Clinton. He put 100,000 more police on the streets of America. He was responsible for carrying out the president's 1994 crime bill to fight violent crime. He implemented the Violence Against Women Act.\He's pro choice. He directed enforcement of a law that protected women's rights to access abortion clinics. He was ambassador and chief negotiator of world trade in Geneva. The result was the largest trade agreement in history, creating thousands of jobs for Americans.\He supports the death penalty and wants to eliminate lengthy appeals. He is responsible for the development of Navy Pier for $200 million, and $1 billion for expansion of McCormick Place. He served as transition co-chair for Mayor Daley and was responsible for the budget cuts that eliminated many perks for city bureaucrats.\He was architect of revisions of the Illinois mental health laws. The Washington Post called it the most important mental health reform in the history of the United States. He also co-chaired the committee to support project vote, a voter registration effort focused on the minority community.\Who else has this awesome history of experience to best be our governor? None other than John R. Schmidt.\Kay Packo\Addison"
336," The Daily Herald sent questionnaires to the candidates for the open seat of representing District 14 on the Kane County Board. Elaine Stern, a Democrat from St. Charles, and Mark Davoust, a Republican from St. Charles, both are seeking to represent the area that includes land west of Randall Road in St. Charles Township and part of Geneva Township. The district is bounded generally by the Fox River on the east, Fabyan Parkway to the south, the Campton Township line to the west and Silver Glen Road to the north.\ Davoust, 45, is vice president of Brasel Products in Batavia. He is a member of the Illinois Manufacturers Association and on the guardian advisory council of the National Federation of Independent Business. He also is a St. Charles Republican precinct committeeman and served as an alternate delegate to the Congressional Small Business Summit in 2000.\ Stern, 61, retired in 2001 from her post as director of Unilever Global Innovation Center in Rolling Meadows. She is a Democratic precinct committeeman and was involved in the women's leadership forum of the Democratic National Committee. She also has served as a court-appointed special advocate in the Kane County juvenile courts.\ Q. Why are you running for this particular office, whether for re- election or election for the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what? What will be your main priority?\ Davoust: I am running for this office because I believe that I can facilitate communication between the constituents of District 14 and the Kane County Board. This will benefit all involved. I will work to help maintain the fine lifestyle that we all enjoy in Kane County and District 14. Transportation and public safety will be among my priorities.\ Stern: In 2001 I took an early retirement after a 36-year business career with the last 25 years in a variety of management positions. It is my desire to use the many management skills I have developed during my career to serve Kane County. These business skills are directly transferable to management of government issues. I have a proven record in strategic planning, budget development and management, policymaking, organizational development, regulatory affairs, technology and science.\ In addition, I believe that citizens of Kane County are best served when strong candidates compete for each elected county office. In the past in Kane County, Republican candidates for many offices have run virtually unopposed. My intention is to run a vigorous campaign to win with clearly defined positions on issues. On Nov. 2, the people of District 14 will be able to make a choice.\ Q. Tell us what contributions you would make. Describe any shortcomings in the current chairman or county board as a whole that you would help remedy and explain how.\ Davoust: As a newcomer to the Kane County Board, I will bring a common-sense approach taken from my years in the business community. This will include, but not be limited to, making certain that our limited financial and other resources are committed to their highest and best uses. I hope to oversee the wise spending of our tax dollars and encourage living within a budget.\ Stern: I will work to ensure the Kane County Board becomes the effective, efficient, and responsive group voters expect of their leaders. I will work to guarantee the board follows through on all decisions it makes, eliminates the contentious relationship it has with the Kane County Departments, aligns all of its decisions against its strategic objectives, Land Resource Plan, and 2030 Plan, and makes transparent to the public all the steps and procedures that are used in making its decisions.\ Q. Many argue that one of Kane's biggest problems is traffic. With several high-volume county roads cutting through your district, including Randall Road, what proposal or ideas do you have to raise the amount of money the county collects for improvement of transportation Infrastructure. Higher gas taxes, sales taxes or some other options?\ Davoust: Traffic is certainly a concern in Kane County, and in the Randall Road corridor particularly. Before I would be in favor of increasing any taxes, including the gas tax, I will need to assure myself that our current tax dollars are being wisely spent.\ Stern: In lieu of increasing gas taxes, I support the use of equitably structured impact fees that are targeted at developers to fund improvements to the county road network and to fund other transit options.\ I support identifying wherever possible traffic reduction opportunities as the first choice in supporting the growth of Kane County as an alternative to simply building more roads. Working with Pace to dramatically increase service in the county, studying the feasibility of light rail service between communities, and working with developers to promote walkable neighborhoods should all be high on the Kane County Board agenda. Many of these ideas are in the county's 2030 plan, but all too often these ideas never move forward. The board has tended to use very traditional methods of dealing with transportation issues like simply building new roads to address traffic problems and has, overall, moved too slowly to address the already staggering traffic congestion.\ Q. Related to the previous question, the city of St. Charles is one of several communities calling for changes to the transportation impact fee system. Do you see the formula as it exists now as fair? Do you support the cities' attempts (including threatening legal action) to get an overhaul of that formula?\ Davoust: The transportation impact fee as originally proposed placed an unfair burden on the Tri-City area. That position has recently been revisited and a fairer allocation of use to fee has been suggested. We need to find an impact fee structure that is fair to all involved while providing the much-needed funds for transportation in the county.\ Stern: I support the use of impact fees in lieu of tax hikes. The Tri-City mayors agree that the underlying concept of the impact fee ordinance that went into effect in April 2004 is equitable. Developments that generate traffic on county roads should pay for improvements to county roads. The mayors feel that the method of calculating those fees is not fair; however, they had an opportunity to raise their objections and to work out a solution during the 2+ years the impact fee ordinance was being discussed by the county board. It is disappointing that the mayors did not take a more aggressive role in the dialogue and that the county board did not more assertively seek input from the mayors during the entire time the ordinance was being considered.\ That said, the Tri-City mayors have recourse other than their threatened lawsuit. The ordinance allows for a yearly review of the formula used to calculate the fees and the State of Illinois requires a review at least once every five years. I am confident that any disagreements between the mayors and the county board can be resolved if both parties actively pursue resolution. As a Kane County Board member I will work to facilitate the dialogue\ Q. Bridge projects have and likely will continue to create much controversy in Kane County. Which of the proposed bridges do you support and why? More recently, the board chairman called for a stop to engineering work on the bridges in favor of land acquisition. What course and speed do you believe the county should take in regard to future bridge development and construction?\ Davoust: I support a regional bridge at Stearns Road and a local bridge at Red Gate Road. From all available information, the Stearns bridge likely will be built within the next two years. Hopefully, this will divert substantial traffic from the northern end of the county and relieve some of the pressure on the mid- valley area. We need to evaluate the need for a second bridge, at Red Gate or elsewhere, in light of the traffic relief provided by the Stearns project.\ Land acquisition is a critical first step in the construction of bridges. We can engineer all day, but if we don't have the land required for the project we cannot complete it. I believe that the county needs river crossings to move traffic throughout the county. This should be done sooner, rather than later. As a community with a beautiful river running through it, we must accept the fact that we need to be able to move across it with ease. The current bridge structure cannot sustain the population that we currently have, let alone an increased population that we all expect.\ Stern: I support building those bridges that support the growth of Kane County and that will have the minimal effect on the environment and on property rights. Current regional bridges are at or will soon be at capacity. As a member of the Kane County Board, I will work to make certain that significant progress is made on decisions about the Fox River bridge crossings.\ I agree with Mike McCoy's decision to make the first priority the acquisition of needed land for the Stearns Bridge and Corridor as well as Longmeadow Parkway Bridge and Corridor. These bridges have been given environmental clearance and clearance to use federal funding. At this stage, monies should first be focused on land acquisition because of rising land prices and the need to have affected homeowners get resolution so they can relocate earlier rather than later.\ Building bridges across the Fox River is a long process from concept to completion. It takes two years from the time a bridge has gone through the lengthy approval process to time of completion. If the county grows as projected, there is no doubt that additional bridges will be needed. As a member of the Kane County Board, I will propose that a study on Fox River bridges similar to the one conducted in 1990 should again be funded.\ Local bridges, such as the proposed Red Gate Bridge, are the responsibility of local governments. They identify the need and the funding sources. I would suggest to mayors and village managers that before building additional local bridges, assure the existing bridges are being fully utilized. Where they are not, consider changing traffic patterns toward any underutilized bridges.\ Q. As a representative of a community that hat had its growth spurt but still represents the western edge of the County's so- called urban corridor under the terms of the 2020 land use management plan, what actions would you take as a board member to foster controlled growth in smaller communities looking to expand?\ Davoust: I cannot stress enough, that we must have communication and cooperation on an intergovernmental level. The 20/30 plan is a useful tool with which the county and municipalities can work together.\ Stern: I support the county's use of the ""smart growth"" development concept to foster controlled growth. ""Smart growth"" development provides a framework for communities to make informed decisions about how and where they grow. It makes it possible for communities to grow in ways that support economic development and jobs, and create strong neighborhoods with a range of housing, commercial, and transportation options.\ As a means of encouraging ""smart growth"" development, Kane County should reward developers who consistently embrace its principles of compact, walkable, distinctive neighborhoods with extensive use of open spaces. Appropriate rewards for these developers would be tax incentives and highest priorities for their projects. This program would be similar to certified supplier programs businesses have used for decades to reward suppliers who meet the highest quality and reliability standards. Kane County should also continue to actively participate in The Campaign for Sensible Growth, a coalition of government, civic and business interests working to promote economic development while preserving open spaces, minimizing the cost of new infrastructure and improving the quality of life in communities in northeastern Illinois.\ Q. As a county board member, you also serve as a (forest preserve) commissioner. During the last five years the forest preserve has used public money to strongly pursue and purchase land throughout the county. The board has used other public money to back farmland conservation and open space. Do you support continuing that practice or even setting aside more money for property purchases?\ Davoust: I believe that farmland conservation and open spaces are good for the community, but like any good thing, they should be done in moderation.\ Stern: Open space provides benefits to everyone in the county and is a basic tenet of the 2030 Land Resource Plan. It is appropriate, therefore, for taxpayers' money to be used to acquire forest preserve lands. Referenda that would increase the amount of money allotted towards the purchase of more land for open space would also help provide buffers around future and current developments.\ The Farmland Preservation program is also a fundamental concept in 2030 Land Resource Plan. It has been successful in saving many acres of farmland in Kane County. The only thing that limits the county from purchasing more development rights from farms is the lack of funding. The county is rapidly losing prime agricultural land and open space. Not being able to fund this program for lack of money will undermine the intentions of the land resource plan.\ Q. What matters of concern to your particular district do you plan to address if you're elected?\ Davoust: District 14 is diverse and contains specific areas of concern. Among those are Randall Road safety, which has recently been addressed by the safety median on the S-curve and the installation of traffic control signals at Bolcum Road and Crane Road. A continued monitoring and enforcement of speed limits on Randall Road will continue to improve our safety. We must, however, be sensitive to the rights of the homeowners adjacent to the corridor and ensure that they're property interests are protected.\ Stern: As a member of the board, a high priority for me will be to put ownership of the process of planning the county's future in the hands of the people of our county. I will work diligently to build strong and enduring intergovernmental alliances and partnerships with other agencies and companies providing vital services to the county. And I will work to keep Kane County a distinctive place to live while it grows and develops.\ Specifically, I will work to ensure the board achieves the kind of results in the area of transportation that will support its growth objectives. I will support new transit and traffic reduction opportunities, ensure the timely completion of construction on the Metra UP West line, identify opportunities for transit service to major activity centers, and insist the Transportation Division identifies high-risk roads and implements plans to reduce those risks.\ I will work to create a program that rewards developers who consistently embrace the smart growth concept of compact, walkable, distinctive neighborhoods with extensive use of open spaces. Appropriate rewards for these developers would be tax incentives and highest priorities for their projects.\ I will reopen discussion about the leaf burning ordinance. I believe that the county board's implementation is not in compliance with the language set forth in the ordinance, which calls for significant assistance to residents who are affected by the ordinance.\ Q. The state has allowed the collar counties to impose a 7 percent cap on tax assessment increases for the next three years. A decision must be made within the next few months. What's your position on the cap? Would you vote for it? Why/why not?\ Davoust: While I am encouraged that we are discussing a cap on property tax increases, I would be most supportive of no tax increase at all. If 7 percent is the best we can get at this time, I would support that. Ultimately, we will have succeeded only if there is a meaningful decrease in our property taxes.\ Stern: As a Kane County Board member I will support a well- written cap that will apply only to houses after being sold.\ I believe that a homeowner tax assessment cap is an important way to protect long-time residents of Kane County from being harmed during periods of dramatic housing price increases. In addition, a cap will force the Kane County Board to make tough choices about which programs to fund. Without constraints, any organization, whether business or government, has the tendency to rationalize increased spending. Unfortunately assessment caps do have the potential to limit future revenue to schools, which get most of their revenue from property taxes and to shift the tax burden to business.\ A well-structured tax assessment cap can be a good budgeting tool while protecting longtime residents without adversely affecting schools. A tax cap encourages the county board to set annual operating budgets based on a clear set of priorities that support its 2030 plans goals and to seek efficiency through the use of best practices in everything it does."
337," Serious wrongs in Connie Neale pact\ To the editor: Being a sports fan, I am often offended if not outraged by the salaries that some athletes receive and the outrageous behavior they display.\ However, I cannot recall an athlete declaring that what they do is for the benefit of anyone other than themselves.\ Sure they may say they want to win for the fans, but if they don't, no one is really any worse off than they were before.\ Having followed the developments in Elgin School District U-46 over the last several years, including the lawsuit, low test scores and now the latest Connie Neale situation, am I the only person outraged by her total disrespect for the people and students in this district?\ To go on indefinite medical leave with the contract she has and not disclose what exactly is her ailment is a slap in the face of all those who pay her exorbitant salary!\ This school board and Neale have time and again declared their concern for and dedication to the students of U-46 and this is what they have to show for it.\ The contract allows Neale to move ""out of the area"" and not only have the taxpayers pickup that tab, but also leave them holding the bag for the $1,100 a day for her interim replacement.\ Considering what the district is already putting out in legal fees due to the lawsuit, I wonder if the district would be willing to invest some more of the taxpayers' money to defend what seems to me to be an extremely bad deal for the taxpayers of U-46.\ What arrogance to pull a stunt like this after she was so arrogant in demanding this contract based on what she called her outstanding record and saying that she was one of the lowest paid superintendents for a district this size.\ If she felt she wasn't being properly compensated, why didn't she just quit? It appears as if she already has anyway.\ Would it be worthwhile to inform the state's attorney of this situation? Maybe some broader news coverage would be nice.\ It just seems to me that there is something way wrong with this situation.\ Mike Conard\ Elgin\ U-46 contract's CPI deal not 'excellent'\ To the editor: Regarding the Oct. 7 editorial, ""U-46 teachers should say 'yes' to good deal.""\ Among others, one reason among others why U-46 teachers might not see the proposed contract as ""excellent"" is the way the cost of living clause has been rewritten.\ The purpose of a cost of living clause is to protect against future, unanticipated accelerations in inflation by tying raises to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\ The 2004-07 contract set limits for the adjustment of 1 to 4 percent. The proposed agreement replaces the 1 to 4 percent range with a range of 1.5 to 2.8 percent.\ CPI inflation during 2006 was measured at 2.5 percent. That cost of living number is built into the proposed salaries for 2007-08. But for the following years, teachers are only protected against the next .3 percentage point of inflation.\ If Iran, Venezuela, China's insatiable demand or missteps by the Federal Reserve were to push inflation any higher than that, teachers get no further raise to make up for it. However, if inflation were to decelerate from the current 2.5 percent by as much as a full percentage point, teachers' nominal raises would follow suit, downward.\ The 1.5 to 2.8 range is an asymmetrical ratchet. If inflation falls to around 1.5 percent, the raise shrinks, too. If inflation rises any above 2.8 percent, the raise fails to rise to keep up with it.\ But it gets worse again, because inflation has already accelerated beyond the new, narrow 1.5 to 2.8 percent range.\ For the raise that will arrive in September 2008, two-thirds of 2007's inflation has already been measured by the monthly CPI. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports inflation has grown by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.7 percent during the January - August period.\ If that pattern holds for four more months, the CPI adjustment would be .9 percent behind actual inflation, leaving teachers exactly .1 percent ahead in real, inflation-adjusted terms in year two, not counting the step.\ The same could just as easily happen again in the third year of the contract. To a lot of people, that seems less than excellent.\ Steven Lauridsen\ Geneva\ Teachers insulted by deal's ambiguity\ To the editor: You wrote that multiple financial wrongs will not make a right and U-46 teachers know from experience they are the first to suffer with financial problems. Then you send a veiled threat that the teachers enjoy the public's respect for absorbing changes and might lose this if they disagree and vote ""no.""\ Teachers are collaborative, by nature and are entitled to a fair agreement that is truly fair to both sides, not just to the superintendent. This is corporate greed at the highest level.\ You wrote that the teachers would insult the taxpayers by rejecting this proposal. The insult is asking a group of professionals to accept an ambiguous contract when they receive much less compensation than professionals in other fields and are charged with the formation of our future leaders.\ Thomas Duffy\ Hoffman Estates\ A day in the life of teachers anywhere\ To the editor: It is always interesting to me when professionals without a teaching degree advise others how teachers should do their jobs and be compensated.\ Recently, you editorialized teachers should say ""Yes"" to a great deal in U-46. May I ask you to think about my job for a moment?\ Thirty children sit around while you teach them writing. They are all excited to learn until the first interruption - Johnny needs the bathroom. Billy and Freddy see this as a great opportunity and wiggle their arms in the air.\ You wonder, ""Do they really need the restroom or is this an excuse to play with Johnny?"" Decide quick, because you're losing the other 27 students. You let them go.\ It's quiet again and everyone's eyes are on you until ... Johnny returns and bumps Susie. Susie, tears streaming, doesn't think it's an accident. You wonder, ""Do I stop and tell Johnny to apologize (a teachable moment) or let it go?""\ Back to teaching. Billy and Freddy aren't back yet, but the others are interested so you continue teaching with your mind in two places until Kathy raises her hand and tells you her stomach hurts.\ You send her to the nurse and go on. But you look around at the remaining faces, hoping you're making a connection. Tommy gets special services for learning difficulties and Mary recently came to this country with little English. Yet, all children need to be on the same level academically.\ You care so much for these children. They are all so different, but you feel responsible for each and every one.\ The bell rings, the kids leave and you sit down, exhausted at your desk to plan lessons for the next day. Don't forget to check your mailbox, answer parent messages and read the principal's e- mail about the fire drill.\ How many students should be in a classroom? How much should a teacher be paid? How great is the contract being offered to U-46 teachers? If you think this letter is a joke, you don't have the background to answer these questions.\ Every teacher knows this is a day in the life of our profession. If you want dedicated, hard-working professionals to do one of the most important jobs in the world, I suggest you stop criticizing teachers or they may just leave to find less-stressful, better paying jobs.\ Dee Maroney\ Schaumburg\ CUB director urges fight against hikes\ To the editor: Many people may not know that the Cook County Board of Commissioners is considering a massive tax increase on electric, natural gas, and telephone service.\ Combined, these taxes would slap the average family with about $360 in extra costs a year, according to preliminary estimates. That's without the mandated yearly increases for inflation.\ This seems to have flown under the media's radar. Maybe that's because the proposal is so outrageous that nobody actually believes it will pass. Unfortunately, it has enough support that all taxpayers should be nervous.\ As the winter heating season approaches, Cook County proposes a nickel-per-therm natural gas tax, which would raise the cost of gas by roughly 5 percent. The proposed electric tax would be another 0.6 cents per kilowatt-hour.\ That means the County Board would effectively hijack the ComEd rate refund consumers fought so hard to earn, as the new tax would exceed the electric credit ordered by Gov. Rod Blagojevich and the General Assembly for 2008 and 2009.\ But if anything, it gets even worse. Cook County actually wants to slap you with a $4 per month tax for each of your home's phone lines, high-speed Internet lines, fax numbers, cell phones - and perhaps even for each cable connection.\ That means the average family, which has about five telecommunications services, would be forced to fork over another $240 a year. It gives a whole new meaning to the term ""pay phone.""\ However, it's not too late to stop this harmful proposal. The Citizens Utility Board encourages all taxpayers to call the Cook County Board (312) 603-6398 and ask to speak to their commissioner. Urge him or her to reject massive tax increases on services you can't do without.\ As the county board considers this proposal, we hope they understand that if they try to tax electricity, they're the ones who could end up out of power.\ We hope they understand that if they want to tax natural gas, they'll be taking plenty of heat from consumers.\ And we hope they understand that if they tax telephones, consumers could be making a call for new leadership.\ David Kolata\ Executive Director\ Citizens Utility Board\ Cook County can't afford higher taxes\ To the editor: Recently, the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability issued a report that Cook County's revenue system is unable to support the services that it is charged to provide. In short, we are spending more than we are taking in. Interestingly enough, President Todd Stroger's FY 2007 budget was supposed to fix this very problem but simply ignored the gathering storm.\ With the demand for health care growing by the day, it is critical that the county board solve this fiscal crisis. I believe the choice is clear: raise taxes or cut expenditures. This is where the county board splits into two camps.\ One camp believes in the antiquated version of county government, where tax and spend is the only option. This camp wants to dramatically increase sales taxes, sending Cook County consumers to bordering counties to make their purchases. With winter rapidly approaching, this camp wants to tax natural gas and electricity.\ You'll hear that county government is cut to the bone, with no more excess to cut. That is hard to believe when one county Commissioner proclaimed, ""You know, I'm a patronage person. I love patronage.""\ This group actually professes that no waste currently exists. Yet revelation after revelation argues the contrary.\ There is another camp that believes in looking at ways to dramatically decrease the size of government, thus dramatically decreasing expenditures. The guiding principle of this group is bringing county government into the 21st century, focusing on a lighter, more mobile work force; delivering top-notch services at the lowest possible cost.\ This camp wants to put an end to waste and patronage in county government, giving Cook County taxpayers the biggest bang for their buck.\ Efficient services and lower taxes is the only way Cook County will survive this fiscal crisis. Increasing taxes will dig us into a deeper hole, protecting the politically advantaged and supporting ""business as usual."" This county must look within itself to balance its budget, not to the taxpayers.\ Timothy O. Schneider\ Bartlett\ Cook County Commissioner 15th District\ Residents will end up paying for barn\ To the editor: The Daily Herald's Sept. 30 story, ""Restored barn celebrates Deer Park history,"" reported that President Gifford said ""it cost about $175 per square foot to restore the three-story 6,542- square-foot barn, or about $1.15 million.""\ That's only on the inside. Outside, the exterior of the barn was substantially reconstructed, plus various property improvements and technology infrastructure, not to mention myriad legal and engineering fees.\ Per square foot, not one cent was invested in a modern, comfortable work environment for our professional staff.\ Last April's candidates for village trustee estimated total Vehe costs between $3.2 and $3.9 million. Six months later, ""final number are still being tallied.""\ Grants, donations, volunteering - all contributed to the property. But far more village dollars that should have been spent on roads and drainage went to Vehe. Meanwhile, the Vehe Foundation has yet to launch a genuine village-wide fundraising effort and just lowered its rental fees. The foundation ""manages"" the property, but the village coffers cough up the cash. Can the foundation provide its own maintenance, much less a return on investment?\ The 50th anniversary celebration was lively; then the vendors and entertainers pulled up their tent stakes and departed. What realistic use will the ""multipurpose center for our community"" have? Residents should judge for themselves, because -rough guess - it cost each of you over $1,200. So far.\ Come inside. Public Comments start at 7 p.m. today (Oct. 15) at the village board meeting and at the village's first public forum on Thursday.\ Deborah and Al Barry\ Deer Park\ This winter, don't smother your trees\ To the editor: Trees are wonderful assets. During warm weather they provide cool shade. During the autumn they provide color and crunch under foot. During the winter they guard us like poised giants, occasionally decorated with icicles and snow. Flowering trees make spring picturesque and fragrant. In this area we are blessed with all sorts of trees. I love and value every one of them.\ Soon you will prepare your landscape and trees for winter. Well- intentioned landscape workers and homeowners will build small mounds around the trunks of their trees. I liken this to putting hip boots on your children or grandchildren and filling the hip boots with water. After two to three weeks in wet hip boots, how do you think their soaked feet will have fared?\ Trees have feet too; they are better known as root flare. Mulch and soil piled on top of the root flare reduces the tree's ability to absorb oxygen. Wet mulch and soil on the root flare and next to the bark can endanger the tree's health. The health problems created may not reveal themselves immediately, but they will endanger your tree and shorten its life.\ Some trees were planted too low. Over the years soil was stacked on top of root flares. Look at your trees. If they grow straight out of the ground, remove some soil and find your tree's feet. This will help your tree to breathe. (You may wish to consult a certified arborist.) When you prepare for winter and put mulch around your trees, keep that mulch off the root flare. Check work done by your landscape helpers. Make sure their good intentions and mulch don't smother your tree.

CORRECTION: Law's number incorrect A story in Monday's editions about a net-metering program misstated the number of the new law. It is Public Act 95-0420. The News-Gazette regrets the error. (09/11/ 07)
\
SPRINGFIELD - Illinoisans who purchase solar panels, wind generators or other types of renewable energy equipment can now get a little more bang for their buck.
\
Gov. Rod Blagojevich last month signed legislation creating a statewide net metering program, which means customers can use excess power they generate through such equipment as a credit against electricity they purchase from their utility company. In a year when electricity rates jumped significantly, that could make a big difference in a customer's bill.
\
""It's really good for the customers for financial reasons, but it also helps people get the idea that we can do something to lower our utility bills while also protecting the environment,"" said state Rep. Naomi Jakobsson, D-Urbana, who became a sponsor of the legislation after receiving requests from a number of her constituents.
\
One of them, Urbana resident Pete Resnick, called the new law ""absolutely fabulous,"" and said he is planning on installing solar panels at his home in the next several months.
\
Such panels usually generate the most power during the daytime, at a time when the average home uses less electricity. Under the new net metering law, every kilowatt hour of that surplus energy is transferred back to the utility company, earning the customer a bill credit equal to that same number of kilowatt hours.
\
""Before, if you had any excess electricity, the power company was only required to buy it back from you at wholesale price, which is obviously much less money than you'd get having it directly taken off your bill,"" Resnick said. ""This is just a great incentive.""
\
As another incentive, the new law requires the utility company to pay for installation of the special new meter residential and small commercial customers may need to participate.
\
The new law, which is in effect, requires all electricity providers to begin offering net metering in Illinois by April 1, 2008. Commonwealth Edison already operates a voluntary net metering program for some of its Chicago-area customers. Ameren does not, but spokeswoman Natalie Hemmer said the company did not oppose the legislation.
\
""We feel that it is a fair bill,"" she said.
\
The new law outlines the framework for the new net metering program, and orders the Illinois Commerce Commission to develop more specific standards within four months.
\
""Probably sometime in January we will know what those standards are and what we're going to have to do in order to meet those standards,"" Hemmer said.
\
According to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, about two- thirds of states have some kind of net metering laws.
\
The new Illinois law is Public Act 94-0420.

339,"On Tuesday, a ribbon cutting will officially open an assembly plant here for gargantuan, 23-ton wind turbines capable of spinning breezes into electricity.\In reality, though, the wind-turbine plant--only the second in the nation and the first outside California--has been churning out a new generation of wind machines as fast as it could for some months, feeding a fluky and nearly overwhelming rush to wind power in the United States.\So who's had time to cut a ribbon?\By midsummer, the nation's capacity for making electricity from wind will have increased a whopping 50 percent in 18 months. By July, hundreds of new, utility-owned turbines will be whirling on sprawling ""wind farms"" across the country, including in Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota.\Although Illinois has been conspicuously absent, even Commonwealth Edison Co., the largest nuclear utility in the nation, is taking a new look at wind power.\""Before it wasn't necessarily feasible, but now it may be,"" said Heather Fabian, a ComEd spokeswoman, who added it was too early to talk about details.\For decades now, wind power has seemed stuck in the role of energy source for the future, with nothing much happening in the present. But finally, it is showing signs of becoming a growing part of mainstream electricity production. Even so, by year's end, all the wind machines combined will produce only a fraction of the nation's energy needs, no more electricity than two of the biggest nuclear power reactors.\Still, like a windmill creaking as a breeze picks up, something is indeed starting to happen.\A manufacturing infrastructure, including the Champaign plant, is being laid down. Nuclear power is waning, forcing utilities to diversify. And a deregulated electricity business is creating a marketplace for renewable energy sources.\Suddenly, mainstream utilities are plunking wind towers onto hilltops as fast as they can to beat a July deadline that will at least temporarily end a federal subsidy that cuts the cost of wind power by as much as 20 percent.\Wind power continues to have a more difficult time in Illinois, however. While the Champaign plant, opened by Danish wind-machine giant NEG Micon, suggests that Illinois is a good place to assemble wind turbines, it remains a poor place to install them.\Neither the political nor the geophysical winds are currently favorable for wind energy in Illinois, though some hold out hope that legislation can change at least part of that equation. Right now, a lack of incentives and what some call a ""punitive rate structure"" are helping keep the machines away.\""Illinois has simply fallen behind other states in adopting policies to encourage cost effective wind power development,"" said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center.\Wind machines today are vastly different from, and much, much bigger than, those made even a few years ago.\A typical machine today generates 56 times more electricity than its 1980s ancestors, and the cost of the electricity it produces has dropped 90 percent.\Improvements in electronics and gearing have allowed the machines to grow to monstrous sizes, capturing the wind with increasing efficiency.\While the towers that hold the turbines and their three spinning blades once topped out at 100 feet, new wind generators are perched on steel stems as tall as 22-story buildings. With its Champaign plant, NEG Micon is betting that it can drive costs down by making its turbines in the U.S.\Its suppliers, too, are headed to the United States. The European company that manufactures blades will be opening a plant in Grand Forks, N.D., this spring.\The most promising destinations for the finished wind turbines lie in a swath of the country buffeted by strong and steady winds, a sort of Great Plains wind belt.\With perhaps too much enthusiasm, wind power advocates say North Dakota, the best wind state, could develop wind power into a $30 billion industry.\But the powerful, prairie-scrubbing winds that empower Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas begin to peter out by the time they reach eastern Iowa and Minnesota, leaving states like Illinois and Wisconsin with a much smaller ""wind resource.""\Wisconsin is forging ahead with wind technology, nonetheless.\The Wisconsin legislature mandated that the four major utilities in the state construct wind farms to produce a total of 50 megawatts of power--about 5 percent of what a single nuclear power reactor puts out.\Rather than fight the mandate, some of the utilities are building more wind machines than they were told to. Madison Gas and Electric Co. was required to produce 3 megawatts of wind power as its share, but instead is putting up an 11-megawatt wind farm near Green Bay.\The utility plans to make the machines profitable through a concept called ""green pricing,"" in which some customers agree to pay more for electricity because it is made from renewable resources.\Madison Gas and Electric estimates that typical residential customers choosing to have 20 percent of their power come from wind will pay an additional $4 to $5 each month.\Even as ComEd takes a new look at wind power, however, others in Illinois are being held back by the absence of what energy wonks call ""net metering.""\In a nutshell, net metering allows a small energy developer--say, a farmer--to install a wind turbine to power the farm and sell any excess electricity to the local power company at the retail rate.\Because there is no net metering in Illinois, the farmer pays one rate for electricity he purchases from the power company, but would get back just a fraction of that for any electricity he pumps back into the system.\State Sen. Christine Radogno (R-La Grange) recently submitted a bill in the General Assembly that would bring net metering to Illinois.\The most critical piece of legislation for wind power, however, is at the federal level.\Under a federal program set to expire at the end of June, every working wind turbine receives a 1.5-cent tax credit for each kilowatt hour of electricity it produces. Legislation to extend the tax credit is part of a tax package that Congress is expected to take up this year.\Since it began operating last fall, NEG Micon's new Champaign plant has already shipped 56 turbines to a wind farm in Iowa and recently finished the first four of 47 turbines headed for Texas.\Before June, the plant is scheduled to finish the balance of the Texas order as well as an order for 15 turbines in Colorado and eight in Wyoming.\After that, though, the market becomes more uncertain.\""I wish I could say we had 100 orders on the books after May, but I don't have that now,"" said Daniel Mandli, the plant's general manager.\As for the future of wind power in Illinois, much depends on how the machines fare in states with similar winds.\""If we see these projects succeed in Wisconsin,"" said Mark Eilers of NEG Micon, ""you will see wind farms in Illinois."""
340,"The Chicago Auto Show is a great place to see the automakers' new car models and futurist concept designs. Clean electric vehicles and hybrids have moved from the sidelines to center stage. General Motors is showcasing its snazzy new Bolt, an EV offering a 200-mile range, more headroom and less pollution. Toyota's test-drive track shows off its new RAV4 hybrid crossover SUV; Ford is displaying its attractive C-MAX and Fusion plug-in hybrids; and the CEO of Volvo, in a speech to the Economic Club, focused on low-polluting cars and autonomous ""self-driving"" vehicles for the future.\How can Chicago tap that excitement and strategically position itself to be a leader as innovative clean car technologies? By building an EV infrastructure of smart policies and fast-charging stations powered by clean renewable energy for innovative clean car technologies. That will improve mobility, reduce pollution, attract interest and investment in our world-class city and reduce foreign oil use. Some key steps forward: \1. Location matters. Let's continue to rapidly build out the public-private EV charging system throughout Chicago and Illinois at both public spaces and private parking areas. More charging stations in high-traffic locations will encourage more people to buy EVs and worry less about boosting their batteries to keep moving. \As EVs gain longer ranges, there needs to be a dependable charging station infrastructure on the highways between Chicago and Madison, Milwaukee, Des Moines, Detroit, Indianapolis and St. Louis. A robust fast-charging station infrastructure can alleviate drivers' worries about running out of power. That's a barrier to new car purchases. Tesla is stepping up. GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Daimler, Honda and other automakers, as well as Federal Express and UPS, should engage and invest to help build out this modern EV charging infrastructure. \2. The power source for charging matters. Let's build more charging stations powered by solar energy during the day and wind power at night to reduce overall pollution. Power prices are generally highest on hot summer afternoons when the most polluting plants tend to be running on the margin to meet peak electricity demand from cranked-up air conditioners. That's also the best time to tap solar energy. If charging stations are solar-powered, then the pollution equation works well. \How can we help make that happen? First, planning, zoning and utility regulatory policies that encourage locating charging stations in places with good solar access. Second, the Illinois Commerce Commission should improve ""net metering"" rates enabling charging stations to sell valuable surplus solar-generated electricity back into the grid. \Wind power is plentiful and provides ""no pollution, no fuel cost"" energy. Because Illinois has surplus wind power and nuclear plants running at night, off-peak market prices are often very low. Nighttime EV charging helps utilities level out energy use. We all gain environmental quality benefits if EVs charge when the power equation results in less pollution. \Driving a clean-tech electric vehicle doesn't help the environment as much if it's charged by electricity generated by highly polluting coal plants. Clean renewable energy should power clean tech transportation. \3. Tax incentives matter. Stable, consistent incentives help build the market and support manufacturing, which needs predictability for transitioning to new clean car technologies. Let's avoid the ""stop-and-start"" tax credits that, until recently, hampered wind power. That uncertainty deterred investment and held back development. Let's keep the EV tax incentives steady. \One of President Barack Obama's biggest successes has been re-energizing the American auto industry and spurring manufacturers to build clean cars for the future. Auto manufacturers took up that challenge. They tapped American ingenuity and creativity to develop new all-electric and plug-in hybrid cars that excite buyers and pollute less. \The Chicago Auto Show showcases many electric vehicles -- large and small, with different price points and features that appeal to many new car buyers. Let's get our EV policies and infrastructure right to charge into the future. \Howard A. Learner is the executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, the Midwest's leading environmental and economic development advocacy organization. \----------\Howard A.

341,"Solar panels are booming. According to the Solar Energies Industry Association, more than a million American homes now sport solar panels. Those million homeowners could agree that sporting solar panels gives their homes energy independence, more control over where their power comes from, increased property values and -- most importantly -- lower electric bills.\But for homeowners considering adding their own panels, the process can seem daunting.\We spoke to some experts, who suggested some questions that homeowners need to consider when researching getting solar power for themselves.\1. Does my roof get enough sunlight? How do I find out?\There are two factors to consider right off: roof orientation and shading.\Orientation is the simplest thing to determine. ""Anything other than North is fine,"" Vikram Aggarwal says. Aggarwal is founder and CEO of EnergySage.com, an online marketplace that makes it easy for consumers to comparison shop for rooftop energy systems. ""South is generally the best. West is the next best, East is the next best."" South-facing roofs are ideal for solar because they capture the most light during the sun's trajectory across the sky.\How much shade your roof receives is the second concern. You'll need about 4-6 hours of continuous sunshine. ""Do you have a lot of trees, adjacent homes or other obstacles that block sun exposure on your roof?"" Jen Darrah of Direct Energy Solar, an installer active in the Northeast, says. ""If so, they could be a factor."" Most of the time, trees can easily be trimmed.\Aggarwal mentions another factor to consider. If your roof is complex, with sharp angles or multiple gables, you might not be able to get the combined 300 square feet or so needed by most systems. In those cases, a ground-mounted system might be more appropriate, assuming you have the yard space to accommodate the solar array.\2. How much can I save?\""There really is no standard amount of money that people can save, because everyone is different,"" Darrah says. There are a variety of factors to consider, including the size of the system, its cost, the local electricity rate and available sunlight. ""However, the bottom line is that when you go solar, you immediately lower your out-of-pocket costs for electricity, and your system can save you thousands in electricity costs for decades,"" she says.\For those seeking a national view, Energy Sage publishes a data report every six months that summarizes costs and trends across the United States.\3. How do I decide what kind of system I need?\""It really starts with talking with a professional solar installer,"" Darrah says. The installer can evaluate the home and roof to make recommendations for the best type of system. ""When you meet with us, you receive a selection of panel options to choose from, so you can decide the look and price-point that's best for you and your home.""\Roof space and electricity needs are big determining factors. Others to consider are warranties and manufacturers. ""Some people are really interested in buying American made, and the options are increasing,"" Aggarwal says. ""You pay a slight premium, but from some people that's a very big deal.""\4. Should I purchase or lease the solar panels?\This is a financial decision that many homeowners face, because the cost of a new solar system can be high. If you don't have enough cash on hand to buy the system outright, low-interest solar loans are available either through the equipment manufacturers or your local bank.\One advantage of purchasing your system is the array of incentives available through government agencies or your local utility. ""With solar ownership, you can take advantage of incentives, rebates and grants, as well as special programs like net metering and Solar Renewable Energy Credits (or SRECs),"" Darrah says. ""These programs lower your system cost and speed up your solar payback.""\Leases, on the other hand, will give you smaller share of the savings. On the other hand, you won't need to worry about maintenance or upkeep costs, since the lessor handles those. ""If you want to save the most money, ownership makes the most sense. If you're looking for something very simple, leasing is a good,"" Aggarwal says.\5. Can I get a tax break?\If you own your system, then yes! ""Several state-level tax incentives exist, but the shining star has been the popular Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provided by the federal government,"" Darrah says. The ITC is a federal solar incentive that allows you to claim a tax credit for 30 percent of the total cost of installing your solar system, and it's available at least until 2022. (Congress has yet to decide whether to extend it past then.)\Homeowners can check www.dsireusa.org, a website run by North Carolina State University, to see a list of local credits, rebates and incentives available in their area. Aggarwal also recommends the solar calculator available on the EnergySage website.\6. Will the system increase the value of my property?\""Studies have shown that this is indeed the case,"" Darrah says. According to a 2013 study by the Appraisal Institute, a professional association of real estate appraisers, solar electric systems positively impact home values. After all, anyone who purchases your home in the future will inherit lowered energy bills.\7. How will this affect the look of my house?\""Are the panels going on the front of the house or the back of the house? People are very focused on how the panels are going to look,"" Aggarwal acknowledges with a laugh. Thanks to advances in manufacturing, there are now an increased number of options available, including black-on-black panels, all-glass panels and rimless panels. If you're looking for a completely invisible option, California manufacturer SolarCity recently announced a premium product that integrates solar panels into individual glass shingles or roof tiles.\8. Do I need to get a new roof first?\Maybe. Installation is best done on a roof in good condition that will not need replacement for a while. If the roof is older -- say 20 years old -- most installers would recommend at least replacing the part of the roof where the panels are being installed.\Aggarwal points out one benefit for your roof. ""The panels do actually protect the roof, so they can extend the life of your roof,"" he says. Panels are relatively easy to remove in the event that your roof needs repair.\9. What happens if I move?\You have two options. Your first option, as mentioned before, is to keep your system at your house. ""It increases the value of your home and provides value to the new homeowner,"" Darrah says. The system could also be transferred to your new home. Direct Energy Solar provides a moving guarantee that assists customers if they decide to move.\10. So what do I do next?\Because solar power can vary greatly from location to location, our experts recommended speaking to local contractors and gathering bids from multiple installers. By speaking to each installer, you'll find out why they are recommending particular options.\Aggarwal recommended his company's service, which takes place entirely online -- with no phone call required -- giving homeowners three to seven options. ""When I'm talking to my friends and family, one thing I like to emphasize is why they should even think of solar,"" Aggarwal says. ""One is that it's one of the really good investment options available to homeowners today. Two, you're locking in your electricity prices for the next 10 to 20 years.""\Finally, Aggarwal says, ""it's one of the greatest ways to generate economics growth in the U.S. You're borrowing from a local bank, you're hiring a local contractor and you're not exporting your energy dollars."" In other words, he says, solar is a ""triple bottom-line"" product that helps your pocketbook, helps the environment and helps the local economy. In that context, it's a no-brainer.\Credit: By Jesse Darland CTW Features"
342,"Gov. Pat Quinn said he would sign legislation Saturday to free up $30 million for the purchase of solar energy for Illinois electricity customers, a move expected to help the state catch up on its lagging renewable energy goals.\""Thousands of average residents will soon get cheaper, cleaner energy, and we will create good paying jobs for working families in the process,"" Quinn said in a statement. \The law, effective immediately, establishes a competitive procurement process to buy energy from new solar and existing projects, particularly rooftop solar. And it allows people to sell excess electricity back to the grid and get ""solar credits"" if part of the state solar program. \""Increasing our investment in clean energy creates jobs, protects the environment and reduces our dependence on fossil fuels,"" said state Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, who sponsored the bill with state Rep. Robyn Gabel, D-Evanston. ""Over the past few years, we've seen wind energy take off in Illinois. I hope that this investment starts a similar revolution in solar energy."" \A glitch in the wording of state law has prevented solar power from being bought for Illinois electric customers over the past two years, even though they have paid $53 million into a fund set aside for that purpose. An additional $80 million is expected by fall, according to Illinois Power Agency Director Anthony Star. \The problem is that the law allows the money only to be spent when power is purchased for Commonwealth Edison and Ameren Illinois customers. But those utilities have more power than they need, because most of their customers have fled for alternative suppliers. ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corp. \Several legislative attempts in Springfield to fix the law have failed. As a result, the state is failing to meet its goals for renewable energy purchases. Under the renewable portfolio standard, the state is aiming to have 25 percent of its energy come from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2025. \Some companies and homeowners have been generating solar power on their own. A billing mechanism called net metering will allow those producers to run their meters backward when they generate more electricity than they consume. \In May, lawmakers offered the solar bill as a temporary fix to the problem. A broader energy bill is expected to be hashed out as early as this fall, one that policy analysts say is expected to also incorporate reforms that would benefit the state's nuclear plants, which have been struggling financially against competing forms of energy, including renewables such as electricity generated by wind and solar. \The support of Exelon, which owns six nuclear plants in the state, is a key to any broader deal. Since wind and solar power compete with Exelon's nuclear plants, it has no reason to support a legislative fix for renewable energy unless there's something in the mix for its nuclear plants. \In a note to investors Friday, Julien Dumoulin-Smith, executive director of equity research for electric utilities at UBS Securities in New York, said that ""ultimately any deal will focus on providing a quasi 'market solution' to compensate Exelon's nuclear units"" and that he expects that could include some adding nuclear power to the state's definition of ""clean energy,"" a deal that would ultimately mean subsidizing those plants in some way. \In the previous session, lawmakers signaled their support for Exelon by signing on to a resolution the company pushed that calls on state lawmakers to aid in pro-nuclear lobbying of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, electric grid operators and Congress. \----------\jwernau@tribune.com"

\
URBANA Slowly, solar energy advocates are making progress promoting systems that work with the sun.
\
An energy crisis in California, high power bills last winter and nationwide interest in using renewable energy have helped their cause, says former University of Illinois agricultural engineer Bill Peterson.
\
So have new, practical applications to make solar power a familiar, everyday commodity, said Peterson, who has traveled throughout the state demonstrating about solar power since he retired from the UI in 1995.
\
""We need to get started somewhere,"" he said. ""Now people are using solar energy on motor homes and campers.
\
""Look at flashing arrows you see on the highway indicating lane changes. Most are now powered by solar cells.""
\
Peterson, whose work is supported by state energy officials, has equipped a trailer to demonstrate how solar powered systems work.
\
On it, he's mounted a commercially available water pumping system to keep livestock supplies fresh and a farm gate that opens and closes by sun power.
\
Peterson also demonstrates a fan and a pathway light with a solar panel on the top.
\
""In the summer, they'd be lighted all night,"" Peterson said.
\
""In the winter, they're marginal, so I wouldn't put them any place critical.
\
""There's more happening in the Southwest where sunshine's more predictable.""
\
Peterson said the state's energy and recycling section, part of the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, underwrites about half the cost of solar system installations if they meet requirements.
\
""Fifteen years ago, the price of panels was 10 times what it is now,"" he said.
\
""And there's a lot more interest now. In California, there's big demand. Those people are worried. The sale of panels was up 30 percent last year, and this year, the industry expects a 50 percent increase.""
\
He takes his display, which includes a large solar panel that tracks the sun, to field days and to school conservation days to spread the word about solar power.
\
The panel is actually four panels of cells made out of wafers of silicon crystals, the most expensive and effective technology for collecting the sun's energy. The panel produces
\
300 watts of power and it runs the quarter-horsepower water pump.
\
Peterson said the four panels cost about $2,000, and the tracker, which supports the panels, costs about $800.
\
The panel follows the sun because tubes lining two sides are filled with Freon that expands and moves from side to side when it's heated by the sun.
\
The gate and the pathway light have cheaper ""amorphous"" panels such as those that run light-activated calculators to collect their power. A remote control switch opens and closes the gate.
\
Peterson believes the opportunities for cost-effective use of solar power in Illinois and other states are in areas not close to power lines.
\
""It costs more than $10,000 a mile to construct power lines,"" he said.
\
""At that price, we can think about solar. In the west, some electric cooperatives also use solar systems because they're cheaper.""
\
Peterson helped a Beardstown Christmas tree grower install a system that pulls water from a nearby lake into his drip irrigation system using a solar pump. And he helped a rural Champaign resident install solar power to aerate his fish pond.
\
Peterson said public examples of solar use include a solar- powered weather radio installed at the Funks Grove Interstate 55 rest stop, photovoltaic lighting installed at some state parks and security lighting at the Illinois State fairgrounds.
\
Rural Mahomet homeowner David Kunde has had mixed results with his solar water heating system, and he's looking for answers.
\
""It worked the first two years we had it, but then it wouldn't follow the sun, so I set it in the 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. position,"" Kunde said.
\
""Then the pump failed, and I haven't been able to find parts for it because the company that built it is out of business.""
\
He figures that when the system worked, it saved about $20 to $25 a month in heating bills in the winter and electric bills in the summer.
\
""I was very happy with the idea,"" Kunde said. ""That's one reason I bought the house. Now I'm considering taking it off the house because it rattles in the wind, but I wish there was some way to fix it.""
\
Mark Wilkerson, vice president of business development for SunWize Technologies Inc., said solar-powered water heating systems make good sense for homeowners, but he said early companies selling the systems were ""selling the federal tax credit, not the equipment.""
\
Many went out of business because their equipment was substandard, stranding a lot of homeowners who had installed systems, Wilkerson said. But he said several good suppliers still install solar heating, including one in the Chicago area.
\
SunWize sells only solar power.
\
""Our primary markets are industrial and commercial where there are electric needs and no alternative power,"" said Wilkerson, who's based at Stelle in northern Ford County. ""Our number one market is highway message and arrow boards.
\
""Five years ago, they were 100 percent powered by little diesel generators that ran 24 hours a day. Now we've eliminated thousands of generators and helped the environment by eliminating the pollution they produced.""
\
Stelle installed alternative energy systems for practical reasons, including a five-year-old municipal phone company that's the first off-the-grid, solar-powered company in North America, and a municipal water plant that's wind powered.
\
""Our power was so bad,"" he said of the reason Stelle residents looked into alternatives. ""We're on the last mile of ComEd lines, and we had lots of brownouts. And we're out in the country, and we have a lot of lightning strikes.""
\
Fourteen of the 44 homes at Stelle population 110 have solar- powered electricity, including Wilkerson's home. He said he installed a $10,000 system, and the state covered half the cost.
\
He said a colleague, Steve Bell, installed a $60,000 system on his home, the state gave him a partial rebate of $20,000 and he just finished his first year of net metering, in which ComEd reimburses customers whose homes produce excess electricity.
\
""Admittedly, not many people could afford to install a $60,000 system, but he got a check back from ComEd for $150,"" Wilkerson said.
\
""He produced enough power for the grid to cover his entire usage and he got money back.""

344,"When Rena Wilson Jones and her husband, Drew, were building a house 10 years ago in a subdivision near the edge of Urbana, they knew the property was likely to be windy, bordered as it was by open fields to the north and west. But they did not realize how fierce the winds would be until construction of their house was under way.\In the decade that followed, the wind drove Wilson Jones crazy from November through April, she said, whipping across her yard and making it difficult to work in the garden. At times, it was hard to walk outside.\Eventually, the couple decided to capitalize on their affliction. Last summer, they installed a 56-foot wind turbine in their yard to draw electrical power from the wind, which sometimes gets up to 40 mph.\They did the work themselves over a weekend, digging a 4-foot-deep hole for the foundation and raising the $13,000 turbine with a winch on their Jeep. It was spinning by early September, and their electricity bills dropped sharply, from $90 to $10 for November, one of the windier months.\""Now, the faster the wind goes, the happier I am,"" said Wilson Jones, a director of nursing at Community Blood Services of Illinois.\Until recently, wind turbines were used primarily by those who lived outside the range of local utility lines, or who wanted to live completely off the grid. Now, reductions in their size and cost, along with improvements in their efficiency, are allowing suburban homeowners to install them in growing numbers.\Sales of wind turbines have been growing steadily since 1990, when the American Wind Energy Association, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, D.C., began tracking them. Last year, about 7,000 small wind turbines -- defined as those that have a capacity of up to 100 kilowatts, roughly enough to power a large school -- were purchased in the United States, according to the group, which said it expects sales to reach about 10,000 this year.\Residential turbines, which account for half those sales, are typically 33 to 100 feet tall, with outputs of two to 10 kilowatts. They cost between $12,000 and $55,000, but in recent years, 19 states, including California, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Ohio, have begun offering incentives and rebates that can cut purchase prices by up to 50 percent.\Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would help states provide grants and low-interest loans for residential turbines (as well as solar panels and geothermal heat pumps), and that would offer a 30 percent federal tax credit on turbine purchases, up to $4,000.\A 10-kilowatt turbine in an area with an average wind speed of 12 miles per hour can lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to removing 1.3 cars from the road, according to the wind energy association. But for some, the financial savings are at least as important.\Marc Schambers eliminated his payments to Southern California Edison after he installed a turbine in his backyard in the town of Phelan five years ago. Schambers, the owner of CleanMessage, a spam-filtering service, opted for an unusually tall 120-foot model (taller devices generate more energy) because his electricity bills were as much as $1,000 a month in summer, he said, when he was paying to cool both his home office and his 1,800-square-foot house.\He has since paid off his $25,000 investment -- the turbine cost $46,000, but he received a $21,000 rebate from the California Energy Commission -- and now produces more power than he can use. Since California is one of 23 states that require power companies to offer ""net metering,"" by which customers receive credit for any extra power they generate, he comes out ahead.\""One of the top 10 pleasures in life is watching your electrical meter go backward,"" he said.\Schambers' neighbors apparently agree; he said he can see 20 turbines from his backyard.\Other parts of the country, too, offer ideal conditions for turbines: The Great Plains, for example, are the ""Saudi Arabia of wind,"" according to Karl Bergey, the chairman and chief executive of Bergey Windpower, a turbine manufacturer in Norman, Okla.\Turbines in low-wind areas\Some consumers have installed turbines in low-wind areas. In August, Curt and Christine Mann put up a turbine next to their Craftsman-style house in the Grant Park neighborhood of Atlanta, despite an average wind speed of only 9 miles per hour, the minimum recommended by the wind energy association. (The group also says that home turbines should be at least 30 feet tall and surrounded by at least an acre of land, free of any large obstructions like dense trees.)\So far, their turbine has led to only a modest reduction in electricity costs, from around $95 to roughly $75 a month, and it could take up to 20 years at that rate to recoup their initial investment. But they were more interested in ecological benefits than financial ones, said Mann, a real estate developer whose company is called City Crest Holdings.\Local governments have put up roadblocks to the devices. A few towns, like Blowing Rock, N.C., have banned them outright because of their appearance, and others require homeowners to petition the local zoning board for a variance to exceed building height limits. Some cities require letters of support from neighbors, which can be hard to obtain because some people believe turbines may threaten birds, reduce property values and make too much noise.\At Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area in California, it is estimated that between 1,700 to 4,700 birds are killed each year. But Michael Daulton, director of conservation policy for the National Audubon Society, said it is not clear what effect individual wind turbines have on birds. The society suggests that homeowners learn whether they live close to a wildlife preserve that attracts a lot of birds, or are situated on a bird migratory route, as the Altamont wind farm is.\Property values\Turbines' effects on property values is not clear. Ryan Wiser, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said the effect of large wind farms on home values has been mixed, and added that there are no studies covering small turbines. When calculating the sale price of a home with a turbine, some brokers value them as they would a swimming pool, adding half of the purchase and installation costs to a home's price.\The noise and shadows turbines make have resulted in some concerns. In July, residents of Beach Haven Terrace, N.J., sued a neighbor, saying the noise from his 35-foot turbine exceeded 50 decibels (the sound level of light traffic or an average home), and that it cast ""strobe-like shadows"" on their property for several hours a day.\When Kurt Karpavich, a resident of Watertown, Conn., an affluent rural town in Litchfield County, sought a variance from the town to put up a 55-foot turbine behind his house last summer, a dozen neighbors signed a petition against it and placed signs reading ""No to the Windmill"" on their lawns.\Jacqueline and David Daddona, who live next to Karpavich, are concerned that his turbine will cast shadows on their house, attract lightning and mar their view of the Naugatuck Valley. Others objected to the presence of a tower rising above the roofline.\""I'm not against the environment, but I just think there's a place for all this,"" said David Daddona. ""You shouldn't try to save a little bit on your electrical bill if it affects your neighbors.""\Karpavich was granted the variance in early summer, but the Daddonas appealed the decision and sued the town planning and zoning appeals commission as well as Karpavich. The various parties have a January date to meet in Watertown Superior Court. Karpavich hopes the legal wrangling is done by this winter so he can install the turbine -- the town's first -- in the spring.\""It's been a tough fight,"" said Karpavich. ""But it's more of a crusade now.""\Credit: By Kristina Shevory, New York Times News Service"
345,"In Springfield, they either called it ""the ComEd bill"" or the ""smart grid bill"": legislation hundreds of pages long outlining a plan to modernize the state's 100-year-old electrical grid.\Large chunks of that legislation, however, have little to do with the smart grid, which is the term used to describe an automated, interactive and computerized electrical grid.\Instead, much of the law is devoted to overhauling the regulatory system that decides electric rate hikes for consumers -- changes that mean millions of dollars per year to Commonwealth Edison Co. In the utility's battle to override Gov. Pat Quinn's veto of the legislation, the bill gained support through additions that addressed specific concerns of legislators, environmental groups and business leaders.\For their efforts, ComEd gained regulatory changes that ultimately mean yearly rate hikes for consumers and faster financial returns for the Chicago-based Exelon Corp. subsidiary. The utility says the efficiencies gained from the new system will ultimately mean cheaper rates for consumers.\The $3.2 billion statewide build-out of the smart grid will begin next year. ComEd said it will likely take 10 years to complete its portion, and its 5.4 million customers will be charged an additional $3 per month to pay for the infrastructure during that time period; Ameren customers will be charged an additional $3.40 a year.\What follows is a look at lesser-known provisions that helped ComEd win votes it needed to turn the legislation into law.\North Shore outages\Following summer storms that left thousands of homes in Chicago's northern suburbs in the dark, legislators fought to force ComEd to improve power reliability.\A consortium of northwest suburbs, representing 1.3 million people in 41 municipalities and one township in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties, sounded its opposition to the bill, calling for ""strong legislative action to hold ComEd to higher reliability and outage response standards.""\Legislators pushed to add concessions to the legislation through a so-called trailer bill, and ComEd held a series of meetings with suburban mayors promising a deal.\The result? A new provision promising to reduce outages in ComEd's northeast region by 20 percent or face a knock to its bottom line. According to Rep. Karen May, D-Highland Park, who pushed for the provision, it wasn't until midnight the night before the legislation passed that the suburbs agreed to withdraw their opposition to the bill.\If they hadn't, she said, she could not have supported the legislation.\""I feel good about having really made an imprint on the ComEd bill,"" May said.\The utility also needs to decrease outage frequency by 20 percent and duration by 15 percent across its territory or face financial penalties. But storms won't count. Under the new law, ComEd is not responsible for outages that stem from the nine largest storms in a given year -- defined as any weather event that knocks out power to 10,000 customers for more than 3 hours.\""There's no way that any storm is going to interfere with them getting their rate of return,"" said Paul Neilan, a Chicago-based energy attorney.\Efficiency measures\To win over environmental groups, crafters of the legislation added provisions to help increase energy efficiency and renewables in ComEd's territory.\The deal created an unusual schism among environmental groups. Some supported the governor's veto in anticipation of a larger bill aimed at creating an overarching energy policy for the state. Others sided with ComEd.\The Sierra Club, for one, changed sides in support of the legislation and got the backing of the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environment Illinois.\Among provisions added:\* Net metering: Large rooftop owners can install wind and solar power, sell excess power back to the grid and receive credits on their electricity bills.\* Distributed generation: About 1 percent of renewable energy procured in Illinois will come from small-scale renewable energy projects.\* Energy efficiency: Instead of procuring megawatts of electricity, the state can procure so-called negawatts, a term used to describe energy that is removed from the grid by paying for energy efficiency programs. The bill increases the amount of negawatts the state can procure by 1.5 million negawatts, the equivalent of turning the lights out in 150,000 homes per year.\""This will be a huge boost to clean energy in Illinois,"" said Jack Darin, director of the Sierra Club, Illinois Chapter, after the General Assembly's veto override. ""By deploying solar energy across Illinois, we'll see new jobs and businesses, and cleaner air as we move away from dirty coal. A smarter power grid will also save consumers money by giving us new tools to manage our power consumption.""\Utility accountability\Legislators concerned that the formula-based rate approach proposed by ComEd would lead to ""automatic rate hikes,"" pushed for tougher provisions that would cut into the utility's bottom line if it failed to live up to certain standards.\Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, who crafted the trailer bill, added teeth that could be leveraged against the utilities. For example, his bill lowered the return on equity utilities would receive under a proposed regulatory overhaul, doubled penalties to utilities that don't deliver on promised jobs and required that Ameren withdraw a proposed rate hike submitted to the Illinois Commerce Commission.\Still, opponents said the bill still wasn't strong enough because it allowed for ""induced"" jobs -- a term that can include jobs created by ComEd's suppliers -- to count toward new job creation.\Paying for innovation\In one of several measures designed to win over the support of business leaders, including corporations, startups and community organizations, the bill establishes the ""Illinois Science and Energy Innovation Trust,"" to provide financial and technical support to public and private organizations for programs and projects that ""support, encourage or utilize innovative technologies and other methods of modernizing the state's electric grid.""\The trust, which will offer grants, loans and contracts to groups working on smart grid technology, will be overseen by a nine-member board set up to advise the utilities during smart grid deployment, along with one trustee from each of the utilities. A nonvoting trustee from the Clean Energy Trust is to give advice about early state investment in smart grid projects.\The trust's goal is be self-sustaining. But ComEd must contribute $15 million, which is an amount that cannot be reimbursed by charging consumers on their electricity bills, according to the law. Additionally, ComEd will contribute funds to the trust for consumer education programs, and 70 percent of that expense can be charged to consumers.\----------\jwernau@tribune.com\Twitter @littlewern\Credit: By Julie Wernau, Tribune reporter"
346,"Shawn Temple, a development director for Weston Solutions, said he has manufacturers, grocery chains and retailers interested in erecting solar panels along large swaths of abandoned industrial sites in Chicago.\""We have lots of clients and sites available,"" Temple said. \But those companies are building large-scale projects in other states because they can't make the math work in Illinois. \A glitch in the wording of a state law has prevented solar power from being purchased for Illinois electric customers even though they are paying into a fund for that purpose. What's more, the state has yet to create a market for trading renewable energy credits, vastly extending the time it takes for solar power producers to recoup construction costs. \No chief financial officer is going to sign off on a big solar project without financial incentives, Temple said. ""It needs to pass the CFO test."" \The incentives are especially crucial, given Illinois' lack of sunny days and low electricity prices. \As a result, virtually none of the power flowing to Illinois electricity customers comes from the sun, despite aggressive statewide mandates that require increasing the number of homes and businesses supplied with renewable energy such as solar. \So far, $53 million has been paid into a fund by Illinois electricity customers. But the law allows the money to only be spent at the same time that power is being purchased for Commonwealth Edison and Ameren Illinois customers. But those utilities have more power than they need because most of their customers fled for cheaper alternative suppliers. \So the pot of money just sits. \A legislative fix would allow the agency that procures power to spend that money on behalf of all Illinois electricity users, regardless of whether they remain with their legacy utility. The fix was expected last week but was postponed after the Illinois Competitive Energy Association, a lobby arm of alternative energy suppliers, claimed that such a move would drive up electricity prices. \Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, who is sponsoring the legislation that would fix the law, said last week that the issue will be taken up after the veto session. \Illinois patterned its renewable energy market after New Jersey, a state that has made up for its dearth of sunshine and low electricity prices by paying well for renewable energy credits. \""On paper we have great incentive for people to invest in solar here,"" said Sarah Wochos, senior policy advocate and director of research for the Environmental Law & Policy Center in Chicago. ""But there's some structural flaws in the mechanics of the law right now that make it impossible for those investments and that growth to happen here."" \In the meantime, experts say, solar development in Illinois has been the exception rather than the rule. \""These are customers that really wanted to make it work in Illinois for one reason or another that went beyond the pure economics of the project,"" said Madeleine Klein, senior vice president of policy and strategy for solar rooftop developer SoCore Energy, a subsidiary of Edison International. \For example, SoCore Energy developed two of the state's largest rooftop solar panel installations, at Ikea stores in Bolingbrook and Schaumburg. The main reason for those projects is that Ikea is committed to having solar panels at its stores. Klein said about 90 percent of its stores have solar panels. \Ikea's projects also illustrate why the state is behind on solar installations. \In Illinois, Ikea's return on its solar investment could take decades, compared with only three years if the same project were hypothetically launched in a sunny state like Hawaii, said Jason Keyes, partner at law firm Keyes, Fox & Wiedman LLP and an attorney for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. \In Hawaii, the cost of a typical residential solar installation has dropped from about $40,000 four years ago to about $26,000 today, according to Brad Albert, owner of Rising Sun Solar, a solar installer in Hawaii. Federal and state tax exemptions further reduce the cost to about $12,100. \As a result, companies have popped up that pay for the solar installation for businesses and homes, and they make a profit selling the cheaper electricity back to the solar panel hosts. So much solar energy is flowing into Hawaii's electrical grid that the incumbent utility has refused to accept any more solar power along certain parts of its system. \""Three years ago, people installing solar were wealthy and had big homes, wanted to save money, but really, the big thing for them was being green. But now it has shifted. People are doing it just for the sake of saving money. And they're saving from day one,"" Keyes said. \Illinois solar power producers tend to be green enthusiasts, and their projects relatively small. \Shedd Aquarium last month announced the installation of 913 rooftop solar panels. The $1.1 million project, paid for with public and private money, is part of the aquarium's goal to cut its energy use in half by 2020. \For Shedd, which can afford a long payback period, the project fit with its sustainability goals. \""We're very proud to be able to have these solar panels on our roof, for lots of reasons,"" said Roger Germann, Shedd executive vice president. ""It's good for the environment. It's good for the bottom line, and we have a unique ability to tell the story and use this installation as a road map for others."" \Shedd's solar panels are projected to produce 300,000 to 400,000 kilowatt-hours per year and shave $25,000 to $30,000 annually from its electricity bill. Shedd officials would like to quadruple on-site renewable energy generation and possibly partner with the Adler Planetarium and the Field Museum to produce power for the entire museum campus. \A billing mechanism called ""net metering"" allows Shedd, Ikea and residential customers to run their meters backward when they produce more electricity than they consume. \But if Shedd or Ikea could offset the cost of installing the solar panels by selling their renewable energy credits to Illinois electricity customers as was intended under a 2007 law, the aquarium would have money coming in that could be used to install more panels, Germann said. \The credits, which vary by state, are based on power production. Renewable energy producers receive one ""credit"" for each megawatt-hour produced. New Jersey credits last month traded at $135; Washington, D.C., credits traded at $485 last month, according to SREC Market Monitor. \At 300 megawatt-hours per year, that could bulk up Shedd's annual revenue from those panels by $40,500 if the credits traded at prices similar to New Jersey's, and to $145,500 per year if the credits traded similar to Washington, D.C., prices. \Without a market for the credits in Illinois, there's no incentive to develop big solar projects, said SoCore's Klein. \Solar panels capable of powering 6,200 suburban homes are installed in Illinois, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, which is about how much the state needs to meet its 2013 goals. But only about half of those solar credits are being purchased to meet the state's renewable energy goals, according to the Illinois Power Agency. \The problem is only expected to get worse. To meet increasing state goals, Illinois will need to increase its solar purchases tenfold by June 2014, according to an analysis by the Environmental Law & Policy Center, and by 2015, purchase credits from solar installations capable of powering about 89,000 homes, or nearly 30 times its current solar purchases. \To meet those goals, the state is not allowed to increase electricity rates more than 2 percent in any given year from 2007 rates. \""We work with big retailers and the (real estate investment trusts) that are landlords to the big retailers. In addition to Walgreens and Ikea, we work with Target, Simon Properties, movie theaters. Our customers are part of this group of folks like Kohl's and Costco who want to build solar,"" Klein said. ""In Illinois, low power prices and no incentives don't paint the right picture for them."" \The price for the credits would be set through a bidding process. \The Illinois Power Agency, which procures electricity on behalf of Illinois consumers, would open the doors for solar developers to bid in their solar credits. In turn, the agency would choose which credits to buy. \For smaller power producers, the agency would offer a flat rate. The agency said it could not speculate on prices for an upcoming procurement that would occur next year if the law is fixed. \Harmon said he is confident the legislature will approve his bill. \""Certainly, as in every compromise, nobody is getting everything that they want. But this is a sensible solution. We have a general consensus,"" he said. \In a statement, Exelon Corp., the Chicago-based parent of ComEd, said it will wait until a final legislative proposal is available before commenting. \For some time, environmental groups have clamored for the law to be tweaked to free up money to buy credits and power from producers of renewable energy. But the legislature has backed off under pressure from ComEd and Exelon, which have contended that the law is working as planned. \But as of June, about 5 percent of Illinois' electricity came from renewable sources, including wind power, reported an Environmental Law & Policy Center analysis of publicly available state data. That's short of the 8 percent target mandated under the law. \Solar, like wind power, is seen as a threat to traditional electric generators, who lose money when businesses and residential customers start generating their own power instead of purchasing it from the electricity grid. \Utilities across the country have pushed for laws to charge monthly fees to customers who generate their own electricity or have capped the amount of solar electricity that can be generated to offset electricity bills. \The Edison Electric Institute, an industry group for shareholder-owned electric companies, said in a January report that traditional utilities have lost less than 1 percent of their typical electricity load to solar electricity producers, but that the trend will grow as solar costs plummet. \""Investors have no desire to sit by and watch as disruptive forces slice away at the value and financial prospects of their investment,"" the institute said in the report. \---------- \jwernau@tribune.com \Twitter @littlewern\Credit: By Julie Wernau, Tribune reporter"
347,"Bill will attract jobs, help environment\At a clean energy summit Wednesday in Chicago, I'll speak to business leaders considering investment opportunities in clean energy -- one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in Illinois. At the forefront of many of these executives' minds will be what, exactly, is happening with business-friendly energy policies in Springfield?\Of the energy bills currently under consideration, only one -- the Clean Jobs Bill, legislation I'm co-sponsoring -- will save consumers $1.8 billion, attract new capital and investment to Illinois and create 32,000 new jobs.\The bill requires utilities to invest in all cost-effective energy efficiency measures. This helps all of us cut energy waste, so we can do more with less. The Clean Jobs Bill also fixes and strengthens the Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS.\The RPS ensures we get a certain portion of our energy from clean, renewable resources like wind and solar. The Clean Jobs Bill would strengthen the RPS so that by 2030, we'll source 35 percent of our energy from renewables.\The bill also directs the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to develop a market-based approach for meeting the standards in the federal Clean Power Plan. This common-sense plan reduces carbon pollution from power plants, while triggering investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy and offering vulnerable consumers much-needed assistance with utility bills.\According to a report released by Environmental Entrepreneurs and other business groups, clean energy companies of all sizes employ more than 104,000 people in Illinois, with a 15-month growth rate of nearly 8 percent. That's more than accounting and real estate combined.\Clean energy saves us all money and creates good jobs. To give businesses the kind of market certainty they need to continue to invest in Illinois, our legislature and governor must pass the Clean Jobs Bill.\State Rep. Elaine Nekritz\Evanston"

349,"Five years ago, Illinois passed legislation requiring electric suppliers to buy more renewable energy such as wind and solar power and then pass those costs on to customers.\The intent of the mandate was to have so-called green electricity accounting for a quarter of the power flowing into residences and businesses by 2025 while fostering homegrown jobs and cleaner air. \But that was before customers of the state's two major electric utilities defected en masse to other suppliers that purchase power on the open market. With that move, the state is falling short of its green mandate, because money being collected from customers by these other energy suppliers isn't being used for green energy purchases. \Instead, the money is going into a fund that's sitting untapped because of obscure language in state law. \That $15 million account is on track to balloon to nearly $135 million by the end of 2014, according to the Illinois Power Agency, the state agency tasked with spending the funds. \Because of the language in the law, the agency can only use the money to buy renewable energy if the state's two utilities are out buying renewable energy at the same time. With only a fraction of their customer bases left, the utilities already have more renewable energy than they need and aren't buying more. \As a result, the money sits, although at one point the cash-strapped state borrowed the entire amount from the fund then repaid the money. Overall, about two-thirds of the state's electric customers are paying into a renewable-energy fund that isn't being used. \""It really doesn't make sense to have all this money being spent by consumers and then have them not getting anything for it,"" said David Kolata, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. ""We'd like to think that this can all be resolved."" \In June, about 5 percent of the state's electricity will come from renewable sources, according to an Environmental Law and Policy Center analysis of publicly available state data. That's short of the 8 percent target mandated under the law, and amounts to about 4.7 million megawatt hours, enough to power half a million homes for one year. \Environmental groups are clamoring to tweak the law to free up those funds but face resistance from nuclear plant owner Chicago-based Exelon and its utility, Commonwealth Edison. They contend the law is working as intended. \Some take issue with that notion. \""The point of the law is to create an environment in which renewable energy can flourish in Illinois, so that we can get cleaner air, economic development and be competitive with states around us,"" said Barry Matchett, co-legislative director and policy advocate for the Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center. ""While we were able to achieve those goals for the last few years -- the renewable energy industry created 19,000 jobs in Illinois in the last five years alone -- unless the law is fixed, we won't see much, if any, more solar or wind energy built in Illinois."" \Consumer advocates contend that not spending the fund's money is costly for consumers. The Illinois Power Agency said new wind farms have driven down power prices overall by about $177 million each of the last two years. Consumer advocates said greater savings might be achieved with even more renewable power nurtured in Illinois. \""This is a problem that needs to be fixed to protect consumers. Consumers are paying money into this fund for the purpose of procuring renewable energy. And if the fund is used as intended, that will clearly save money for consumers,"" said Natalie Bauer, a spokeswoman for the state's attorney general's office. \The fact that the renewable fund isn't being spent and that the money is dependent on consumers who can freely switch back and forth between electricity suppliers at any time has already caused some wind and solar power developers to back off on projects. \""We don't like unstable markets,"" said Jeff Bishop, senior manager for government and regulatory affairs at EDP Renewables North America, a Houston-based wind power developer. His firm has paused on $1 billion of near shovel-ready projects in Illinois that his company spent more than a decade developing. \""We need the finance community to feel confident with the project's long-term prospects,"" said Bishop, whose company has already spent $1.5 billion building wind farms in Illinois. He said the renewable portfolio standard, the law that mandates how much electricity will come from renewable sources, worked well until customers started defecting from ComEd and Ameren, which serves the southern part of the state. \If the money remains unspent, the state is expected to slip further behind in meeting its green electricity mandate. By 2017, just 7 percent of Illinois electricity is projected to come from renewable resources, a little more than half the mandate of 13 percent set for that year under the law, according to an Environmental Law and Policy Center analysis. \""The IPA needs additional authority to spend those funds as the General Assembly intended,"" said Anthony Star, the agency's acting director. \As it now stands, most of the state's renewable energy mandates are met through the purchase of energy credits, sold through a market-based system that supports existing wind farms in Illinois and surrounding states. \If more funds were available along with a larger customer base to spread out costs, said David Fein, a vice president of state government affairs at Exelon, consumers could be forced into the pricier ""power purchase agreements"" that help finance new wind farms. Before a wind farm is built, the agreements force electricity customers to promise that they will purchase 100 percent of the power a wind farm is expected to produce. \With a guaranteed ""customer"" for their power over the long term, wind developers are able to persuade investors to sign on to the projects, but the agreements are more costly for consumers than the energy credits that support existing wind farms. \Exelon, which owns and operates the country's largest fleet of nuclear power generating units, created a stir last year when the American Wind Energy Association booted it from its membership over Exelon's lobbying to end tax credits for the wind industry, viewed by people in that industry as crucial to continued growth. The company said it no longer felt the country should be subsidizing wind generation development. Those lobbying efforts failed. \Christopher Crane, Exelon's chief executive, has said tax credits keep electric wind turbines producing power even when there is no demand for it, driving down the prices Exelon receives for power from its nuclear plants. Exelon's earnings have been battered as power prices have fallen. The company swung to a $4 million loss, down a penny per share in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $200 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. \With fewer customers available to spread out the companies' costs for long-term renewable energy contracts, ComEd and Ameren are bumping up against a legislative cap that prevents renewable energy purchases from increasing rates by more than 2 percent. \In ComEd's territory, the utility is charging its customers the maximum allowed under the law for renewable purchases, or about 92 cents per month on average. Customers who receive their electricity supply from ComEd pay into an account the utility spends. \The untapped funds are in a separate account supported primarily by former ComEd and Ameren customers who defected to other suppliers. These other suppliers meet about half their green obligations by buying renewable energy on the open market and the other half through ""alternative compliance payments"" that flow into the account. \When consumers began switching to other suppliers, ComEd and Ameren's prices were significantly higher than those offered by other suppliers. Recently, those prices have fallen, and policymakers are waiting to see if consumers begin to switch back, which could change everything from how much money is available to buy renewable power to how much that power would cost. \In the ComEd territory, 79 percent of the electricity it delivers comes from other suppliers, according to the Illinois Commerce Commission, compared with 27 percent in 2007. \Mark Pruitt, a former Illinois Power Agency director and an adviser to Chicago for electricity issues, said customers of the other suppliers are overpaying for renewables because the law forces them to pay the same rates for renewable energy that utility customers are paying. Utility customers are paying the maximum amount because they are oversubscribed on renewables due to so many customers defecting. \Assuming consumers don't switch back to ComEd or Ameren, and the law isn't changed, Illinois electricity customers will pay $280 million more for renewable energy between 2014 to 2017 than they would have if all customers paid into a single account, said Pruitt, who analyzed utility projections for electricity purchases provided to the Illinois Power Agency. \Senate Bill 103, sponsored by Sen. Michael Frerichs, D-Champaign, proposes channeling all money for renewable energy into a single utility-controlled account with the Illinois Power Agency procuring all renewable energy on behalf of all Illinois electricity customers. The move, advocates say, would lower prices for all consumers by spreading out the costs. \The agency remains neutral on the legislation but acknowledged that the state is not meeting its mandates for renewable energy. \ComEd opposes the bill. \""There is no reason to reform the RPS (renewable portfolio standard) law, and the proposed changes would significantly increase costs to ComEd customers,"" ComEd spokeswoman Judith Rader said. She said that, since the law was enacted, ""Illinois has seen a major build-out of wind energy: Our state is now the fourth-largest producer of wind energy in the country."" \Gov. Pat Quinn supports the bill. \Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman for his office, said: ""There is no reason for having two Illinois renewable portfolio standards when there is only one Illinois energy market. This is a common-sense solution that will deliver lower energy prices for consumers and businesses, protect the environment, and drive more economic development and new jobs across Illinois. \""Meeting our renewable portfolio standard's goals will not only be good for our environment; it will also support the state's economic recovery and give families a financial break from rising utility rates."" \---------- \jwernau@tribune.com \Twitter @littlewern\Credit: By Julie Wernau, Tribune reporter"

Although Illinois was unaffected by the blackouts last summer, the catastrophic failure of the power grid offers several lessons for how Illinois, and the rest of the country, can avoid similar blackouts in the future. Simply put, we need more reliable energy.
\
Illinois needs more distributed generation, which is a term used to describe smaller-scale power generation, such as combined heat and power, solar energy, and wind energy. Distributed generation is commonly used by hospitals, universities and industrial facilities as both a primary and backup form of energy. While these facilities are connected to the grid, their ability to generate their own power reduces demand on the grid and improves power reliability, both for the individual facility and for all other power customers.
\
Wind and solar energies are examples of distributed generation and can lighten the grid load effectively and efficiently.
\
In order to advance distributed generation, Illinois needs a Renewable Portfolio Standard, which would require a certain percentage of energy generated to come from renewable sources. An RPS bill, which is currently being considered in the Illinois Senate, would take pressure off the grid, while benefiting the Illinois economy and environment at the same time.
\
Distributed generation needs to be a priority in Illinois energy development, and we need to follow the lead of other states and begin developing renewable energy.

351,"Coaching is Antonio Maestranzi’s renewed purpose, the former Bartlett and Northern Illinois basketball player said Wednesday.\Maestranzi, 33, will be the next boys basketball coach at Rockford Guilford High School, pending approval of the Rockford School Board, RPS District 205 announced.\""I’m unbelievably excited,"" said Maestranzi, who intends to relocate from Bartlett to Rockford. ""I definitely have a passion to coach. The past couple of years I’ve been doing some AAU and training with some high school players. I just have a real passion for coaching at that level. This is the age and this is the level where you can influence kids the most. I feel like I have a good ability to coach because of my experience. It’s what I want to do long term for the rest of my life. It gives me purpose and I have a real passion to do it.""\Known as Anthony when he was named honorary captain of the 2001-02 Daily Herald All-Area Boys Basketball Team/Fox Valley, Maestranzi went on to play for coach Rob Judson and assistant Carl Armato at NIU. He finished a four-year college career with 166 3-pointers, good for fourth on the Huskies’ all-time list.\Undrafted out of NIU, the 5-foot-9 point guard was approached by an agent who got him into an exposure camp for the Italian Basketball Federation.\Maestranzi traveled to Italy, landed a two-month contract and played well enough to earn two more months.\A good season led to a contract for another. Then another. In all, he played six years in Italy for four teams between 2006-2012.\Upon returning to the United States, he went to work for his family’s knife sharpening business in Schaumburg: A. Maestranzi Sons Knife Services.\Meanwhile, he began working for a development program for elite Chicago-area players and became an assistant varsity coach at Marmion.\Last year, he became a full-time AAU coach, following in the footsteps of his father, John Maestranzi, who helped develop several Division-I players as coach of the Illinois Wildcats, including Illinois guard Dee Brown and former Villanova guard Scottie Reynolds.\Last year’s AAU season was Antonio Maestranzi’s first as a head coach. He directed the Kessel Heat U-16 team to a successful campaign.\When the Guilford job opened after an 11-17 finish in 2017-18, Maestranzi was given the heads up by Armato, a Guilford assistant who will remain an assistant under Maestranzi.\""Coach Maestranzi brings a lot of enthusiasm and excitement to this position,"" Guilford High School athletic director Augie Toldo said. ""He’s hungry to help rebuild the program with our students on the court, in the weight room, in the classroom and community.""\Guilford’s new head coach said his lack of sideline experience will be mitigated by a strong understanding of what goes on between the lines.\""I have a unique background because I got to play at a high level overseas. It’s high-level basketball,"" Maestranzi said. ""They use a lot of spacing and things of that nature. I’m grateful I have an opportunity to implement that stuff with these kids.\""But our No. 1 focus is going to be the culture, how we do things, our work ethic and our leadership qualities. I want to build an environment that develops young men on and off the court. That’s number one. We want to create an environment where players have a better chance to succeed on and off the court because they were involved with our program. I believe this is a platform to develop kids and prepare them for life, business, relationships, college, all of the above. With that focus we’re going to make them hard workers, mentally tough, and we’re going to build leaders. I believe success comes as a result of focusing on those things.""\CREDIT: By Jerry Fitzpatrick jfitzpatrick@dailyherald.com"

CHAMPAIGN - Champaign County's planning and zoning director is urging rejection of a proposal to extend the life of the joint Champaign-Champaign County enterprise zone. In a memo to Champaign County Board members, Frank DiNovo is recommendingthat the county reject, for now, the city of Champaign's request to extend the term of the enterprise zone from 2006 to 2016. Instead, DiNovo urges that the county board wait on the issue until the county has had an opportunity to evaluate the zone'seffectiveness at attracting industry. Meanwhile, city and local economic development officials are arguing that the enterprise zone is a critical economic development tool that, if lost, would put the area at an economic disadvantage. In a writtenmemo to the county board, DiNovo noted that in fiscal 2000, the county provided $181,000 in property tax abatements in its two joint enterprise zones in Champaign and Urbana. Since the zones were established in the mid-1980s, the county has providedmore than $1 million in tax relief to companies and individuals that build in the enterprise zone, he wrote. DiNovo said he calculated the cost of the incentives himself with the help of the county clerk's office. Nowhere do they appear in thecounty's budget, he said. ""These incentives don't appear in the budget,"" DiNovo said. ""Nobody tracks the cost, but as far as taxpayers are concerned, the effect is the same - their taxes are higher than they otherwise would be."" If the county didn'toffer the incentives, the owner of a $150,000 home would pay $4.55 less on a property tax bill, DiNovo said. Nearly a penny of the county's overall property tax rate of 61 cents per $100 of assessed valuation is attributable to the enterprise zoneincentives, he said. ""What we are doing is shifting the tax burden to farm and residential,"" DiNovo said. ""That is the net effect. Somebody has got to make up the difference."" DiNovo said there are a number of economic studies nationally thatquestion the effectiveness of enterprise zones. The issue will come before the county board's Environment and Land Use Committee at 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Brookens Administrative Center, 1776 E. Washington St., U. Specifically, the committee isbeing asked to endorse or reject extending the life of the Champaign-Champaign County enterprise zone for 10 more years, though 2016, and also to expand the zone by another 167 acres to include the northern part of developer Clint Atkins' ApolloSubdivision industrial park. In the enterprise zone, the city, county and Champaign Park District provide 100 percent property tax abatements on the increase in assessed value for industrial projects and for five years for commercial projects. Inaddition, building materials used for those projects are exempt from sales taxes and the state provides other incentives. DiNovo's stand puts him at odds with a number of local economic development officials. A top city official, a local developerand the executive director of the Champaign County Economic Development Corp. all argue that the enterprise zone is effective and is one of the few economic development tools at the disposal of local officials. Jill Guth, executive director of theeconomic development corporation, said that Illinois, in comparison to neighboring states, offers fewer incentives for companies considering locating here. That makes local incentives tremendously important, she said. ""Many of these prospects orsuspects we're looking at, one of the first things they want to know is if we have an enterprise zone,"" Guth said. ""There are 94 of them (enterprise zones) in Illinois. I'm working on a couple major local expansions and the enterprise zone is a majorcomponent of the incentive package we're exploring with those companies."" Craig Rost, Champaign's deputy manager for development, said that the biggest incentives for companies looking to establish a local plant are state incentives that are availableonly at sites located in an enterprise zone. Those state incentives include investment tax credits, job training credits, a utility tax exemption for companies with more than 200 jobs and a state 5 percent sales tax exemption for machinery andequipment. ""We've created this playing field where most municipalities have the enterprise zone,"" Rost said. ""Somebody who doesn't have the zone is at a disadvantage. If our zone has a short life, a place like Decatur might have an advantage."" TheChampaign- Champaign County enterprise zone covers 8 square miles and includes most of the city's nonresidential areas, including Interstate Research Park, some of the Apollo Subdivision, an area near the junction of interstates 57 and 74, the MarketStreet industrial area, the industrial portions of West Springfield Avenue and a large part of Campustown. Mark Dixon, director of real estate for The Atkins Group, also argues that many companies ""won't even consider a location without an enterprisezone."" Dixon said the Champaign- Champaign County enterprise zone was a factor in helping to secure Rockwell Automation, formerly the Allen-Bradley Co., and Fed Ex Ground, formerly RPS, which combined employ nearly 1,000 people. ""Every one of thoseemployees buys cars, buys homes and buys groceries in the county,"" he said. ""The ripple effect does help the community."" County board Chairwoman Patricia Avery, D-Champaign, said she thinks further study is a good idea. ""It's starting to concern methat we are chipping away at our tax base,"" she said. ""Maybe we ought to examine it a little more closely."" DiNovo makes no recommendation on the proposed expansion of the enterprise zone to add part of the Apollo subdivision, except to note that theproposed expansion does not comply with a 1995 county board resolution. That resolution said expansions of the zone should occur for specific projects and if the company is not in significant direct competition in the local market with any existingcounty firm. DiNovo said the county board has ignored that resolution, however, in previous expansions of the enterprise zone.
