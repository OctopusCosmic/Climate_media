0,"Here we go again. Some Republican legislators want to snap a short leash on the state Department of Environmental Quality, reauthorizing it only for a short time - and with several conditions.\They can't abolish ADEQ, lest the federal Environmental Protection Agency step in with even stricter standards.\But a House-Senate committee now recommends the department - set to expire July 1 - be reauthorized for just two years, rather than the usual 10-year renewals for state agencies.\ADEQ is responsible for protecting air and water quality in Arizona. It also tests auto emissions, issues permits where pollution may be generated and cleans up contamination from leaking fuel storage tanks.\But some legislators want the department to play ""Mother may I"" - requesting legislative permission before it could, for example, work to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\The Western Climate Initiative, with seven governors (including those from Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and California) and four Canadian premiers, initiated a cap-and-trade program.\It limits carbon dioxide emissions from power plants but lets producers trade their emissions allowances.\Arizona's version was enacted in 2006 by order of Gov. Janet Napolitano. But some legislators say cap-and-trade is a virtual tax, and they want legislative approval required before such environmental efforts can be made.\Earlier this year, Napolitano vetoed legislation that would have required such approval.\These same lawmakers also question whether ADEQ issues permits fast enough, especially for uranium mines in northern Arizona, and whether some projects were appropriate when added to environmental lawsuit settlements.\But in pushing for less environmental oversight and more instantaneous green lights for industries, these Republicans are missing a key point.\Arizonans want clean air and clean water. Tourism depends on it. Luring new businesses to Arizona depends on it. Indeed, our very lives depend on it, as do the lives of our children and grandchildren.\These elected officials will not win kudos for their efforts to hamstring this regulatory agency, thus allowing environmental quality to be grossly degraded.\Even Republicans can have asthmatic children, an aversion to tainted water and a desire to ensure that Arizona's environment is pristine.\We strongly urge the Legislature to not only renew the Department of Environmental Quality for the full 10 years, but also to lend it full support and encouragement to continue keeping Arizona's air and water clean and safe - for all of our sakes.\Asthma and sickness from tainted water know no partisan bounds: Even Republican voters want a clean environment."

2,"It's the question visitors to Arizona ask often when the subject is sustainability: With so much sunshine and so much empty land -- and empty rooftops -- where's all the solar power?\The quickest explanation is cost. Building solar power plants is expensive and would spike electricity bills in a state where prices are comparatively low. Rooftop panels also have high up-front costs.\In a sustainable world, individuals and businesses would accept at least part of the added cost as the price of finding a lasting balance between the need for energy and the benefits to the environment of renewable resources.\Some people already have accepted the cost and converted to clean energy. But regulatory hurdles and practical obstacles remain.\And even a clean energy source like solar power isn't sustainable if it disrupts the economy and excludes customers who can't afford it. That's why utilities are exploring a wider mix of sources, including wind, geothermal and biomass.\As the big power providers work to assemble that mix, many of the advances in renewable energy are occurring at the grassroots level.\...\Energy: Install an Energy Star thermostat and you could save up to 500 pounds of carbon emissions per year.\...\At the base of the White Mountains just outside Snowflake, a biomass power plant went online this month, cranking up toward an expected output of 24 megawatts, or enough for about 9,000 homes.\That's not much in a state with growing electricity demands, but on the day it went live, the plant became Arizona's largest single source of renewable energy other than hydroelectric dams.\On a scarred ridge above Heber, work crews gather the fuel for the plant: skeletons of trees charred by the 2001 Rodeo-Chediski Fire.\Although too damaged for timber companies, the trees still hold biomass, material that can be burned to make steam to turn power turbines. That potential caught the interest of entrepreneur Robert Worsley, who wanted to build a renewable-energy operation on land he owned in the White Mountains.\""We're all about BTUs,"" said Scott Higginson, a vice president at Tempe-based Renegy Holdings, which built the plant. ""All the wood here is biomass,"" he said, dragging his finger through the air on a ridge above a fire-ravaged patch of ground. ""There's nothing left to salvage for timber or even wood shavings.""\Renegy will work to clear thousands of acres charred by the fire, but the bulk of its fuel will come from green forest areas being thinned under a Forest Service plan to protect communities from future fires.\The plant was built next to a recycled paper mill operated by the Canadian company Catalyst. The operation recycles paper products, mostly trucked up from Phoenix, and produces newsprint. Renegy will add waste from the process to its biomass fuel mix, making the plant that much more sustainable.\Without the plant, the Forest Service would burn much of the green waste cleared from the forests, releasing carbon and other pollutants, or allow the materials to decompose, releasing methane. Renegy says it will remove almost every trace of pollutant as the biomass burns. Arizona Public Service Co. and Salt River Project have agreed to buy the plant's output.\...\Air-conditioning: A room air conditioner too big for the room it's trying to cool will actually perform less efficiently than one designed for the space.\...\In 2007, the Arizona Corporation Commission adopted one of the nation's most aggressive renewable energy standards, requiring regulated utilities to produce or buy 15 percent of their power needs from renewable sources by 2025.\The new rules also will push clean energy, mostly solar , deeper into the private sector.\Of the 15 percent renewable power mandated by the commission, 30 percent must come from distributed solar, systems installed on rooftops. The commission estimates that the requirement will lead to 5,500 new rooftop arrays in 2009 and 9,125 new systems in 2010.\""That was very deliberate,"" said commissioner Kris Mayes, who helped develop the standards. ""We wanted people throughout the state to benefit.""\The rooftop rules are likely to help small companies that can help homeowners figure out how residential systems work and could spur ground-level efforts to cut costs.\Already, several upstart companies have landed in the state with offers to lease rooftop arrays to contain costs.\Businesses that can take advantage of incentives, scale and a long payoff period will likely lead the way, Mayes said.\""It makes good sense for them,"" she said. ""This is a way to shield themselves against what's coming.""\What's coming is government action to curb global warming, whether it's a direct carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program that would cap smokestack emissions then allow cleaner-burning companies to trade pollution credits with those that exceed limits.\Either option will likely push energy costs higher, turning expensive solar projects into more affordable alternatives.\...\Computers: You can save 40 watt-hours per day by turning your computer completely off instead of leaving it in sleep mode. That adds up to 4 cents a day.\...\Cost remains a high hurdle for people who seek sustainable alternatives. Solar energy comes with a steep up-front cost, from tens of thousands of dollars for homeowners to millions of dollars for businesses that want to install systems.\Lee Feliciano thinks he can help larger businesses take their first sustainable steps into solar power. A former solar-system installer, Feliciano started SolEquity as a way to finance solar projects and get big rooftops wired for the sun sooner.\He packages deals that let businesses go solar and then his company keeps the incentives and tax credits in return. Most of his customers will spend $1 million or more on the projects.\""With solar and with wind, as renewable energy, 90 percent of your costs or more is front-loaded,"" he said. ""There are not a lot of people with that sort of long-term perspective. Financing is the key to unlocking it.""\His deals work best in places where power costs already have risen. In California, with some of the most expensive electricity in the nation, it's relatively easy to finance a solar project that makes financial sense, one that probably wouldn't pencil out in Arizona.\""There's a two-word answer why that is,"" he said. ""Cheap electricity. Generally speaking, I think it's fair to say the price of electricity in California is double what it is in Arizona. If you compare the incentives given, they're not that far off. The real kicker is their electricity costs twice as much.""\If Congress fails to renew an important solar-energy tax credit this year, solar-energy conversion would slow to a crawl, at least until energy prices catch up to the cost of renewable systems.\...\Cleaning: We could save as much as 1% on national carbon emissions, and $3 billion in energy, if we all simply washed our clothes in cold water.\...\At the current price of electricity in Arizona, a residential or small-business solar array might not pay for itself for 15 or 20 years, even with tax credits and rebates. But utilities say they are seeing increasing numbers of rooftop projects, often in unexpected places.\Phoenix installed 732 peel-and-stick solar panels on the new downtown convention center, mostly as a teaching and learning tool. Arizona State University plans to blanket its campus buildings with solar panels.\""If we're going to meet the requirements, we'll need over 40,000 installations by 2012,"" said Barbara Lockwood, renewable energy manager for APS. She believes the most progress will come when homebuilders start offering solar panels as an option, just like granite countertops or upgraded carpet.\""The best way to get the rooftops is to be able to roll it into a mortgage,"" she said.\So far, homebuilders have been reluctant to offer solar panels as an option, but a few smaller companies have started to introduce the idea.\...\Cooking: Preheating your oven is usually unnecessary, except when baking bread or cookies. Just turn on the oven when you put the dish in.\...\Leon and Janet Hauk decided to retrofit their existing north Peoria home with a 5.2-kilowatt system, big enough to supply most of their electricity needs during cooler months and return some to the grid.\""I just got tired of paying the power bill and watching the cost of electricity go up,"" Janet said, flipping through summertime power bills under $40. ""Now, every time the rates go up, it means our system will be paid for that much sooner,"" Leon added.\The system cost about $14,000 after rebates and tax credits, but the Hauks have taken the advice of many solar-energy advocates who tell people to consider a solar array an investment and the electricity savings the return on that investment.\""It starts to pay for itself,"" said Mick Dalrymple, owner of a.k.a. Green in Scottsdale and a frequent sustainability evangelist. ""How many jet skis pay for themselves? You're getting free electricity. You're essentially buying insurance against higher energy prices.""\On the outside of the Hauks' home, APS installed a special electric meter with a digital arrow that points to the right when the house consumes power from the grid and to the left when it produces enough power to send it back out.\When power goes out onto the grid, the Hauks accumulate credits that they redeem during hotter months, when the air-conditioner uses more electricity than they can produce on the roof.\On a table inside, a monitor tells a more detailed story, keeping track of how much power the system has sent out and how much money the Hauks have saved in the two years since they installed the array. Those savings have topped $2,500.\""This is an asset,"" Janet said. ""I have Formica countertops, and I don't have wood floors. And what we have, we won't have to replace in 10 years. The cosmetic things go out of style. This doesn't.""\|\WHAT YOU CAN DO\green\Switch to compact fluorescent lightbulbs.\greener\Buy energy-efficient light fixtures and appliances.\greenest\Unplug small and large appliances and electronic equipment when not in use.\|\Making sustainable power\A clean-burning power plant in Snowflake is leading the way toward more sustainable energy.

At Northern Arizona University, chemistry Professor Stephanie Hurst is experimenting with cobalt as one way to capture light for solar power.\Cobalt is mined in the United States, making it more readily available than silicon. It is also cheaper than other light-absorbing materials, such as ruthenium, which can cost 60 times more than cobalt.\|\in their own words\THE REGULATOR: KRIS MAYES\Kris Mayes is a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission, the state's regulator of public utilities.\We're probably not going to be mothballing coal plants, but I just don't see a scenario where we'd build a new coal plant in Arizona. With Congress considering cap and trade (a system of limiting greenhouse-gas emissions), I don't see how a policy maker in his right mind could advocate a new coal plant.\I think we are just at that tipping point (for solar energy). We have to see whether people will put rooftop panels on, whether utilities will build plants.\My argument to individuals is (solar energy) is a shield. If you can put solar panels on your roof, do it now. We have been talking to home builders about making solar a choice, like granite countertops are.

3,"Arizona earned kudos in 2007 for helping to launch the Western Climate Initiative, a regional effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas pollution.\Now that progressive move is under attack by state Rep. Andy Biggs, the Gilbert Republican who last made headlines with his goofy insistence that good education systems don't bring a state more jobs.\Biggs now has proposed HB 2467, which would prohibit the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality from participating in the move to reduce greenhouse gas pollution.\Weirdly, the House Committee on the Environment voted Tuesday in favor of his anti-environment bill.\Biggs says the initiative's planned cap-and-trade program would drive up consumer energy costs by imposing new requirements on coal-fired electricity plants.\The program is creating a regional market whereby power plants and other entities that pollute too much would either reduce emissions or buy credits so they could exceed the caps.\But given the choice between a cleaner environment and slightly higher energy costs, many Arizonans likely would opt for cleaner air.\And that priority isn't limited to Arizonans.\Other participants in the cap-and-trade program of the Western Climate Initiative are New Mexico, Utah, California, Oregon, Montana and Washington, as well as the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.\The partners issued their design recommendations for the cap-and-trade program in September. The recommendations only now are being implemented.\Gov. Jan Brewer had told The Associated Press in December that she favored state involvement to ""see what we can do here in Arizona to address that issue."" But she also cited economic concerns and uncertainty about the cap-and-trade program.\Former Gov. Janet Napolitano launched Arizona's involvement without seeking legislative permission, a fact that miffed more than a few Republican lawmakers.\But the cap-and-trade program isn't some radical experiment. Such plans already are under way in established markets in the Northeast and Europe.\""It's ridiculous for Arizona to not have its leading environmental agency address the No. 1 environmental issue facing Arizona,"" notes Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon Chapter.\We agree.\Scientists say the Southwest will suffer more from global warming. Arizona needs to stay in this program and ensure that the regional effort to thwart greenhouse gas emissions succeeds - for the sake of our environment and all who breathe our air.\Our Opinion\The Southwest will be hit harder by climate change and Arizona needs to keep pushing to thwart it."
4,"GARY N. YAQUINTO\We are all painfully aware of the dramatic rise in energy prices. Its effect is felt most immediately at the gasoline pump every time we fill up.\Less obvious, but looming right around the corner, is a similar situation brewing in Arizona's electricity markets.\Over the past 10 years, the demand for electricity from Arizona's power producers increased by 41 percent, reflecting both increased population and rising per capita electricity usage.\Looking ahead, electricity demand in Arizona is projected to increase an additional 85 percent over the next 25 years.\Arizona power companies must build or acquire new capacity to meet the growing level of customer demand. Depending on the type of new generation facilities to be built, the total costs of adding generation, transmission and distribution facilities are projected at $65 billion to $77 billion through 2032.\If the cost of materials and labor to construct future power facilities continue to escalate faster than the overall rate of inflation (as it has over the past several years), the final bill could rise by another $10 billion or so.\Future efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions through market mechanisms such as cap and trade programs or carbon capture technologies will add even more to the price of electricity for the Salt River Project, Arizona Public Service Co. and Tucson Electric Power Co. - all of which rely on coal for a significant portion of their diversified fuel mix.\Rising demand for renewable sources of power will further place upward pressure on electricity prices as Arizona power companies seek to comply with renewable portfolio mandates.\The Arizona Investment Council commissioned Arizona State University consultants to undertake an extensive study of infrastructure needs over the next 25 years. One conclusion from the study is that the price of electricity in Arizona will need to increase annually at a rate greater than the general inflation rate to finance the cost of infrastructure necessary to meet Arizona's growing power needs.\This means for Arizona to secure its electricity future, prices will need to increase by 2.5 percent to 3.9 percent annually. It's not surprising that the three largest retail providers of electricity in Arizona each are seeking rate increases to cover the costs of constructing new infrastructure.\It's time our government, business leaders and citizens work together to address these important issues. If we don't begin planning for the future now, we face the prospect of power brownouts or blackouts, thus endangering our health and lifestyle and negatively impacting our economy.\Our policymakers must be forthright with consumers and tell them that the costs of investments to keep the lights on will be reflected in higher prices for power.\If necessary, they must construct appropriate safety nets for the most disadvantaged families. The CEOs of our power companies must think creatively about ways to meet our growing demand for power that reduces precipitous price increases.\Consumers must be willing to use energy more efficiently and alter consumption patterns. With capable leadership and collaboration at all levels, we can make the critical investments in essential energy infrastructure while mitigating the impact to consumers.\Working together and armed with good information and data, we can harmonize the economics of energy use and production with our environment.\Gary M. Yaquinto is president of the Arizona Investment Council (www.arizonaic.org)."
5,"As Congress delays work on a national climate-change bill and world leaders quash expectations for an international pact, a once-growing movement to address global warming at a state level has hit its own walls.\Three regional coalitions, formed out of frustration during the Bush administration, are pushing ahead with plans to control the greenhouse-gas emissions widely blamed for rising global temperatures. But their efforts still add up to a patchwork solution derided as either too little or too much.\On the global stage, hundreds of scientists and world leaders, including President Barack Obama, will gather Dec. 7-18 in Copenhagen, Denmark, for the United Nations Climate Change Conference. The goal is to produce a treaty that would reduce global-warming pollution. But as the largest countries, including the United States, struggle to settle the same issues within their own borders, the more likely outcome is a broad outline on how to achieve an agreement.\The core issues, at all levels: Should the government try to control greenhouse-gas emissions or allow the market to regulate itself? Who would pay for a government-run program? And would a regional or a national program make a difference if the rest of the world failed to participate?\The U.S. House passed a climate-change bill in June that would cap greenhouse-gas emissions across the country and create a national system to sell and trade pollution credits. A Senate version has made little progress.\Of the three state coalitions, just one has started its work trying to limit greenhouse gases. That group, based in the Northeast, has met with mixed results and struggled to measure progress amid the recession.\A second group of states, in the upper Midwest, is still hashing out the basic design of its cap-and-trade program to limit carbon emissions.\And the third group, founded in 2007 by Arizona, New Mexico, California and other Western states, is nearing its first self-imposed work deadlines amid unanswered questions, including whether the states should wait for Congress to act or if states should even try to fight a global problem.\The group, known as the Western Climate Initiative, comprises seven states and four Canadian provinces. It is fighting politics, vocal critics, massive state budget deficits and, at times, its own ambitions. But even its more reserved supporters say the group can still help the states confront climate and energy issues.\""As a state, we have to stay engaged,"" said Benjamin Grumbles, director of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. ""We may disagree sometimes, and we do. We have robust discussions. But we can focus on practical and pragmatic solutions that can green and grow Arizona's economy.""\Instigating change\The states originally banded together in the regional coalitions when it became clear that former President George W. Bush opposed any significant attempts to control greenhouse gases. The mantra among the states was ""If the federal government won't act, we will.""\""We've been the innovators; we've been the laboratories,"" said Pete Grannis, commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and a leader in the Northeast-based Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\""We recognize the imperative of a strong federal cap on emissions,"" he said. ""But it's very important as we move forward that our efforts not be pre-empted. We have something to offer.""\Grannis briefed members of Congress earlier this month on the regional programs, along with representatives from the Western Climate Initiative and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord.\One of the unusual challenges the regional groups face now is the pledge by President Barack Obama to pass national climate-change legislation, which has given critics of the states' efforts a new argument against the plans.\So far, the three groups represent 23 states, which account for almost half the nation's population and about 37 percent of the greenhouse-gas emissions. The groups are loosely organized. Each state will adopt its own rules and run its own programs.\The focus of the three groups is a cap-and-trade system. The states or regions would set limits on greenhouse-gas pollution, primarily emissions produced in the burning of fossil fuels. The major emitters -- power plants, factories, refineries -- would receive pollution allowances. If a company reduced emissions enough, it could sell or trade excess allowances to another polluter that couldn't meet the limit.\So far, only the Northeast group has launched its carbon-trading market, and for now, it applies only to electric utilities. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative auctions the pollution allowances, but critics say the prices fetched at auction have been too low, suggesting the caps were set too high, reducing the need for allowances.\Judi Greenwald, a vice president at the non-profit Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the Northeast example is still evolving. ""They chugged along, got the program up and running, and they're getting a modest level of reductions at a modest cost,"" she said. ""That's the price level that matches supply and demand at this moment, and I think it's working fine.""\The Pew Center has worked closely with the regional groups and helped bring them together for the briefing in Washington on Nov. 9.\Criticism mounts\The Western Climate Initiative set some of the most aggressive goals of the three groups. Its members designed a cap-and-trade system that applied to all carbon polluters, from utilities to automobiles, and it built a tight timeline before most states could take the plan to their legislatures.\""We left a lot of the decisions to the states and provinces,"" said Michael Gibbs, the group's co-chairman and an assistant secretary in California's Environmental Protection Agency.\""One of the strengths of WCI from our perspective is that we do have a broad diversity of opinion of how to design this,"" Gibbs said. ""We think we will end up with something that works well as a model. It's producing a design with broad appeal.""\But Western politics proved more volatile than those in the Northeast, where states moved quickly to adopt cap-and-trade legislation.\In Arizona, Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat and one of the Western Climate Initiative's founders, resigned to take the post of Homeland Security secretary in the Obama administration. Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a Republican who surprised many when he signed his state up for the initiative, resigned a few months later to become U.S. ambassador to China.\In both states, the new governors were Republicans and did not immediately endorse the initiative's plan. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has since said she wants the state to remain in the group, if only to keep a place in the process. ""If you're not at the table, you're likely to be on the menu,"" she has told several audiences.\Utah's new governor, Gary Herbert, has been more vocal in his doubt that climate change is real. Some in that state think he may support legislative efforts to withdraw from the group.\The initiative also has faced sharp criticism from outside organizations, which say the cap-and-trade system would ruin state economies.\The Western Business Roundtable, an issues group funded in part by energy companies, released a report this year that said forcing industries to comply with the emission caps could chase away billions of dollars in new investments and increase energy costs.\Other opponents seized on the involvement of the Western Governors' Association, accusing that group of supporting the Western Climate Initiative with money from states and taxpayers that didn't support its goals.\In leveling those charges, the National Taxpayers Union, an anti-tax advocacy group, described the initiative as ""a climate tax scheme written largely by California environmental activists.""\The governors' group angrily denied any wrongdoing. Gibbs said the states have tried to keep the entire process as transparent as possible.\Waiting for Congress\So far, only California and four Canadian provinces have adopted the legislation needed to meet the Western Climate Initiative's 2012 deadline to launch the carbon-trading system. Gibbs said that won't undermine the coalition's goals. Other states can start up their programs as they win approval from their legislatures.\Such votes seem unlikely as states struggle with declining revenues and big budget deficits, leaving many lawmakers reluctant to start new programs, especially if they mean higher costs for consumers or businesses. The recession has also dulled enthusiasm for green initiatives in general as attention turns to jobs, foreclosures and basic services.\As a result, some states suggest the wiser move is to let Congress act on a national cap-and-trade plan instead of creating a state system that might shut down almost as soon as it starts. Many states now say they would rather focus on complementary polices that would work alongside a federal program.\""When WCI was launched, the focus was on the cap-and-trade, but there is a growing interest in these other policies,"" said Grumbles, the Arizona regulator. ""Now we've got a great opportunity to foster renewable fuels, to promote smart growth and green buildings, to look for other green solutions.""\Brewer has not taken a formal position on any cap-and-trade system, but Grumbles said a federal program would be preferable to several regional versions. The Western Climate Initiative, he said, can help shape a federal system and make sure Western issues are addressed.\Meanwhile, states should direct more resources toward adapting to the changed climate, Grumbles said. He cited the threat to Arizona of prolonged drought and water shortages caused by warmer temperatures.\""Some people will continue to debate whether climate change is real or how much of it is natural and how much of it is man-made,"" he said. ""We know drought is real. We can't pretend it doesn't exist. We need to adapt.""\Greenwald, of the Pew Center, said states can focus on other issues but shouldn't lose sight of the need to limit greenhouse-gas pollution.\""A lot of people see this as being bad for the economy,"" she said. ""Our view is it will be good for the economy over the long run. There will be some costs, but ultimately a low-carbon economy will be more sustainable for the environment and for the economy.""\|\Regional groups try to address climate change\Over the past five years, three regional coalitions have formed to address climate change issues. The chief goal of each is to reduce pollution from greenhouse gases, the emissions produced when fossil fuels are burned.\To help achieve the goal, the coalitions have proposed carbon-trading systems that set a cap on pollution and let businesses buy, sell or trade allowances to emit pollution. Each state will manage its own system, working with the region-wide goals. There are no penalties for missing the goals and a state can withdraw from the group.\The coalitions represent 23 states,48 percent of the U.S. population, 37 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions and 53 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, according to the Pew Center for Global Climate Change.\Here is a look at the three coalitions:\WESTERN CLIMATE INITIATIVE\Founded: 2007.\Members: U.S. states Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington; Canadian provinces British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.\Primary goal: Reduce greenhouse gas pollution to 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 using a cap-and-trade system and complementary policies, such as renewable energy incentives and forest health programs. Emissions cap would cover 90 percent of greenhouse gas pollution. System is set to start in 2012.\Information: www.westernclimateinitiative.org\REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE\Founded: 2005.\Members: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont.\Primary goal: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions 10 percent below 2009 levels -- now the upper limit -- by 2018. First phase covers electric power generators only. The group auctions pollution credits; sixth auction is scheduled Dec. 9.\Information: www.rggi.org\MIDWESTERN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ACCORD\Founded: 2007.\Members: U.S. states Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin; Canadian province Manitoba (also a member of the Western coalition.)\Primary goal: Reduce greenhouse pollution 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 80 percent by 2050, using a cap and trade system and complementary policies.

6,"On Labor Day weekend, the campgrounds and trailer parks around the Grand Canyon were quiet. With excessive heat warnings throughout the country and restrictions in place to slow the spread of a deadly virus, the holiday weekend was different from years past. Still, a steady stream of RVers and campers rolled in and out of the campgrounds on the South Rim.\But those who had come to see one of the nation's most treasured natural wonders were met with a hazy view. One morning, the other side of the Canyon was barely visible. The striking definition of ridges, the red and orange palettes the Canyon is known for had been flattened by a smoky, at times opaque, haze.\Smoke from some of the largest and hottest wildfires in history in California, Oregon and Washington had blanketed the West, and even reached the East Coast.\For some, the haze was reminiscent of the 1990s, when the Grand Canyon had often been similarly obscured. Pollution from Los Angeles, vehicles, coal-fired power plants and controlled burns seriously impaired the view at the Canyon at least 75 days a year, dulling its colorful vistas into a muted, murky landscape.\Haze in the Grand Canyon was a particular concern for Arizona, the Grand Canyon state. At the time, Arizona led efforts to address smog in the Canyon, initiating partnerships with other Western states and spurring federal policies that greatly improved both visibility at the Grand Canyon and air pollution across the country.\""The Grand Canyon is like the canary in the coal mine,"" said Roger Clark, a program director for the Grand Canyon Trust and an active member in the regional haze work from its earliest stages. ""Visibility issues are an early warning sign of things going awry in the atmosphere.""\By the early 2000s, the partnership of Western states established out of the Grand Canyon haze work was tapped to address another phenomenon just entering mainstream consciousness: climate change.\Growing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the planet led Arizona to develop a comprehensive state climate action plan. Other states soon followed.\Today, the effects of climate change on Arizona have become almost as evident as the smoke hanging over the canyon: dwindling snowpack and extreme drought are stretching Colorado River supplies thin, summer temperatures are getting hotter and increasing heat-related deaths, and more destructive wildfires are scorching landscapes and lives. Temperatures in Maricopa County alone have risen by nearly 2 degrees Celsius since record-keeping began in 1895.\But Arizona is not the leader it was 15 years ago when the state led the West on regional haze and then climate policy.\Cities have largely taken the lead on climate policies. In recent years, the governor and the Legislature have taken no cohesive action, enacting laws that prohibit mitigation efforts at a local level. One state law even prevents state agencies from monitoring green house gases.\""The state first and foremost needs to stand up and say that we have an issue with climate,"" said Coral Evans, the mayor of Flagstaff, the first city in the state to declare a climate emergency. ""That leadership needs to be there. We don't talk about climate change. Maybe a lot of people in leadership in our state don't have the lived experience that I have. I'm third generation. I grew up here. Things are definitely different.""\On a hot day in August 2006, Steve Owens steeled himself before entering the governor's office. As the director of the state Department of Environmental Quality, it was his job to brief then-Gov. Janet Napolitano on the state's new climate action plan.\He and a coalition of dozens of stakeholders — businesspeople, scientists, environmentalists, energy experts, ranchers, river runners, auto industry executives — had worked for more than a year to develop a set of 49 policy recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Arizona.\That day, Owens expected to defend the economic viability of the plan. Instead, the governor asked why the goals — reduce emissions to 2000 levels by 2020 and 50% below 2000 levels by 2040 — weren't more aggressive.\Nearly two decades ago, Arizona emerged as a national leader in developing strategies to combat fossil fuel-driven climate change. A wave of Democratic governors who were concerned about the issue were elected across the West. Republican governors like Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah were vocal about wanting to lead on climate and environment issues.\The momentum was a response to federal inaction: In 2001, the George W. Bush administration announced that it would not implement the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark international treaty signed in 1997 that required nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. At the start of his second term, Bush passed numerous policies at the behest of polluting industries who didn't want more regulation.\By 2005, the issue drew attention at a more local level. It turned out to be ""a watershed year for states deciding it was time for them to step up on climate change,"" said Patrick Cummins, senior policy advisor at Colorado State University's Center for the New Energy Economy.\That year, Napolitano signed an executive order to create a state climate action plan, one of the first in the nation at a state level.\In the previous decade, Arizona had added fossil fuel pollutants to the atmosphere more than any other state. Between 1990 and 2005, Arizona's emissions shot up a staggering 56%, a rate of increase three times the national average. The numbers gave Napolitano compelling reason to act.\""It was a realization that climate was a really big deal and that we needed to have a plan, that we needed to put some intentionality into it,"" Napolitano said in a recent interview. Napolitano recently resigned as the President of University of California to teach as a tenured professor at UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy.\""It seemed to me that this was an area that Arizona needed to take up and also could be a leader in,"" she said.\A string of states followed: New Mexico, the Carolinas, Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania all developed their own climate plans. Arizona dipped its toes into international climate collaboration, too: A few months after Napolitano's executive order, Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora declared they would work together to address emissions in the borderlands.\""This had been just something done by governors in the Northeast and the West Coast and not by the heartland. Arizona was the first southwestern state to do this and one of the first red states in the country, period,"" said Thomas Peterson, President of the Center for Climate Strategies. The Washington D.C.-based non-profit has worked with more than 20 states across the US and with countries around the world to develop strategies to lower emissions and achieve economic goals.\The organization leads states to find a consensus on policies and prepared the emissions inventory, forecast, and economic impact analyses for Arizona's 2006 plan.\""Arizona demonstrated that a very diverse group of stakeholders could reach agreements on a substantial list of things to do to address emissions,"" Peterson said.\Seven northeastern states had already signed a memorandum to create the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the first mandatory market-based program in the US to reduce emissions. Launched in 2009, it continues to be lauded for showing that economic growth can coincide with emissions reductions.\In 2007, Arizona attempted to spearhead a similar regional approach. Governors of three West Coast states, along with Arizona and New Mexico, signed a memorandum of understanding directing their environmental agencies to design a market-based mechanism to achieve regional emissions goals, what was known as a cap-and-trade program. Republican strongholds Utah and Montana signed on to the program too and the Western Climate Initiative was born.\In developing the 2006 plan, Arizona found that the transportation and electricity sectors accounted for nearly 40% each of the state's total emissions. Cities were in a long-running fight with bad air pollution. Passenger vehicles were then and remain a main driver of the state's ozone pollution.\At the time, Napolitano and ADEQ officials determined that adopting the more stringent California Clean Car standards was necessary, especially in light of Arizona's rapid growth in both population and vehicle use. The tailpipe standards would not only lower planet-heating emissions, but also help the state meet the stricter ozone standards announced by the Bush Administration in 2008.\""While this regulation alone will not substantially reduce or reverse ongoing global climate change, it is inconceivable that those reduction targets could be achieved without actors like the state of Arizona undertaking reductions like this,"" ADEQ stated in its final rulemaking.\Many major policy recommendations from the plan were adopted by other states, helping the US make a significant dent in its emissions over the years. In fact, state policies have had a greater impact than the Great Recession in lowering national emissions.\""There was this period when there was this enormous wave of action,"" said Peterson. ""But the action didn't get fully implemented and there's all this unfinished business. And that is the failure.""\The Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora were on the verge of signing on to the Western Climate Initiative when the Great Recession hit. By the time the Initiative launched in 2012, Arizona had already pulled out of the cap-and-trade program.\When Napolitano was appointed to serve in the Obama Administration as Secretary of Homeland Security in 2009, Republican Jan Brewer landed in the governor's office. The recession, California's growing regulatory environment, and President Barack Obama's election rapidly transformed the state's political landscape.\""2009-10 was a time in Arizona dominated by optimism about solar energy, skepticism about 'cap and trade,' and concern about California and the federal government determining Arizona's environmental and economic competitiveness,"" Ben Grumbles, the ADEQ director appointed by Brewer after Owens left for the EPA, wrote in an emailed statement to The Republic.\He now serves as Maryland's Secretary of Environment and is an officer for the regional carbon market program in the northeast.\On Feb. 1, 2010, Brewer signed an executive order to pull Arizona from the Western Climate Initiative, saying the program would cripple the state's economy. Two months later, she signed a law that prevented any state agencies from even monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. The law remains on the books today.\In a final blow to the momentum of the Napolitano era, Brewer signed an order that, in 2012, blocked the state from adopting California's clean car standards. The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry celebrated the repeal as vindication from California's ""overbearing regulatory environment."" Environmentalists decried the move.\""Brewer and I had very different ideas about what Arizona needed and what good public policy was,"" Napolitano said. ""She focused on the immigration agenda almost to the exclusion, it seems, of everything else.""\Brewer declined to be interviewed for this story.\Brewer's signing of SB 1070, an anti-immigration law, plunged Arizona into political chaos and landed the state in the national spotlight. The rise of the Tea Party and increasing political polarization across the nation pushed climate change to the sidelines and made it increasingly a partisan issue.\During the Bush years, John McCain had been the only Republican senator to push for climate change legislation, but after his electoral defeat in 2008, he reverted to the party line and played a large role in blocking any climate legislation from reaching the senate floor.\Since that time, there has been no comprehensive climate action from the governor or the Legislature. With the Trump Administration's repeal of Obama-era clean car standards, despite the EPA's finding that the rollback could lead to an additional 444 to 1,000 premature deaths from increased air pollution, the federal government has created an even lower backstop for a state already struggling to mitigate bad air.\""Arizona was really standing out because of all the things we were doing,"" Owens recalled. ""It's disappointing, the things that could have been done in the last 10, 15 years. With drought conditions that still persist, the record heats we continue to have, the Colorado river drying up, you would think people would be more concerned. But the people who are in positions to do something about it are in complete denial.""\When Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans was a kid, she swam in the Rio de Flag every summer. The river flowed behind her grandfather's house, its cool waters a welcome summer respite. By the time Halloween came around, winter had usually settled over the city. Sometimes the snow lasted through April.\Today, Evans lives in the house her grandfather built in 1942, but the river behind it no longer flows like it used to. The heavy winters of Evans' childhood are rarer. Ski resorts now spray manufactured snow onto the mountains to mark the beginning of ski season. The temperate summers Evans grew up with are warmer; every year, temperatures inch closer to reaching 100 degrees for the first time.\""I have had the ability to experience firsthand the changes caused by this climate crisis we're experiencing,"" said Evans, who is running for a seat in the state House as a Democrat. ""The local impact of the climate crisis is devastating and is directly impacting our quality of life and our economy right now.""\Arizona's carbon emissions aren't as dire as the 2006 climate plan anticipated they would be. The plan predicted a whopping 148% increase in emissions by 2020 if Arizona failed to implement any of the recommended policies.\Just before the Great Recession hit, Arizona had increased its emissions from 2000 levels by 20%. In 2008, the state spewed an all-time high of 102 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\The recession, combined with improving technology over the years and utilities shifting to a more robust renewable energy portfolio, tempered the state's emissions rate and led to a decrease in total emissions to 2000 levels by 2017, according to the US Energy Information Administration, the best state-level greenhouse gas emissions data in the absence of a state-run greenhouse gas inventory.\Still, Arizona is falling behind in the West when it comes to proactive climate policy. In 2018, voters in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada elected Democratic governors and legislatures. Soon after, Colorado joined California's clean car standards. New Mexico and Nevada are moving to do the same. Earlier this year, a climate report ordered by the Utah Legislature developed a roadmap for tackling climate change and pollution.\While climate change is a global problem, some of the most innovative and effective solutions in addressing emissions have come from the state and regional levels, and have even incentivized stronger action from the federal government.\""It makes a national program more inevitable when enough states are doing it, so state action and state leadership is going to continue to be important,"" said Cummins. ""But ultimately when you look at what the scientists are telling us about cutting emissions in half by 2030, getting to net zero by 2050—this requires a national mobilization.""\Arizona's cities and counties have taken the lead on climate action in the absence of state and national leadership. Flagstaff, Phoenix, and Pima County all conduct their own regular greenhouse gas emissions inventories. Maricopa County published its first inventory this year. Flagstaff, Phoenix, Tempe, and Tucson have either already implemented or are in the process of developing their own climate action plans. Over the years, the cities have enacted innovative policies to reduce their respective carbon footprints.\""Phoenix is home to 1.7 million people, so we are larger than 10 states,"" said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego in a recent interview. ""Cities are the branch of government that are closest to our residents. We hear what they need and what they want. If we lead, it really can make a difference. I would love to see the Legislature give us more tools to be able to respond to our residents rather than restrict our ability.""\In recent years, the Legislature has passed multiple bills that hinder climate action on a local level. In 2014, the Legislature outlawed plastic bag bans in cities and towns. In 2015, the Legislature prohibited cities from requiring energy benchmarking for commercial buildings, a move that Tempe council member Lauren Kuby called a ""slap-in-the face to local decision making.""\This year, in what many called a reflex response to California policies, a state law was fast-tracked through the Legislature and signed by the governor in February to prevent Arizona's cities and towns from banning natural gas or other fossil fuels in buildings.\""The Legislature has the potential to be a driving force to create an equitable approach to water insecurity and extreme heat,"" Kuby wrote in response to emailed questions from The Republic.\""Arizonans, as well as cities, businesses, and nonprofits are way ahead of the AZ Corporation Commission, Legislature, and the Governor in thinking and acting proactively to address the climate emergency,"" she said. ""Extremists in the Legislature are not only content to do nothing, they attempt to squash cities that are innovating to address the climate crisis.""\In recent years, the Arizona Corporation Commission repealed rooftop solar incentives. Though the state's major utilities have announced fairly ambitious clean energy goals, the commission has not increased its renewable-energy and energy-efficiency standards since the mid-2000s.\Some lawmakers have attempted to push legislation to require action at a state level. In this last Legislative session, Democrats Kirsten Engel and Juan Mendez introduced bills in the House and Senate respectively to develop a state climate action plan and greenhouse gas inventory. The bills died before ever reaching the Senate floor.\""Fundamentally, we need a state Sustainability Commission and an Arizona Office of Sustainability,"" Kuby wrote. ""If the State of Florida can dedicate an office to incubating policies that mitigate or adapt to climate change, then Arizona, with a history of coming together on contentious water issues, should be able to agree that we need coordinated sustainability policy at the state level.""\It was only last year that Governor Doug Ducey publicly acknowledged climate change was influenced by human activity. In the past several years, Ducey has taken some action on environmental issues plaguing the state, particularly water issues. In January 2019 he signed an executive order to create a council to address long-term concerns about a drier future in Arizona beyond the issues involving the Colorado River.\""Governor Ducey believes we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and that doing so is tied to our economy and quality of life,"" a spokesperson for the governor wrote in an email to The Republic. ""At the same time, we are mindful of how any proposed policies impact our economy, taxpayers, small businesses, everyday Arizonans and energy costs. ADEQ is an entire state agency devoted 365 days a year to protecting our environment and our air and water.""\The governor declined to be interviewed for this story and didn't respond to specific questions from The Republic.\Every year, ADEQ spends millions of dollars on a variety of travel reduction, vehicle efficiency and lawn equipment replacement initiatives to improve emissions. But the agency has no authority to address carbon dioxide emissions, one of the main greenhouse gases.\ADEQ spokesperson Caroline Oppleman pointed to partnerships with utilities, the private sector, and advancements like evolving electric vehicle and hydrogen fuel cell technology as ways Arizona will lower its carbon footprint in coming years.\The market-driven shift from coal dominance will also improve emissions, Oppleman said. The closure of the Navajo Generating Station in November 2019 alone reduced Arizona's emissions by 13.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to ADEQ. Roughly a third of Arizona's energy production is already from non-fossil fuel alternative sources, including Palo Verde nuclear generating station, said Oppleman.\""Our goal with all these efforts has been to take the politics out of it, and focus on good policies that are bipartisan and good for the state of Arizona,"" Ducey's spokesperson wrote.\The reliance on the federal government and natural market swings will have positive impacts, but those actively working toward solutions say waiting on the market isn't enough.\""We're implementing climate policy by implementing utility energy policy and transportation policy,"" said Jeff Schlegel, a member of the 2006 climate action plan working group and a state energy policy consultant. ""The prospects for the Commission improving the energy rules and in so doing, making progress on climate change is probably the best thing that we have going right now.""\On the transportation side, Schlegel said, a combination of the market and EPA requirements for ozone standards, and other air quality issues in the Valley will also help improve emissions policies.\""It's just a matter of whether you have it three to five years earlier because of some good policy,"" Schlegel said. ""But not only is the Legislature not taking positive action to address the crisis, they're preventing local municipalities from taking their own action, which is bizarre coming from a political party that claims it is in favor of local control.""\Time is running out. In 2018, the world's leading climate scientists warned the world had to take drastic action within 12 years to slow the rate of global warming and keep it at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond that, every degree has increasingly dire consequences.\The world has already warmed more than one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution and is on track to reach 3 degrees of warming by the end of the century if major reductions in emissions aren't achieved.\The Paris climate agreement, an international treaty to lower greenhouse gas emissions hoped to restrict warming to two degrees. In 2017, the Trump Administration announced the U.S., one of the largest emitters of planet-heating emissions in the world, would no longer participate in the agreement.\For all living organisms, the faster climate changes, the more difficult it is to adapt to it. When climate change is too rapid, as it has become with the help of human-caused emissions, species start going extinct.\Coral reefs would largely die off with two degrees of warming. Three degrees could result in the loss of many coastal cities. Four degrees could reduce the flow of the Colorado River to a trickle. Five degrees could leave huge swathes of the planet uninhabitable.\There will also be economic impacts. A 2017 study found the U.S. could lose 2.3% of its GDP for each degree Celsius increase in global warming.\The Southwest, already the hottest and driest region in the United States, is warming at a faster rate than other parts of the country. Maricopa County's average temperature has increased by 1.9 degrees since 1895. This gradual climate change means longer, hotter summers, experts say, as the monsoon pattern arrives later.\States can have tremendous power to make a difference, especially in the U.S., which is second only to China in its contribution to planet-heating emissions.\""The states need to be taking the initiative on this because the federal government right now certainly isn't,"" said Owens, the former ADEQ director. ""While an individual state can only do so much, it's extremely important for an individual state to do as much as it can.""\Political polarization in the last decade has made large-scale action difficult, but many see bipartisan consensus as the only way forward.\""The state of Arizona and the federal government can't continue ignoring this issue,"" said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero in a phone interview. ""We are at a point where it's all hands on deck. Democrats, Republicans, the business community, elected officials, students and scientists can work together to plan for the future, invest in green, renewable infrastructure that creates jobs. It is an economic opportunity for us and at the same time, we will be doing something good for our environment.""\In September, Tucson formally declared a climate emergency and will implement a decade-long plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.\The need to remove politics from the climate conversation is something many from both sides of the aisle agree needs to happen. This year, representatives from Arizona's utilities, business community, and political leaders met in a forum to discuss the state's direction on energy.\""The consensus was clear: the value of diversifying our energy portfolio and expanding our utilization of renewable energy options is not a left or right question, but an imperative that will have significant impacts on our state,"" Jaime Molera, a Republican and former state official, and Glenn Hamer, the president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, wrote in a joint op-ed in The Arizona Capitol Times in February.\Discourse may be the first step, but the science shows the window for meaningful action is rapidly closing.\""Climate is the great convener. Our livelihoods and environment should not be partisan,"" said Kuby. ""We need to elect people who are not beholden to corporate interests, who reflect the people and the science that we are in a climate crisis and must take action.""\Erin Stone covers the environment for azcentral.com and The Arizona Republic.

7,"This year, the member states and provinces of the Western Climate Initiative will be working on details for a cap-and-trade system for regional greenhouse gases.\The plan calls for a regional cap-and-trade program to be implemented starting in 2012.\The Arizona Investment Council believes it is unwise for the Western states to proceed with carbon controls in advance of a national program.\Nevertheless, we also believe Arizona should continue to have a strong voice within the initiative to protect Arizona interests as program details continue to be developed.\Former Gov. Janet Napolitano brought Arizona into the WCI as a founding partner in February 2007.\This exercise of executive authority understandably rankled many legislators, who believe the decision to join WCI had to be made in concert with the Legislature.\Consequently, HB 2467 was introduced to prohibit participation in WCI by Arizona's Department of Environmental Quality, the agency currently leading Arizona's participation.\HB 2467 recently passed out of the House Environment Committee by a single vote majority, with only five members voting.\Interestingly, Gov. Jan Brewer has signaled her intent for Arizona to remain a participant in WCI under her leadership and new administration.\The Arizona Investment Council, like many stakeholder organizations, is concerned that a regional cap-and-trade system will impose new costs on energy production that will further drag down Arizona's economy and place it at a competitive disadvantage.\The Western Business Roundtable recently issued a report detailing the economic costs of such a program in the WCI region.\That report concluded that adoption of cap and trade only in the West would do little to improve global warming, but it would substantially raise energy prices and deepen the recession, which many economists predict will extend well into next year.\While a regional cap and trade may improve the competitive position of renewable energy sources relative to fossil fuels, Arizona consumers will feel the sting of higher costs and reduced disposable incomes.\Nevertheless, it appears inevitable that environmental externalities such as greenhouse gases will be built into the cost of energy.\Our council believes it should be done carefully at a national level with an even playing field for all producers and consumers.\To the extent that the governors in WCI seek to influence a federal program or to implement controls that exceed a federal standard, Arizona should remain at the regional table to ensure that the potential economic consequences of carbon control measures are considered and to explore all avenues for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, including investment in renewable generation, energy efficiency, clean coal technologies and nuclear generation.\Gary Yaquinto is president of the Arizona Investment Council.\Arizona's voice needed in Western Climate Initiative\Cap and trade only in the West would do little to improve global warming, but it would substantially raise energy prices."
8,"Another Earth Day has come and gone, but the public discussion of environmental issues hasn't progressed much.\In fact, the public dialogue often seems stuck in the pre-environmental era. Environmentalists continue to depict public-policy debates as a fight between those who want to protect the environment and the polluters. And, according to the environmentalists, the polluters are still winning because they lie, cheat and exercise disproportionate political influence.\In reality, the trend lines on most pollutants have steadily improved over the last couple of decades in the United States. The belief that public policy should be protective of the environment is nearly universal.\Environmental public-policy disputes these days are mostly over the best approach to make even greater environmental gains and the cost/benefit trade-off of increments of additional pollution reductions.\There is one issue, however, where the lines do appear to be as sharply drawn as in the pre-environmental era, and that is the biggest environmental issue of all: global warming. The debate seems to be between those who think global warming is an imminent disaster and those who think it's a bunch of hooey.\The debate also seems populated by a lot of people expressing extreme confidence about scientific matters that are beyond their ken. I don't want to join their number, but here seems to be the state of play regarding the science.\There does not seem to be any dispute that concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing. Nor does there seem to be any dispute that surface temperatures on Earth increased during the 20th century.\A natural assumption is that there is a connection between the two phenomena. But there are anomalies and uncertainties.\For example, there seems to have been two periods of warming in the last century, one before 1945 when industrial pollutants aren't thought to have been much of a factor, and after 1976, when they are. Moreover, in the later period, there has not been nearly the same warming in the low troposphere, up to five miles above the Earth, as there has been on the surface, contrary to what would be expected in a greenhouse effect.\Skeptics also point out that computer projections about the future cannot truly mimic the complexity of nature, fluctuations in sun intensity also fit the warming data, and increases in some greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, may have some beneficial effects.\Prudence, however, would suggest constraining the extent to which humankind changes the atmospheric chemistry. We know that the pre-industrial atmospheric chemistry works. Any projections about the effects of changing that atmospheric mix are, however well informed, ultimately guesswork.\So, how to go about constraining the extent to which human activity changes the atmospheric chemistry while also doing the least to constrain improvements in living standards?\Countries that have signed onto the Kyoto global warming treaty are pursuing a cap-and-trade approach. The U.S. Senate seems to be drifting toward the same approach here.\Cap and trade is often sold to skeptical conservatives as a market approach to pollution control. And it is, indeed, more market oriented than government dictating emissions levels and control technologies. But it has many undesirable market consequences.\In cap and trade, government sets an overall limit on allowable emissions for a particular pollutant. Rights to emit are then distributed within the limit, which can then be traded.\The rights, however, are usually distributed based upon existing emissions. Government, in other words, gives companies a property right to their pollution, and the greater the polluter, the more valuable the property right. New entrants have to buy these pollution rights from incumbents, which gives incumbents excessive market power.\A more direct and fairer approach would be simply to tax the pollution. Those who pollute more would pay more, rather than in essence being rewarded for past polluting behavior. New entrants would be advantaged because they could begin with cleaner production methods, rather than disadvantaged.\A modest tax on greenhouse-gas emissions would seem what best fits what is currently known. Industry would be put on notice that such emissions are a cost item, potentially subject to sudden and sharp increases. That would create an incentive to alter production techniques to avoid that volatility without the immediate economic costs of Kyoto or a cap-and-trade approach.\Because it involves a tax, conservatives would likely have to lead the way on such an approach. Liberals are wary of being hit over the head with the ""T"" word, not unjustifiably since both Al Gore and John Kerry were attacked for previous support for either emissions or fuel taxes.\Conservatives, who generally still dispute the need to act at all on greenhouse gases, aren't likely to exercise such leadership anytime soon. Some evangelicals, however, are taking a new look at environmental issues, particularly global warming, as part of good stewardship of God's creation.\Somewhere between doomsday and denial is a sensible approach to global warming.\\\Reach Robb at robert.robb@arizonarepublic.com or (602) 444-8472.

9,"This week, the Senate is poised to make a historic vote on the Climate Stewardship Act, introduced in January by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. The Climate Stewardship Act funds research into climate change and creates a cap-and-trade system for reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\The cap-and-trade system caps the total greenhouse gas emissions allowed from large greenhouse gas emitters, and assigns tradable emissions allowances to the affected emitters. Entities emitting less than their assigned, tradable allowances may sell the extras for profit, and those emitting more that their assigned allowances can purchase the extra allowances on the market.\The cap-and-trade system is tried and tested: It is used to regulate emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating plants, the principal cause of acid rain. Over the past decade, concentrations of sulfur dioxide in our air have decreased 39 percent with no noticeable harm to the electric industry. Putting the cap-and-trade system to work on greenhouse gases will be similarly effective and similarly painless. A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study of the economic impact of the act estimates that it could be as low as $40 per household per year.\Besides having a very small cost, the act will stimulate the economy. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires new technologies and new products. Wind turbines, solar cells, fuel cells, hybrid automobiles and automated energy management are a few examples. Other nations with more aggressive greenhouse gas commitments are quickly leaving the United States behind in developing these technologies. The world's top four wind turbine manufacturers hail from Denmark, Germany and Spain. The two hybrid automobiles widely sold in the United States are Japanese. Passing the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act will provide the motivation to develop these technologies essential to the planet's well-being and bring this business, and the accompanying jobs, back to the United States.\Arizona is well-situated to benefit from the technology development the act will initiate. Honeywell, with major facilities in Phoenix, has been a leader in automated energy management for years. Arizona State University also has the teaching and research programs in place to support these new technologies.\But the benefits of passing the act will extend far beyond Arizona.\The international greenhouse gas reduction program, the Kyoto Protocol, contains a key flaw: It allows developing nations to develop with little to no greenhouse gas constraints. The results could be disastrous for the environment. Just last week, the New York Times published an investigation detailing China's explosive growth of old-technology, coal-fired energy generation and conventional automobile sales. If left unchecked, this trend means China's increase in emissions between now and 2030 may equal the combined increase of the remainder of the world.\The United States is a key knowledge and technology exporter to the world. By capping our emissions we are not only stimulating our own high-tech industries but spearheading worldwide adoption of the modern technologies required to halt global warming.\Let's follow the lead of Sens. McCain and Lieberman and let the United States lead the world in attacking climate change with new technology -- made in the U.S.A.\\\The writer is an assistant professor in the School of Management at Arizona State University West. On Wednesday's Opinions page, ASU Professor Robert Balling argues that the McCain-Lieberman bill provides economic pain and no environmental gain."
10,"Come Nov. 4, people who pay $4 a gallon or more for gas on the way to the polls will likely be thinking of energy issues while in the voting booth.\Many Arizonans will have paid costly bills for summer air-conditioning. Voters in cooler regions will be dreading their natural-gas or heating-oil bills for the winter.\Whoever inherits the White House can anticipate energy to be one of the defining issues of the presidency. The term will be marked by debates over nuclear, coal, natural-gas and solar power, offshore oil drilling, increasing fuel use from China, and the fact that some people don't think global oil production can meet demand.\The nation, and presumably the president, will have to find a way to negotiate surging energy needs, environmental concerns and soaring prices.\Energy already has hit home in Arizona.\Gasoline started setting records in mid-March, surpassing prices set in the wake of Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005, and rising a couple of cents a day through June.\It would cost Valley drivers nearly $6 million more daily to buy the same amount of fuel consumed last year, but many are cutting back.\And Phoenix utilities disconnected 40 percent more people from their electricity for late payments from January through May this year than the same time in 2007.\Getting more energy is proving to be difficult.\President Bush asked Saudi Arabia to increase oil output, with limited results.\Controversy slows efforts to build more power plants. Even relatively non-controversial natural-gas generators need transmission lines and pipelines to deliver their fuel, and both can invite debate.\Here are some questions to help voters weigh the candidates on energy:\Is the next president likely to enact energy legislation?\Both John McCain and Barack Obama pledge to overhaul the country's approach to energy issues. The debate will hinge on setting a long-term strategy that keeps the economy running, and learning to adapt to higher energy prices.\Climate-change legislation that affects energy also is likely to move forward. Not only is public demand strong, but also the affected industries, such as coal-burning power plants, would like to see solid legislation that takes away some of the uncertainty caused by the lack of a policy.\Why is there debate over drilling for oil off U.S. coasts and in Alaska?\President Bush recently lifted a presidential ban on offshore drilling, but Congress would need to do the same to give oil companies access to regions off-limits since 1981.\The ban was originally spurred by a 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif. McCain supports removing the ban; Obama is opposed.\Opponents say drilling is not worth the environmental risk and that it's likely the oil would simply sell at the global market price at the time.\McCain said last month that offshore drilling wouldn't greatly ease the supply crunch but would provide a ""psychological impact"" to Americans and ease concerns the government was not acting on the issue.\Obama said McCain is focused on drilling because it ""polls well.""\Numbers tell the story best.\The banned offshore reserves hold about 18 billion barrels of oil, which sounds like a lot unless compared with daily global demand.\If all the off-limits offshore areas and Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge were open to drilling, they could produce about 1 million barrels a day at their peak before trailing off, the Energy Information Administration estimates. That represents a little more than 1 percent of the nearly 85 million barrels a day produced worldwide.\The new oil wouldn't affect U.S. gas prices much, the EIA concluded.\Will laws limiting the amount of greenhouse gases from power plants or cars make things more expensive?\Probably, but building more power plants to meet electric demand won't be free, either. The debate over greenhouse-gas legislation is likely to center on how much it costs consumers and the economy to enact such legislation.\For example, Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va., have tried to pass legislation that would cut greenhouse-gas emissions 19 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 63 percent by 2050.\Arizona Public Service Co. officials used some assumptions to calculate that would cost them $180 million a year in operating expenses in 2012, and could add 5 percent or more to customer bills.\A separate analysis of the bill by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that if utilities could pass on the expenses, customers could see bills go up 44 percent in 2030.\Both McCain and Obama support cap-and-trade programs -- where a limit is set on emissions and businesses can trade permits that allow them to release those emissions -- along the lines of the Lieberman-Warner bill.\McCain supports giving out permits to release greenhouse gases that equal the current production from power plants and transportation fuels, and gradually reducing those allowances, forcing companies to cut back emissions or buy ""offsets.""\Offsets mean paying for others to cut their emissions when you can't cut your own.\Obama wants to auction off all the permits to emit greenhouse gases and use some of the money to fund alternative energy and help low-income families pay for weatherizing their homes or paying their energy bills.\Can't we use more U.S. coal?\The U.S. has plenty of coal reserves, but many coal plants have been shelved, and others are struggling to get permits. Coal also emits the most carbon dioxide associated with global warming.\Because coal supplies about half the nation's electricity, can be burned around the clock and is relatively inexpensive outside of environmental costs, experts say research into technology that could clean up its emissions is critical.\Obama and McCain support funding such technology.\Obama's energy pledges include that he will ""use whatever policy tools are necessary, including standards that ban new traditional coal facilities"" that don't have reduced emissions.\The coal industry wants to develop a way to capture and store the greenhouse gases that come out of coal plants.\Why not build more nuclear plants?\McCain supports building more nuclear power plants.\Obama's campaign page says it's ""unlikely"" that the country can cut greenhouse-gas emissions without nuclear power.\McCain supports storing spent nuclear fuel from the nation's generators under Yucca Mountain outside Las Vegas.\While that is the only site the Department of Energy and other federal agencies are preparing for permanent storage, it's not supported by many people in Nevada, as well as communities along routes to Yucca Mountain, such as Flagstaff.\Obama opposes Yucca Mountain as a storage site and says there is ""no future for expanded nuclear"" without first finding a safe solution to dispose of nuclear waste.\|\Head to head on energy\GAS PRICES/OFFSHORE DRILLING\John McCain: Encourages investigation into oil speculation, supports reform in the futures market. Opposes a windfall-profits tax on oil companies. Wants to end ban on offshore drilling to extract more oil and natural gas from America's coasts. Wants more flex-fuel autos manufactured that can run on high blends of corn ethanol.\Barack Obama: Wants to cut oil consumption by at least 35 percent by 2030 through repealed tax breaks for oil and gas companies, increased fuel-economy standards and increased federal investment in advanced hybrid vehicles. Wants all new cars to be capable of burning high-ethanol blends. Said offshore drilling won't fix gas prices.\NUCLEAR POWER\John McCain: Supports nuclear development, with the ultimate goal of building 100 new plants, 45 of them by 2030, and supports storing spent nuclear fuel in Yucca Mountain, Nev.\Barack Obama: Says meeting emissions goals for energy is unlikely without more nuclear plants but that storing spent fuel in Yucca Mountain, Nev., is not an option. Says he'll seek alternative solutions.\ENERGY EFFICIENCY\John McCain: Supports increased energy efficiency at government-owned and -leased properties to show leadership in conservation. Supports tax credits for zero-emission autos. Pledges to cut red tape for upgrades to electric grid, eventually allowing the charging of electric cars, and encourages ""smart meters"" that allow two-way communication between utilities and customers.\Barack Obama: Would make all new federal buildings zero-emission facilities by 2025 and overhaul efficiency codes for appliances set by the Department of Energy. Suggests decoupling energy sales and profits for utilities so they may profit from efficiency measures. Would increase energy efficiency grants. Wants to phase out traditional, inefficient lightbulbs and invest in a ""smart grid"" to encourage more renewable energy use.\ALTERNATIVE ENERGY\John McCain: Supports ""even-handed"" tax credits for solar, wind and other renewables. Wants to offer $300 million reward for improved electric-car batteries. Pledges $2 billion annually to research cleaner ways to burn coal. Wants a 10 percent tax credit for wages spent on research and development.\Barack Obama: Would extend a production-tax credit for renewable energy. Pledges $150 billion during 10 years for biofuels, plug-in hybrids, renewable energy, low-emission coal and power-grid upgrades. Suggests a venture-capital fund to ensure new technology is commercialized. Wants a national rule requiring 25 percent of electricity to come from renewables by 2025.\ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING\John McCain: Encourages a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gasses to slowly reduce emissions. Sets target of cutting emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020, and 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.\Barack Obama: Supports cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gasses. Wants to see emissions at 1990 levels by 2020, and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Would use proceeds from emissions auctions to help those affected by the measures.\|\For more information\McCain's ""Lexington Project"" energy proposals:\Go to www.exploremccain.com, click on ""Issues,"" then click on ""American Energy.""\Obama's energy proposals: www.barackobama.com/issues/pdf/EnergyFactSheet.pdf\U.S. Department of Energy analysis of drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge: www.eia.doe.gov/oiafservicerpt/anwr/introduction.html\U.S. Department of Energy analysis of offshore drilling: www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/otheranalysis/ongr.html\Global oil consumption and production: www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/3atab.pdf\|\Based on interviews with Zachary Smith, Regent's Professor of political science and natural resources, Northern Arizona University; Michael Kuby, professor of geographical sciences, Arizona State University; Thomas Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute; Joe Lucas, vice president of communications, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity; Bud Annan, former head of the U.S. Department of Energy's solar program, now a Scottsdale consultant; Saifur Rahman, director of the Center for Energy and the Global Environment at Virginia Tech and a vice president of the IEEE Power & Energy Society.\|\Part of a series on where John McCain and Barack Obama stand on the issues.\Today: Energy and oil.

11,"The state's environmental agency should not be allowed to regulate greenhouse gases or fuel economy without the Legislature's OK, a legislative panel decided Thursday in recommending just a two-year extension for the agency.\The recommendation puts the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality at the center of a power struggle between Gov. Janet Napolitano and a Legislature unhappy with her decision to have Arizona join a regional effort to curb greenhouse-gas emissions.\Most state agencies face a periodic review by the Legislature and usually are given 10-year renewals. But lawmakers have been tougher on ADEQ since it was first created more than two decades ago. The agency has never gotten the standard 10-year extension.\To agency Director Steve Owens, it raises the question of whether the state should even have an environment department.\""It seems to me the main reason they (legislators) want to have a DEQ is not to protect the environment but to keep the federal government at bay,"" Owens said.\Without ADEQ, the state's environmental regulation would be handled by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\But Sen. Chuck Gray, R-Mesa, said that no one wants to see the agency go away but that lawmakers do want to see an agency that works better with industry and moves more quickly when dealing with pollution problems.\The agency's fate will be decided next year when the Legislature must take action if ADEQ is to continue operating beyond June 30.\Legislators are particularly irritated with Napolitano's decision last year to sign the state on to the Western Climate Initiative, a collaboration among seven Western states and four Canadian provinces to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. The group is proposing a cap-and-trade system to encourage a reduction in fossil fuels, believed to be a major cause of climate change. Each state or province has to work out its own detailed plan.\""We did not know anything about the Western Climate Initiative, what it entails, its effects on business,"" said Rep. Michele Reagan, R-Scottsdale. ""It was just shoved down our throats.""\Lawmakers also object to the Clean Cars program, a multistate effort to reduce emissions from cars and trucks. ADEQ wrote rules to meet the Clean Cars standards, which were approved earlier this year.\The legislative-oversight panel, consisting of members from the House and Senate environment committees, took aim at those two programs in its recommendations on ADEQ's future.\It urged that the agency be prevented from enacting any policies related to the Western Climate Initiative. Lawmakers also recommended that no actions proceed on either the climate initiative or Clean Cars without legislative approval.\Those stipulations are attached to the panel's recommendation that ADEQ be continued for another two years. The agency had sought a 10-year extension, which is common for many agencies that get a ""sunset"" review.\Gray said the two-year renewal is needed ""because of ongoing problems that never seem to get resolved.""\During a two-day hearing, lawmakers heard testimony from a mining executive who said his company was stymied in its attempts to get permits for uranium operations in northern Arizona. There were also complaints that the agency moves too slowly in processing pollution permits.\Lawmakers also used the session to air their own grievances about the Western Climate Initiative as well as a $1 million payment to the climate group from a pollution settlement negotiated by ADEQ. In that case, $1 million of a $6 million settlement reached with Honeywell over groundwater contamination was sent to the climate initiative.\Owens defended the payment as a ""supplemental environmental program"" that is common in many pollution settlements.\But the legislative panel, showing its displeasure with the arrangement, recommended that the Legislature block the agency from sending penalty money to any source other than the state's general fund.\The recommendations were enough to push the Sierra Club, one of the agency's backers, to say it cannot support the plan to renew the agency, saying it would be better to live with the prospect of federal oversight than a vastly weakened state agency.\""It would be a joke if it weren't so important,"" said Sandy Bahr, who lobbies for the Grand Canyon chapter of the Sierra Club.\""The whole premise: punishing them for being careful with uranium mining?"" she said.\""Do (legislators) understand what uranium can do to the groundwater, and don't you think that drinking water for millions of people is worth being careful with?""\The recommendations approved Thursday are far from the final word on the agency.\They will be folded into a legislative bill, which will be discussed in the 2009 session of the Legislature."
12,"Discussion of the environment by the presidential candidates has mostly focused on their policies toward climate change and energy issues.\But other green challenges, including improved air quality and public-lands use, are also important to the western United States.\A new administration could decide whether Arizona must meet tougher federal air-pollution standards, or whether to impose more limits on recreation and construction in national parks and forests.\Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama have similar views on issues such as particulate pollution and mining, with both favoring enforcement of the Clean Air Act and the overhaul of a 136-year-old law regulating mining on public lands.\But on other issues, such as road construction in national forests, Obama favors stronger action, while McCain espouses a more moderate, market-based approach.\Those are topics that are passionately debated in Arizona.\Maricopa County struggles with too much dust in the skies, while hard-rock mining is important to the state's economic health.\Federally managed lands are becoming battlegrounds for conflicting priorities, from renewable energy to recreational use.\|\The issues\Head to head on clean air, public lands use\Issue: Clean air: Whether the Environmental Protection Agency's standards for particulate air pollution and smog are adequate or should be tightened further.\Barack Obama: Favors a strong Clean Air Act, which he says the Bush administration has weakened. Wants tougher regulations on smog and soot and would ensure that ""public health standards are set by scientists, and not politicians and lobbyists,"" according to his campaign. Supports tighter regulations on mercury emissions and lead. Because his daughter, Malia, suffers from chronic asthma, he said he has an ""enduring personal commitment to cleaner air.""\John McCain: Says he would ensure that the Clean Air Act is aggressively enforced. He also would set national air-quality standards based on ""sound economic and environmental science."" In the past, McCain has backed measures that would have tightened toxic-emissions standards. His votes included one in 2005 supporting a Senate resolution that would have overturned an EPA rule exempting coal-fired power plants from provisions of the Clean Air Act.\Issue: Renewable energy: Pursuing alternative forms of energy in an effort to decrease greenhouse gases and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels.\Barack Obama: Supports tax credits for wind and solar projects, as well as for biofuels, including corn-based ethanol. Would pledge $150 billion over a 10-year period for alternative energy development, including low-emission coal and power-grid upgrades. He favors a national rule requiring that 25 percent of electricity come from renewable energy by 2025. Also favors a mandatory cap-and-trade program and an 80-percent reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.\John McCain: Supports increased use of solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy, but doesn't like broad-based tax subsidies for such projects. He wants the government to invest in research and development across a range of industries. He's a staunch supporter of expansion of nuclear power, with the goal of building 100 new plants. He also proposes spending $2 billion a year to advance clean-coal technology. Plus, he favors a mandatory cap-and-trade program, calling for a 60-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\Issue: Mining: Whether to reform the 1872 Mining Law, which was designed to speed development of the West, and how best to balance mining against other potential uses of public lands.\Barack Obama: Wants to update the law to improve environmental protections and provide compensation for the use of federal land. Believes that any changes should take into account the effects on industry. Obama was criticized for not supporting 2007 legislative attempts to overhaul the Mining Law. The proposal, favored by environmentalists, would have ""placed a significant burden on the mining industry and could have a significant impact on jobs,"" he said.\John McCain: Says the Mining Law should be reviewed and updated. Supports reforms to ensure that mining activities are environmentally responsible, but any changes must also take into account economic and market conditions. Any fees for future mining activity should be fair to both the miner and the taxpayer. ""Such reforms should not be used as a means of chasing responsible miners from the land or retarding the environmentally responsible development of mineral resources that are critical to our economy,"" he said.\Issue: National forest roadless areas: Whether the 2001 rule, which bans road building, logging and development in about a third of all national forests, should stand or be replaced by a state-by-state petition process.\Barack Obama: Supports the Clinton-era rule as written, saying it protects 58.5 million acres of national forest from harmful building. Says road construction in forests can harm fish and wildlife habitat and pollute lakes, rivers and streams.\John McCain: Supports protecting wilderness areas, but says a road should not be barred in a specific area via a one-size-fits-all approach. Does not support extensive building in national forests, saying such decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.\Based on information from the League of Conservation Voters, the Pew Campaign for Responsible Mining, the Heritage Foundation and the presidential campaigns of Sens.

13,"One way to clear Arizona's air of all the stuff that smears our skies and chokes our lungs -- the particulates, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone -- is to just stop.\Stop driving. Stop building things. Stop relying on power plants that belch pollutants.\The sustainability movement would take a less drastic, but still effective, approach to air quality: Do something that strikes an enduring balance between the demands of growing communities and the environment.\The problem is, some of the steps people can take to improve the air may seem inadequate or ineffective because the results are not immediately apparent. Ride the bus, form a carpool, even get a neighbor on board and what changes outside?\That is where sustainability's grass-roots nature can play an important role. Individual acts and personal responsibility are valued and encouraged. What people do on their own can lead to larger steps from business and, ultimately, government leaders.\Bad air is a problem easy to see. Far-reaching solutions remain elusive.\...\Driving: Americans could save 1.6 billion gallons of gas by maintaining proper tire pressure.\...\Faced with a 64-mile round-trip commute between his horse-property near Gold Canyon and his workplace in Phoenix, Joe Yarina bought a Smart car.\The vehicle is itself a product of a sustainability initiative, built by a European partnership using recycled and recyclable materials. Its tires don't even spit the grains of rubber that aggravate Phoenix's brown cloud.\The car's defining feature is its size, about 8 feet long and 5 feet wide. Yarina's 2006 model gets about 50 miles per gallon and emits less than a third the carbon dioxide of a typical car.\""It's incredible what that little car can do,"" Yarina said. ""It can't be beat. It's roomy, parking is a cinch, it handles quick and easy and it climbs like a bat out of you-know-what.""\Yarina and his wife left Tempe 22 years ago, seeking more room for their horses. For a while, he drove a GMC Sierra King Cab pickup, but as gas prices rose, he became more conscious of the money he spent to get to and from work.\After a lot of research, he settled on a Smart car, which earned safety ratings as impressive as its gas mileage. He paid $25,000, a premium over the similarly sized, $14,000 Toyota Yaris.\Yarina shrugs off the up-front cost. He pays slightly more than $20 to fill his gas tank, and after a week's commuting, there is still a gallon to spare. Studies by the California Air Resources Board have concluded that cheaper operating costs would generally offset the higher costs of low-emission cars and trucks.\...\Travel: If the entire New York City taxi fleet were converted to hybrids, it would save the emissions of 24,000 cars.\...\Vehicle emissions are responsible for about 39 percent of the greenhouse gases in Arizona's air and contribute heavily to concentrations of urban ozone and particulates.\Statewide, power plants make up another 39 percent of the greenhouse gas inventory, but in urban Maricopa and Pima counties, vehicles -- cars and trucks on the roadways, construction equipment -- account for most of the pollution. Arizona's county governments have set goals to reduce air pollution on a large scale, though the Legislature has declined to extend such goals outside the largest urban areas.\One of the most controversial plans to clean up air on a regional scale is to establish a cap-and-trade system aimed at power plants and other non-mobile sources of pollutants. The government would set air-quality limits, or caps, and then allow polluters that reduce emissions below the cap to sell the difference in credits to polluters that exceed the limits.\Such plans face strong opposition from industry and lawmakers, mostly over who would set the caps and which countries and businesses would bear the greatest burden. In the meantime, smaller-scale efforts are under way across the state.\...\Air-conditioning: Getting one unit tuned up can save 220 pounds of carbon per year.\...\In a warehouse-sized building on the south end of Tucson, an upstart company called Global Research Technologies has built a machine its inventors say could work almost like a huge vacuum for air pollution.\The machine is an example of new carbon-capture technology, an idea that is the focus of widespread research among electric-power providers. But while utilities would capture pollutants from a stationary source, Global Research wants to tackle the more elusive mobile sources, such as cars and trucks.\Prototypes suggest the device, about the size of an industrial shipping container, could remove 1 ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in a day, about what a typical motorist produces in 10 weeks of driving.\Once captured, the carbon could be injected into underground rock formations and stored or perhaps sold for industrial uses. Injecting carbon into the ground is called carbon sequestration.\Millions of the carbon capture devices would have to be deployed to dramatically reduce carbon levels in the atmosphere, and the machines would require significant sources of renewable energy to avoid further fouling the air.\But, in an interview with The Arizona Republic last year, Global Research President Allen Wright compared the work in his company's lab to the Wright Brothers' first glider.\""Mankind has done big things all its life,"" Wright said. ""Big stuff shouldn't be scary. It's just big.""\...\Home: Adding weather stripping to your doors and windows can save 1,600 pounds of carbon from electrical generation per year.\...\Arizona's three major power providers, Phoenix-based Arizona Public Service Co. and Salt River Project and Tucson Electric Power, are participating in a carbon-storage pilot project near the Cholla power plant in Joseph City. The project is a test to determine whether the methods would be viable commercially. Carbon dioxide will be brought to the site and pumped about three-quarters of a mile into an underground rock formation, where it will be stored and monitored.\""The challenge is to keep the CO2 down there,"" said William Auberle, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northern Arizona University who has studied carbon capture. ""We're still learning about the technology, about leaks and other issues.""\The Clean Air Act regulates air quality and sets federal standards, but Arizona's urban areas have struggled to meet those standards. Maricopa County remains under order by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reduce particulates, the fine bits of dust that can lodge themselves in lungs and impair breathing.\The county got more bad news earlier this year when the EPA set higher standards for ozone, a colorless, odorless gas that can worsen symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases. The new rules could put Maricopa County in violation of the law again.\...\Trash: When 1 ton of plastic bags is reused, the energy of 11 barrels of oil is saved.\...\Patti Sand believes the bad air over Phoenix contributed to the death two years ago of her 11-year-old grandson, Joseph Chavez.\Joseph suffered from asthma. He took medication and underwent breathing treatments, but he remained active and in the fall of 2006 joined the school cross-country team.\Sand remembers the day he died: Sept. 13. Pollution advisories had been posted. After running for a while, Joseph was hit by an asthma attack.\His mother took him home for a breathing treatment, but he still struggled to breathe. She rushed him to Banner Estrella Medical Center in west Phoenix.\Arriving at the hospital a short time later, Sand hurried down a hall and saw nurses hugging and crying. She knew. Joseph died later that evening.\Sand contacted the Arizona chapter of the American Lung Association the next day to find out what she could do to help spare other families a similar tragedy.\She learned that 548,000 Arizonans suffer from asthma, one of the highest rates in the nation. As many as 80 Arizonans die of asthma each year.\Since Joseph died, Sand has told her story to other families, she's volunteered her time and she's raised money for the annual asthma walk, joining the JoJo Team, named after her grandson.\""I feel it's going to get worse, that it's going to become a big epidemic if we don't do something about our air quality,"" Sand said.\""One of the things my grandson used to love is the sunsets,"" she said. ""You look at that sunset and you think, 'Wow, it's a beautiful sight.'

Research has focused on injecting the CO2 into porous rock formations. Many questions remain about long-term storage and whether the captured CO2 could be used commercially.\Interest is also growing in terrestrial storage, a method of reducing CO2 emissions using land and vegetation management. For example, overgrown forests could be cleared of fire fuels and the material used for biomass power production. This helps avoid fires that spew carbon into the air and reduces decomposition of old vegetation that would put methane into the air.\This alternative would be less expensive and could produce other benefits to the health of forests and wetland habitats, but it is also harder to monitor and measure.\Arizona is part of a Western carbon sequestration partnership exploring both options.\|\in their own words\THE RESEARCHER: JONATHAN FINK\Jonathan Fink is the director of the Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State University.\There's a reason there's a ""global"" in the Global Institute of Sustainability.

14,"President Barack Obama's call Tuesday for carbon-emission restrictions at coal-fired power plants drew angry responses from Republicans in Arizona's congressional district and praise from environmentalists who called it overdue.\The president ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to begin a public process to create the first rule that would regulate carbon from new and existing plants. Coal plants, including one that helps power much of the Southwest and pumps Colorado River water to Phoenix, are the nation's largest source of greenhouse gases.\Navajo Generating Station near Page is the West's largest coal-fired plant and already is the subject of proposed EPA rules to reduce haze at a cost of up to $1billion.\""President Obama's war on coal and war on Arizona jobs continues,"" Rep.

""Whether it's through unreasonable environmental requirements, delays in permits or burdensome regulations on coal-powered plants such as Navajo Generating Station, this administration's policies threaten our livelihoods.""\Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., posted criticism on his Facebook page.\""Though we never ratified the Kyoto (climate) Protocol,"" he wrote, ""our country was able to reduce (carbon dioxide) through new technology in the private sector, not top-down, economic-crushing government mandates.""\Obama, speaking to students at Georgetown University, predicted the ""job killer"" criticism. He said industry lobbyists made the same claims about earlier legislation to clean the air, increase fuel economy and reduce acid rain, only to watch business innovate and create jobs to meet those government challenges.\""That's what they've said every time America sets better standards for our air and our water and our children's health,"" he said, ""and every time they've been wrong.""\The president said the environment used to be a bipartisan issue and should be again. He noted that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has previously supported cap-and-trade legislation. A spokesman for McCain did not respond to a request for comment.\Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., called Obama's plan ""a good first step.""\""The time for false choices and outdated rhetoric is over,"" he said in a written statement.

15,"While both presidential candidates' energy proposals are a step in the right direction, they are inadequate when compared to the scope of the problem of global warming.\Individuals and corporations need fiscal incentives to change their practices. Simple social responsibility cannot be depended on to make a big-enough impact to reverse the damage caused by humanity. Much like the candidate's proposals, a policy of cap and trade of carbon emissions needs to be implemented immediately with a low carbon emission cap.\Additionally, fuel-efficiency standards for new cars need to be raised to at least 40 miles per gallon by 2020. In order to meet this goal, the government needs to create financial rewards for technological innovation.\Climate change will not be counteracted unless individuals change their wasteful habits. However, this will not happen without specific incentives for them to do so.\Inefficient practices need to be taxed, while conservation should be financially rewarded. At this point in time, with the current state of climate change, a few small changes from a small number of people is not enough.\Businesses and people alike need fiscal incentives to change in order to protect the environment, and, in turn, themselves.\-- Ciara Rinaudo, Phoenix"
16,"TEA parties, fireworks, picnics and sunscreen filled our Fourth celebration with a blend of uneasiness, yet respite. Among many, there's a sense that things aren't right, that freedoms are slipping, while our celebration is dearly familiar.\I've long loved the East Valley. As a teen, I celebrated the Fourth, in Mesa, with area cowboys and those who pretended to be, dancing away the night at the Mezona Hall on Main Street. Of course, there were always national problems then, but what sustained our days were the love of God, family and substantial boundaries for healthy conduct.\The faces of those three stabilizers are now deeply altered, in such a way as to be unrecognizable. The absolute, strangest shift is what ""God"" has become. Columnist George Will (Newsweek, June 22) has one take on the phenomenon. He says, ""Global warming has become like God: It is an explanation for everything and an all-purpose excuse for the political class to do whatever it wants to do."" Further, ""Green reasoning is the first refuge of scoundrels.""\Immediate evidence of this truth came this past week. It was leaked that the Environmental Protection Agency snuffed data that questioned the validity of global warming and whether ""carbon dioxide must be strictly regulated by the federal government.""\Of course, any further information on the lack of scientific evidence could harm the push by President Barack Obama and Congress to shove through the cap-and-trade bill.\Today, the U.S. Senate is gearing up to give the Green God even more power as members prepare to pass their version. Only days ago, eight Republican Congress persons made sure the House version got approved, while 40 Democrats voted against the scheme. The deed is almost done unless citizens rise up in overwhelming protest. It's one thing to celebrate freedoms; it's another to fight for them. (Capitol switchboard: 202-224-3121.)\Those who study this Pandora's box tell us it is the most oppressive measure ever to be considered; some call it ""the battle of our lifetime."" They warn of ""skyrocketing"" energy costs (Obama's own description) and predict the loss of jobs and freedoms. Amazingly, they contend that it won't improve the environment one iota and it's failed in Europe. (One source: www.heritage.org.)\Some claim it enhances the Obama plan to bring all aspects of American lifestyle under federal oversight (e.g. controls the usage and cost of energy and water) and will aid in his intentions to equalize wealth.\The renowned British philosopher, Edmund Burke, says this about egalitarianism: Government has never been able to equalize incomes. But, it can destroy and enslave. ""A perfect equality will indeed be produced, that is to say, equal wretchedness, equal beggary, and, on the part of the petitioners, a woeful, helpless, and desperate disappointment."" In other words, he warns the playing field will, indeed, become level. ""They pull down what is above; they never raise what is below.""\Truth is it's all about politics, not compassion. It's about shifting America into full-blown socialism, rather than allowing competition to solve pollution issues; it's a war against profits.\Many do not believe this is upon us. They prefer to trust the Pied Piper, to be taken care of by Big Brother. They are the uninformed, the feel-good group, the naive.\As each precious freedom is taken off the table, will the Fourth go the way of Washington and Lincoln's holidays, of Christmas and even Thanksgiving? Will we celebrate what was Independence Day or just try to forget it?\Linda Turley-Hansen is a syndicated columnist and former television news anchor who lives in the East Valley.

17,"A week after a state panel approved rules for cleaner car emissions, the Legislature Monday passed a bill that would block those rules from taking effect.\The action also prevents state agencies from taking part in the Western Climate Initiative, a multistate program to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Gov. Janet Napolitano joined the initiative in February 2007.\In fact, House Bill 2017 is as much a rebuke of the Democratic governor and what lawmakers see as her improper use of executive authority as it is a rejection of programs to control greenhouse gases.\With the House's 36-22 vote, the bill moves to the governor for what everyone expects will be a speedy veto. The Senate approved the bill last month.\""This isn't about the greenhouse effect, this isn't about the environment,"" said Speaker Jim Weiers, R-Phoenix.\Instead, it's about the separation of powers, something Weiers and others say the governor violated when she entered into agreements such as the Clean Car Program and the Western Climate Initiative.\The Clean Car Program, which the governor joined in September 2006, aims to cut the emissions from cars, light trucks and SUVs that contribute to global warming. It would be phased in beginning with new cars in 2012 and take full effect in 2016. The Governor's Regulatory Review Committee approved the rules last week.\The seven states and three Canadian provinces participating in the climate initiative are working on a draft plan to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. That plan is due in August, but industry officials in Arizona worry that they will be forced into standards dictated by its large neighbor to the west, California.\Those concerns are another motivating force behind HB 2017, and were on full display at a Monday morning news conference held by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\The chamber unveiled a poll that Chamber President Glenn Hamer said showed Arizonans, while supporting steps to curb climate change, want to know the economic cost of doing so.\But the poll offered few specifics on what the cost-inducing programs would be. When pressed on that, Hamer said the details ""didn't matter.""\""This shows people are going to be very, very price-sensitive,"" he said.\One question suggested electric and natural-gas prices could climb 45 percent to 260 percent depending on whether any programs to reduce carbon emissions are put in place, without detailing what those programs would be. Seventy-nine percent of those polled said they oppose the idea of implementing such programs if they would have to pay for them.\Hamer said the estimates came from the Electric Policy Research Institute. But since programs won't be unveiled until August, opponents have based estimates on projections of what a cap-and-trade program and other measures might do."
18,"If Gov. Janet Napolitano heads to Washington to serve in President-elect Barack Obama's Cabinet, it could portend a major shift in policy for one of her biggest local priorities: climate change.\Environmental groups, elected officials and other political watchers say that a new Republican administration, under the helm of now-Secretary of State Jan Brewer, would likely significantly reduce Arizona's involvement in the Western Climate Initiative.\Napolitano was a founding member of the regional effort, which brings several Western states and a handful of Canadian provinces together to limit and reduce man-made greenhouse gases, among other things.\Although all the WCI partners have signed off on the concept of emission reductions through a cap-and-trade system, each state is responsible for passing its own laws and rewriting its own regulations to accomplish goals.\""From an environmental perspective, if she leaves, I think we are in big trouble,"" said Sandy Bahr, who lobbies the state Legislature in behalf of the Sierra Club's Arizona chapter. ""I think probably the greatest disappointment is that if she is leaving early, some of the things she's done will be undone in no time.""\Over the past six years, Napolitano has worked with -- and, in many cases, done battle with -- legislators and industry on a host of environmental initiatives, including:\* Forest restoration. This includes efforts to minimize and prevent future forest fires through thinning and controlled burns.\* Clean air. Napolitano pushed for and ultimately signed into law a wide-ranging bill that limited the use of leaf blowers, placed new restrictions on the construction industry and called for the paving of vacant lots and road shoulders in an effort to reduce particulates in the air.\* Reduced tailpipe emissions. In an unpopular move, the governor gave the state's Department of Environmental Quality broad authority to write new rules requiring new cars, light trucks and SUVs sold in Arizona to emit lower levels of carbon dioxide and other contaminants linked to global warming. The rules have not yet taken effect, pending the outcome of a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which blocked California from adopting similar standards.\But although Napolitano has frequently used the Governor's Office as a platform for advancing eco-friendly initiatives, perhaps none has caused as much controversy, particularly at the state Legislature, as her support of the regional climate initiative.\Critics, which include both business interests and Republican legislators, say the governor has been putting the state's economy at risk by pushing the group's climate-change goals.\""That is the one area that makes us the most nervous, where we are the most unhappy ... or concerned is probably the best way to put it,"" said Marc Osborn, a lobbyist for the Arizona Manufacturer's Council.\Osborn said some of the WCI's stated goals, including reducing fossil-fuel consumption by making it more expensive, will mean higher energy costs for consumers.\And if the cost of doing business here increases, that could drive companies out of the state, Osborn said.\Although Brewer, who will replace Napolitano if the governor departs, is not yet willing to talk about her agenda, others are already speculating that she might proceed differently from the Democratic governor.\""As far as what I know about Jan Brewer, I would say she is probably not going to go along with (the WCI),"" said Republican Rep. Ray Barnes, who serves as chairman of the House Environment Committee, adding that other priorities, such as dealing with the state's billion-dollar budget deficit, would likely be higher on the new governor's to-do list.\If that's the case, it could mean that Brewer and any appointees at the Environmental Quality Department could choose not to author new rules limiting greenhouse gases. Business backers say they are hopeful that Brewer would provide a sympathetic ear.\""We'd much prefer to see international cooperation on issues like this,"" said Ann Seiden, spokeswoman for the Arizona Chamber of Commerce. ""Looking at everything through an economic lens is especially needed right now, and that is something that we would encourage the governor or her successor ... to do.""\Seiden said the Chamber has not yet had any direct conversations with Brewer on the WCI or other environmental policies or issues but said, ""I think we have a great relationship with (her).""\|\Governor's issues\A look at Gov. Janet Napolitano's signature issues and how they would be affected by her departure."
19,"President Barack Obama entered the White House one year ago Wednesday with everything going for him: Momentum from his historic election, high poll numbers and overwhelming Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.\But Obama and Congress took on an ambitious agenda that they couldn't finish in 2009.\Although Obama scored some big legislative victories such as the passage of the $787 billion economic-stimulus package, historic tobacco-industry regulations and credit-card reform, he found Capitol Hill something of a quagmire for his top domestic priorities such as health-care reform, climate-change legislation and financial-services regulation. The drawn-out and bruising health-care battle pushed other major issues such as immigration reform to the back burner.\With health-care reform likely in its precarious final stages -- House and Senate leaders are ironing out differences between bills passed in each chamber -- Congress this week resumes working toward the other major goals its leaders outlined in 2009, as well as on the still-sluggish economic recovery.\Lawmakers aim to tackle complicated issues, including job creation, immigration reform and climate change. But they'll have less time than last year to do it because many face re-election and must devote time to their political campaigns at home.\Meanwhile, Obama's poll ratings continue to droop, and the Senate Democratic caucus faces the possibility of losing its filibuster-proof 60-member majority after November -- or even after this week, if Republicans win an upset Tuesday in the unexpectedly tough fight for the late Sen. Edward Kennedy's seat in Massachusetts.\It's a lot of work, but some political experts believe the current Congress is up to the task, noting it already has made historic progress.\""Most Congresses would not be able to get this done,"" said Rodolfo Espino, an assistant professor of political science at Arizona State University. ""But if you look at what this Congress has done in the last year, they've really charged forward on a lot of fronts more quickly than most observers of Congress would have thought was possible.""\Some recent developments might make the Democratic Congress' job even tougher -- while adding to its urgency to finish what it started while it can.\Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., came under fire this month after a new book about the 2008 campaign revealed he made clumsy racial comments about Obama. Reid, who is up for re-election this year, is reeling in the polls back home. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the embattled chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, announced he will retire rather than face voters again in November. Veteran Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., also has said he won't run again.\Election-year dynamics will complicate matters even further. Traditionally, lawmakers don't take on as heavy a workload -- and are more reluctant to tackle hot-button, politically controversial topics -- as during non-election years. By the summer, many members will start fixating on their races, a reality that leadership accepts and understands will affect Capitol Hill's work schedule.\""That will shorten the calendar quite a bit,"" said Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., the senior member of the state's House delegation. ""You'll see us going in later in the week and probably leaving earlier in the week. The calendar is dictated a lot by what's happening in the different elections. We'll probably be done in October.""\By contrast, the Senate last year didn't pass its version of the health-care bill until Christmas Eve.\Still, it's not impossible to get things done even during midterm-election years, particularly in the first six months or so. Although Congress tried and was unable to pass immigration reform in 2006, it did enact other legislation such as the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, a law cracking down on child predators and sex offenders. In 2002, the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate kept busy responding to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the looming Iraq war but also passed campaign-finance reform and enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, designed to minimize corporate accounting scandals like the one that led to the downfall of Enron.\Immigration reform\So far, the prospect of an abbreviated schedule amid election-year politics hasn't made Democratic leaders and Obama administration officials shy away from contentious issues such as comprehensive immigration reform.\During the presidential campaign, Obama promised Hispanic voters that he would try to fix the nation's broken immigration system early in his administration. But even some rank-and-file lawmakers who support the idea are skeptical that Congress can get it done this year.\""I think that the president is very intent on this being part of the 2010 agenda,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Obama's point-person on immigration reform and a former Arizona governor, recently told The Arizona Republic's Editorial Board. ""It would have to go early in 2010, but as you can tell from the newspapers now, they are making real headway on health care, and as health care gets resolved, there will be time now opening up legislatively to look at immigration, to look at financial regulatory reform ... to look at job creation.""\The House will wait for the Senate to pass an immigration bill now in development by Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. The strategy, Pastor said, is for the House to quickly pass whatever measure makes it out of the upper chamber. House Democratic leaders don't intend to facilitate ""a prolonged debate"" on what they know is ""a political hot potato,"" he said.\""If immigration reform isn't done by early spring, it's not going to happen. They'll take it off the table,"" Pastor said.\Jobs and banking\Obama will lay out his 2010 priorities in his State of the Union address to Congress, which has not yet been formally scheduled but could be as soon as Jan. 26. The White House had hoped that the House and Senate would reconcile differences in their competing versions of the health-care legislation before the speech, but that might not happen.\The economy is back on Obama's radar screen in a big way. The stimulus package was a major accomplishment of his first year in the Oval Office, but the national unemployment rate remains at 10 percent. Obama may call for some additional stimulus-style jobs spending.\""They have got to start focusing on jobs because the job situation is still bad, the economy is still in the tank, and we've been spending all this time talking about health care and the environment,"" said Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., the No. 2 Senate GOP leader. ""And my guess is, in his State of the Union, Obama is going to do nothing but talk about the deficit and jobs.""\The House passed a jobs bill before recessing for the holidays, but the Senate has yet to act.\""With unemployment as it is, and jobs and the economy being an issue, obviously there will be something (done to address the problem),"" Pastor said.\The Obama administration and Democratic leaders also aim to enact a battery of new regulations, including a possible fee on banks, to protect consumers and taxpayers and help rein in the financial-industry excesses that contributed to the 2008 economic meltdown.\Dodd's intention to retire might actually free him up to pursue even more aggressive changes, Espino said.\""They know that Americans are very angry at Wall Street profits while the American people on Main Street are suffering very badly,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\Much else still to do\Another holdover from last year is energy reform and climate change. The House narrowly passed a sweeping and in some quarters controversial cap-and-trade measure in June, but the legislation quickly ran into trouble in the Senate.\Democrats from some states, such as coal-friendly West Virginia, don't like the bill. McCain, who in the past has been sympathetic to fighting global warming, said he is disappointed the measure does not address nuclear power, which he supports, in any meaningful way. He called the legislation protectionist because it would put tariffs on goods from countries that don't meet U.S. environmental standards.\""As far as I'm concerned, what they've got now is a non-starter,"" McCain said.\In addition to such outstanding major issues, Congress also is responsible for passing a budget and a series of appropriations bills and must decide the fate of President George W. Bush's signature tax cuts, which are set to expire this year. The Senate may need to consider one or two international treaties, too, Kyl said. One is a new arms-reduction treaty. A comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty that the Senate rejected in 1999 also may return.\That raises questions about how much lawmakers can reasonably expect to accomplish given this year's election constraints on their time. Last year demonstrated how easy it is to underestimate how long it takes to pass complex, landmark pieces of legislation.\""Congress works a little bit slower than the president wants -- that's always the case,"" Espino said.\Rep. Harry Mitchell, D-Ariz., said there is always a possibility that lawmakers might have to return to work after the November elections for a lame-duck session, as they did in 2008, when they bailed out the sinking U.S. auto industry, and in 2006.\""No one really likes them, but they end up happening anyway,"" he said."
20,"In a sense, this is where it all began for Sen. Barack Obama.\Four years ago, a national political star was born at the Democratic National Convention in Boston when he delivered the keynote address to the party faithful.\Now, Democrats gather this week in Denver to formally nominate Obama, who in those four years has rocketed from Illinois state senator to U.S. senator to best-selling author and presidential front-runner.\His historic campaign has defied expert predictions and shattered fundraising records. He inherits a party still stinging from back-to-back close election losses and faces voters clamoring for change in troubled times.\While Obama, the first African-American candidate to top a major-party ticket, has become an international celebrity and a hero to the left, political experts say he enters his party's convention still seeking to win over the nation's trust. With Republicans less enthusiastic about their candidate, Arizona's Sen. John McCain, some see the election as Obama's to lose.\This week, they say, poses a critical test for Obama: Can he make the case that America is ready for a Democrat, ready for his policies and ready for a Black president.\""He has run a great campaign ... and yet he is still incredibly vulnerable because he is such an unknown quantity to so many Americans,"" said Dan Gerstein, a New York-based Democratic strategist. ""You just can't overstate how groundbreaking his campaign is.""\Rich Galen, a Republican strategist in Washington, said Obama's celebrity belies an empty agenda and will ultimately backfire.\""The Paris Hilton ad (run by the McCain campaign) was exactly what is already on people's minds,"" Galen said. ""All that he (Obama) is interested in is big crowds and bright lights.""\On Thursday, Obama is scheduled to accept his party's nomination before as many as 80,000 at Invesco Field. To win over undecided voters, experts say, the speech must feel like a populist celebration, not an ostentatious coronation.\Gaining an edge\Obama enters the convention ahead in the polls and with reason to be optimistic.\For starters, there is the money. About 2 million people have contributed to his campaign, and he is the first candidate to forgo public matching funds in the general election. By comparison, the McCain fundraising operation is good but not brilliant.\On the issues, Obama opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq before it started. And polls suggest voters trust Obama more on the economy, seemingly giving him an edge in two of the biggest concerns voters have noted.\Beyond that, at times his campaign has seemed transcendent. To his supporters, Obama is not just the presidential front-runner but a symbol of what they think America aspires to be.\Born in 1961 in Hawaii to a woman from Kansas and a man from Kenya, Obama has a background unlike any other presidential candidate.\His parents met when both were students at the University of Hawaii. They separated and divorced when Obama was about 2.\In 1967, his mother married a man from Indonesia, and Obama spent four years in Jakarta. In 1971, Obama moved back to Hawaii to live with his American grandparents.\He graduated from Columbia University in New York in 1983 with a degree in political science. He settled in Chicago and worked several jobs for five years before going to law school at Harvard University. In 1991, he graduated with honors and later began teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago.\A year later, he married his wife, Michelle. In 1996, Obama won a seat in the Illinois Senate representing Chicago's South Side. Four years later, he lost in his bid for the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2004, after his convention speech, he easily won a seat in the U.S. Senate.\Seizing opportunity\At the Democratic convention that year, Obama drew rave reviews for a speech that signaled his ""post-partisanship"" by speaking of an America that isn't divided along party lines.\""We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states,"" he said. ""We coach Little League in the blue states, and yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. ... We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.""\In his four years in the Senate, Obama has been among the most reliable of votes for Democrats. He has sponsored 129 bills since 2007 alone, yet unlike McCain, isn't associated with any memorable legislation in his Senate career.\Obama is seen as charismatic in a way that disarms many of his opponents, a quality not seen since President Reagan. He is a gifted speaker whose lofty rhetoric conjures President Kennedy.\There are doubts about the 47-year-old's readiness, given his status as a first-term senator.\But Obama arrives in Denver as the nation is weary of a lame-duck Republican president and as Democrats seem poised to tighten their control of both chambers of Congress.\If McCain, at 71 and eight years removed from his maverick heyday, seems to be fighting bad timing, at times Obama has often seemed to have the political winds at his back.\Still vulnerable\Still, for all his political advantages, Obama's lead is a narrow one. In several key swing states -- Florida, Missouri and Ohio -- Obama has consistently trailed McCain in polling.\""I think it's exactly as close as people think it is,"" said Galen, the GOP strategist. ""It's dead even because he hasn't been able to make the case. ... Their biggest weakness is their hubris.""\During the Democratic primaries, Obama gained the strategic upper hand on Sen. Hillary Clinton, fumbled on several occasions and allowed her to remain competitive, then limped across the finish line with a thin lead.\The summer campaign has followed a similar course. In July, Obama returned from Europe and the Middle East largely to acclaim and after the McCain campaign endured a series of high-profile gaffes. But McCain hit Obama anew with charges of elitism and playing racial politics. The polls tightened.\Entering the convention, Obama's biggest worry may well be managing expectations. On Thursday, Obama will accept his party's nomination 45 years to the day after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. stepped into history with his ""I have a dream"" speech.\Obama's speech will, no doubt, be stirring. It also will be followed one week later by the biggest public display of former prisoner-of-war McCain and his heroic biography. It is the closest the parties' conventions have been since 1956 and the latest they have ever been held. The timing will test whether either man gets a convention bounce this year.\Afterward, Obama faces a sobering electoral map.\Polling suggests McCain is likely to carry most of the South and the Great Plains. Obama is expected to win the northeast and the West Coast. Giving each man his home state, they could be fighting over fewer than 15 states.\Obama is running well in Colorado, Iowa and New Mexico, states Bush carried four years ago. But it still leaves an electoral margin as thin as the epic 2000 race.\Liz Chadderdon, a Virginia-based Democratic consultant, said Republicans picked their strongest candidate, one who is more popular than his party at the moment. It should keep the race close, she said.\Gerstein, also a Democrat, agrees.\""It will continue to be that close until (Obama) breaks that trust barrier,"" he said.\|\Barack Obama: PARTY: Democrat.

21,"With the final piece of the presidential puzzle in place, the picture now seems even less clear.\By picking Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, Sen. John McCain sent an unmistakable message Friday that he intends to shore up the conservative wing of his party while aggressively competing for women voters, a crucial bloc for Democrats and a group still smoldering with disappointment for Sen. Hillary Clinton.\For Democrats, who collectively exhaled in relief 12 hours earlier after a harmonious convention, the surprise selection likely means Sen. Barack Obama will have to work much harder for women voters through Election Day.\For McCain, the pick further burnishes his reputation as a political maverick, someone willing to gamble a shot at the White House with a vice-presidential nominee with arguably thinner credentials than the man he has criticized as unfit for the office.\In her first appearance as McCain's running mate, Palin immediately reached out to all women by paying respects to Democrats Clinton and Geraldine Ferraro, who in 1984 was the first woman to run as a vice-presidential nominee.\""It turns out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling,"" Palin said, referring to Clinton's historic run this year and to comments Clinton has made that her supporters put 18 million cracks in the nation's glass ceiling. Palin's comment drew thunderous applause.\It is a gambit that worked well with the 12,000 in attendance.\""Washington will never be the same. That's a good thing,"" said Richard Strong, a 78-year-old retiree from Huber Heights, Ohio. His wife, Rosa Maria, said simply, ""It's a very wise choice.""\Palin, 44, is a little-known, first-term governor and mother of five. Central casting could hardly have chosen someone with as much to please conservatives while still dramatically altering the electoral calculus of the presidential race.\""She's exactly who I need. She's exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old politics of me first and country second,"" McCain said in announcing his selection on his 72nd birthday.\Palin is a hunter and a one-time beauty contestant. She has cut taxes and stood up to the oil interests that dominate the Alaskan economy. She has a son who is headed to fight in Iraq and another she chose to have knowing he had Down syndrome.\Her executive record is short: two years as governor, a stint on the Wasilla City Council and later its mayor. But her outside-the-Beltway status could help in a year when Republicans are generally drained of enthusiasm.\McCain's campaign successfully kept Palin's selection under wraps until about two hours before his rally here. While word of his choice seeped out, many at the Nutter Center still didn't know even as McCain began describing his pick. He deliberately used language that didn't give away the secret.\When McCain made clear his choice was a woman, startled women in the crowd threw their hands into the air and screamed their approval. One woman's mouth fell open, another shook her head in amazement.\Allan Saxe, a political-science professor at University of Texas-Arlington, called McCain's choice ""an absolute home run,"" one guaranteed to drive the Obama-Biden campaign ""bananas.""\""The conservative right wanted John McCain to pick Mitt Romney, and in a sense, he did. She is everything Mitt Romney is, except a woman.""\The only downside, Saxe said, is the Democrats will beat her up over a lack of experience. But then, Obama lacks a lengthy national political record, he said, so that argument may be a wash.\McCain first met Palin in February with a group of governors at the National Governors meeting. He came away impressed, said Charlie Black, a senior McCain adviser who was there for the initial meeting.\""(He) talked to her at length about energy after that meeting,"" Black said.\""Then, separately, we had a reception that night for Republican governors, and the two of them talked at great length. I wasn't standing in on that conversation, but I think he had a great impression of her from their first meeting.""\Entering the day, it was widely believed that McCain was considering former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Both men may have brought strengths to the ticket, but each also had limited appeal.\In choosing Palin over Romney, McCain effectively heads off a battle on conservative credentials that would have inevitably trailed Romney to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., next week. Romney upheld abortion rights and spoke in favor of gay rights earlier in his career.\Pawlenty, 47, is considered a rising star in GOP circles but one who has yet to forge an identity in the national arena. He may have helped Republicans in Minnesota, but he would have been a stranger almost everywhere else.\""The short list went to a vetting process,"" Black said, ""and at the end of the vetting process, McCain felt he had a number of good choices.\""Then, he was the one who had to think it through and make a decision.\""Obviously, he was very excited about her. I know that over the last few days he thought he had a lot of good choices. I think he made his final decision (Thursday).""\Strategically, Palin should solidify McCain's grip on Alaska, a state that increasingly appeared competitive for Obama. Democrats haven't carried the state since 1964.\Besides being a conservative, an abortion opponent and a mother, Palin also is an avid sportswoman, a factor that will appeal to gun owners from Texas to rural Pennsylvania to Ohio and among a blue-collar demographic where Obama struggles.\McCain's choice, Saxe said, may be the most critical pick for vice president since 1960 when John F. Kennedy picked Lyndon Johnson as a running mate. ""John Kennedy needed Texas, and he needed the South, and LBJ gave it to him,"" Saxe said. ""This is similar. McCain needs to get a boost from conservative Republicans and more of the women's vote.""\|\John McCain: PARTY: Republican. AGE: 72.

22,"The Navajo Generating Station, the huge coal-fired power plant outside Page, supplies a fraction of Arizona's electricity demand, but its role in moving water to the state's largest cities has thrust it into a growing battle over the cost of cleaning up air pollution.\In the two months since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules that would require costly new air-scrubbing equipment at the plant, the debate has escalated into a war of increasingly dire predictions: Tribal economies could collapse. The plant itself could close. The price of water sold to Phoenix and Tucson could quadruple.\Environmental groups have targeted Navajo and the nearby Four Corners Power Plant for years because of the emissions-related haze that builds up over the Grand Canyon and other fragile landscapes. The EPA ranks Navajo as the nation's third-largest emitter of nitrogen oxides, pollutants created when coal is burned. Four Corners is the second-largest.\The new EPA rules, if adopted by the agency, would force owners of the two plants to install complex new air scrubbers that use ammonia to break down the pollutants. Navajo's owners say the systems cost too much money and could push power rates out of reach for the plant's users. They also argue that the added scrubbers would produce visibility improvements imperceptible to human eyes.\One reason tempers have flared is the unusual role the generating station plays, both in its own backyard and in the state's population centers.\The coal burned to produce electricity is mined on the nearby Hopi and Navajo Indian reservations, and tribal members supply much of the labor needed to keep the plant running. If the plant closed, the tribes would lose the jobs and millions of dollars in revenue from the coal.\Although the tribes have long sided with environmentalists on resource issues, leaders condemned the Sierra Club and other groups for supporting the EPA plan, creating schisms within the tribes.\The plant, owned by five utilities and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, powers the state's largest conveyor of water, the Central Arizona Project Canal, supplying electricity cheaply enough to pump water 3,000 feet uphill, from the Colorado River to Phoenix and Tucson.\That link between water and energy has raised anew doubts about subsidizing cheap water with cheap electricity, but CAP officials say there's little question that the EPA plan would result in higher prices for water users.\""What we do can't be done without water or power,"" said David Modeer, general manager of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District. ""Power is the biggest expense related to the price of our water. I can't think of any bigger threat to us other than the Colorado going dry.""\Opposing proposals\The EPA outlined its proposal to require the tighter pollution controls at Navajo in a densely worded document published in the Federal Register in August. The power plant's partners knew something was coming but expected federal regulators to consider a less-expensive option discussed late in 2008.\""We were quite surprised that it departed so much from what we had proposed,"" said Richard Hayslip, an associate general manager at Salt River Project, the plant's managing partner. ""The signals were pretty positive that they were agreeing with what we talked about. It was a little disappointing.""\SRP had submitted an alternate proposal late last year, one aimed at trying to reduce pollution from the plant in what the utility believed was a more cost-effective way.\That plan included ongoing work to install more-efficient burners that would reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides, one of the chief sources of pollution from coal burning. The low-NO{-x} burners, as they're called, would cost about $43 million to install and would not raise operating costs significantly.\The EPA proposed a more advanced air-scrubbing system that uses ammonia to reduce pollutants. The system, known as Selective Catalytic Reduction, could cost $600 million to $1 billion to install, according to SRP estimates, and would add about $13 million a year to the plant's operating budget, expenses that would be passed on to users.\The ammonia must be injected into the system after the coal is burned. The chemical would be delivered to Flagstaff by railroad and then trucked to Page, where the only rail service is a direct line from the Kayenta coal mine that feeds the plant. The process could require additional measures to get rid of sulfuric acid mist produced with the system.\""It would be a very significant capital investment and challenging to do the work,"" said Glenn Reeves, SRP's manager of power generation. ""We would have issues just getting approval from all the owners. There are a lot of uncertainties around coal plants right now.""\The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which holds a 21 percent interest in Navajo, faces strict rules under California law about investing money in coal-fired plants and could decide to walk away from Navajo if the expenses rise too high.\Partners in the Mohave Generating Station near Bullhead City did just that at the end of 2005 amid issues with air-quality rules and the supply of coal. That closure eliminated about 300 jobs at the plant site and 240 jobs filled mostly by coal miners from the Navajo Reservation.\The Navajo Generating Station partners have enlisted Gov. Jan Brewer and have appealed to the state's congressional delegation, but they still fear the EPA is on track to require the costly upgrades.\The agency will accept public comments through the end of the year before making a final decision, which is likely by the middle of 2010.\If the EPA adopts its proposed rules, SRP would have five years to complete the upgrades.\Navajo's owners or its users, such as CAP, could challenge the final ruling or even take the agency to court. All say they are preparing to respond quickly when the decision is made.\Costly consequences\What makes this case more than another fight over utility regulations is Navajo's unusually close ties to the CAP Canal. A spike in power prices at the plant would result in significantly higher water rates for CAP users and could affect the state's ability to store water for future use.\The Navajo Generating Station was built to provide a power supply for the canal, which snakes 336 miles from the Colorado River near Lake Havasu City to Phoenix and Tucson. The power feeds a series of pumps that move 1.5 million acre-feet of water a year -- almost 500 billion gallons -- as much as half the water used by cities and farms in Maricopa, Pinal and Pima counties.\The canal must lift the water a total of almost 3,000 feet in elevation, a task that consumes 2.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity, enough to supply about 200,000 homes.\That makes the CAP the largest single electricity user in Arizona, and it raises the stakes if Navajo's operations are put at risk.\""We do not have an alternative,"" said Susan Bitter Smith, president of the elected board that oversees the canal. ""This is a survival issue for us. We need the EPA to work with us in a rational, logical way that takes into consideration all of the consequences.""\CAP officials are suggesting two possible outcomes if the EPA adopts its proposed rules:\One, the power plant stays open, but the price of electricity spikes by 50 to 100 percent, depending on how many years the cost of the upgrades are amortized. The higher prices would hit all the plant's users, which include utilities in Arizona, Nevada and California.\Two, the partners decide to abandon the plant, and CAP is forced to buy electricity off the grid. In the worst-case scenario, officials believe costs to move water could quadruple.\In either case, CAP would have few options except to pass along the higher costs to its customers -- the cities and water companies that buy water from the canal wholesale -- and to property-tax payers in the three counties.\Phoenix and other cities have written letters urging the EPA to consider the effects of its proposal beyond air quality, to look at the potential for higher water costs.\""We're just asking them to weigh the equities as they look at protecting the visibility around the plant,"" said Tom Buschatzke, water adviser for the city of Phoenix. ""We're trying to make EPA understand the importance of the issue, the way regional and local economies are suffering right now.""\The CAP Canal accounts for 43 percent of Phoenix's water supply, so the city probably couldn't absorb the higher charges, Buschatzke said, meaning at least some of the cost would be passed down to ratepayers.\The long-term effects could grow worse. Phoenix and other cities rely on the state Water Banking Authority to help store water as a hedge against future droughts. The Legislature already has slashed the bank's budget, and if the bank can't buy water, the cities would lose that backup supply.\Higher costs also would affect agricultural users, who now pay below-market prices for CAP water as part of a deal that will make their supplies available to cities by 2030.\And the loss of the plant would deprive the CAP of a critical source of revenue used to help repay the federal government the state's share of the canal's construction costs. Under an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation and the plant's partners, CAP is allotted a certain amount of power and can sell whatever it doesn't need.\If the power isn't there or if it's so expensive no one will buy it, CAP officials would have to raise the needed revenue elsewhere, and their only options are water rates and property taxes.\Environmentalists counter\One of the arguments SRP, CAP and others have made in recent weeks is that the expensive controls proposed by the EPA wouldn't improve air quality enough to justify the huge price tag. SRP suggests that the change in visibility might not even be noticeable to the human eye.\Environmental groups don't buy that argument. They say any improvement will move the plant closer to visibility rules that allow no haze over national parks and other protected lands.\""The standard is no impairment,"" said Roger Clark, who follows the issue for the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust. ""Every increment along the way improves visibility, and that's what the law requires.""\The EPA disagreed with SRP's analysis and argued that the utility and its partners overestimated the cost and underestimated the benefit.\Environmental groups also say the EPA plan is just the first of a one-two punch the power plant will likely face in the coming years. If Congress passes a climate-change bill that includes a cap-and-trade plan to reduce pollutants, Navajo will get hit with the equivalent of a carbon tax.\Clark and others say CAP should invest in alternative energy. Cover the canal with solar panels, for example, and connect them to the transmission lines that already supply the pumping stations along the route.\Covering the canal also would help reduce evaporation from the channel. CAP estimates that it loses about 16,000 acre-feet, or about 5 billion gallons, a year to canal evaporation.\CAP's Modeer acknowledges that renewable energy will play a role in the canal's future, but ""the power that can be generated out of solar under the most advanced technology today still could not provide our base load of power.""\Clark and others say one of the most important questions bubbling up from the dispute is the cost of water in the West.\Water providers and customers don't really pay for the water; they pay for its delivery and treatment. The largest component of CAP's wholesale rate is the cost of energy. That water-energy link is as old as the West's oldest water projects, but it's likely to surface more often as energy prices rise and water resources tighten.\""People say water will get more expensive in the future, but what they mean is it's going to get more expensive to provide it, to move it, to treat it,"" said Sharon Megdal, director of the University of Arizona's Water Resources Research Center.\""Energy costs are going to be huge, and I don't think people understand it.""\|\Navajo Generating Station\Location: Navajo Reservation, near Page.\Constructed: Work began in 1969; the three units began running in 1974, 1975 and 1976. Initial cost was $650 million. An additional $420 million was spent in the 1990s to install air scrubbers.\Fuel source: Burns coal from the Kayenta mine, 50 miles east of the plant site.

23,"Published correction ran 7/27/10: ""Romley provides calming GOP voice,"" July 25, Valley & State, B11: Bill Montgomery, Republican candidate for Maricopa County attorney, was described as having been ""a high-ranking member of (former County Attorney Andrew) Thomas' team."" Montgomery objects to the description, saying he was a bureau chief, separated from the county attorney by at least three layers of supervisors.\The Arizona Republic Editorial Board has spent weeks interviewing scores of candidates. We've taken their measure, studied their pasts and learned their views. Today, we present our recommendations to you. With early voting beginning Thursday, we hope you will use this as one of many sources of information that informs your vote.\|\U.S. SENATE (REPUBLICAN)\McCain has vitality, longtime experience\Nothing about our rationale for supporting John McCain has changed from our judgments of the recent past.\McCain today is as energetic and enthusiastic an opponent of wasteful federal spending as he was in 1986 when he first was elected to the U.S. Senate. He remains an ardent advocate for the nation's defense, a duty that was sorely tested in the darkest days of the Iraq war, when McCain stood virtually alone in defense of the ""surge.""\We also believe, still, that John McCain would have guided his nation responsibly and honorably had he been elected president in 2008.\For those reasons and many more, we support McCain in his primary bid for U.S. Senate.\Conservative ""tea party"" candidate Jim Deakin, a Navy veteran like McCain, is an earnest political newcomer whose libertarian underpinnings are admirable. But he needs seasoning.\J.D. Hayworth, a former congressman and talk-show host, is not the answer that Republicans who chafe at McCain's record seek. In the end, the question is, ""Is Hayworth Senate material?"" And, in the end, the answer is clearly no.\The ground upon which McCain must campaign is rumbling with sentiments hostile to the sort of immigration reform he once championed. We get that. We cannot appreciate, however, the wholesale rejection now of those ideas.\McCain may be returned to the Senate. We support his candidacy thus far.\|\U.S. SENATE (DEMOCRAT)\Glassman displaying energy, political savvy\With national focus on Arizona's Republican race for the U.S. Senate, the candidates on the other side of the aisle have gotten scant attention. They deserve more.\Rodney Glassman, former vice mayor of Tucson, is one of those sound prospects. He is a savvy, young newcomer with a bright political future. And Cathy Eden, former director of the state Department of Health Services, comes to the race with a well-earned reputation as a sound manager with a heart of gold.\We lean toward Glassman, if only for the extraordinary energy he has brought to his campaign and the impressive political resume he has accumulated.\A lawyer and JAG officer in the Air Force, Glassman served on the staff of Rep. Raul Grijalva. He has served on the boards of an astonishing number of civic organizations -- a mark of both dedication and ambition. Eden, a former state legislator and manager of Coconino County, is an Arizona native. Not surprisingly, her approach to politics dovetails with the Arizona politician she admires most, Mo Udall.\Political organizer Randy Parraz is intensely focused on immigration and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, to the exclusion of most else. News reporter John Dougherty seems intent on practicing his investigative skills in the Senate.\Arizona Democrats would be well-served with either Glassman or Eden on the ballot in November. We give the nod to Glassman.\|\ATTORNEY GENERAL (REPUBLICAN)\Horne is flawed but is better GOP choice\Regarding the two Republican candidates for state attorney general, the question for voters is this, in our view: Do we go with Tom Horne, whose judgment while a student 40 years ago appears lacking? Or do we back Andrew Thomas, whose judgment regarding present-day issues, like the abuse of the justice system, is profoundly lacking now?\Arizona voters should run, not walk, from the candidacy of former Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas. Rarely in the history of Arizona governance has an officeholder appeared more willing -- enthusiastic, even -- to throw into turmoil the operation of a major public subdivision like Maricopa County and grossly abuse his enormous police powers in the process.\As Arizona superintendent of public instruction, Tom Horne has a record depicting some progress. He has bravely battled wild-eyed education extremists and struggled (vainly, in part) to keep the AIMS test a meaningful measure of student progress.\But as a law-school student many years ago, he received a lifetime trading ban from the Securities and Exchange Commission following his company's bankruptcy. And he repeatedly neglected to include that bankruptcy in his Corporation Commission filings.\We believe Horne is an honorable citizen who did wrong. Yes, he's flawed. But he is a far better candidate for attorney general than Thomas.\|\ATTORNEY GENERAL (DEMOCRAT)\Rotellini's reputation: Fierce enemy of fraud\What a placid environment is the Democratic primary for attorney general. While the Republicans heave knives at one another, the Democrats are positively tranquil.\Whoever the Republicans deliver to the general election will be badly damaged by accusations. If those GOP hopefuls are paying attention -- and, rest assured, they are -- there is one Democrat they don't want to face: Felecia Rotellini.\She will bring it on.\In this field, she is the ferociously smart prosecutor who has clocked significant time in the courtroom taking down lawbreakers and unwinding the complex strands of financial fraud.\As superintendent of the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, she slapped $5 million in fees and fines on Western Union for violating laws meant to cut off funds to Mexican cartels. In 1999, she was lead litigator in the successful case against accounting giant Arthur Andersen for failing to protect investors from the Baptist Foundation fraud.\We like her opponents. David Lujan is one of the very decent people and leaders at the Legislature. And former Assistant Attorney General Vince Rabago has a ground-level knowledge of border issues.\But they lack Rotellini's breadth of experience as a prosecutor and manager.\The Republic recommends Felecia Rotellini.\|\CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 3 (REPUBLICAN)\Morris stands out in field of 10 for her independent thinking\The polls suggest the Republican primary in Congressional District 3 comes down to three men who recite GOP talking points virtually in unison. If voters want only traditional Republican positions, former state Sen. Jim Waring, former Paradise Valley Mayor Vernon Parker or Ben Quayle, son of the former vice president, can deliver it. (Though Quayle needs more seasoning and his own record of accomplishment.)\But if voters want a Republican drawn from Arizona's tradition as a state of independent thinkers uninterested in fitting a mold, they should cast their ballot for Paulina Morris.\She is one of 10 Republican candidates who hope to succeed fellow Republican John Shadegg, in a district that stretches from north-central Phoenix to New River.\Morris shines as someone who will worry less about fitting in with the crowd and more about doing the right thing -- the path trod by Republicans Shadegg, Burton Barr and Barry Goldwater.\Morris, a limited-government Republican, has an extensive record of public service. She would bring the same energy and skills to Washington that enabled her to help fix the financially troubled Maricopa Medical Center and its 11 health centers and other facilities.\Morris calls herself a ""traditional, conservative Goldwater Republican."" Like Goldwater, she refuses to sign contracts or pledges on fiscal and other issues. ""I won't sign pledges because I'm not a robot,"" Morris told The Arizona Republic.\She has shown courage. After she was elected to the health-system board, conservative Republicans pressed her to close down the hospital. She stood up to them. ""That wasn't my job,"" she said. Voters sent her to the board to fix the system.\She shows thoughtfulness in her approach to immigration.\Morris' family fled Cuba in 1960 (she was born in Chicago) and she demonstrates a tough but nuanced view on immigration. She supports Senate Bill 1070, calling it inevitable in the face of federal inaction, and favors securing the border.\We expect that from Republican candidates. But Morris doesn't stop there. Fences aren't enough. She stresses the importance of the United States getting at the root of the immigration problem, which is a lack of good-paying jobs in Mexico. The U.S. should encourage Mexico to democratize its economy and foster a middle class, she suggests.\Morris is tough on the performance of President Barack Obama. She is critical of his economic-stimulus packages, saying they have created few jobs.\She favors opening the credit markets so small businesses have access to capital, which would enable them to grow and create jobs.\She also opposes Obama's health-care plan, cap-and-trade energy legislation and his ""artificial deadline for troop reductions"" in Afghanistan.\Paulina Morris stands out as the right conservative for Republican voters in District 3. The Republic recommends her in the Aug. 24 primary.\|\CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 1\Newcomer Mehta is best Republican pick\The vast Congressional District 1 has eight candidates competing for the Republican nomination. The best choice is a newcomer to political races, Show Low cardiologist Steve Mehta.\As a doctor and a small-business man running rural medical centers, he understands the health-care and economic challenges that loom large in a swath of Arizona that stretches from Casa Grande to the Utah line. His call for more emphasis on stimulating small-business growth, including tax incentives and greater access to credit, fits well with the needs of the region.\And, as the son of immigrants from India, Mehta brings a special perspective on the hot-button issue of immigration.\His priorities include forest restoration and renewable energy, which can bring both jobs and environmental benefits to District 1. He also has a strong interest in foreign affairs. The war in Afghanistan touched him personally. His wife, who was a captain in the U.S. Army Reserves, spent a year and a half directing a medical unit there.\Like Mehta, all the other candidates are firm conservatives. Sydney Hay, a public-affairs consultant and GOP candidate in 2008, has a passionate concern for the state's future. Rusty Bowers, government-affairs director for the Arizona Rock Products Association, has a history of service in the Legislature.\But in this year's race, Mehta leads the pack.\The Republic recommends Steve Mehta as the Republican candidate for Congressional District 1.\|\CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 5\Bitter Smith holds best promise for GOP\On the issues, little separates the top Republican candidates seeking to challenge Rep. Harry Mitchell.\They all believe free-market solutions should replace the federal health-insurance reform passed this year. They oppose earmarks. They want the border secured. So the question for voters isn't who best matches their views but who stands the best chance of defeating Mitchell, a Tempe Democrat. And that means who can best appeal to the independent voters who will swing this election.\The answer: Susan Bitter Smith.\Bitter Smith has the room to tack toward the middle. David Schweikert and Jim Ward are battling for the ""most conservative"" label, making it more difficult for them to later appeal to independents. They have other shortcomings.\Bitter Smith supports letting trade associations provide health care to their small-business members, allowing them the same advantages that corporations have. Ward wants to ""unburden"" companies from providing health insurance, making it an individual responsibility. Independents can support Bitter Smith's idea -- they won't like Ward's.\All three candidates take a hard line on securing the border and enforcing the rule of law. Only Bitter Smith supports allowing a controlled guest-worker program to provide farm labor.\Republicans improve their chances by nominating a conservative with enough of a moderate streak to appeal to independents. We recommend Susan Bitter Smith.\|\MARICOPA COUNTY ATTORNEY\Romley provides calming GOP voice\His goal was ""to calm the waters,"" Rick Romley said when he was named interim Maricopa County attorney in April.\As the previous occupant of the job, he was an obvious choice to restore order after the stormy tenure of Andrew Thomas, who resigned to run for attorney general.\Republican voters should make him the candidate to try for a full term in November.\The war between the supervisors and Sheriff Joe Arpaio is still raging.\If Romley can't stop the hostilities, he can at least make it more difficult for Arpaio to push his vendetta against the supervisors and the courts.\Romley, who has three decades of experience, is a particularly solid candidate for dealing with Senate Bill 1070. Although no fan of this law, he is ready to enforce it -- without going beyond legal and constitutional bounds.\Romley has some good proposals, including a special court to deal with troubled veterans, whose violations often reflect deeper problems that require treatment. But the biggest order of business is to restore trust and stability.\Bill Montgomery, the other GOP candidate, is a county prosecutor who promises to offer a fresh start. But he was a high-ranking member of Thomas' team and has Arpaio's endorsement.\Despite his assurances, the risk of putting the office in turmoil again is just too great. And it's hard to see how Montgomery could rein in the sheriff's excesses.\The Republic recommends Rick Romley as the Republican candidate for Maricopa County attorney.\|\PRIMARY ELECTION: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\Early voting: Begins Thursday.\Early ballot: Go to azsos.gov/election/county.htm and, under your county, find ""Request your early ballot.""\Election day: Aug. 24.\Register: To register online, go to servicearizona.com and click on ""register to vote.""

24,"It's the question visitors to Arizona ask often when the subject is sustainability: With so much sunshine and so much empty land -- and empty rooftops -- where's all the solar power?\The quickest explanation is cost. Building solar power plants is expensive and would spike electricity bills in a state where prices are comparatively low. Rooftop panels also have high up-front costs.\In a sustainable world, individuals and businesses would accept at least part of the added cost as the price of finding a lasting balance between the need for energy and the benefits to the environment of renewable resources.\Some people already have accepted the cost and converted to clean energy. But regulatory hurdles and practical obstacles remain.\And even a clean energy source like solar power isn't sustainable if it disrupts the economy and excludes customers who can't afford it. That's why utilities are exploring a wider mix of sources, including wind, geothermal and biomass.\As the big power providers work to assemble that mix, many of the advances in renewable energy are occurring at the grassroots level.\...\Energy: Install an Energy Star thermostat and you could save up to 500 pounds of carbon emissions per year.\...\At the base of the White Mountains just outside Snowflake, a biomass power plant went online this month, cranking up toward an expected output of 24 megawatts, or enough for about 9,000 homes.\That's not much in a state with growing electricity demands, but on the day it went live, the plant became Arizona's largest single source of renewable energy other than hydroelectric dams.\On a scarred ridge above Heber, work crews gather the fuel for the plant: skeletons of trees charred by the 2001 Rodeo-Chediski Fire.\Although too damaged for timber companies, the trees still hold biomass, material that can be burned to make steam to turn power turbines. That potential caught the interest of entrepreneur Robert Worsley, who wanted to build a renewable-energy operation on land he owned in the White Mountains.\""We're all about BTUs,"" said Scott Higginson, a vice president at Tempe-based Renegy Holdings, which built the plant. ""All the wood here is biomass,"" he said, dragging his finger through the air on a ridge above a fire-ravaged patch of ground. ""There's nothing left to salvage for timber or even wood shavings.""\Renegy will work to clear thousands of acres charred by the fire, but the bulk of its fuel will come from green forest areas being thinned under a Forest Service plan to protect communities from future fires.\The plant was built next to a recycled paper mill operated by the Canadian company Catalyst. The operation recycles paper products, mostly trucked up from Phoenix, and produces newsprint. Renegy will add waste from the process to its biomass fuel mix, making the plant that much more sustainable.\Without the plant, the Forest Service would burn much of the green waste cleared from the forests, releasing carbon and other pollutants, or allow the materials to decompose, releasing methane. Renegy says it will remove almost every trace of pollutant as the biomass burns. Arizona Public Service Co. and Salt River Project have agreed to buy the plant's output.\...\Air-conditioning: A room air conditioner too big for the room it's trying to cool will actually perform less efficiently than one designed for the space.\...\In 2007, the Arizona Corporation Commission adopted one of the nation's most aggressive renewable energy standards, requiring regulated utilities to produce or buy 15 percent of their power needs from renewable sources by 2025.\The new rules also will push clean energy, mostly solar , deeper into the private sector.\Of the 15 percent renewable power mandated by the commission, 30 percent must come from distributed solar, systems installed on rooftops. The commission estimates that the requirement will lead to 5,500 new rooftop arrays in 2009 and 9,125 new systems in 2010.\""That was very deliberate,"" said commissioner Kris Mayes, who helped develop the standards. ""We wanted people throughout the state to benefit.""\The rooftop rules are likely to help small companies that can help homeowners figure out how residential systems work and could spur ground-level efforts to cut costs.\Already, several upstart companies have landed in the state with offers to lease rooftop arrays to contain costs.\Businesses that can take advantage of incentives, scale and a long payoff period will likely lead the way, Mayes said.\""It makes good sense for them,"" she said. ""This is a way to shield themselves against what's coming.""\What's coming is government action to curb global warming, whether it's a direct carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program that would cap smokestack emissions then allow cleaner-burning companies to trade pollution credits with those that exceed limits.\Either option will likely push energy costs higher, turning expensive solar projects into more affordable alternatives.\...\Computers: You can save 40 watt-hours per day by turning your computer completely off instead of leaving it in sleep mode. That adds up to 4 cents a day.\...\Cost remains a high hurdle for people who seek sustainable alternatives. Solar energy comes with a steep up-front cost, from tens of thousands of dollars for homeowners to millions of dollars for businesses that want to install systems.\Lee Feliciano thinks he can help larger businesses take their first sustainable steps into solar power. A former solar-system installer, Feliciano started SolEquity as a way to finance solar projects and get big rooftops wired for the sun sooner.\He packages deals that let businesses go solar and then his company keeps the incentives and tax credits in return. Most of his customers will spend $1 million or more on the projects.\""With solar and with wind, as renewable energy, 90 percent of your costs or more is front-loaded,"" he said. ""There are not a lot of people with that sort of long-term perspective. Financing is the key to unlocking it.""\His deals work best in places where power costs already have risen. In California, with some of the most expensive electricity in the nation, it's relatively easy to finance a solar project that makes financial sense, one that probably wouldn't pencil out in Arizona.\""There's a two-word answer why that is,"" he said. ""Cheap electricity. Generally speaking, I think it's fair to say the price of electricity in California is double what it is in Arizona. If you compare the incentives given, they're not that far off. The real kicker is their electricity costs twice as much.""\If Congress fails to renew an important solar-energy tax credit this year, solar-energy conversion would slow to a crawl, at least until energy prices catch up to the cost of renewable systems.\...\Cleaning: We could save as much as 1% on national carbon emissions, and $3 billion in energy, if we all simply washed our clothes in cold water.\...\At the current price of electricity in Arizona, a residential or small-business solar array might not pay for itself for 15 or 20 years, even with tax credits and rebates. But utilities say they are seeing increasing numbers of rooftop projects, often in unexpected places.\Phoenix installed 732 peel-and-stick solar panels on the new downtown convention center, mostly as a teaching and learning tool. Arizona State University plans to blanket its campus buildings with solar panels.\""If we're going to meet the requirements, we'll need over 40,000 installations by 2012,"" said Barbara Lockwood, renewable energy manager for APS. She believes the most progress will come when homebuilders start offering solar panels as an option, just like granite countertops or upgraded carpet.\""The best way to get the rooftops is to be able to roll it into a mortgage,"" she said.\So far, homebuilders have been reluctant to offer solar panels as an option, but a few smaller companies have started to introduce the idea.\...\Cooking: Preheating your oven is usually unnecessary, except when baking bread or cookies. Just turn on the oven when you put the dish in.\...\Leon and Janet Hauk decided to retrofit their existing north Peoria home with a 5.2-kilowatt system, big enough to supply most of their electricity needs during cooler months and return some to the grid.\""I just got tired of paying the power bill and watching the cost of electricity go up,"" Janet said, flipping through summertime power bills under $40. ""Now, every time the rates go up, it means our system will be paid for that much sooner,"" Leon added.\The system cost about $14,000 after rebates and tax credits, but the Hauks have taken the advice of many solar-energy advocates who tell people to consider a solar array an investment and the electricity savings the return on that investment.\""It starts to pay for itself,"" said Mick Dalrymple, owner of a.k.a. Green in Scottsdale and a frequent sustainability evangelist. ""How many jet skis pay for themselves? You're getting free electricity. You're essentially buying insurance against higher energy prices.""\On the outside of the Hauks' home, APS installed a special electric meter with a digital arrow that points to the right when the house consumes power from the grid and to the left when it produces enough power to send it back out.\When power goes out onto the grid, the Hauks accumulate credits that they redeem during hotter months, when the air-conditioner uses more electricity than they can produce on the roof.\On a table inside, a monitor tells a more detailed story, keeping track of how much power the system has sent out and how much money the Hauks have saved in the two years since they installed the array. Those savings have topped $2,500.\""This is an asset,"" Janet said. ""I have Formica countertops, and I don't have wood floors. And what we have, we won't have to replace in 10 years. The cosmetic things go out of style. This doesn't.""\|\WHAT YOU CAN DO\green\Switch to compact fluorescent lightbulbs.\greener\Buy energy-efficient light fixtures and appliances.\greenest\Unplug small and large appliances and electronic equipment when not in use.\|\Making sustainable power\A clean-burning power plant in Snowflake is leading the way toward more sustainable energy.

At Northern Arizona University, chemistry Professor Stephanie Hurst is experimenting with cobalt as one way to capture light for solar power.\Cobalt is mined in the United States, making it more readily available than silicon. It is also cheaper than other light-absorbing materials, such as ruthenium, which can cost 60 times more than cobalt.\|\in their own words\THE REGULATOR: KRIS MAYES\Kris Mayes is a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission, the state's regulator of public utilities.\We're probably not going to be mothballing coal plants, but I just don't see a scenario where we'd build a new coal plant in Arizona. With Congress considering cap and trade (a system of limiting greenhouse-gas emissions), I don't see how a policy maker in his right mind could advocate a new coal plant.\I think we are just at that tipping point (for solar energy). We have to see whether people will put rooftop panels on, whether utilities will build plants.\My argument to individuals is (solar energy) is a shield. If you can put solar panels on your roof, do it now. We have been talking to home builders about making solar a choice, like granite countertops are.

25,"Gilbert-based Diversified Energy Corp. will supply the refinery equipment for an Indonesian operation that will process plant oil into jet fuel, the company announced.\W. David Thompson, Diversified Energy's president and CEO, said his company will partner with PT Jatropha Feedstock Initiative, headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia, for the project.\Thompson and Gary Batchelor Jr., the president and director of JFI, said the project will create up to $1.5 billion in ""green industry"" exports and generate more than a quarter of a million new jobs -- most in Indonesia --over the next 15 years.\""We want to become a bio-Exxon company,"" Batchelor said. ""We expect to be a multibillion-dollar company in 10 years.""\Jatropha curcas trees produce inedible fruit whose seeds are up to 60 percent oil by weight, according to Batchelor.\JFI's business plan is to harvest the seeds from more than 5 million acres of high-yield jatropha hybrid trees on seven islands in Indonesia. The trees will produce about 3.3 tons of jatropha oil per hectare (more than 8 tons per acre), Batchelor said.\""The beauty of these oils is that you never run out,"" he added. ""We'll be getting oil from these trees for the next 50 years. And we can always plant more.""\The expectation, he said, is that the plantations will produce more than 300 million gallons of crude jatropha oil by 2016 and more than 2.1 billion gallons per year by 2025.\From every 1,000 gallons of raw oil, the project can produce 450 gallons of jet fuel, 330 gallons of biodiesel and 180 gallons of naphtha, he said. The remainder is waste product.\The Diversified Energy-JFI project aligns neatly with the nation's goals to create and export ""clean and green"" technologies, Thompson said. The United States has a goal of using 36 billion gallons of renewable transportation fuel per year by 2022.\The first production goal is jet fuel, Batchelor said, not only because it will have a more immediate impact on pollution, but because it will be an economically attractive product for airlines that fly into Europe, where they will likely face a carbon tax beginning next year.\Biofuels are, in theory, carbon neutral -- the carbon dioxide released when burned is offset by the CO2 absorbed by the plants from which they are derived. In practice, the picture is murky, at best.\Although Diversified Energy has made jet-fuel equivalent, it hasn't been used by an aircraft yet. Thompson said the companies will start the fuel-certification process this spring and that he expects their product to be fully certified by 2012.\""So biofuels can be sold at a premium,"" Thompson said. ""And as the price of crude oil rises ... this should become more profitable.""\Diversified Energy will also provide equipment to convert raw biomass, such as seed shells and cuttings, into fertilizer, as well as other refined fuels, including synthetic gas.\""We'll be producing so much biomass that we can't make it all into fertilizer,"" Batchelor said. ""So, we'll take it and make syngas and sell it, too.""\Batchelor, who graduated from West Point in 1974 with a degree in mechanical engineering, said the company expects to employ 38,000 people in five years, 177,000 in 10 years, and 266,000 in 15 years.\""We will be buying over $100 million in equipment from the United States in the next five years,"" Batchelor said. ""Within 20 years, over a billion (dollars) in equipment.""\And that, Thompson said, will create jobs for chemical and mechanical engineers, assemblers, welders and so on, including those who make equipment such as conveyors, pumps, tanks and tubing.\""The project has huge requirements for irrigation,"" Thompson said, noting it will need ""1 billion meters of irrigation tubing.""\They plan to purchase that tubing from U.S. sources, he said.\Batchelor would only characterize his expectations for profit as ""very high.""\""(Jatropha oil) is an agricultural product in a country where labor costs are extremely low,"" he said.\After he completed his military duty, Batchelor worked first for Ford Motor Co., then for a California company that built oil refineries. That led him, in 1981, to Indonesia, where he has lived ever since.\For a time, he operated a fleet of tuna boats, but in 2006 in the wake of a sudden, and dramatic, price increase for diesel, he got interested in biofuels.\Thompson, a 1978 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy in electrical engineering, founded Diversified Energy in 2006. It is a privately held, alternative- and renewable-energy company focusing on biorefinery-conversion technologies. Thompson was the founder and president/CEO of Spectrum Astro Inc., which developed and manufactured satellites for the government.\""Within the next 20 years, will jatropha oil replace all the fuels in the world? No, it won't,"" Batchelor said. ""But there are certain sectors where we can help, particularly in transportation, with bio-jet fuel and biodiesel for trucks and trains.""\Batchelor characterized the project as a win for all involved.\""The Indonesian people get jobs, the products help the environment and it is extremely profitable,"" he said. ""That's hard to beat."""
26,"I recently read R.T. Kelley's op-ed expressing his outrage over Marshall Elementary School's 11th annual Festivus celebration (""My kid's school nixed Christmas -- for Festivus"").\My children attended Marshall from 2002-11 and were fortunate enough to participate in six years of Festivus -- more if you count all the times they went back.

27,"Public money supports the development of nearly every form of energy -- a point not lost on a budget-conscious public after California solar company Solyndra Inc. wasted a $500 million federal loan and oil companies continued to rack up profits with nearly record gasoline prices.\A hodgepodge of incentives, from loan guarantees and grants to tax breaks, support coal, oil, nuclear, solar, wind and other projects.\The high-profile collapse of California-based Solyndra, which declared bankruptcy, has drawn attention to the billions of dollars spent. Some say the country's myriad incentives are a result of the nation's lack of a cohesive energy policy. Others, who discredit global warming tied to burning coal, oil and natural gas, say nothing but the market and the lowest price should drive energy policy.\Several national reports have attempted to quantify how much federal money is provided to energy, and what the voting public would prefer.\The U.S. provided about $37.2billion in energy subsidies in 2010, according to a report last year from the Energy Information Administration. Federal stimulus-act funds likely increased that number last year.\""One of the main issues is that people don't really understand what we are talking about when we mention energy subsidies,"" said Robert Rapier, a national energy expert who works for an alternative-energy company in Hawaii and author of ""Power Plays: Energy Options in the Age of Peak Oil.""\Why do we have subsidies?\Rapier and other experts said the the debate over subsidies boils down to debates over global warming, with people's beliefs on what should be subsidized closely related to whether they believe society should act to prevent carbon-dioxide emissions.\If so, they generally support alternative-energy subsidies and are in favor of cutting subsidies to fossil fuels tied to global warming. If not, they tend to favor cutting alternative-energy subsidies and spending to make traditional energy forms cheaper.\But in reality, it is more complicated, he said. For example, many of the so-called subsidies that oil companies get are tax breaks that encourage them to drill in the United States. If the incentives didn't exist, it wouldn't cause people to drive less and use less gasoline, it would just push that production overseas.\""People say that the oil companies are rich and don't need it,"" Rapier said. ""It doesn't matter if they are rich, is it getting them to do something they would not otherwise do?... That tax credit is designed to save us jobs and prevent outsourcing. This is something people don't think about when they say we need to get rid of (oil) subsidies.""\Alternative energy is unlikely to ever become widely used without subsidies, or a larger policy shift addressing global warming, because technologies like solar and wind are less efficient at generating electricity than fossil fuels that are densely packed with energy, he said.\""If we are ever going to move away from (fossil fuels), it is going to require some help,"" he said. ""We just have to make decisions, as citizens, if this is the way we want to go. Even if I invent a new renewable fuel tomorrow (that can compete with oil), there is no infrastructure to get it to market. There are some things we need to be doing to open up the market a little bit.""\Gautam Gowrisankaran, an economics professor at the University of Arizona Eller College of Management, said the hodgepodge of U.S. incentives is a result of not having a clear energy policy. Without political consensus on energy and global warming, interest groups win support for their individual causes.\""I believe in free markets and would rather the government just tax carbon rather than get into the politics of which energy sources to subsidize,"" he said. ""If there is a harmful element to the environment from carbon-dioxide emissions (from coal, natural gas and oil), that is the policy to implement. But politically we are not there yet. So to substitute for that, we like to subsidize renewable energy rather than tax traditional fossil fuels.""\With a carbon tax, solar, wind and other alternative energy would not need subsidies because they would be economically competitive with fossil fuels, he said.\And tax breaks for domestic drilling and other fossil fuels could probably go away, too, he said.\""There might be a little more domestic drilling because of the tax breaks, but the effect is small,"" he said. ""There might be national-security reasons why we want more domestic oil, but there are easier ways to (increase energy security). You can increase the strategic petroleum reserve. You don't have to produce it domestically, but you can insulate yourself from supply disruptions.""\He said that addressing carbon emissions would be a more straightforward approach that would allow the free market to work, rather than have politicians helping their chosen priorities.\""We have all these different policies, renewable-portfolio standards, subsidies,"" he said. ""The best of these are approximating this goal and the worst of them are pretty crazy in terms of how inefficient they are.""\He said even if a small minority of scientists are skeptical of human-caused global warming, it makes sense to tax carbon emissions to address the problem.\""Let's say that you thought there was a 1 percent chance of a terrorist attack in New York,"" he said. ""We would be working to protect New York. There doesn't have to be certainty of terrorist attacks for us to do that. Just a probability of something bad for us.""\Cuts urged, regardless\Amid all the debate regarding subsidies, political polar opposites have found common ground calling for an end to at least some of the government incentives that they find financially wasteful and environmentally harmful.\An annual report titled ""Green Scissors: Cutting Wasteful and Environmentally Harmful Spending"" is co-sponsored by environmental group Friends of the Earth and conservative group the Heartland Institute, along with Public Citizen and Taxpayers for Common Sense.\The 2011 report called for an end to fossil-fuel subsidies for oil and gas, cuts to nuclear incentives and ending the 45-cent-per-gallon ethanol tax credit, which Congress allowed to expire last year after the report.\""Our view is that all energy subsidies should be eliminated,"" said Eli Lehrer, a vice president with the Heartland Institute. He said the group advocates for much wider cuts than what is detailed in the report, but it finds it helpful to reach common ground with environmental groups like Friends of the Earth.\""We think the market alone should decide what form of energy people use,"" he said. ""There should not be any sector-specific tax benefits that overwhelmingly benefit one sector over another. They should not exist for anybody.""\The Heartland Institute concluded in a book titled ""Climate Change Reconsidered"" that global warming could benefit society, and that civilization would be able to cope with even the worst-case scenarios.\""We don't contend that climate change doesn't go on, nor do we contend it is environmentally benign to burn coal,"" Lehrer said. ""There are plenty of reasons beyond carbon emissions that subsidies for things like coal and oil are environmentally problematic.""\But the groups disagree on subsidies for alternative energy.\""Subsidies for solar and wind power also have environmental downsides and, at any case, are government interference in the market,"" he said.\Ben Schreiber, a tax analyst for Friends of the Earth, said his group advocates for alternative-energy subsidies.\""Friends of the Earth believes the government has a really important role to play transitioning to a clean-energy economy,"" he said. ""There is no way we are going to deal with climate change without government intervention.""\He said it's important to work with other groups despite not agreeing on all issues.\""The Heartland Institute ... we think their position on climate change is reprehensible, and they know it, and they think our stance on the environment is ludicrous or whatever,"" he said.\""We both acknowledge we are coming from totally different places. What we do have is overlap where some of our goals come together.... If you are going to take on something as strong as the corn lobby (to end ethanol subsidies), you need to work together with people that are aligned with you.""\|\Coal\Coal got $561million in tax expenditures in 2010, much less than the $3.3 billion it got in 2007, according to the EIA. It also got $663million in 2010 for research and development.\Natural gas\Nearly all of the so-called subsidies for natural gas and oil drilling are written into tax code and available to other types of manufacturing, and are meant to encourage production in the U.S.\Solar\Alternative-energy subsidies for solar power and wind are mostly direct expenditures and tax credits for energy production, and they are often renewed for a few years at a time rather than permanent.\|\Energy subsidies\The U.S. Energy Information Administration compared subsidies in 2010.\Coal got about $1.4 billion in direct subsidies, mostly for research and in tax incentives.\Natural gas and petroleum got $2.82 billion, nearly all from tax incentives and none from the federal stimulus act.\Nuclear got $2.5 billion, mostly in research and development and tax incentives.\Solar got $1.13 billion, most in direct funding, and about 70percent of which was tied to the federal stimulus act.\Wind got $4.99 billion, nearly all tied to the stimulus.\Biomass got 1.17 billion, split about evenly between tax incentives and research and development.\Geothermal got $273 million, mostly tied to the stimulus.\Biofuels got $6.6 billion, mostly in tax credits.\Common oil-company tax breaks\According to the American Petroleum Institute, many oil incentives should not be called ""subsidies"" because they are written into tax code and are not direct payments:\A manufacturers tax deduction for domestic production encourages drilling in the U.S. Companies get only a 6 percent deduction compared with 9 percent for traditional manufacturing firms.\Drilling costs can be written off.\Foreign tax credits allow deductions for taxes paid to other nations.\Depletion allowances allow oil resources to be written off as depreciation as they are emptied.\Alternative subsidies\The wind-production tax credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. It is worth 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by wind farms for the first 10 years they are open. The stimulus act allowed wind developers to collect a 30 percent tax credit for projects that began construction before 2012.\The solar-investment tax credit is scheduled to expire Dec.31, 2016. It gives the builder or owner of a solar rooftop project or solar power plant a tax credit worth 30 percent of the project's cost. A stimulus act program allowed developers to receive grants rather than tax credits for projects that began construction before 2012.\A longer comparison\The Environmental Law Institute report ""Estimating U.S. Government Subsidies to Energy Sources: 2002-2008"" in September 2009 found:\Fossil-fuel subsidies during that time were $72 billion.\Renewable-fuels subsidies were $29 billion during the same time.\Most fossil-fuel subsidies were written into tax code, while renewable subsidies are mostly time limited.\Almost half the renewable subsidies were for corn-based ethanol.\Source: Energy Information Administration, American Petroleum Institute, American Wind Energy Association, Solar Energy Industries Association, the Environmental Law Institute."

32,"The Navajo Generating Station, the huge coal-fired power plant outside Page, supplies a fraction of Arizona's electricity demand, but its role in moving water to the state's largest cities has thrust it into a growing battle over the cost of cleaning up air pollution.\In the two months since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules that would require costly new air-scrubbing equipment at the plant, the debate has escalated into a war of increasingly dire predictions: Tribal economies could collapse. The plant itself could close. The price of water sold to Phoenix and Tucson could quadruple.\Environmental groups have targeted Navajo and the nearby Four Corners Power Plant for years because of the emissions-related haze that builds up over the Grand Canyon and other fragile landscapes. The EPA ranks Navajo as the nation's third-largest emitter of nitrogen oxides, pollutants created when coal is burned. Four Corners is the second-largest.\The new EPA rules, if adopted by the agency, would force owners of the two plants to install complex new air scrubbers that use ammonia to break down the pollutants. Navajo's owners say the systems cost too much money and could push power rates out of reach for the plant's users. They also argue that the added scrubbers would produce visibility improvements imperceptible to human eyes.\One reason tempers have flared is the unusual role the generating station plays, both in its own backyard and in the state's population centers.\The coal burned to produce electricity is mined on the nearby Hopi and Navajo Indian reservations, and tribal members supply much of the labor needed to keep the plant running. If the plant closed, the tribes would lose the jobs and millions of dollars in revenue from the coal.\Although the tribes have long sided with environmentalists on resource issues, leaders condemned the Sierra Club and other groups for supporting the EPA plan, creating schisms within the tribes.\The plant, owned by five utilities and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, powers the state's largest conveyor of water, the Central Arizona Project Canal, supplying electricity cheaply enough to pump water 3,000 feet uphill, from the Colorado River to Phoenix and Tucson.\That link between water and energy has raised anew doubts about subsidizing cheap water with cheap electricity, but CAP officials say there's little question that the EPA plan would result in higher prices for water users.\""What we do can't be done without water or power,"" said David Modeer, general manager of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District. ""Power is the biggest expense related to the price of our water. I can't think of any bigger threat to us other than the Colorado going dry.""\Opposing proposals\The EPA outlined its proposal to require the tighter pollution controls at Navajo in a densely worded document published in the Federal Register in August. The power plant's partners knew something was coming but expected federal regulators to consider a less-expensive option discussed late in 2008.\""We were quite surprised that it departed so much from what we had proposed,"" said Richard Hayslip, an associate general manager at Salt River Project, the plant's managing partner. ""The signals were pretty positive that they were agreeing with what we talked about. It was a little disappointing.""\SRP had submitted an alternate proposal late last year, one aimed at trying to reduce pollution from the plant in what the utility believed was a more cost-effective way.\That plan included ongoing work to install more-efficient burners that would reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides, one of the chief sources of pollution from coal burning. The low-NO{-x} burners, as they're called, would cost about $43 million to install and would not raise operating costs significantly.\The EPA proposed a more advanced air-scrubbing system that uses ammonia to reduce pollutants. The system, known as Selective Catalytic Reduction, could cost $600 million to $1 billion to install, according to SRP estimates, and would add about $13 million a year to the plant's operating budget, expenses that would be passed on to users.\The ammonia must be injected into the system after the coal is burned. The chemical would be delivered to Flagstaff by railroad and then trucked to Page, where the only rail service is a direct line from the Kayenta coal mine that feeds the plant. The process could require additional measures to get rid of sulfuric acid mist produced with the system.\""It would be a very significant capital investment and challenging to do the work,"" said Glenn Reeves, SRP's manager of power generation. ""We would have issues just getting approval from all the owners. There are a lot of uncertainties around coal plants right now.""\The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which holds a 21 percent interest in Navajo, faces strict rules under California law about investing money in coal-fired plants and could decide to walk away from Navajo if the expenses rise too high.\Partners in the Mohave Generating Station near Bullhead City did just that at the end of 2005 amid issues with air-quality rules and the supply of coal. That closure eliminated about 300 jobs at the plant site and 240 jobs filled mostly by coal miners from the Navajo Reservation.\The Navajo Generating Station partners have enlisted Gov. Jan Brewer and have appealed to the state's congressional delegation, but they still fear the EPA is on track to require the costly upgrades.\The agency will accept public comments through the end of the year before making a final decision, which is likely by the middle of 2010.\If the EPA adopts its proposed rules, SRP would have five years to complete the upgrades.\Navajo's owners or its users, such as CAP, could challenge the final ruling or even take the agency to court. All say they are preparing to respond quickly when the decision is made.\Costly consequences\What makes this case more than another fight over utility regulations is Navajo's unusually close ties to the CAP Canal. A spike in power prices at the plant would result in significantly higher water rates for CAP users and could affect the state's ability to store water for future use.\The Navajo Generating Station was built to provide a power supply for the canal, which snakes 336 miles from the Colorado River near Lake Havasu City to Phoenix and Tucson. The power feeds a series of pumps that move 1.5 million acre-feet of water a year -- almost 500 billion gallons -- as much as half the water used by cities and farms in Maricopa, Pinal and Pima counties.\The canal must lift the water a total of almost 3,000 feet in elevation, a task that consumes 2.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity, enough to supply about 200,000 homes.\That makes the CAP the largest single electricity user in Arizona, and it raises the stakes if Navajo's operations are put at risk.\""We do not have an alternative,"" said Susan Bitter Smith, president of the elected board that oversees the canal. ""This is a survival issue for us. We need the EPA to work with us in a rational, logical way that takes into consideration all of the consequences.""\CAP officials are suggesting two possible outcomes if the EPA adopts its proposed rules:\One, the power plant stays open, but the price of electricity spikes by 50 to 100 percent, depending on how many years the cost of the upgrades are amortized. The higher prices would hit all the plant's users, which include utilities in Arizona, Nevada and California.\Two, the partners decide to abandon the plant, and CAP is forced to buy electricity off the grid. In the worst-case scenario, officials believe costs to move water could quadruple.\In either case, CAP would have few options except to pass along the higher costs to its customers -- the cities and water companies that buy water from the canal wholesale -- and to property-tax payers in the three counties.\Phoenix and other cities have written letters urging the EPA to consider the effects of its proposal beyond air quality, to look at the potential for higher water costs.\""We're just asking them to weigh the equities as they look at protecting the visibility around the plant,"" said Tom Buschatzke, water adviser for the city of Phoenix. ""We're trying to make EPA understand the importance of the issue, the way regional and local economies are suffering right now.""\The CAP Canal accounts for 43 percent of Phoenix's water supply, so the city probably couldn't absorb the higher charges, Buschatzke said, meaning at least some of the cost would be passed down to ratepayers.\The long-term effects could grow worse. Phoenix and other cities rely on the state Water Banking Authority to help store water as a hedge against future droughts. The Legislature already has slashed the bank's budget, and if the bank can't buy water, the cities would lose that backup supply.\Higher costs also would affect agricultural users, who now pay below-market prices for CAP water as part of a deal that will make their supplies available to cities by 2030.\And the loss of the plant would deprive the CAP of a critical source of revenue used to help repay the federal government the state's share of the canal's construction costs. Under an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation and the plant's partners, CAP is allotted a certain amount of power and can sell whatever it doesn't need.\If the power isn't there or if it's so expensive no one will buy it, CAP officials would have to raise the needed revenue elsewhere, and their only options are water rates and property taxes.\Environmentalists counter\One of the arguments SRP, CAP and others have made in recent weeks is that the expensive controls proposed by the EPA wouldn't improve air quality enough to justify the huge price tag. SRP suggests that the change in visibility might not even be noticeable to the human eye.\Environmental groups don't buy that argument. They say any improvement will move the plant closer to visibility rules that allow no haze over national parks and other protected lands.\""The standard is no impairment,"" said Roger Clark, who follows the issue for the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust. ""Every increment along the way improves visibility, and that's what the law requires.""\The EPA disagreed with SRP's analysis and argued that the utility and its partners overestimated the cost and underestimated the benefit.\Environmental groups also say the EPA plan is just the first of a one-two punch the power plant will likely face in the coming years. If Congress passes a climate-change bill that includes a cap-and-trade plan to reduce pollutants, Navajo will get hit with the equivalent of a carbon tax.\Clark and others say CAP should invest in alternative energy. Cover the canal with solar panels, for example, and connect them to the transmission lines that already supply the pumping stations along the route.\Covering the canal also would help reduce evaporation from the channel. CAP estimates that it loses about 16,000 acre-feet, or about 5 billion gallons, a year to canal evaporation.\CAP's Modeer acknowledges that renewable energy will play a role in the canal's future, but ""the power that can be generated out of solar under the most advanced technology today still could not provide our base load of power.""\Clark and others say one of the most important questions bubbling up from the dispute is the cost of water in the West.\Water providers and customers don't really pay for the water; they pay for its delivery and treatment. The largest component of CAP's wholesale rate is the cost of energy. That water-energy link is as old as the West's oldest water projects, but it's likely to surface more often as energy prices rise and water resources tighten.\""People say water will get more expensive in the future, but what they mean is it's going to get more expensive to provide it, to move it, to treat it,"" said Sharon Megdal, director of the University of Arizona's Water Resources Research Center.\""Energy costs are going to be huge, and I don't think people understand it.""\|\Navajo Generating Station\Location: Navajo Reservation, near Page.\Constructed: Work began in 1969; the three units began running in 1974, 1975 and 1976.

33,"Arizona Republic columnist Robert Robb suggests the state would be best served by maintaining an outdated clean-energy standard set in 2006, and that the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) lacks the authority to update the standard at all.\Robb's column (""Preempt clean energy mandates,"" March 17) misses the mark completely.\He mischaracterized the Arizona Supreme Court's holding in Johnson Utilities and the nature of the Corporation Commission's constitutional powers. Additionally, he fails to recognize the many ways in which modernizing our clean-energy rules will benefit Arizona ratepayers, communities, the economy and environment.\Robb is correct that the bills being considered in the Legislature would freeze Arizona's current energy standard by placing it in statute and forbidding the Corporation Commission from going further. He is wrong that doing so is a good thing.\Not only do these bills represent an unconstitutional power grab by the Legislature, they also create an uncertain regulatory climate for businesses. That poses risks of losing needed economic development opportunities and crucial jobs. Because availability of clean and renewable-energy resources is often a deciding factor for locating in a particular state, companies considering Arizona for relocating or expanding their presence would not have the market stability and certainty they require.\That's why so many companies have supported the commission's energy rules package: Recently, more than two dozen businesses and business associations, including Ball Corporation, Google, Microsoft, REI and Salesforce, signed a letter in support of the 100% carbon-free and efficiency standards.\The potential for instability and uncertainty arising should these bills pass is the reason a broad-based coalition of businesses, economic development organizations, utilities, clean energy providers, manufacturers, electric vehicle companies and many others oppose these measures.\Robb also fails to understand the holding in Johnson Utilities v. Arizona Corporation Commission, a landmark Arizona Supreme Court case decided in July 2020 that outlined the ACC's authority as set forth in the state Constitution. The Constitution grants the commission's broad authority to regulate public service corporations and breaks it down into two buckets: exclusive authority over ratemaking and permissive authority to make and enforce rules and regulations for the ""safety and health"" of the public, which the ACC holds concurrently with the Legislature.\Promulgating rules that will reduce carbon emissions, improve energy efficiency and increase the adoption of renewable resources — all of which directly relate to improving air quality and the health of the environment and Arizonans — is squarely within the Corporation Commission's constitutional power to regulate for public health and safety.\While lawmakers can set energy policy via statute, they lack the power to decrease state utility regulators' constitutional authority; indeed, as the Supreme Court explicitly stated in the Johnson Utilities ruling, ""The legislature lacks the power to decrease the Commission's constitutional authority."" In other words, the Legislature cannot simply forbid the commission from regulating.\Yet, that is exactly what lawmakers are trying to do. The language of the bills before the Legislature, by their very terms, attempts to abrogate the constitutional authority of the Corporation Commission by stipulating that it ""may not adopt or enforce a policy, decision or rule that directly or indirectly regulates"" electric generation resources or carbon emissions.\Clean and renewable energy technologies have come a long way since 2006 while at the same time experiencing an exponential drop in generation costs. In that time, Arizona has become a hub of technology and innovation, and a leader in the development of clean and renewable energy technologies — a boon for Arizona's economy.\Even without reference to actual rules being considered by the Corporation Commission, it is simply foolish and regressive to suggest Arizona should be operating under a clean-energy standard set before some of these new technologies were even developed and when the cost of generating clean energy was much higher.\Although we support the Legislature having a role in energy policy, these bills simply miss the mark. Our state's economic growth requires stability and certainty, which means we need to get this right the first time. Let's take the time to do it right.\Steven G.

34,"Arizona Corporation Commissioner Justin Olson took talking points on renewable energy and environmental programs provided by Arizona Public Service Co. and cited them, often verbatim, to a Wall Street analyst who was seeking information about his views as a regulator.\The San Francisco-based Energy and Policy Institute, which advocates for renewable energy and action on climate change, published emails between Olson and APS on Thursday, along with a recording of the conference call where he repeated the APS talking points.\An EPI official and one of Olson's political rivals said the reciting of APS policy positions shows Olson can't be objective when deciding rates and other policies for the company.\In an interview, Olson said despite the group's claims, he makes his commission decisions independent of APS.\The revelation from EPI comes not only amid an election for two seats at the commission Nov. 6, but following years of turmoil at the five-member commission regarding the influence of the state's biggest electric company.\""The Corporation Commission has had a lot of problems in the last few years in terms of questions about whether the commissioners were regulating in the public's interest or more in the interest of APS,"" said David Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute and author of the report.\He added that Olson, who was appointed by Gov. Doug Ducey to fill a vacancy, has campaigned on being an independent voice for integrity.\""I think the emails and subsequently him essentially parroting APS policy positions verbatim only further erodes trust in Commissioner Olson and the Arizona Corporation Commission to regulate independently of APS' influence,"" Pomerantz said.\Olson said he reaches out to a variety of sources for information on energy policy, not just APS. He said he has met with the commission staff, solar companies and energy-efficiency experts to help shape his opinions.\""He's cherry-picking out the portions where I agree with APS,"" Olson said of Pomerantz's report. ""But it is important to point out I shared much more information on the call in addition to that.""\He said he only repeated information from APS that he personally agrees with, and that he does not agree with the utility on all points.\""I can defend all the positions I took on that call,"" Olson said.\Olson said that when APS learned he was taking the call with Credit Suisse, the company reached out to him, and he took up an offer from the company supplying him information to consider.\Some of Olson's statements on the conference call were almost exactly what APS Director of State Regulatory Affairs and Compliance Amanda Ho wrote May 17 in her talking points supplied to him before the call.\Utility regulators commonly speak with Wall Street analysts, who track the business environment of utilities and offer recommendations on whether to buy the stock.\EPI officials learned of the conference call and recorded it. The Corporation Commission did not publicly announce that Olson would participate in the call. The commission only routinely issues such public notices when two or more commissioners are making public appearances or statements, not for individual commissioners.\Credit Suisse analyst Michael Weinstein upgraded his rating on the stock of APS parent company Pinnacle West Capital Corp. from ""neutral"" to ""outperform"" before the call in May and maintains the favorable rating today.\In an August report, he cited comments from Olson in his analysis of how the stock should perform.\Among the topics on the May 18 call was rooftop solar versus large, utility-scale solar plants.\""From a cost perspective, utility-scale solar today is approximately 1/3 the price to install relative to rooftop installations while providing the same environmental benefits,"" Ho said in her five-page memo to Olson. ""It also has the benefits such as tracking that can provide more energy during peak periods on the system.""\It was one of many points Olson echoed on the next day's call.\""The cost of installation is about one-third the cost of rooftop solar,"" Olson said on the call when asked about rooftop solar. ""In addition, there are added benefits of utility-grade solar that it can track with the sun throughout the day, which increases the efficiency of the energy generation.""\As Pomerantz notes in his report, this argument from APS and Olson ignores the fact that when customers invest in their own rooftop solar, the utility avoids costs that would be billed back to customers if the company had built a power plant itself.\Olson said the point is something he believes, regardless if it aligns with APS. And he said it is important for the regulators to continue allowing customers to install solar.\""It is important for us to enact policies that facilitate that and do not put up roadblocks that hinder their ability to accomplish that,"" Olson said Thursday.\Olson's comments on energy-efficiency programs also mirrored Ho's.\""Significant progress has been made on Arizona's energy efficiency programs,"" Ho said in her memo. ""Utilities have reconfigured their offering to align with the way customers use energy with the focus now being on high-value DSM (demand-side management, a utility term for efficiency efforts like low-power light bulbs) programs that address peak energy periods.\""Additionally, the toolbox for Demand Side Management is being expanded to include smarter and more efficient uses of energy as opposed to simply tracking kwh (kilowatt-hour) reductions.""\When Olson was asked about efficiency on the call, he said:\""Significant progress has been made in these programs. Utilities reconfigured their offerings to align with the way customers use their energy, the focus now being on the... high-value demand side management being executed using smart and more efficient technologies, that are smarter than what historically has been used just simply tracking kilowatt-hour reductions.""\Olson said Thursday that the accusation that he is reliant on APS for his positions as a regulator is off target, citing policies where he disagrees with the utility.\For example, APS has fought over the years to prevent regulators from implementing or even investigating retail electric competition, which would allow customers to shop for their electric company rather than being forced to use the company that services their address.\Olson has said on the campaign trail this year that he wants to investigate retail competition.\""Any commissioner who has called for considering retail competition in electric providers cannot be considered someone who is anything but independent from APS,"" Olson said. ""My actions speak for themselves.""\Olson also said he supports the effort from Commissioner Robert Burns to subpoena records from APS and Pinnacle West regarding their spending on political campaigns.\APS and Pinnacle West have refused Burns' efforts to subpoena the information, and a majority of commissioners has thwarted Burns' attempts to use the courts to get that information.\Democrat Sandra Kennedy is running for a seat on the commission in this year's election. She said she was stunned when she read the EPI report Thursday, which documented multiple instances of Olson repeating APS statements and included a recording of the subsequent call with the Credit Suisse analyst.\""My mouth fell wide open,"" Kennedy said.\During an Oct. 9 debate hosted by The Arizona Republic, Kennedy accused Olson and the other Republican in the race of parroting APS talking points.\""I had no clue they had stooped to this level,"" Kennedy said.\""Justin Olson has had the opportunity to separate himself from the current commission establishment to become a true statesman,"" Kennedy said. ""Unfortunately he has chosen to fall into that same old corruption narrative.""\A key difference between the Democrats and Republicans running for the Corporation Commission this year is their stances on Proposition 127. The measure would require electric companies like APS to get half their power from renewable sources like solar and wind by 2030. The Democrats support it and Republicans oppose it.\The initiative's backers have said that because APS opposes adding more renewable energy, and because the company has a strong influence over the commissioners who set such policies, that the voter-approved constitutional amendment is the necessary remedy.\The EPI report bolsters their argument, a spokesman for the proposition said.\""It's kind of a smoking gun,"" Prop. 127 spokesman DJ Quinlan said. ""It shows I think how beholden some of these officials are to APS. They are literally telling him what to say. He is literally a ventriloquist for APS at this point.""\He continued.\""Ultimately we have a Corporation Commission, governor and Legislature who are not going to move Arizona in the right direction as far as renewable energy goes,"" Quinlan said. ""They are going to do whatever APS asks them to do.""\APS spokesman Hal Pittman said it is appropriate for the company's officials to communicate with the commissioners because the state's biggest utility employs experts who understand the industry.\He said EPI should not be trusted.\""As pointed out by the Washington Examiner, the Energy Policy Institute is not a think tank, watchdog, or non-profit institute, but rather a dark money organization that attacks the interests of the energy industry,"" Pittman said. ""Most recently, it has been the primary mouthpiece of pro-Proposition 127 propaganda.""\Pomerantz said that EPI does not accept money from corporations, trade groups or governments, but also does not disclose who funds the group. He said they do that to protect those financial backers from harassment by public officials who disagree with the group's efforts.\""EPI does this work not just in Arizona, but in states around the country,"" Pomerantz said. ""We are trying to expose unflattering things about pretty powerful corporations and their influence. Some of those organizations have attacked EPI. APS, I would expect them to do that. Our founders try to keep a target off their backs.""\He said the fact that the group doesn't disclose its donors is irrelevant to the facts it has uncovered.\""APS and its lobbyists can say what it wants about us but I'll stand by our record on the work we've done,"" Pomerantz said.\CREDIT: Ryan Randazzo"
35,"Arizona Public Service Co. will continue to offer business owners rebates for installing energy-efficient equipment that can range from new air-conditioners to electricity-saving exit signs.\The Arizona Corporation Commission approved an extension of the rebates Wednesday as half of an APS plan to spend an average of $25.5 million a year to cut energy demand.\Commissioners voted the business rebates into place in 2006 on an interim basis and voted 4-1 to keep them.\They evaluated the rebates with a cost-benefit analysis that took into account power plants that won't be needed because of the conservation and reduced energy costs.\The analysis also calculated reduced water consumption from making electricity and reduced air pollution.\APS spent $27.8 million on the program from 2005 to '07. Business and school rebates accounted for $12.5 million of that, which saved 1.38 million megawatt-hours of electricity and 321 million gallons of water, according to figures from the commission.\""This decision will help schools and small businesses save money on their energy bills while, at the same time, protecting the environment,"" Commissioner Bill Mundell said.\The rebates are specific. For example, APS will pay a company $5 to simply get rid of an 8-foot-long ceiling light or $25 to install a higher-efficiency exit sign, according to its rebate list. Customers also can suggest rebates for items not on the list.\APS found that it costs the company about 1 cent per kilowatt-hour to save electricity, which compares with about 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour to generate or buy electricity on average, said Jim Wontor, manager of demand-side management projects for the utility.\""So long as it is our least expensive alternative for acquiring more kilowatt-hours, we'll continue to do these kinds of programs because they are more cost-effective than other means of generating power,"" he said.\APS and Salt River Project, the other major local utility, also offer rebates for homeowners who install energy-saving equipment. SRP has been expanding its business-rebate program since May, trying to match those offered by APS, said Debbie Kimberly, SRP manager of energy efficiency.\Commissioner Mike Gleason voted against the rebates for APS, saying they offer too much benefit to business owners at the expense of other ratepayers.\""That's millions of dollars of ratepayers' money that went to businesses,"" he said, adding that the utility didn't reduce energy use as much as expected in the test run.\""All these things they were subsidizing, the businesses should have made (those changes) on their own because they made money on these things,"" he said.\He recommended APS spend more on educating businesses on how they can save money with efficient appliances.\Energy-efficiency experts said that business owners get a much quicker return on their investments in energy-saving devices with the utility rebates.\""(Business owners) should be looking at any way they can to reduce their bill,"" said John Bunch, president and CEO of Supermarket Energy Technologies, a Phoenix company that sells grocers energy-efficient lighting, motors and other parts that qualify for utility rebates.\""They already are spending the money, they are just sending it to the power company,"" he said.

37,"What stands out on the 31st Earth Day, observed today, is how little\environmentalists are willing to even acknowledge, much less celebrate, their\victories.\This is, indeed, the movement of the perpetual scowl.\In reality, environmentalism is the most successful political and cultural\movement of our time. Appreciation for and a desire to protect the natural\world is virtually universal, a paradigm shift of monumental proportions.\Although the environmental movement is loath to accept it, this cultural\transformation has even permeated industry. Industry still fights about what\the standards should be. But environmental compliance is now generally a\primary business strategy.\The benefits of this paradigm shift are quite tangible. Virtually all\environmental measurements have significantly improved over the past 30 years.\The air in urban areas is cleaner, drinking water safer, land disturbances\more restricted.\Paradoxically, further progress will require another paradigm shift, this\one within the environmental movement itself.\Thus far, environmental regulation has taken the form of government\establishing maximum pollution standards and dictating control technologies.\Applying these regulations to specific sites involves scientists and engineers\from the regulated arguing and negotiating with scientists and engineers from\government over computer models about what different technologies might emit\under various scenarios.\This so-called command and control approach has taken environmental\protection about as far as it probably can. Nevertheless, there are some in\the environmental movement who want to continue to push it.\Those in the movement's hard edge have objectives other than simply\protecting the environment. They dislike our capitalist economic system and\our bourgeois values. They want to force a fundamental reordering of society.\And it is here that most people get off the train. We like our bourgeois\lifestyle, and most of the rest of the world aspires to it. We want an\environmentalism compatible with a market economy and increasing standards of\living.\This conflict is playing itself out in the environmental controversies of\our day. The Kyoto Treaty on global warming was pretend environmentalism.\Complying with it would have cost more than 10 percent of U.S. GDP annually.\The Bush administration withdrew a treaty that was already dead, here and in\much of the rest of the world.\The arsenic standard raises the question of how much protection at what\cost. Currently, the EPA sets drinking water standards hundreds of times below\concentrations known to be harmful. But complying with the Clinton\administration's departing arsenic standard would have cost mostly rural water\systems an estimated $4.5 billion, even though concentrations below the\existing standard have not been found harmful. The existing standard just\doesn't provide much margin.\After California, few doubt the need to develop additional energy\resources, which will come at an environmental cost.\Economists have long argued that replacing the command and control approach\with emission taxes would be more effective and efficient.\Government would set a tax rate on emissions sufficient to achieve the\protection of public health desired. Industry would be free to use whatever\production and emission control techniques it wants, but would be subject to\the tax.\An emissions tax would give industry an incentive to be as clean as\possible, since it would pay for each increment of pollution, not just if it\exceeds the maximum allowed. And environmental regulation would become a\governmental revenue source rather than a taxpayer cost.\Other market-oriented approaches exist to address other environmental\issues. But without the support of the environmental community, they will be\difficult to implement politically.\So, those with the perpetual scowls face a choice: Do they embrace markets\and continue to improve the environment? Or do they hold out in the quixotic\quest for a fundamental reordering of society?"
38,"Q&A\Earlier this year, Diane Brown, executive director of the consumer watchdog Arizona Public Interest Research Group, was recognized by the Arizona League of Conservation Voters for leading efforts to improve environmental and conservation policies in Arizona.\Brown sat down for an interview recently to talk about Arizona PIRG, which is based in Phoenix, and its role in helping protect Arizona consumers.\Question: Which issues are priorities for PIRG in Arizona this year?\Answer: For Arizona PIRG, the vast majority of our time is spent in places like the Arizona Corporation Commission relating to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Insurance with some time spent on the Legislature.\In particular, Arizona PIRG has focused on utility rates and increasing energy efficiency. This has the social and health benefits of improving health and air quality. The Arizona Corporation Commission recently approved the nation's most stringent energy-efficiency standard, which requires all electric utilities in Arizona to increase their energy efficiency (reliance on solar, wind and other renewable resources) by at least 15 percent by 2025.\Q: Would that lead to an increase in utility rates? Why would PIRG support that?\A: We're looking at the the overall benefit for consumers not only short term but also long term. There may be instances where a rate increase is justified, particularly if it means there will be an increase in energy efficiency that will in the long term result in (utility) bills being lower.\Arizona PIRG is also working towards a Phoenix-Tucson passenger rail.\Q: Hasn't this high-speed train been under discussion for years?\A: The idea of a Phoenix-Tucson rail has been discussed for decades, but for the first time last year, the Arizona State Transportation Board approved a rail plan for the entire state. They are proposing the next steps would include an environmental-impact study for the rail.\We've also been working on insurance issues. Under the federal health-reform law, any proposed insurance-rate increase of 10 percent or more needs to be made public. The Arizona Department of Insurance is the state authority that will implement this policy for Arizona, and it is looking at doing it soon instead of letting the federal government do it for us.\Q: Is Arizona unique when it comes to insurance-rate oversight? Why is this authority important for our state?\A: Arizona PIRG is working to be sure the agency moves forward in a way that would increase consumer participation and taxpayer involvement in these issues. Ultimately this policy change would give the state the authority to deny any unjustified insurance-rate increase. At this time, Arizona Department of Insurance cannot (prohibit) insurance-rate increases from going into effect. But the Arizona Department of Insurance needs that authority to protect consumers."
39,"Officials at Arizona Public Service Co.'s parent company said Thursday that their prosperity hinges on an improving economy and, eventually, regulatory approval to increase profits while decreasing total power sales.\APS can ask state regulators at the Corporation Commission for a rate increase next year, and likely will take the opportunity to ask for a ""decoup-ling"" mechanism in its rates. That would allow APS to increase rates and maintain its profits even as it enlists new technology to reduce power consumption.\For now, the company is investing in efforts such as low-power light bulbs and rebates for customers who tune up their air-conditioners, and taking the hit when those customers buy less power from the utility.\But that could change under a decoupled rate structure.\In July, the commission voted to require regulated electric utilities to reduce the amount of power they sell by 22 percent by the year 2020 by helping homeowners and firms save energy.\The move parallels a national push to increase energy efficiency and cut back on building multimillion-dollar power plants and transmission lines -- which ultimately are financed by customer rate hikes.\APS officials support the rules but want to maintain their revenue even as they sell less power.\""From APS' perspective, the commission must implement an effective decoupling mechanism or similar device in the next APS rate case if APS is to achieve the rigorous energy efficiency standard contained in the rules,"" said Don Brandt, president and CEO of APS' parent company, Pinnacle West Capital Co.\He said the company has been participating in public meetings with the commission to discuss decoupling, and noted that Chairwoman Kris Mayes issued a draft statement supporting decoupling for utilities.\""We view many of the commission's activities as signaling positive developments for Arizona's regulatory environment,"" Brandt said.\The policy statement from Mayes cited a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study that said customers of APS and Tucson Electric Power Co. could save $5.2 billion through 2030 with energy-efficiency promotions at the utilities, even if rates increased through decoupling.\""When looking at decoupling, it makes complete sense for us,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Kevin Cole, who, like others tracking Pinnacle West stock, had questions about the policy Thursday.\""Are investors better off in the long run with you pursuing a decoupling scheme?"" analyst Greg Gordon of Morgan Stanley asked Pinnacle West officials.\Company officials responded that decoupling would allow them to continue their company's growth as the economy improves and their customer count rises.\""It's been important from our perspective pursuing decoup-ling that we didn't trade away any of the intrinsic value of our company, and that is the long-term growth profile,"" Brandt said.\Pinnacle West reported Thursday that it improved its quarterly profit by 14.3 percent excluding a gain related to its discontinuing real-estate segment.\The company's earnings were helped by a rate increase that became effective this year and warm weather, although a decrease in per-customer power use held profits down a bit.\For the third quarter, Pinnacle West earned $226.7 million, or $2.08 a share, compared with $198.4 million, or $1.96 per share, in the same quarter last year.\Excluding a $7.2 million gain related to the real-estate subsidiary the company is discontinuing, the company earned $233.9 million for the quarter.\Revenue rose to $1.14 billion from $1.09 billion in the same quarter last year.\Analysts, who usually don't focus on one-time charges, expected the company to earn $2.01 a share on revenue of $1.13 billion.\Weather in APS territory from July to September was not as warm as last year -- the average daily temperature was 94.1 degrees compared with 94.6 degrees last year -- but daily humidity was 5 percent higher, the company reported.\""Although the recession has slowed our historically robust growth patterns, Arizona retains numerous qualities that make it a desirable place to live and do business,"" Brandt said. ""Its past record of strong growth remains an attractive, distinguishing characteristic for our company."""

These dirty sources negatively impact public health, damage and pollute our environment, and emit greenhouse gases, contributing to global climate change.\The utility has made strides toward replacing some of this polluting generation with renewable energy sources, but they have not gone far enough. SRP customers, this is our opportunity to stand up and request a clean-energy plan that focuses more on energy efficiency and renewable energy resources.\SRP should aim for goals similar to those of Arizona Public Service Co.

Because SRP is not regulated by the Arizona Corporation Commission, it is not subject to these requirements and instead is looking at a combined renewable and efficiency goal of 18 percent by 2020. This includes existing large hydropower plants and other resources not allowed under the Renewable Energy Standard.\A greater investment in energy efficiency by SRP will help lower energy bills and save customers money, drive down future energy costs, delay the need for new power plants, reduce water use and help protect public health by improving air quality and decreasing greenhouse-gas emissions. Considering all of the benefits to customers, it would make sense for SRP to set up a similar efficiency goal separate from a renewable-energy goal.\Generating more of our electricity from clean, renewable resources, including solar and wind, can help us transition from polluting coal-fired power plants rather than spending ratepayers' money on new units and cleanup measures.\In its most recent pricing process, SRP customers were responsible for paying higher rates in order to construct a new unit at the Springerville Generating Station and associated transmission and distribution facilities, as well as to clean up existing power plants that were in violation of the Clean Air Act.\Now, SRP is looking at major expenses associated with cleaning up the Navajo Generating Station.

Considering all of the benefits to customers, it would make sense for SRP to set up a similar efficiency goal separate from a renewable-energy goal.\Generating more of our electricity from clean, renewable resources, including solar and wind, can help us transition from polluting coal-fired power plants rather than spending ratepayers' money on new units and cleanup measures.\In its most recent pricing process, SRP customers were responsible for paying higher rates in order to construct a new unit at the Springerville Generating Station and associated transmission and distribution facilities, as well as to clean up existing power plants that were in violation of the Clean Air Act.\Now, SRP is looking at major expenses associated with cleaning up the Navajo Generating Station. Rather than continually expecting customers to pay more in order to clean up these old dirty coal plants, SRP needs to transition to clean sources.\SRP customers, let's tell them what we want: a commitment to clean, renewable energy sources and energy-efficiency measures that make sense for our wallets, our health, our children and our environment.\Find out more at www.srpnet.com/environment/sustainableplan.aspx.\Jon Findley of Mesa is an SRP customer who works with non-profits on environmental and energy issues."

44,"Re: ""Reporter to U.N.: Many immigrants remain invisible,"" by Daniel Gonzalez, Dec. 13 Valley & State In Depth.\In comparing the changes to New York and Chicago from immigration in the early 20th century, Gonzalez fails to point out these immigrants were here legally. This is not the case with a large segment of the Latino immigrants in Phoenix and other major U.S. cities.\These 19th- and 20th-century legal immigrants eventually assimilated themselves and became non-hyphenated Americans. My maternal grandfather's family arrived from Italy in the late 1800s, and my grandfather would not allow my mother to speak Italian in the home, as they strove for accent-free English. This was in the era when the concept of ""e pluribus unum"" was understood and a driver for assimilation.\Gonzalez mentioned the problem with the Turks in Berlin, due to the refusal of most Muslims to assimilate into their new home country. This has resulted in a serious problem of Balkanization throughout much of Western Europe's Muslim population.\His comment that Latinos are despised by our ignorance or prejudice is simply wrong. We are a nation of laws, and respect for the law is the issue. If illegal immigration is OK because these immigrants are doing work others will not do, then I presume it is OK for anyone to violate any law if our motives are pure.\--Everett Chamberlain, Phoenix\Let Cheney take defense of torture on international tour\In the Monday USA TODAY section, former Vice President Dick Cheney defends the enhanced interrogation techniques and apparently is making the media rounds to get his message across.\I can hardly wait for him to travel out of country to continue his defense of the torture techniques and critique of the CIA Senate report.\--Angel Rodriguez, Glendale\Municipal water users should follow CAP example, save water\I was encouraged to read about California, Nevada and Arizona collaborating in the face of looming Colorado River water-delivery reductions due to the falling water level in Lake Mead. I was disappointed, however, to read that while the article did say municipal water users could be affected in the future, it left the average reader with the impression that there was little the municipal water consumer can or should do.\Central Arizona Project provides municipal water to Maricopa, Pinal and Pima counties and would eventually be affected if the level of Lake Mead continues to fall. Individuals need to follow the example of the states and begin now to reduce the demand for municipal water before mandatory reductions occur.\Eliminating high-water-use landscaping and adopting short showers, low-flow toilets and shower heads alone will not avert the long-term water shortage, but it will buy time to generate real solutions to it.\--Chris Jensen, Cottonwood\Obama's energy policy is\nothing but a war on fossil fuel\Edward Murphy (Letters, Dec. 12) praised President Obama for his energy and jobs performance.\The only energy strategy this president has had has been the war on fossil fuel, including shutting down coal and blocking the XL pipeline. Virtually all of the energy progress we have made was made by ""fracking"" funded by private investors on private land.\As for the jobs performance, when you add the discouraged workers into the unemployment number, it soars to over 10 percent. And thanks to Obamacare, many of today's jobs are part time, hardly cause for rejoicing.\--Steve Townsende, Glendale\Get facts straight before praising Obama's (failed) leadership\Regarding the letter praising President Obama's leadership, the writer needs to get his facts straight.\Drilling permits on federal lands have decreased 36 percent under Obama. The reason oil production has grown is due to drilling on private lands. When this administration took office, gasoline was $1.82 per gallon.\The national debt has doubled under Obama. The only reason interest rates are so low is because the Treasury is printing money at the rate of $75 billion per month. China is not buying our debt; the Federal Reserve is. Someday this has to be paid back by our kids and grandkids.\The median annual family income has decreased $4,000 since Obama took office. The real unemployment rate is over 11 percent if you include people who quit looking for work. The labor participation rate is 62 percent, the lowest since the Great Depression.\How in the world can you call this leadership? I think the American voters answered this in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections.\--Dan Earlie, Scottsdale\After creating obstructions,\Republicans want to whine\The audacity of the Republican Party is simply stunning. After stonewalling any productive action for six years, the Republicans are now outraged that the president is providing leadership on the critical issue of immigration. My reaction is good work, Mr. President.\--Julie Sullivan, Chandler\The mayor who cared about\the architecture of Phoenix\It was sad to read about John Driggs passing. I was in high school when he was mayor of Phoenix, and he left a big impression on me. He set the standard for mayors.\His appreciation for the built environment was second to none. He carried that enthusiasm to the work he did with Western Savings through a demand that the bank buildings he built would present an elegant and timeless structure to help make Phoenix a big city with great architecture.\His desire to preserve our past as well as create our future was unmatched. As an architect, I see what he meant to our city. He has left a lasting impression on me and Phoenix. Thank you, John Driggs.\--William X Waldrom, Phoenix\Effort to kill efficiency standard will lead to higher electric bills\Commissioner Gary Pierce is asking the Arizona Corporation Commission to ditch the Arizona energy-efficiency standard, which saves Arizonans millions of dollars.\It was passed unanimously in 2010. This standard cuts electric bills for those who participate. For example, if you buy reduced-cost efficient light bulbs at the hardware store, you benefit. If you are rebated on a new air-conditioner, you also benefit. More importantly, indirectly, it saves us from having to put far more money into new power plants.\Pierce writes that the utilities have so much capacity that the standard is not saving on power upgrades, but one need look no further than utility plans to see that is false. Pierce seems to deny the higher electric bills we would pay if this standard were repealed.\Is his goal to promote expensive power plants costing us much more than this cost-saving standard? Not only does this standard help save us money, it keeps our air and water cleaner. It is a big win for all of us.\--Russell Lowes, Tucson"

46,"A Senate panel tapped the brakes on a bill that would revive a program that uses gasoline-tax money to clean up contamination from leaking underground fuel-storage tanks.\Senators on the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee said the program, which has operated for a quarter century, needs to end. But not quite yet, they decided on a 5-0 vote, although they put shorter time limits on it than bill sponsor Rep. Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, had proposed.\The petroleum industry is lobbying for an extension of the tax that has funded a state insurance program. They argue that, despite requirements that tank owners carry insurance, the program is still needed to help clean up gasoline leaks discovered years ago.\House Bill 2636 now would extend the penny-per-gallon gasoline tax for eight years, through 2023, instead of 2030. Without legislative action, the tax will expire at the end of this year.\The senators had no comment on the tax, other than to say it needs to terminate at some point.\The legislation would allow the state to reimburse gasoline-tank owners who reported a leak prior to mid-2006, as well as anyone who found a leak after that date as long as an application for coverage by the State Assurance Fund is filed by the end of 2016.\Tank owners would still have to meet federal requirements to insure their tanks, but the state would also act as an insurer, covering up to the first $500,000 in costs. In some circumstances, state aid could be as much as $1 million to address a leak. The money would come from the penny tax on each gallon of gasoline.\Tuesday's changes to the bill likely won't be the last.\Sen. Don Shooter, R-Yuma, urged his fellow panel members to support it. But, he said, it will not move for final Senate debate until some issues are resolved, such as the role of private-insurance companies in taking over the coverage of leak cleanups and the extent to which the state Department of Environmental Quality should study the risk of leaks from existing underground tanks.\""In my opinion, it's not ready for prime time,"" Shooter said.\Sen. Gail Griffin, R-Hereford, said she proposed a shorter lifeline for the penny tax as a signal that the State Assurance Fund needs to terminate.\""We need to draw a line in the sand so this doesn't continue forever,"" she said in the committee hearing. Griffin said she remembered debating the program when she previously served in the Legislature in the late 1990s.\She later said lawmakers want clean air and water, but the question of who should be responsible for cleaning up gasoline leaks is a difficult one since circumstances vary among tank owners.\Reach the reporter at maryjo. pitzl@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-444-8963."
47,"In a dynamic, fast-changing economy, job creators have options.\If you construct an environment that is conducive to economic growth -- one that includes the necessary fundamentals, such as educational opportunities, good qualify-of-life options and sound transportation -- the jobs will come. Growth will happen. Or so the economists say.\There is a flip side. If you do not provide the essential elements of growth, they will go elsewhere. In Arizona's case, to Texas. Or Nevada. Or, even still, to California. The American economy is dynamic and business has options.\By nearly every measure, Arizona's commitment to transportation is flagging. We are failing to keep up with the competition. And that could prove deadly to the state's economy.\Today, the state is resting on its laurels. Having built hundreds of miles of freeways in the past quarter-century, and 20miles of light-rail transit in the Phoenix metropolitan area, we seem to have concluded that's enough. It isn't.\The funding formula for transportation is leaking badly. Based largely on a gas tax that does not account for inflation and a half-cent sales tax that falters badly in recessionary times, Arizona's Highway Users Revenue Fund, or HURF, is capable of producing barely a third of the revenue needed to meet state needs over the next 20years.\The numbers are profound. Just to fund basic transportation needs, state transporation officials calculated in 2010 that Arizona would need to find an additional $62.7billion over the next 25years to cover the state's transportation needs. That doesn't include the great economy-enhancing engine of them all: an Interstate 11 linking Phoenix with Las Vegas.\On transportation, Arizona needs vision and leadership. And a sense of cooperation that transcends old boundaries, such as the gulf between Tucson and Phoenix. We need a new way of looking at what ""transportation"" means.\Transportation is connectivity. It connects economic growth centers.\It is not defined by a gas tax or a sales tax. It is not a funding source -- which is how we have tended to define transportation in decades past. Transportation is the vehicle for creating a growth economy. A smooth, multimodal transportation system in a dynamic, mobile society is the essential tool for creating jobs.\Arizona's immediate economic future depends on decision-makers recognizing the nexus between sound, diverse transportation and job growth.\Some are. Gov. Jan Brewer convened a broad-based business-government coalition called the Arizona Transportation and Trade Corridor Alliance, which is expected to make recommendations about transportation improvements and how to pay for them. Regional transportation authorities are talking seriously about a new, three-county transportation bond. Arizona and Nevada have formed an alliance to further the creation of Interstate 11.\All of them are talking about how to fund transportation in Arizona. And all that talk is expected to reach a crescendo in 2014.\Economic growth requires sound transportation. Arizonans have a decision to make on that score, and soon.\|\OVERVIEW\Five steps to take now to bring about an Arizona transportation renaissance:\1. Make a transportation-building campaign about the taxpayer's best interests. A real transportation plan is not about a higher gas tax or a new user fee. It's about the economy. And jobs. Historically, every Arizona transportation campaign ever launched has focused on passing a new tax or convincing the Legislature to hike funding to build a shiny, new transportation thing. At best, that approach worked sometimes. This time, advocates for building a 21st century transportation system must make the case that a substantial investment in transportation is in the public's best economic interests. That it is the difference between our children living productive lives and barely scraping by.\2. Link arms. Territoriality is us. It can't be any longer. Arizona's habit of viewing transportation investments almost entirely in local terms is butting heads with the modern reality. You cannot hope to create the multimodal, transregional transportation systems that Arizona needs if your focus is merely citywide. Or countywide. Or even merely statewide.\3. Live the new reality: It's on us. Arizona and its Southwestern neighbors, including Mexico, cannot wait for federal assistance to create the economic-transportation infrastructure we need. The days of Washington shelling out billions for ""shovel-ready"" projects have passed us by. Perhaps the feds will help with some projects. Perhaps not. We cannot sit and wait to find out.\4. Recognize that the status quo simply is not an option. In Coconino County, half of what the high-country region receives in highway-user-fund revenue from the state is spent on snow removal. Not on road-building or road-safety projects. On snow removal. The state Transportation Department's budget is barely a third of what the most conservative-minded needs assessments say it should be. And even those scarce resources have been plundered by the Legislature in recent years. This is not acceptable behavior for public leaders who wish to see their citizens employed.\5. Refocus. Economically speaking, Arizona is not a stand-alone state. We are at the center of a highly mobilized east-west economy ranging from Dallas to the Southern California coast. At the same time, we are the U.S. portal to a transcontinental economy that runs from northern Mexico to the Canadian border. And we are part of an urban economic triangle that includes Las Vegas and Los Angeles as our growth partners -- likely the fastest -growing economic region in the country over the next several decades. This is the environment that our transportation systems must be constructed to accommodate.\|\The New Arizona\ABOUT THE SERIES\Sept.22 >> As we come out of the cold of the Great Recession, now is the moment to fire up strategic plans for a more prosperous Arizona.\Oct.6 >> Arizona needs to more aggressively mine the rich vein of commerce on our southern border and boost our trade with Mexico.\Oct.20 >> Our state's elected and business leaders should find new ways to shore up one of our most important industries: aerospace.\Nov.03 >> Water, the lifeline of our desert state, will be in peril if we do not plan ambitiously to keep it flowing.\Nov.17 >> As Arizona undergoes a dramatic redesign of the U.S. health-care system, it must continue building the scaffolding to medicine's high-tech future.\Today >> The cyclical pattern of economies suggests Arizona will resume its historic growth, a good reason to start planning the transportation to support it.\Dec.15 >> The world has changed, and Arizona's K-12 education system needs to change to keep up."
48,"Gov. Janet Napolitano has indicated her desire for new laws against price gouging.\Attorney General Terry Goddard is also conducting an investigation of oil companies. Two previous attorneys general made similar investigations and found no illegal profiteering.\The Senate and House Transportation committees are investigating and developing possible solutions to provide Arizonans with some immediate relief.\One of those solutions is to temporarily suspend Arizona's gas tax of 18 cents per gallon. This would save more than $2 million per day for Arizonans. An average citizen would save about $20 per month with this plan.\The governor has touted a budget surplus. In order to keep road and highway construction on track, the savings to consumers resulting from a brief moratorium on the 18-cent per gallon gas tax would be replaced in its entirety from a portion of this budget surplus.\The governor believes that the immediate relief to Arizona consumers resulting from a suspension of the gas tax would be minor for some consumers.\As one who is chauffeured around in a car filled with gas paid for by Arizona's taxpayers, perhaps Napolitano's immunity from the gas crunch leads to her feeling that the $20 per month savings is not significant enough.\But this possible solution will benefit all Arizonans and provide significant relief to small and large businesses that depend on gasoline. These businesses provide Arizona with the jobs that feed families and spur our economy.\The governor wants to create a backdoor cap on gasoline prices which will create greater shortages while demands for gas remain constant. Her proposed solutions will result in long lines at gas stations and will throw a speed bump in the way of Arizona's dynamic economic growth.\In essence, it really boils down to whether you want to control when and where you buy gas or whether you want Big Brother telling you when, where and how much to fill up, through mechanisms like rationing.\Before we rush toward more regulation and bigger government, we should look at creating an environment that makes it easier for gasoline to reach Arizona consumers.\This industry is one of the most heavily regulated, and while we look toward the suspension of the gasoline tax as a temporary solution we will also be looking at how we can provide relief by removing bureaucratic red tape.\Rather than looking for ways to bring more government into the problem by deciding how much profit is appropriate, we need options that will allow businesses to continue to thrive and meet the needs of Arizona.\Once prices have stabilized we can then refocus on more long-term solutions -- for example, calling upon our federal leaders to allow for an increase of domestic oil production so that America will be free of our dependency on foreign suppliers.\A comprehensive energy plan, including alternative-energy solutions, is an appropriate remedy to our energy deficiencies, not the knee-jerk, big-government reaction proposed by Napolitano.\The Senate and House transportation committees this week will hold a joint meeting to continue the Legislature's investigation into Arizona's rising gasoline prices.\Those affected by the rapid increase in gas prices, including consumers, the trucking industry, airlines, manufacturers, small business and the petroleum producers, will be there to discuss the impacts of various types of relief.\\\Sen.

And there are still more than six weeks to go before Election Day.\Political campaigns are seldom honorable affairs, even if McCain pledged after clinching the Republican nomination that his would be.\But experts say the 2008 campaign is already more negative than most.\""We're not getting the honorable campaign we were promised,"" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania expert on political communication and co-director of FactCheck.org. ""In an environment in which the nation needs something else, it's been really disappointing.""\""I think 2008 has become the ugliest campaign in recent memory,"" said Darrell West, director of governance studies for the Brookings Institution. ""In past races, candidates were more careful to document their claims. ... There's a lot more noise out there in the media universe, so the candidates assume they can get away with murder.""\Last week, the McCain camp suggested that Obama had indirectly called McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, a pig at a rally.\""You can put lipstick on a pig,"" Obama said. ""It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still gonna stink.""\It mattered little that McCain has also used the phrase. Ultimately, McCain conceded Monday that he didn't think Obama had called the Alaska governor a pig.\The McCain campaign has suggested Obama would raise taxes on the middle class, though Obama and outside economists have said all but the wealthiest taxpayers would get a tax cut under his plan.\Obama has run a musical ad about McCain's professed limited understanding of economic issues. The ad lyrically suggests McCain is a dummy. Another ridiculed McCain for not knowing how many homes he and his wife own.\""I regret, and I'm offended, by some of the negative aspects of this campaign,"" McCain told a Minnesota crowd Friday. He didn't, however, say what he regretted, or even what offended him.\Jacob Neiheisel, a senior researcher at the University of Wisconsin Ad Project, said both campaigns have gone heavily negative. For McCain, 56 percent of his ads have attacked Obama since the conventions ended, Neiheisel said. About 77 percent of Obama's have attacked McCain, Neiheisel said.\West said McCain ran a more civil campaign during the primary season. But about two months ago, the campaign traded a gaffe-prone, free-wheeling campaign that talked of issues like gas-tax holidays for a negative tone intended to tear down Obama's popular image.\""In a close race, candidates get desperate and they'll do anything to win,"" West said.\One July ad from McCain said Obama made time to visit a gym, but canceled a visit to wounded troops in Germany. The non-partisan FactCheck.org noted that Obama did visit wounded troops. He canceled one visit after a military adviser was barred from joining him, raising questions about whether the visit would be seen as solely political.\Meanwhile, if Obama was slow to reach for insulting terms, he is learning fast.\During a campaign stop Tuesday, for example, Obama singed McCain repeatedly for saying the American economy is fundamentally sound. Obama also took McCain to task again for the dozens of lobbyists who have worked for the McCain campaign. And Obama added an insulting allusion to Palin.\""If you think those lobbyists are working day and night for John McCain just to put themselves out of business, well then I've got a bridge to sell you up in Alaska,"" Obama said in a reference to the so-called Bridge to Nowhere, an unpopular federal-earmark project that Palin initially supported.\There has been some fallout from the change in tone.\Obama has been criticized for this week's Spanish ad that ties McCain to comments about Mexicans by conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh and generally faults McCain for GOP immigration policies. The comments, from 1993, were taken out of context, and Limbaugh is hardly a McCain fan.\That follows the bruising McCain took last week for running the kindergarten ad, which didn't make clear that Obama supported teaching children how to avoid sexual predators.\Jamieson said the financial crisis this week and next week's debate should force both candidates to offer more substantive discussions on the campaign trail and in their ads."
50,"What is it about liberals and gas prices?\They rant and rave about overconsumption of gasoline, how it threatens the environment and our national security. They try to force reduced consumption through regulation and prop up alternative energy sources through subsidies.\But if gas prices rise, which might actually do something to reduce consumption, liberals denounce the increases and swing into action to reverse them.\Take Gov. Janet Napolitano's curious decision to seek a federal waiver from Arizona's requirement to use cleaner-burning gasoline during the summer. The only reason cited is to seek relief from rising gas prices.\Now, Napolitano is presumably among those who believe that automobile-related pollution is a serious problem in the Valley. Driving fewer miles means less pollution. Higher gas prices means fewer miles driven.\Ordinarily, the left favors the environment over economic considerations, to the extent it admits such tradeoffs are necessary.\But Napolitano's proposal would actually result in a double-whammy on the environment: more miles driven using dirtier fuel.\Napolitano is also a cagey politician and perhaps this is just a pre-emptive, protective move.\People don't like higher gas prices, and in our flaccid political culture, they expect government to do something about whatever they don't like.\Napolitano's staff admits that the waiver request is all but certain to be a futile gesture. But it will enable Napolitano to say: Hey, I tried to do something about high gas prices. The feds said no. Go complain to Bush about it.\The unwillingness of the political class to let prices do their work, even when the result would be to advance favored policies, is remarkable.\Because I'm an incurable wonk, I once found myself watching a congressional hearing about car and truck fuel-efficiency standards on C-SPAN. Liberals want higher fuel-efficiency standards, particularly on SUVs and large passenger trucks.\It was quite a sight: politicians and a panel of governmental technocrats -- people who don't actually make or produce anything tangible -- discussing what engine improvements were possible at what cost.\One of the politicos asked the panel whether there was anything more effective than higher fuel-efficiency standards to reduce gasoline consumption.\The technocrats were unanimous that there was: a gas tax. In other words, higher gas prices.\That line of inquiry, needless to say, wasn't followed up.\Of course, even without a gas tax, prices have gone up. And customers have responded, even without higher fuel-efficiency standards: Sales of SUVs and large passenger trucks have plummeted. Car manufacturers expect demand to remain lower and are shifting production to models that combine some of the roomier features that people like in SUVs with a more fuel-efficient car frame.\In other words, Congress achieved its policy objective without doing a thing. Perhaps Congress should consider doing nothing more often.\To be fair, it's not just the left that prefers regulation to letting prices and market do their work.\All five members of the Arizona Corporation Commission are Republicans. But they are well on their way to proving the adage that when Republicans are firmly in control, they govern like Democrats.\The purpose of the commission is to prevent monopoly utility providers from reaping monopoly profits by regulating rates.\But commissioners apparently fancy themselves energy traders. They are considering a requirement that regulated utilities produce a substantially larger amount of electricity from renewable sources, even though that is expected to increase consumer prices.\Now, the five politicians on the commission have no particular insight into the future of energy markets. Yet they're contemplating dictating energy mixes decades ahead.\The paradox is this: Renewables, particularly solar, would likely advance quicker if the commission didn't exist.\Solar isn't likely to gain market share through large electricity producers. Instead, it's likely to advance as a tactic individual building owners use to avoid large electricity producers.\For large electricity producers, the cost of producing power varies considerably. Yet with rate regulation, consumers are insulated from the true cost of peak-demand power.\For solar, there are high initial costs for installation, but the variable cost for production is minimal.\If peak power from large producers were priced at true cost, the differential with solar would be substantially reduced and solar might become an attractive way for individual building owners to avoid price volatility. The potential of a real market might attract investment to further improve solar efficiency, narrowing and perhaps even overcoming the price differential with peak power provided by large producers.\The price mechanism can be a powerful force for beneficial change, if politicians will just get out of the way.\\\Reach Robb at robert.robb@arizonarepublic.com or (602) 444-8472.

51,"SUV owners are just safety-conscious\I was watching a story on SUVs on ""60 Minutes"" Sunday and the show basically took the position that those of us who drive these big boats are supporting terrorism, destroying the environment, putting ourselves in danger, and causing grave harm to others. And the media still clings to the notion that it is not biased. Oh, please.\As evidence for all of this, they trotted out statistics on higher rollover rates for SUVs, leaving out the information that there are major differences between one model and another that affects that data. For example a Jeep Wrangler is not the same as a Hummer and so the high rollover rate of the former should not be included in data relating to the latter. Remember, folks, figures lie and liars figure, so all statistics must be taken with a grain of salt.\Good old Morley Safer then had various car experts comment on how in an accident between an SUV and a regular car, the SUV is going to win. Gee, no kidding. That is why I want my family in one. Metal equals safety. It is an old axiom that is as true today as it ever was. Personally, and I think for a lot of us SUV owners, it is precisely that fact that propels us in our buying decision.\My personal highlight of the story was when Morley trotted out some Frenchman to make his case that we Americans only love big things and that, I am not kidding here, we make our decisions based on our ""reptilian brain.""\Finally we come to the combined topics of supporting terrorism and destroying the environment based on the higher than average fuel consumption of these vehicles. SUVs do indeed guzzle gas, but even at today's high prices, gasoline is still cheaper than bottled water.\I know other countries consume less energy. There are lots of reasons for this, but mostly these other places are a lot smaller than the United States. They don't need to drive very far to anything in Belgium. Further, other countries tax the daylights out of gasoline. Just drive to Mexico and check fuel prices. If you want to see demonstrations in American cities just raise the gas tax to make fuel $4 per gallon.\That brings me to the ""supporting terrorism"" issue, or as so many anti-war protesters are calling it, Blood for Oil. This charge is based on the fact that countries like Saudi Arabia make a lot of money on oil and some of their citizens support terrorism. OK, that is true enough. However, it is unfair to blame an entire nation due to a few nuts.\Of course the people spouting this sort of silliness are the same people that believe the upcoming war is for oil in the face of the fact that Iraq is the ninth largest exporter of oil to the United States and hardly significant. We would be better off, if that was our aim, invading Canada, Venezuela, or Mexico as they are the first, second, and third largest exporters of oil to the United States today.\I'll tell you what supports terrorism: the dope that most of the protesters are smoking.

52,"Over the past month, an Arizona job-growth bill has been circulating around the Internet and the state. As written, the bill focuses on tax breaks for large corporations, offers little assistance to the small businesses in Arizona and has a limited short-term impact on creating jobs. While creating a welcoming environment for all businesses should be a concern for every legislator, why not start with a jobs bill that has immediate impact and offers a return on taxpayer's money?\For the past several years, Arizona legislators and the governor's office have swept Highway User Revenue Funds to fill general budget shortfalls. The fund is generated from taxes on each gallon of gas we purchase, monies that are supposed to be earmarked for infrastructure projects.\With more than 10 million people expected in Arizona by 2020, we cannot afford to shortchange the infrastructure of Arizona. Infrastructure that plays a critical role in moving people and goods. Infrastructure that can give Arizona an advantage in the Southwest.\The projects that could be funded are varied, local and statewide, and will have an immediate impact on job creation, from planners and engineers who create/design the projects, to contractors who build the projects, and even suppliers who deliver/manufacture the materials. Jobs would not only be saved and created, but gas-tax revenue would be spent where it is supposed to be allocated.\Arizonans would be given a hard return on our investment. An investment that Arizona will need as we enter our next 100 years of statehood.\Please visit www.andrewforaz.com for more information about my campaign for Arizona State Senate District 11.

53,"Bill managing off-road was on the right path\Re the March 22 editorial, ""Three legislators kill popular ATV bill"":\Arizona Off-Highway Vehicle Coalitions members have worked on and supported the last two attempts at getting an OHV bill passed for Arizona.\This OHV problem is not new to land managers or to OHV clubs and responsible OHV riders. All these groups have been working together on these problems for some time now.\Agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management are in the middle of designating trails systems on all of Arizona's federal land and hope to have that completed by 2009. OHV groups and organizations donate thousands of hours of free labor and equipment to do much-needed projects. We are trying to work on these OHV issue but there simply is not adequate funding to catch up.\HB2573 would have provided dollars and management tools to the land managers to repair, maintain or open new trails or close illegal ones. In no way did this bill circumvent existing federal or state regulations required to do this work.\To comment on state Sen. Robert Blendu's concerns: He says the state of Arizona ""charges us"" a million dollars and ""we"" get nothing from that money.\The million dollars he is talking about is actually $692,100 that is regularly swept by law, by our legislators, from the OHV Gas Tax Fund to pay for operating expenses at Arizona state parks. These expenses are not related to OHV use. This is a legislative problem the OHV community cannot address alone.\The remaining gas tax funds have always found very good projects that do benefit OHV recreation statewide.\Unfortuneatly, the OHV gas tax fund has not kept pace with the growth in this recreation's popularity - a 347 percent increase in the last 10 years. The cost to manage OHV use is huge.\The Forest service estimates more than 29,000 miles of routes and trails in Arizona. At approximately $5,000 a mile to repair and as high as $10,000 per mile to construct trail, this type of legislation is a must to responsibly manage this recreation.\In the Tucson area, as in Maricopa County, the dust issue has forced closure of OHV areas if dust suppressant is not applied to OHV parking areas and access roads. This bill would generate fund for agencies to purchase this material and keep your trails open.\To address the issue of how the dollars could be spent: If, passed, the bill would program dollars to be used to pay for public education on where and how to safely operate off-highway vehicles. This would include maps, information at point-of-sale on where to ride and needed permits, free training for safe operation of OHVs and much more.\Dollars would go for creating the infrastructure needed to keep OHVs on a designated trail system (trails, signs, maps, access guides, mitigation of damage from illegal OHV use). There has to be a law enforcement part of this bill. With no consequence for wrongdoers, no amount of signs will stop illegal use. And it is the illegal use that closes recreation areas.\This bill had so many diverse supporters because it allowed the public and visitors to continue to enjoy legal OHV trails but drastically reduces the problems and damage from illegal OHV use. And, in the end, that is what this bill is about.\OHV recreation generates more than $4 billion a year for Arizona's economy. Some $187 million dollars of that is sales tax alone. It also provides more than 36,000 jobs.\We need to manage this recreation. Legislation such as HB 2573 is a great start.\Don't look at the problem. Look at the solution.\JEFF GURSH\Arizona Off-Highway Vehicle Coalition\Imperfect man leading us to more perfect union'\Sen. Barack Obama's speech, ""A More Perfect Union"" (http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/hisownwords), recognized that many of us feel some degree of black anger and white resentment.\He acknowledged these emotions while neither justifying them nor condemning them.\While condemning their hateful expression, he conceded that these feelings exist.

Yes, a tax to save jobs. Otherwise, the Saudis are going to gut our economy, from the solar industry to auto manufacturers to the oil and gas industry. It's economic war. Do we really want to lose that war?\If not, just immediately raise the gas tax, but make it variable so that when the price goes up (as it will as soon as our oil and gas industry is ruined), the tax automatically goes down.

But, please Arizona Legislature, just do it.\-- Ruth Moyerman, Scottsdale\Want to put APS in its place? Install batteries, leave the grid\As we receive the batteries and place them in the shelves constructed just for them, we had to smile at the coverage of the utility company attack on us solar producers.\By the end of the year we will be able to call APS and advise we need their lines removed from our property as we will go off the grid. This will give us freedom from the politics of helping a private company meet its demands and requirements to their paying public and being taxed for this assistance.\If all solar customers, both buyers and leasers (yes, you can go off grid as a leaser) were to go off the grid, then there would be no arguments as APS and others would have to step up to fill the gap we now fill for them for little if any compensation.\Sure, we may have three to five weeks of no sun when we need to fire up the generator we bought years ago to provide for days APS failed to provide power, but it will be all ours. Rising rates and taxes will be someone else's nightmare.\-- Dave Lordan, Wickenburg\APS should raise rates on those who don't install solar panels\Given the societal costs of coal (planet warming carbon dioxide and mountain top removal) and the expense of building additional power generation plants, instead of raising rates on those installing solar panels, APS should raise rates on those who do not have solar panels installed.\-- John Wurm, Gilbert\If Congress picked vegetables, reforms would quickly follow\In response to the Monday editorial, ""Like vegetables? Then back immigration reform"":\I just can believe what I'm reading. With Obama's new ruling on immigration, somebody is worried that seasonal workers with newly gained legal stability may leave the fields for more steady employment and we won't have anyone to pick our vegetables. This sounds like slavery.\The Republicans want to keep the immigrants in the fields? They don't want them to better their lives? OK, so why don't our children fresh out of high school or college go out in the fields and pick our fruit and make our beds in the hotels? Because certain cultures are not used to back-breaking hard work.\My grandparents came from another country, worked hard, and were able to be mobile. My parents were at least able to get a high school education and work over 25 years for the phone company. Sad to think that if they were one of the Mexican immigrants from over the border, I would not have been as successful working for a computer company for 36 years. I would be making beds in one of the posh Vegas hotels.\To stop people from gaining legal, moral and human stability is barbaric. It would be a great idea for the new Republican Congress to start picking our fruit. Maybe then they can address the human dimensions of this problem.\-- Ellie Liakopoulos, Chandler\'Non-citizen' stamp is racist, injures hopes of young people\Mike Wallace (Letters, Wednesday) believes that stamping non-citizen on dreamers' licenses is not racist.\Maybe not racist only, but another stumbling block for these young people to pursue the American Dream.

55,"The governor recently has indicated her desire for new laws against price gouging, and the attorney general is investigating oil companies. Two previous attorneys general made similar investigations and found no illegal profiteering.\The Senate and House Transportation Committees are investigating and developing possible solutions to provide Arizonans with immediate relief for high gasoline prices.\One solution is to temporarily suspend Arizona's gas tax of 18 cents per gallon. This would save Arizonans more than $2 million a day.\Gov. Janet Napolitano has touted the state's budget surplus. In order to keep road and highway construction on track, the savings to consumers resulting from a brief moratorium on the gas tax would be replaced in its entirety from a portion of this surplus. The average citizen would save about $20 per month.\The governor believes the immediate relief to consumers would be minor. As one who is chauffeured around in a car filled with gas paid for by Arizona's taxpayers, perhaps Napolitano's immunity from the gas crunch leads to her feeling that the $20 savings is not significant.\But this solution would benefit all Arizonans and provide significant relief to small and large businesses that depend on gasoline. These businesses are the ones providing Arizona with the jobs that feed our families and spur our economy.\Napolitano wants to create a back-door cap on gas prices, which will create shortages while demands remain constant. Her proposed solutions would result in long lines at gas stations and throw a roadblock in the way of Arizona's dynamic economic growth.\It really boils down to whether you want to control when and where you buy gas or whether you want big brother telling you when, where and how much to fill up through things like rationing.\Before we rush toward more regulation and bigger government, we should look at creating an environment that makes it easier for gasoline to reach Arizona consumers.\This industry is one of the most heavily regulated. While we look toward suspension of the tax as a temporary solution, we also will look at how we can provide relief by removing bureaucratic red tape and its associated cost.\Now is the time to seek solutions that can provide immediate relief to Arizona consumers and businesses. Rather than looking for ways to bring more government into the problem, we need options that will allow businesses to continue to thrive and meet the needs of Arizona's families.\Once prices have stabilized, we can refocus on long-term solutions, such as calling upon our federal leaders to allow for an increase of domestic oil production so America will be free of our dependency on foreign fuel.\A comprehensive energy plan, including alternative energy solutions, is an appropriate remedy to our energy deficiencies - not the knee-jerk, big-government proposal of this governor.\The Senate and House Transportation Committees continue to meet regarding Arizona's gasoline prices. Those affected by the rapid increase in prices - consumers, trucking, airlines, manufacturers, small business and petroleum producers - will participate to discuss the impacts of various types of relief. Real solutions, explored the right way.\*\State Sen. Thayer Verschoor and Rep. Andy Biggs, both Gilbert Republicans, are chairmen of the Senate and House transportation committees, respectively."
56,"As anyone who drives to work each day can attest, our Valley freeways are\congested - and getting more so every week. Commute times are growing longer\and tempers shorter as hundreds of thousands of Valley drivers find themselves\mired in gridlock. Freeway construction continues but at a snail's pace, while\growth and congestion roar ahead.\In response to this growth, we must speed up the construction schedule for\the freeway projects now on the drawing board. In addition to alleviating\bottlenecks, advancing the schedule for these projects could actually save the\state money. By purchasing land now, before it gets developed and goes up in\value, the cost per mile of freeways could be reduced by millions. And by\reducing the amount of time cars spend idling in traffic, the amount of\pollution produced can be significantly reduced.\The question is, how can we make this happen without raising taxes?\Our first step must be to stop the federal drain on our gas tax revenue.\Each year Arizona sends $85 million more in gas tax dollars to Washington than\we get back in highway money. I have been working with our congressional\delegation to end this unfair subsidy of other states and their highway\systems.\Next, we should include freeway construction funds in the next state\budget, which is being crafted now. Fueled by state tax cuts, the economy\continues its robust growth. Why not take a portion of the money that is\expected to come in over estimates, and use it to solve one of our most\pressing problems - transportation. Building roads is, after all, one of the\most basic functions of government. That is what I have proposed.\One proposal that is working its way through the House would take advantage\of a federal law that permitted the creation of a State Infrastructure Bank\here in Arizona for lending money to speed up construction of freeways. The\bill would direct the state to write checks for up to $400 million into\Arizona's SIB account. That money would then be lent out to complete various\freeway projects ahead of schedule. Over time, the money would be repaid to\the state as the freeways are constructed and local and federal funds become\available.\Of course the state does not have an extra $400 million tucked away in a\room at the Capitol. To understand where this money would come from, think of\the state budget as a checking account. Just as some people put a check in the\mail a few days before payday, so too the state of Arizona would in essence be\""floating"" a check to the SIB for $400 million. That $400 million would\already be pledged to cover various state obligations from teacher salaries\and building rents to health care costs for poor children.\As a fiscal conservative, I'm not entirely comfortable with this idea. The\danger is that if the economy slows, and revenue doesn't come in as fast as we\expect, the state might not have enough to cover its expenses. Freeways are\important, but we have other priorities, such as education, that must remain\our No. 1 priority.\I support the SIB concept; my concern is with financing that puts at risk\funding for other state programs. It is smarter to capitalize the SIB account\in the budget, as I have proposed, than to use dollars that are already\pledged elsewhere.\Expanding our freeways sooner rather than later is a goal that cuts across\party lines. The booming economy created by seven years of tax cuts and a\business-friendly environment here in Arizona has given us the means to build\freeways more quickly without raising taxes. We must not allow legislative\gridlock to squander this opportunity to ease the gridlock on our streets.\CAPTION: Brenda Burns"

Also, the time and money they spend fixing potholes is a waste. The very next rainstorm wipes out all the work that was done, and then it all has to be done again.

So he walked away from a multimillion-dollar contract. Yes, he died for his country. Sure, he is a hero. But what about the other heroes who have died in Iraq?\You don't see them receiving a nationally viewed funeral. They died, as Tillman did, for our country. They lost much more than a multimillion-dollar contract: their children, wives or husbands, mothers, fathers. What makes his death any more mournful?

The U.S. House and Senate are moving to finalize a $300 billion, six-year transportation bill that will continue this practice.\The Environmental Working Group recently completed a monthslong investigation using several million computer calculations on 3 million U.S. Department of Transportation records. The results (at www.ewg.org) show that:\- In 176 metro areas, gas tax payments to the highway trust fund exceed spending on transportation by more than $20 billion total.\- Tucson had an estimated $275 million shortfall in federal highway expenditures compared with gas taxes paid during the past six years.\- Phoenix-Mesa commuters lost $900 million while Phoenix-area commuters saw $787 million less than they paid.\These disparities have received little consideration on Capitol Hill, though many members of Congress are fighting to ensure that states receive federal highway funds equivalent to what they contribute in gas taxes.\ELIZABETH C.

58,"Raise the gas tax. Double grazing fees. Protect funding for state parks and wildlife.\These measures, and more, would cost money now but could save the state big bucks in the long run, a coalition of grass-roots organizations said in a report released Thursday.\That's because such spending would improve the state's environment and its attractiveness as a place to live, said Chad Campbell, executive director of the Arizona Advocacy Network.\The group did not have a balance sheet showing how much money could be saved if its ideas are put into place.\But in a news conference at the state Capitol, Campbell called the state's current policies ""fiscally unsound and environmentally damaging.""\For example, the state's emphasis on building freeways has come at the expense of mass transit, as well as traffic and pedestrian safety, he said.\Throughout the 1990s, Arizona saw a decrease in the share of its transportation budget that went to non-road projects, he said, citing a study done by the Surface Transportation Policy Project.\The metro area has consistently rated poorly for pedestrian safety and has ranked in the top 10 of congested cities, he said.\The network, which consists of environmental, political, social and consumer groups, suggests that the state put more dollars into mass-transit projects, particularly light rail for Phoenix and Tucson.\It also recommends a variety of ways to pay for such projects, such as raising the fuel tax an unspecified amount (although it says a 1-cent increase could raise $500 million over 20 years), and creating a gasoline sales tax.\None of these ideas is popular in the Legislature, and Campbell acknowledged the group has a lot of work to do to bring about its desired shifts in public policy. For example, changing HURF allocations would require a change in the state Constitution.\Besides transportation, the ""Investing in Arizona's Future"" report examines sprawl, water use, air quality, grazing leases, energy efficiency and water quality.\Campbell said the group wanted to sketch a large vision, but recognizes that it will have to start with smaller steps.\One such move could be a proposal to help smaller Arizona communities in their efforts to conserve land. This could be done by using the interest earned on dollars in the state's ""Growing Smarter"" fund for matching grants to small and rural communities for land preservation.\\\Key proposals\Some key recommendations from Investing in Arizona's Future, a report by the Arizona Advocacy Network:\* Raise the cost of grazing leases on state trust land to match market value.\* Establish a sales tax on gasoline and use it to pay for transportation projects, including mass transit.\* Prohibit well drilling within a quarter mile of river and stream beds.\* Raise water prices to increase conservation.\* Create a regional planning body for the Phoenix metro area, with control over land use, transportation and air-quality issues.

59,"It took a village to clean fuel from urban desertscape\By SHERYL KORNMAN\skornman@tucsoncitizen.com\After 25 days of labor over two months, the sweaty work of a crew that trimmed back a gnarled midtown firetrap is done.\The city workers, neighborhood volunteers, homeless people and students who collaborated to clear dangerous overgrowth from a half-mile-long urban desertscape called Arroyo Chico Wash got the hearty approval of a city fire inspector yesterday.\""You guys have done a really great job. It's protectable now,"" said Randy Clinkingbeard, the Fire Department's hazardous materials fire inspector.\The desertscape is ""the most emblematic area of Sonoran Desert species in the city,"" says environmental engineer David Confer, a resident of the Colonia Solana neighborhood through which Arroyo Chico Wash runs.\The wash, with flatland on both sides, is a half-mile long and 150 feet wide.\It is a well-known riparian habitat, home to 62 species of birds - more species than any other neighborhood in Tucson, according to Bill DuPont, Colonia Solana's homeowners association president.\A bird population study was done a few years ago by a University of Arizona doctoral candidate, DuPont said.\Clinkingbeard is experienced in nonstructure fires; he teaches wildfire fighting in Tucson.\He toured the site on foot and by SUV yesterday with a city transportation official and an environmental engineer and resident of the Colonia Solana neighborhood, who steered the project to completion.\With the high fire danger this summer, officials said the area could be a hazard if dead trees and plants were not removed.\The area had been well-watered until the Army Corps of Engineers several years ago built a project in Reid Park to control flooding in the wash.\Before that, water had sheeted up over the wash and nearby streets, said Joe J. Plasentilla, the Transportation Department's street district superintendent.\In those days, residents were required to have flood insurance.\The water kept the trees, cactuses and other plants in the wash lush and green.\But since the water was diverted about three years ago, undergrowth died, and the natural but hazardous material piled up.\Plasentilla said this is the most extensive wash-clearing project the city has undertaken.\Earlier projects involving Alamo Wash, south of Speedway and west of Wilmot, and Rose Hill Wash, near Broadway and Kolb, mostly involved removing debris left by people who used the washes as landfills.\Residents in the upscale Colonia Solana neighborhood had protested even when the city tried to trim trees overhanging the roads alongside the wash.\The city had to keep access to the roads clear for road repair, but homeowners were concerned that natural vegetation was being destroyed.\Things are different this summer.\""I think they realized there was a fire hazard"" that could endanger their homes, Plasentilla said.\So city transportation officials and the Colonia Solana Homeowners Association began an unusual collaboration to remove the dead growth while leaving native plants and trees.\The effort began in May and was completed today.\The collaboration was completed with the cooperation of Plasentilla, the homeowners association president; Bill DuPont; Clinkingbeard, the Fire Department's hazardous materials fire inspector; and Colonia Solana resident David Confer, who has a doctorate in environmental engineering.\It was Confer, who works on sustainable environment projects through his business, Sustainable Design and Development, who trained a Transportation Department heavy equipment operator, Martin Pena, to train others to identify native and non-native plants and trees.\Pena, who usually works on road repair and construction with a jackhammer and other heavy equipment, said he took on the urban wash task as a challenge.\On any other day he might be filling potholes or building roads.\""I prefer it to asphalt work, so I didn't mind,"" he said yesterday, as he did some touch-up work with a chain saw.\Now, firefighters from Fire Stations 3 to the west and 11 to the east will visit the site to acquaint themselves with the spruced-up wash, Clinkingbeard said.\""They know all the entry points, how to get in and out in case of fire,"" he said.\Area residents donated sweat, know-how\By SHERYL KORNMAN\skornman@tucsoncitizen.com\There are no lions, tigers and bears in this Land of Oz, planted more than 75 years ago to create an urban desert parkland smack in the middle of Tucson.\But there are coyotes, javelina, snakes and cottontail rabbits - and dozens of species of birds - in Arroyo Chico, a half-mile-long swath of riparian habitat that runs through Colonia Solana, a midtown neighborhood.\Bill DuPont, president of the Colonia Solana Homeowners Association, helped coordinate a recent effort to clear from the area non-native plants and trees, especially the African sumac and Mexican paloverde.\Nopal cactuses, native to Sonora, Mexico, were left behind. They had been planted to help represent the cactuses of the region, according to environmental engineer David Confer, a resident of the neighborhood who volunteered his expertise and dozens of hours to the cleanup.\The nopal cactuses were not harmed because they enrich the environment and do not contribute to the dangerous overgrowth, it was determined.\""I've been here (in Tucson) most of my life, and we wanted to come in and not just cut everything down,"" said Joe J. Plasentilla, the city Transportation Department's street district superintendent. He oversaw the department's part in the cleanup.\""This has been such an experience. We've had a great relationship with the neighborhood,"" he said.\Coyotes, javelina, snakes, lizards, quail, rabbits and other wildlife that call the wash home are still in residence.\The coyotes and javalina left when the work started in May, but they're back now that the shovels are packed up and the city's Solid Waste trucks have pulled out, piled high with debris cut from the wash.\A few homeless people camp in the wash from time to time, and debris they left behind was cleared up, too, Confer said.\About 900 cubic yards of debris were removed from the wash, city transportation officials said.\""We've been working three years on trying to get the arroyo clean,"" DuPont said.\Three years ago, the wash was the responsibility of the city's Parks & Recreation Department, he said.\But due to budget cuts, it reverted to the city's Department of Transportation, which by then had some funding from the gas tax for maintenance projects.\The rock-and-concrete retaining walls at each end of the wash were built by city road crews to control flooding, but nothing had been done to control the overgrowth in the wash, which is city property.\This summer, fire officials determined the wash could be a fire hazard and told residents of the neighborhood something had to be done.\The Transportation Department offered to blade the wash, but that was not acceptable to the homeowners.\They wanted to preserve the desert landscape and knew what they were talking about. Some of them have professional expertise in landscape architecture and environmental engineering.\The neighborhood is one of 16 in Tucson's register of historic places, DuPont said.\And the Arizona Historic Preservation Office has recommended the neighborhood be nominated for national recognition as a historic site, he said.\The wash was created between 1924 and 1928 by landscape architect Stephen Child, DuPont said.\""He wanted the houses (that would be built there) to face the wash,"" DuPont said.\The homes were built starting in 1928, he said.\Child wanted the wash ""to preserve the local flora and fauna,"" DuPont said.\Part of Child's plan was to bring cactuses from throughout the Southwest to Arroyo Chico Wash, but that grand plan was scuttled because of the Depression.\Present homeowners share Child's goal of a Arroyo Chico as natural as possible.\As time went by, it became more difficult to keep vegetation in the wash from becoming a fire hazard.\With the high fire danger this summer, the Tucson Fire Department inspected the wash as part of its wider effort to get homeowners to clear brush around their homes to remove fire fuel.\Fire officials decided Arroyo Chico Wash met a criterion for fire hazard designation in its present condition because it is close to homes.\It was decided that city workers with chain saws, and others from the Solid Waste Department would pick up and haul away cuttings.\Crews recycled everything they could, DuPont said.\There was quite a bit of mesquite, and it was offered to residents of Colonia Solana who wanted to pick it up and cut it into firewood.\Truckloads of mulch, created from the daily trimmings, were delivered to residents.\Mailings by the homeowners association to Colonia Solana residents let them know about the project and the firewood and mulch.\The association, which was created in the mid-'80s, doesn't want to change its name, DuPont said, in order to become an official city neighborhood association.\It gets no financial support from the city's Neighborhood Resources Department and pays its own expenses through optional membership dues. In order to get city funding, the association would have to call itself a ""neighborhood association,"" which homeowners there are not willing to do.\The homeowners group paid the wages of the homeless workers it employed to provide manual labor throughout the project through Primavera Works.\Primavera helps homeless people find shelter and employment.\University of Arizona and University High School students also offered free labor in the cleanup effort.\Parks & Recreation workers brought in a chipper on Wednesdays, after the plants and shrubs had been pulled.\Fridays, Solid Waste workers brought in trucks to pick up clippings.\Before any live plants were removed, Confer or someone he trained to determine what should stay and what should go would walk along a section of the wash and tag what should be pulled.\""It was a much bigger project than we expected,"" DuPont said.\MAP: Arroyo Chico\Source: Tucson Citizen\PHOTO CAPTIONS: Photos by GARY GAYNOR/Tucson Citizen\City heavy equipment operator Frank Galaz cuts a mesquite branch above Arroyo Chico Wash.\Primavera Works employee Rick Garcia with a heavy load of prickly pear skeletons\PHOTO MUG CAPTION: GARY GAYNOR/Tucson Citizen\Joe J.

60,"As a teacher, I am not sure if I should be excited or confused. A few years ago, we passed a law that linked teacher pay to a school letter grade, which was determined by the results of a statewide standardized test.\Now legislators are considering a bill that wants to give parents the option of having students ""opt out"" of the state test.\The good news is that our test scores will improve dramatically. Because students who find class work difficult or inconvenient will no longer be taking the test, all of our schools will soon be ""excelling.""\The bad news is that with no data, we will lose the ability to spot these students when they walk in the door, and get them the help they need right away.\I agree standardized tests are not the solution to all of the challenges in education. But it is ironic that the same legislators who argue for competition in education feel threatened by the idea of a test that we can use to measure the success of students in different learning environments, within our state and the rest of the country.\Every business and organization needs objective metrics by which to measure improvement. Why should education be any different?\-- Christina Kimble,\Gilbert\Accelerating tax schedule\does homeowners no favors\I recently received my notice of valuation from the Maricopa County Assessor's office. Yes, the change in my value was the first thing I looked at, but what was even more interesting was the assessor's advocacy for condensing the property tax calendar.\He doesn't like the fact that owners receive their noticed value 18 months before it's taxed, that the current system is ""cumbersome, untimely, and lacks true transparency."" He wants to fix the problem by valuing property and taxing it in the same year, which would ""allow for negative shifts in market conditions to be addressed in a far timelier fashion"" than the current system provides.\So how often have we as property owner's experienced ""negative swings"" in our property values? More often than not and absent a recession, my property value grows every year.\So what the assessor really wants to do is to allow my property taxes to increase at a faster rate than what the current calendar allows. On the rare occasion when my property value drops, I can rest assured I will be taxed at a lower value that one year.\-- Jim Brodnax,\Glendale\Don't think you pay enough?\Don't forget sales, property tax\I read with great interest James Hoffmann's desire to pay more in taxes to help fund recent cuts to the universities and community colleges. (""Tax me more; let me pay for services the state provides,"" Wednesday Letters.)\He complained that that he owed state income tax but was refunded $383 because of of $400 credit for charitable donations. He asked ""What sense does it make that we can live here all year and pay no income tax for all the state services we enjoy?""\First off, most of the services he enjoys come from other than the state, and are funded by unavoidable property taxes. Pay the bill or lose your land.\Don't think for a minute that the income tax is the only source of state revenue. What about the state sales tax? Surely he makes purchases throughout the year? If he has automobiles: the license plates. And what about the gas tax?\It seems to me that if Hoffman wants to pay more in taxes, he should have simply forgotten about his charitable contribution when he filed his return. With that, he could have felt good about paying the $383 he owed. If he wants to pay even more to the tax man, I'd be delighted if he paid my taxes too!\-- Randy Jenkins,\Sun City\If reservation rejects highway, build no access to it\I see that the South Mountain Freeway must be built totally on non-reservation lands.

61,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."

The cracks are terrible on main driveways east and west to Interstate 17, even near the Phoenix Art Museum.\From DowntownDynamo: Good news. The city will be using about $20 million of transportation stimulus dollars for street repairs and paving.

63,"It's sad and unseemly to hear so many Americans whining about gas prices while brave men and women are dying in an effort, whether wise or not, to keep the oil lanes open.\But it's not surprising that many Americans assume that cheap gasoline is a civil right. Cars have driven us insane. Just drive around Phoenix -- or try to -- amid the rage and madness, played out with 4,000-pound projectiles moving 20 miles per hour or more above the speed limit. The folks inside are probably pleasant enough until they get behind the wheel. It doesn't help that car ads on TV feature gladiator-style driving.\In this bubble of car madness, it's easy to forget that we have chosen to be so dependent on the automobile. We have chosen SUVs over more fuel-efficient cars; policy breaks for Detroit over investments in new technologies and transit; and building houses in the far suburbs over renewing older close-in neighborhoods.\Whether one approves or disapproves of those choices, they have increased our dependence on oil.\With this madness comes confusion.\We celebrate ""the greatest generation"" of World War II, while many Americans seem unwilling to make any sacrifices to fight Islamic totalitarianism. Terror's seed and target is our oil addiction. Wartime has never been so easy or so fun on the home front or so we think.\We complain bitterly about OPEC, but it's the drama of co-dependency. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries fears truly high oil prices more than an American with a 100-mile commute in a Hummer does. Remember, oil prices are not that high when adjusted for inflation. If they reach real records, it will cause conservation and a search for alternatives that would wreck the oil producers.\OPEC wants oil just high enough, like any other business relationship.\The price gougers and the oil companies are our other villains. No doubt industry concentration and ""just-in-time"" methods reduce competition and keep supplies tight. But neither OPEC nor Big Oil is primarily to ""blame.""\We're witnessing the price mechanism when a world is bidding for a limited resource. The world has taken our cue about driving and sprawl. The American model, exported globally, is creating unprecedented demand.\But the most important factor is terrorism at the heart of the world's oil capitals. Whether oil resources are peaking or not, we face a long-term challenge to the security of Middle Eastern oil fields. Millions of men there, cut off from modernity, are the angry recruits of extremism. Our oil addiction both empowers dysfunctional regimes and forces us to intervene in the oil fields as an imperial power.\Faced with madness and confusion, both political parties respond with pandering and cowardice. Republicans want to drill everywhere, while Democrats would tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The first idea would only postpone the reckoning, while furthering our addiction and degrading the environment. The second idea is utterly unserious: draining a strategic reserve so Susie the Soccer Mom thinks she's getting a one-week drop of a few pennies, if that.\Deep down, we know what we must do: a major national push for conservation, new energy technologies and sustainable communities.

67,"This article is one in a series of articles contributed by Arizona State University's Global Institute of Sustainability. The institute advances interdisciplinary research and education on environmental, economic and social sustainability.\-\The idea of sustainable transportation looms large as gas prices skyrocket and Valley residents must pay up or reduce their travel. Both choices have severe impacts on the economy and livability of our region.\Sustainable transportation is not just about the environment -- it's about providing options, options that allow residents to adjust to changing conditions.\Arguably, the Valley of the Sun has forgone sustainable planning solutions for the ""one-size-fits-all"" model of more freeways, wider arterials, ubiquitous free parking, unwelcoming sidewalks, leapfrogging developments and segregated land uses. All these features have created more dependence on the automobile and fewer choices for our residents. But ""free markets"" only function when there are choices.\Planners have criticized this model since the 1950s, when freeway planning was moved from local bodies to state departments of transportation with often top-down approaches. Some cities rejected this paradigm, refusing new freeways and funding public transit instead. That means, for them, high gas prices do not translate into mass extortion. Public transit is improving, mind you -- especially in Tempe, Mesa and Phoenix -- but how do we solve this problem regionally?\To begin, we must ask ourselves tough questions, such as: why continue with our freeway construction programs? Sure, to stop such programs would devalue outlying areas and increase congestion, but even with more freeways, drivers will suffer from high gas prices.\And there are other problems. Maricopa County already has among the dirtiest air in the country, and Arizona is the fifth-worst state in the nation for traffic fatalities.\Most planners agree that new exurban developments consume added freeway capacity even before the freeway opens and adding road capacity to solve congestion is unsustainable. It is like loosening one's belt to solve a weight problem; eventually you run out of belt and you still have the weight. Again: Why not stop now?\Let us concentrate development on urban infill sites and near light rail, express bus and other transit and job centers. We could enact a comprehensive affordable housing policy so families do not have to ""drive till they qualify."" The hundreds of commercial centers in the region could accommodate housing.\At just moderate densities, the region could continue to grow without expanding horizontally. With more local and express buses, light-rail and bus rapid-transit extensions, and bike lanes and canal paths, we could steer the system in a more sustainable direction. Some outlying areas may be devalued, but that process is happening anyway because of gas prices.\We also need to question our planning policies and public-policy status quo and address the balance between the state DOT and regional and local planning bodies.\Instead of introducing new sales taxes, we should consider raising the gas tax and allowing it to fund public transit. We could rely more on property taxes and impact fees to fund transportation, since much of the value from transportation investments accrues to property.\We should reconsider regional tax policies so cities are not competing for often inefficient development.\We also need to question our air-quality management plans claiming we can nearly double regional automobile travel and still meet standards we already have trouble meeting today.\Our past planning efforts have put us into a deep hole -- so why keep digging? At a significant but not (yet) insurmountable cost, we can shift our course in our region and provide more diverse and sustainable living and travel options for a more sustainable future.\-\Aaron Golub is an assistant professor at the School of Sustainability and the School of Planning at ASU. His research focus includes public transportation systems, social equity and the environmental impacts of transportation."
68,"As the East Valley Chambers of Commerce Alliance works to refine and solidify a preliminary list of goals for the coming year and legislative session, officials are hoping Southeast Valley business owners will come forward with the issues that concern them.\""We're in the process of developing our priorities,"" said Otto Shill, chair of both the EVCCA and the Mesa Chamber's Business Advocacy Council. ""If there are specific issues that are important to them, now's the time to get involved with the chambers.""\In deciding which points are most important to pursue and which specific positions to take, the alliance also invites speakers from various industries. During the last legislative session, the alliance ultimately weighed in on more than 40 bills that affected businesses, according to Chandler Chamber President Terri Kimble.\Though Shill stressed that 2014's priorities haven't been set in stone, a few issues came up repeatedly in interviews with leaders from all four Southeast Valley chambers of commerce.\They all cited the Affordable Care Act and its implementation as a major source of confusion and anxiety for businesses, for instance.\""You want to talk about a big old question mark that everybody has,"" said Kathy Tilque, Gilbert Chamber of Commerce president. ""We're not quite sure what that all is going to look like. The bottom line on health care is that the uncertainty has businesses really holding back on making long-term decisions, so we're going to be looking at that.""\Shill said, ""The (Obama) administration wasn't expecting the extent to which businesses were willing to reorganize to avoid having to comply with some of the rules.""\""They pushed off most of the penalty requirements for another year, so now's the time for businesses to be looking at employee demographics and figuring out how you're going to be reconfiguring your workforce,"" he added.\As the Arizona Corporation Commission weighs opening Arizona's electricity market, utilities are another hot topic.\""Energy and water have always been important issues, but with a lot of the things that are going on right now -- the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) regulations; the Navajo Generating Station and how that impacts the delivery of water and/or electricity; and then the deregulation of electricity -- those are going to be huge,"" Tilque said. ""All of that is brewing right now.""\With the Tempe bus strike fresh in officials' minds, transportation also has center stage.\""The way we fund most transportation, through the gas tax, by virtue of cars getting more energy-efficient is going to become less and less in the future,"" said Mary Ann Miller, Tempe Chamber of Commerce president.\""From a Tempe standpoint, we will always be looking to make sure that our state-shared revenues are not negatively impacted, given that as the economy comes back, other communities will be growing in residents whereas Tempe, being landlocked, won't grow by nearly as large as a percentage.""\Simplifying the tax code to make Arizona more business-friendly continues to be a priority, though chamber leaders aren't ""sure how much we will realistically be able to introduce this next year,"" Tilque said.\""I think you're going to see from us a clear message, and that is that we need to lower the cost of doing business in Arizona,"" she said.\""How do you provide consistency and predictability in the business environment? There are a lot of national issues that are creating uncertainty. If you pile on state issues that create uncertainty and then you get down to municipal level, you have created a big mess and businesses are going to be stalled. Anything we can do legislatively to cut through some of that...would be helpful.""\Secondary issues including education funding, unemployment benefits, infrastructure and facility maintenance, flexibility in municipal-level zoning and upcoming elections.\Suggestions for changes in state law that would help local businesses can be directed to the alliance's lobbyists at 602-606-4667."

71,"Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and Democratic challenger David Garcia tread familiar ground in their second head-to-head public forum Tuesday, debating the best ways to improve economic prosperity, secure the state's border and educate Arizona's children.\But the Tucson debate also pushed the candidates to detail their views on a spate of issues that had gone unaddressed during the candidates' Monday discussion in Phoenix.\The discussion gave viewers a look at how the incumbent and his opponent would tackle everything from water conservation to school safety.\Some topics and the candidates' positions:\Asked about transportation infrastructure in rural areas, Garcia said that in many Arizona towns, ""the road in is not only a pathway, it is the lifeline to economic development.""\""Highway funds have been stripped from our budget for several years now,"" he said. ""I know they're starting to return, but there's still much work to be done for rural Arizona.""\He didn't answer the question of whether he would raise the state's gas tax, saying only that rural Arizona is ""looking for options.""\""What the state has routinely done is pass along budget cuts that go to cities and towns and counties, and they have to make up the difference,"" he said. ""...They need investment at the state level.""\Ducey said that ""infrastructure is the backbone of our economy,"" and ""now that our budget has available dollars, we've been able to reinvest in rural roads.""\""We were able to accelerate $134 million for (State Route) 189, and we have additional dollars available,"" Ducey said.\The 3.75-mile roadway will connect the Mariposa port of entry with Interstate 19 in Nogales.\""We're not going to raise gas taxes, especially when electric cars are what's coming next,"" he said.\When the discussion shifted to water conservation, Garcia said the issue ""keeps me up at night.""\""Water is the lifeblood of Arizona, and it's one that we cannot play politics with,"" he said.\If elected, he said, ""one of the first things we'll focus on is bringing all parties together and working on addressing Arizona's drought-contingency plan, working on water-conservation measures, and building the kind of trust and transparency that Arizona leadership has shown in the past instead of politicizing this issue.""\Ducey acknowledged there are ""things we need to do to address today's water needs, both from a reform perspective and from a generational perspective.""\He said part of the reason he appointed Jon Kyl to replace the late John McCain in the U.S. Senate earlier this month is ""because he is a water expert.""\""We'll have the reforms done in this next (legislative) session through the drought-contingency plan,"" he promised. ""I talked to Senator Kyl about it today.""\Regarding new energy sources, the governor says he wants ""to see solar, I want to see wind, I want to see innovation and technologies come to Arizona.""\""But my first concern is for Arizonans who are on a fixed income, the Arizonans that are vulnerable and living paycheck to paycheck,"" he said. ""I want affordable and accessible energy.""\Ducey said he believes ""nuclear energy is clean energy"" and vowed to ""bring a common-sense approach that allows our state to grow, that allows renewables to come here, that improves our environment, our water, our air.""\Garcia said the state ""should be a leader in solar energy"" and that officials ""need to look at the sustainability and long-term aspects of our economy and of our energy structure.""\""It has not come about, because we have...energy companies locally who are not investing as much as they need to in everyday Arizonans,"" he said. ""For that to happen, we need leadership that is going to make it a priority that we become a solar superpower.""\CREDIT: Maria Polletta"
72,"Diane Whittaker boarded the light rail at McDowell Road and Central Avenue on Tuesday morning, leaving her night-shift job at a downtown office just as others started their day.\Next stop: 19th Avenue and Montebello Road, where she would catch a bus to her Phoenix home.\Whittaker has taken this route since moving to Phoenix a year and a half ago. She finds it convenient and much cheaper than having a car.\""I can go basically everywhere with the light rail and the bus,"" she said. ""When I moved here, I didn't have a car. I haven't bought one yet. There's no rush.""\Though the Valley has been cast as having a dominant car culture resistant to widespread use of public transportation, a new report released Tuesday finds it moving away from that image as Arizonans such as Whittaker increasingly turn to public transit.\The study of statewide transportation trends found Phoenix and Tucson residents driving less and frequently seeking alternative modes of transportation: options such as walking, biking and ride-sharing.\Annual driving miles per capita in Arizona decreased by 10.5percent between 2005 and 2012, according to federal highway usage statistics and census data cited by researchers.\Meanwhile, Arizonans are using public transportation more than ever.\In metro Phoenix, the number of public-transportation trips per capita increased by 16 percent from 2005 to 2010.\In the Tucson area, the number of public- transportation trips increased by 25 percent during the same period, according to the report.\State, regional and municipal public policies need to reflect that growing preference for non-driving travel options, the report said.\The reasons are many and varied.\Much of the shift is being led by the Millennial generation (18- to 34-year-olds), which is more environmentally conscious and less interested in driving.\Other factors include the increasing costs of gasoline and vehicle ownership; increases in telecommuting; seniors who feel they can no longer drive safely; and the availability of alternatives, ranging from ride-sharing smart-phone apps to the 20-mile Valley Metro rail line, which opened in December 2008.\The study was conducted by Arizona Public Interest Research Group, with funding from St. Luke's Health Initiative.\Transportation is no longer just about driving a car on a highway, the study said.\Jeremy Stubbs of Phoenix began riding light rail when he was a college student and has been using it regularly for two years.\He made the decision to use public transit after his car was stolen, but he said he had always liked the idea.\Working downtown makes the light rail a convenient way for Stubbs to commute to work.\The money he saves is the main reason he prefers public transportation.\Figuring in car payments, insurance and gas, Stubbs estimates he saves $400 a month.\""Also, the idea that it's better for the community and the environment -- that's a close second,"" he said.\The two age groups that witnessed the largest growth between 2000 and 2010 -- 60 to 64 and 25 to 29 -- both are increasingly moving away from driving, the study said.\Arizona has a larger senior population than the national average. Seniors are looking for alternatives to getting behind the wheel. Often, they do not feel safe or comfortable with driving anymore, the report said.\""The report documents how Arizona is experiencing a shift in how people travel,"" said Diane Brown, Arizona PIRG director.\Transportation officials should capitalize on shifting attitudes by using innovative travel tools, real-time schedule updates and services to encourage car-sharing, bike-sharing and ride-sharing, the report's policy recommendations said.\There also is greater demand for transit, bicycling and pedestrian infrastructure.\Officials should reallocate resources away from expenditures in ""expensive, unnecessary new highways, and toward the maintenance and repair of our existing infrastructure and the development of new transportation choices,"" the report said.\But there always will be a need for highways, especially to encourage trade, travel and other economic opportunities between states, said Laura Douglas, Arizona Department of Transportation spokeswoman.\She noted that there are certain statutory limits that do not allow state gas-tax revenue to be diverted to public-transit projects from highway funding.\The challenge for state and regional transportation planners has been balancing the competing needs of highway construction and maintenance with local transit, said Jack Sellers, chairman of the Transportation Policy Committee at the Maricopa Association of Governments.\While the report pointed out the demands of Millennials and seniors, there also is a key population in between -- namely, families with children -- that is dependent on driving private vehicles, Douglas said.\Still, light-rail ridership is at levels that were not expected to be reached until 2020, and Valley public transportation had 73 million riders last year, Valley Metro said.\|\19.1 passenger trips per capita taken on public transit in Phoenix in 2005.\22.2 passenger trips per capita taken on public transit in 2010, a 16 percent increase from 2005."
73,"Pay-as-you-go roads have eased congestion on clogged highways and brought states much-needed revenue.\But toll roads, often created through partnerships with private business, also come with heavy opposition and battles over control.\Lawmakers will have to weigh the benefits and disadvantages as they consider several new bills that if passed would add Arizona to a growing list of states turning to tolls roads to help pay for rising transportation costs.\""This isn't going to solve all of your problems,"" said Leonard Gilroy, director of government reform for the Reason Foundation, a Los Angeles think tank. ""It's going to apply to a slice of your transportation needs, largely in urban areas where you've got a lot of growth.""\Arizona's relentless growth and rising costs of construction and maintenance is stretching the limits of traditional financing based on fuel taxes and fees, forcing officials to consider alternatives such as toll roads. The need is especially critical as the state develops a long-term plan for transportation improvements that could cost billions of dollars. The state is at a crossroads of changing its method of transportation funding, Gilroy told the board of the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce in November. Foreign companies are pouring money into other states such as Texas and California, and Arizona should position itself to rake in money from public-private partnerships, he said.\Key legislators have been reluctant to approve toll roads because they place an additional tax on residents. A new effort to create a statewide transportation plan and Gov. Janet Napolitano's push for transportation improvements could change that.\The option of creating toll roads ""has to be in the mix,"" said Marty Schultz, a member of a coalition of business interests pushing for the statewide transportation plan. ""We can't stick our heads in the sand.""\The benefits\Deals with private industry to finance, build and operate new or existing highways can take financing pressure off of state budgets. Companies also can build roads faster than governments, advocates say.\Facing a $1.8 billion highway construction shortfall, Indiana in 2006 leased its Indiana Toll Road for $3.8 billion to a joint venture for 75 years. The companies involved are owned by an Australian developer and toll-road operator and a Spanish toll-road and parking-lot operator.\Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said the tollway was losing millions of dollars every year and the lease provided ready cash for more than 200 transportation projects.\""Leasing it extracted the equity in the project,"" said Thomas Gresik, an economics professor at the University of Notre Dame. ""There were no gains coming out of the toll road as it stood before.""\Besides generating money, toll roads can offer ways to manage congestion. They can fund new highway construction, and the cost of the tolls can prompt drivers to pursue other routes.\""In a fiscally restrained environment, toll roads offer a solution to increase capacity,"" said Christopher Poe, director of the Center for Tolling Research at the Texas Transportation Institute. ""Arizona, Texas, other Sun Belt states, you're going to need all of these (financing) tools to (address) the transportation needs that these states have.""\The drawbacks\Despite their benefits, toll roads are controversial.\In Pennsylvania, a dispute rages over turning Interstate 80 into a toll road. Angry crowds have turned up at meetings run by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, which would operate the toll road.\Elsewhere, opponents in Texas, Indiana and Illinois have been critical of those states' handing of toll roads.\People oppose toll roads primarily because they are viewed as double taxation. They feel their taxes already paid for a road that they now will have to pay to use.\""This is not free markets applied to roads,"" said Terri Hall, regional director of the anti-tolling San Antonio Toll Party. ""These are state-sanctioned monopolies. This is big business teaming up with government to stick it to the little guy.""\John Enright, an escrow officer who commutes between northeast and downtown Phoenix, lived in Buffalo, N.Y., and used the toll roads there. He said the toll roads were always clogged and even systems with auto-pay scanners required drivers to slow to a crawl so devices in their cars could be read by overhead scanners.\""The drive time in Phoenix already is a pain,"" he said. ""It would be devastating if they put tolls where there are heavy morning commutes.""\Another problem with toll roads is in the deals themselves. When private companies take over highways, states give up some of their control. There also is backlash about foreign ownership of U.S. infrastructure.\A consortium of private interests built a $130 million toll road on California 91. But the contract carried a non-compete clause that barred new roads within 1.5 miles of both sides of the toll lanes. The toll operator objected when the state wanted to expand. The dispute was settled when the Orange County Transportation Authority bought the toll road for $207.5 million.\Poe said it's difficult for government to write a contract with a toll-road company that will predict all of the issues that will crop up over, say, a 50- or 75-year term. Government needs to retain its right to build whatever roads it deems necessary, he said, but balance that with the pressure new or expanded roads would put on profits of the toll roads.\""The public sector can keep as much control as they want through that concession agreement,"" he said. ""If they give up too much, shame on them.""\What's ahead for Arizona\Arizona legislators considered several toll-road bills last year, including one to convert the Valley's carpool lanes into pay lanes.\Two key proposals died in committee. Not enough lawmakers were willing to take up the pay-to-drive issue, but similar measures are being considered this year.\""Too many people consider roads an entitlement and resent paying for roads and road maintenance,"" said Curtis Lueck, a Tucson transportation consultant. ""Frankly, if our legislators continue refusing to raise gas taxes and user fees, tolls become an attractive option -- maybe the only option, short of stopping growth.""\Polls say the public would rather pay higher gas taxes than use pay highways. But money for new roadways has to come from somewhere. Experts acknowledge that the public is going to pay, either in taxes or tolls. The debate is on which is most appropriate.\Eric Anderson, transportation director of the Maricopa Association of Governments, expects to see more innovations in transportation financing. For instance, he thinks that in the next couple of decades the gas tax will be replaced with a vehicle mileage tax.\Anderson said there is a mistaken notion in the state that toll roads can be the easy answer to Arizona's transportation-funding issue.\""It will not solve the crisis,"" he said.\|\TOLL-ROAD STRATEGIES\As toll roads grow, states have tried myriad strategies for footing the construction bill, paying for operations and deciding how to charge drivers.\VIRGINIA: Full private development\The 14-mile Dulles Greenway connects to a state-owned toll road. The Greenway was designed, built and financed by private interests, which also operate it.\INDIANA: Leasing option\The state leased the Indiana Toll Road to two companies for $3.85 billion for 75 years. The deal set limits on how much the companies can earn through tolls.\CALIFORNIA: Congestion pricing\Tolls for special lanes on California 91 coincide with traffic. As congestion increases, so do tolls. The road is said to be the first in the U.S. to use this system.\|\Toll-road bills\State lawmakers will consider several toll-road bills this year. Here's what some of those bills would do:\* Create a toll road that would run from the intersection of 75th Avenue and Loop 303 to Prescott.\* Convert carpool lanes into high-occupancy toll lanes.\* Outline rules for the state when it contracts with private companies for transportation projects, including toll roads.\* Require that private companies contracting with the state for transportation projects be based in the U.S.\* Allow for the creation of highway authorities, including those that can collect tolls."

A young\sergeant asked, ""Ever have to kill a little brown-eyed baby girl coming at you\begging for candy with a grenade in her hand?""\Did we ever wonder about the great number of drug addicts, suicides and\mental wards filling with Vietnam vets to bury their memories?\Want to talk about war crimes? How about a scandalous wartime fraud in\which billions were bilked from us by sergeants and generals with greedy\corporate salespeople and Saigon bureaucrats? We called them the Khaki Mafia.\Most of those military millionaires still walk free even after a U.S.\Senate investigation and a federal trial in the 1970s, betraying some 200,000\dead and wounded GIs.

75,"ELECTION 2003\TOMORROW'S ELECTION\PROP. 200 AND 201\Readers speak up about transit election\PRO\There are many positives\In the spring of 2002, Tucsonans turned down a plan for transportation ""improvements"" offered by the city and heavily promoted through a costly ad campaign. The plan featured giant grade-separated intersections designed to speed auto traffic through the congested heart of the city and out into the suburbs as quickly as possible.\Tomorrow voters will have an opportunity to vote on a new transportation plan, Propositions 200 and 201, which comes as a result of thousands of hours of hard work by citizens whose only incentive is to make a livable city for Tucsonans.\The plan includes greatly expanded bus and van service, street repairs, sidewalks, bike paths, added police, and the beginnings of a future light rail system serving the east and south sides as well as several shopping malls, the University of Arizona, downtown and Rio Nuevo. Such a light rail system requires many years of planning and government approval before becoming a reality, and this would be the necessary first step.\While three-fourths of Tucsonans are able to drive cars, this plan will benefit all in many ways. Daily commuters will be able to get to work or school in a rapid, stress-free manner. People unable to drive can get where they need to go. Fewer car trips translates to cleaner air and less need to widen streets and condemn properties.\Last year the city and car dealers and others seemed to have unlimited funds to promote their ""Cadillac"" plan. This year the ""compact-model"" citizen plan depends on one-to-one voter education. I urge all city voters to say ""yes!"" to Propositions 200 and 201.\JUDY A. GRAY\Tucsonans deserve another option\I've recently noticed billboards sponsored by an organization called ""Independent People Like You."" One of them threatens that if we get a new light rail system, it will ""rip up Broadway,"" as if a few months of inconvenience is more important than having a mass transit system that works better for people and the environment.\Maybe the problem with the slogan isn't that it advocates independence, but that it fails to also advocate responsibility. The more we drive our cars, the more we pollute the air. Unfortunately, it seems like we don't have a lot of choices. What can we do without driving a car?\An improved mass transit system gives us another option. It affords independence while also being responsible.\SUSAN M. CALHOUN\Jeff Smith wrong about fares\Jeff Smith's Oct. 29 column on Propositions 200/201 - ""Give light rail a shot, then we'll try go-carts next"" - mentioned ""increased passenger fares on city mass transit."" I believe he was referring to the ""increase in fare revenues resulting from increased ridership (there will be no increase in fares)"" as stated in the Citizens Transportation Plan literature.\The analysis supporting the Citizens Transportation Plan holds that fares will not increase, even with light rail. Transit revenues will increase, the result of increased ridership.\Smith is ""skeptical as to how well (light rail) would work in a scattered-out city such as Tucson."" Several cities with successful operating light rail lines or approved lines under active design have comparable population densities to Tucson. And let's remember, Tucson is only going to grow.\Tucson has 2,656 people per square mile, which includes empty land on the Southeast Side, skewing the number further downward. Phoenix has 2,342 people per square mile and has a light rail line in final design. Salt Lake City has 1,467 people per square mile, almost half of Tucson's density.\Like Smith, I, too, would like to ""keep the rest of Tucson from looking like 'I-10 Meets I-19, The Sequel.' "" This is why I (and many others) have donated so much personal time and energy to inform the public of the tremendous benefits the entire city will gain from this investment in our future. This is why I have already voted ""yes"" on Propositions 200 and 201. It's about time.\CAMILLE KERSHNER\CFASTS Volunteer Coordinator\Propositions will benefit drivers\Please allow me to make a final plea to the automobile drivers before the election tomorrow.\Propositions 200 and 201 are good for people who drive cars in Tucson. Here's why:\1. No gas tax, hence, no increase in the price of gasoline.\2. No one will be forced to give up their car.\3. No one will be forced to ride the light rail or the buses or the trolley.\4. With more people riding buses and light rail, there will be fewer cars on the road that drivers have to contend with.\5. The light rail construction will not be nearly as bad as what those billboards claim.\6. Light rail will help minimize wear and tear on the streets.\7. Neighborhood streets will be resurfaced.\8. Widening of major corridor streets will not be needed with light rail.\So, if you drive a car, please vote yes on Propositions 200 and 201. It will benefit you.\DALE SHUMWAY\CON\Lots of questions, no answers\We are hearing all kinds of claims about the success of transit expansion in other cities, but always in vague, qualitative terms that do not tell us whether there has been any significant reduction in traffic congestion or any scientifically measured reduction in air pollution.\If light rail spurs growth along the line, how will that reduce traffic in that area? It would appear that increased development would more than offset an increased percentage of trips by transit rather than auto.\What, if any advantage is there in having light rail compared to improved bus service along the same route? And what is the difference in cost for both?\What percentage of traffic would be diverted from automobile to transit as a result of the plan? I would like to see actual numbers.\What will happen to property taxes along the route? What are the chances that people living on the outskirts of town would move to in-fill development?\Will transit service be fast enough for commuters? What about riders who must transport groceries and other cargo?\A lot of questions about the transit propositions seem to be lacking answers.\ALFONSO GOMEZ\Light rail will be a boondoggle\Regarding the Oct. 29 guest column, ""Tucson mass transit has history of manipulation"": Mary Beth Callie writes well and does a good job outlining the history of mass transit in Tucson. But her understanding of the proper role of government in a Constitutional Republic leaves a lot to be desired.\It is not a primary role of government to support ""basic infrastructure."" In a non-socialist society, mass transit - or indeed any kind of transit - is the responsibility of the individual.\Our original highways were private turnpikes and our transcontinental railroads were private enterprises encouraged by the government through tax advantages.\If there is a need for light rail or any other kind of mass transit, free enterprise will meet that need better and cheaper than the government. The sole role of the city should be to stay out of the way and give a tax break to anyone who will meet the supposed need.\History should teach Callie that if the government runs mass transit, it will be a just another boondoggle like Sun Tran, La Placita Village and the Convention Center.\ED KAHN\All aboard for a fleecing!\Picture this: Build a light rail from City Hall Depot. For a fee you will be taken for a ride.\CLARA McINNIS\Copy Phoenix, move traffic better\I have lived in Tucson for 63 years and have seen many changes, some for the better, some not. Like many Tucsonans, I loathe Phoenix, but they do one thing we need to take a look at: They move traffic. You can go from one end of town to the other in a very short time.\We still have a small-town attitude. If it takes workers hours to get to work, not too many employers will want to come here.\Light rail would be a good way to get rid of two lanes down whatever street they run the thing. This is not the answer.\The city and county first should learn to get along with each other, then send all of their traffic engineers to Phoenix to observe how to move traffic.\It's not with bike paths or lagging left turn signals. As I recall, lagging left turn signals were going to be an experiment to see how they worked. The experiment failed and blocked traffic. I guess that's what they wanted because they changed all the signals to lagging left.\This is the computer age and they should use them, not play games.\The concept of park and ride is great. There should be more lots with room for more cars. How about trying to get major employers to add their own shuttle buses from park and ride lots?\Run big buses during rush hour and smaller ones every hour or two the rest of the day.\When designing a road, don't they take future traffic into consideration? If they would have built the Rillito-Pantano Parkway years ago, extended Sunrise through to Houghton, and all the rest that was proposed, we wouldn't be where we are today.\We don't need more bike paths, and this ""not through my neighborhood"" stuff has got to stop.\DAMON A. PROSE\Where's the proof?\I have yet to see any study demonstrating light rail would be a cost-effective means of transportation in Tucson.\If someone could prove the money spent on light rail would move more traffic and remove more congestion than the same money spend on adding bus service, I might vote for it if I were in a good mood on election day. Otherwise, forget it.\RENE SMITH\PROPOSITIONS AT A GLANCE\Proposition 200\Allows an increase in the city sales tax of three-tenths of a percent from the existing 2 percent and an increase in the city's sales tax on construction contracting to 6 percent from 2 percent.\Money raised from the increases would be deposited in a city account and used only for specific transportation plan components.\Proposition 201\Enacts the increase in the city sales tax and the sales tax for construction contracting.\It contains the transportation plan drafted by Citizens for a Sensible Transportation Solution and requires city officials to adhere to the plan and implement a transportation system that focuses on transit over road widenings and expansion projects.\PHOTO CREDIT: XAVIER GALLEGOS/Tucson Citizen\CUTLINE: Tucson traffic heads eastbound on 22nd Street, near Kolb Road."
76,"Frank Devine wanted to buy a clean car. One that ran on something other\than gasoline. One that would not foul the air.\But east side, west side, north and south, he could not locate a dealer in\the Valley that carried what he wanted: a Chevy Cavalier with a lively engine\that would run on both compressed natural gas and gasoline.\So he bought a gas-powered car and planned to convert it, only to discover\there isn't a conversion kit able to handle the job.\His dilemma reflects the roadblocks Arizona faces as it tries to clean up\its air by weaning motorists from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.\The state has built a national reputation on its incentives to encourage\businesses and individuals to use vehicles that run on compressed natural gas,\electricity, propane, hydrogen or solar energy. This week, the most lucrative\incentives took effect: tiered tax credits that offer the biggest benefit to\the cleanest cars. They could erase the extra cost of buying an\alternative-fuel vehicle.\So far, the enticements have been virtually fruitless.\Of 3.3 million registered cars and trucks on Arizona's roads, only about\6,600 use alternative fuels. With numbers like that, the environmental effect\of such vehicles is obscured like the profile of South Mountain on a bad-air\day.\Proponents say those numbers don't give the full picture of alternative\fuels and their potential for cleaning up the Valley's air.\As last week's high-pollution advisories and daytime haze reminded, vehicle\exhaust is a key source of air pollution. Factor in the 60 million miles a day\that motorists pile up on Valley roads, and the air pollution benefit of cars\driving on low- or zero-emitting fuels is enormous.\And there's the added plus of reducing reliance on foreign oil.\""You wouldn't need the Seventh Fleet sitting in the (Persian) Gulf. You\don't have to worry about who's going to become buddies with Saddam next\week,"" said House Speaker Jeff Groscost, the lawmaker who has spearheaded\Arizona's alternative-fuel policies.\Amanda Ormond, director of the state Energy Office, said it will take 20 to\30 years to make the technology shift to new fuels.\BUMPS IN THE ROAD\The first five years have been slow going. The reasons for the sputtering\start are many:\*Often, Valley car dealers simply aren't prepared to sell cars that run on\anything other than gasoline. Calls to Chevrolet, Chrysler and Toyota\dealerships yielded no information about whether they sell such cars, even\though those manufacturers make them.\""I've never heard that question come up, and I've been here five months,""\said a salesperson at Lou Grubb Chevrolet.\*Fuel can be hard to find. There are only seven fueling stations for\compressed natural gas, five for propane and 34 charging stations for electric\vehicles in the Valley.\*The technology seems foreign to most people, who don't realize, for\example, that a car powered by compressed natural gas drives just as well as\one fueled by gasoline.\*The upfront cost can be daunting, and the incentives designed to bring\down the price can be baffling. Although cars fueled by compressed natural gas\tend to cost less in the long run than those that run on gasoline, cost\comparisons are not readily available to most customers.\*And the state, busy creating legal sticks and financial carrots, hasn't\publicized them - or enforced them. Groscost said the state needs to fire up a\public relations campaign on how motorists can drive out of air pollution.\One thing is certain: The fuels pollute less than gasoline and diesel.\A 1998 Ford Crown Victoria that runs on compressed natural gas, for\example, produced 66 percent fewer hydrocarbons than a comparable gas-fueled\Crown Victoria, according to a test done by at a local emissions station.\The natural-gas car produced 40 percent less carbon monoxide and registered\zero for oxides of nitrogen, a chief component of ozone pollution.\Electric and hydrogen-powered cars don't even have to take the emissions\test because they don't burn fossil fuel.\For motorists willing to drive such cars and trucks, Arizona offers\everything from thousands of dollars in tax credits to nearly free auto\registration and unrestricted use of the coveted HOV freeway lanes.\STATE SNAFUS\Five years ago, the Legislature ordered all government fleets in the Valley to\convert to alternative fuels. They were to be the trailblazers, stimulating\the market and leading to the installation of fueling stations throughout the\Valley.\But even that strategy hasn't run according to plan.\None of the government fleets met a state mandate requiring 90 percent of\their vehicles to run on alternative fuels by December 1997.\""I could have told you that five years ago,"" Ormond said. ""The standards\we set were so incredibly high.""\There are no penalties for missing the deadline, and 14 government agencies\have dropped out of the program altogether. They say high costs prevent them\from making the switch to cleaner-burning vehicles.\Ormond said it makes little sense to punish the agencies. Many of the\obstacles are beyond the control of local governments, she observed.\For example, a hail storm in Manhattan, Kan., last year caused several\months' delay in Phoenix getting 52 Ford pickups that run on either gasoline\or natural gas. The trucks were shipped to Kansas for modifications to their\fuel systems when they were pockmarked with hail. Phoenix bought the repaired\trucks at a discount.\In another case, state fleet officials were so frustrated about Ford's\delay in delivering 134 alt-fuel vehicles that they fired off a letter to\Ford's chairman and CEO, Alex Trotman. He never responded.\Despite the obstacles, some government agencies have embraced the shift to\the new fuels.\The state's Capitol Police is the first force in the United States to\patrol in an exclusively alternative-fuel fleet. The small department uses 11\Crown Victorias that run on compressed natural gas.\The city of Phoenix has the largest fleet of alternative vehicles in the\state, numbering more than 900. More are on the way. The city's new buses,\which hit the streets last summer, are powered by liquefied natural gas\instead of diesel, a move that is reducing the smelly black plumes of exhaust.\As these fleets expand, the state policy aims to spread the message to\private fleets, hoping to lure them with big tax breaks.\But the private fleets haven't taken the bait.\""It's tough to compete against ARCO at 95 cents a gallon,"" said Ed\Hempelman, a senior account salesman with Southwest Gas Corp.\There are faint signs of progress. Castle Boutique, a chain of adult\bookstores, converted its truck to also run on compressed natural gas.\""I live here, too,"" said Taylor Coleman, president and CEO of the Castle\Superstore Corp. ""I know having a vehicle that puts out less emissions is\very important.""\SuperShuttle long has run on compressed natural gas, due to a city mandate\that it use clean-burning vans to and from Sky Harbor International Airport.\The state's incentive system favors cars built to run exclusively on\alternative fuels.\This cools the fervor of business owners to take the less costly step of\converting their vehicles, said Nathan Learner, president of AZ Star\Alternative Fuels, a conversion company.\""It has nothing to do with the environment,"" Learner said. ""It has\everything to do with economics.""\Despite his frustrations with slow movement in the conversion market,\Learner knows that a lot of his success hinges on the gas pump.\""When gasoline goes to 2 dollars a gallon, I'll be a popular guy,"" he\said. ""But I can't tell you when that will happen.""\NOT EASY FOR INDIVIDUALS\Individual motorists are the last component in a switch to alternative fuels.\Their impact could be significant.\But local dealers aren't rushing to get Valley motorists into such cars. At\Mel Clayton Ford, a salesperson said he could provide an alternative-fuel\vehicle. But he wasn't encouraging.\""There's some tax advantages, if you're a 'green' person,"" he said. But\the price is high, and finding someone to maintain the car could be a problem,\he added.\General Motors' EV-1, the first mass-marketed electric car since the early\days of autos, isn't aggressively pushed, despite the fact the Valley is one\of only three spots in the United States where it's offered for lease.\Radio and print ads don't give the address of dealers, only a Web address\and a toll-free number that frequently requires long waits for service.\In two years, about 100 of the cars have been leased between Tucson and\Phoenix, and 400 in Southern California.\The people who do manage to get a car powered by electricity or compressed\natural gas on the road face other annoyances.\Ted Hidinger can't count the number of Department of Public Safety officers\who have pulled him over while he's driving solo in the freeway carpool lanes.\""It's amazing to me how ignorant people are of our own laws,"" said\Hidinger, a senior consultant at Arizona Public Service Co. ""And the general\public flips me off when I drive by.""\Most people who buy alternative-fuel cars aren't acting on a whim. They're\deliberate and motivated to do what it takes to find the right car.\Devine is one.\An early skeptic, he became a believer in the clean-air benefits of such\cars after working with them as maintenance administrator for the Washington\Elementary School District.\""I thought it wouldn't work if you didn't put gasoline in it,"" Devine\recalled with a laugh.\But the cars did well, despite lingering suspicions that blamed the new\fuel for all sorts of unrelated automotive maladies. A lack of places to\refuel continues to be an obstacle. But the number of stations is growing.\The state will open a public fueling station late this winter near the\Capitol. Electric charging stations are popping up at shopping malls, at\Texaco gas stations and at Monti's La Casa Vieja in Tempe - making the\restaurant a popular spot for EV-1 drivers.\""It's like a hummingbird feeder out there,"" said owner Michael Monti, who\drives his own EV-1. ""I go out there one day, and there's a red EV. The next\day, there's a green one.""\Cost also has been a barrier, which is why state policymakers have created\the incentives over the past five years.\But unraveling the stack of tax credits and deductions is far from simple.\Auto dealers can't or won't compute the potential savings of buying an\alt-fuel car. At Honda of Mesa, salesmen said they're waiting for the state to\give them a checklist that summarizes the savings.\In California, the approach is straightforward: The state buys down the\cost of the vehicles. That's why the EV-1 leases for $399 a month in\California, while in Arizona, it's $499.\But those tax incentives have frayed the nerves of GM reps, who say they\can't get Arizona officials to tell them how a potentially lucrative $10,000\tax break would apply to their EV-1s.\Ormond said the Legislature will have to unravel the problem. That means\that although the break took effect Jan. 1, it wouldn't be available until\late spring, at best.\EYE ON FUTURE\Some experts believe the fuel technology that will have the biggest effect is\not yet on the streets. The electric car, for example, is likely a bridge to\more popular and efficient forms of transportation, said Dick Thompson,\director of communications for GM's advanced-technology vehicles.\""It's transitional, leading to who knows what's next?"" he said.\Others see hydrogen as the long-term answer because it doesn't burn fossil\fuels and produces no emissions.\Although electric vehicles also have zero tailpipe emissions, many get\their juice from coal-fired electric plants.\And battery disposal is still a vexing problem because the batteries\contain lead.\The only hydrogen vehicles on the road in the Valley are created and owned\by hobbyists. But members of the Phoenix Rotary Club 100 are trying to\convince the international organization to adopt hydrogen as the group's next\worldwide initiative, since it wouldn't involve burning a fossil fuel.\And that makes sense to Devine.\""When they get the technology to store it in smaller spaces and have it in\vehicles,"" he said, ""it'll happen.""\Until then, Devine will continue his quest to join the first wave of\lower-polluting vehicles by finding a conversion kit for his car.\CAPTION: (1) THE BAIT\CAPTION: To entice individuals and businesses into buying alternatively fueled\CAPTION: vehicles, lawmakers have created incentives to help consumers recoup the extra\CAPTION: purchase price.

77,"Arizona Public Service Co. said Wednesday that it plans to make a small concession in its proposal to reduce rooftop solar subsidies that could make it easier for current solar customers eventually to sell their houses.\Through a program called net metering, customers get credit for the electricity they send to the grid when their houses are not drawing power. The utility asked regulators in July to reduce the credits it pays customers with rooftop solar, or simply to charge them more for the power they buy at night.\The proposal would add $50 to $100 to the average solar user's monthly electric bill. The proposal has sparked a backlash, including a protest by about 40 solar advocates outside the utility's headquarters in downtown Phoenix on Wednesday.\APS' proposal, which has yet to be reviewed by the Arizona Corporation Commission, would affect only new customers, including people buying existing homes with solar. But it would complicate any potential home sale for the 18,000 APS homeowners already in the net-metering program because new buyers wouldn't get the same deal.\APS officials said Wednesday they are changing that position. The utility will ask the Arizona Corporation Commission to consider allowing the net-metering contracts to remain for 20 years with the address, not the individual customer, said Barbara Lockwood, general manager of energy innovation for APS.\This would allow people with solar to sell their houses and pass along the benefits of net metering to the new owners.\""We've changed our position on that. Customers didn't think that was right,"" Lockwood said. ""You can credit that to the response from customers.""\She said the change is in line with the views of the Corporation Commission staff, which opposed the changes APS suggested but did agree on the need to alter net metering in some way. She said APS will file the proposed change with the commission before the November meeting at which regulators are expected to review net metering.\It's unclear whether the change will influence many of the protesters who lined up along Van Buren and Fifth streets Wednesday with signs reading ""APS is slimy"" and ""APS lied.""\Most of the protesters were retirees from Goodyear living in a neighborhood where nearly everyone has bought or leased solar panels.\Those customers, as well as a few representatives of the rooftop-installation industry, had a variety of complaints about APS, including the proposed changes in net metering and the recent confirmation from the utility that it has contributed money to at least two non-profits that have taken out television ads opposed to net metering.\In July, APS suggested the support from the non-profits was coincidental, but it recently told The Arizona Republic that the company sent money to two non-profits that support the utility's goal to make solar customers pay higher bills. The undisclosed amount of money has been used to purchase hundreds of thousands of dollars in television ads.\Solar customer Charles Miller said APS deceived customers.\""They paid for these ads, these groups,"" Miller said. ""It was really APS paying for it all along.""\Miller said the ads also cloud the truth. He disputed claims made in the ads that non-solar customers are being forced to foot the bill for those with solar panels. He pointed out that solar customers paid outright for systems or lease them and that they generate power and sell it back to the utility.\""How are we costing them money?"" he said.\APS spokesman Jim McDonald said in a statement Wednesday: ""We have said from the beginning that we would support groups that support our point of view on net metering. That is what we are doing. Our support for non-profits that share our views on the need to reform net metering has become a phony controversy fueled by opponents eager to distract attention from the substance of the issue.""\Other APS officials said that because solar customers pay such a small utility bill, they avoid paying for routine upkeep of the power grid, even though they rely on the grid at night and when their panels don't produce enough power for their appliances.\Solar advocates disagree, saying the rooftop arrays defer utility investments in new power plants and lines.\APS officials planned to meet Wednesday's protesters with bottled water, cookies and pamphlets explaining how much solar energy the company uses, which they set up on tables near the utility headquarters' entrance. But the protesters held their posters along the street corner and most did not make it down to the area where APS officials were awaiting them.\""Dear Net Metering Protester,"" began the letter APS officials were handing out. ""Our proposed changes would make solar energy sustainable for the long term, and restore fairness -- and it will not harm those customers who have already answered the call to 'go solar' on their rooftop.""\Miller said the Arizona Corporation Commission should look into the way APS helped pay for the ads.\""There should be a total investigation by the Arizona Corporation Commission,"" he said.\The commission, which regulates most utilities in the state, was the focus of a 2009 plan, obtained by The Republic, that had been pitched to APS by Lincoln Strategy Group, a high-profile consulting firm. The plan proposed funneling money through non-profits to influence debate on controversial issues and to alter the makeup of the commission.\Don Brandt, APS chief executive, said he immediately rejected the plan. Another APS official called it ""absurd.""\After the report was presented, however, APS hired one of the two Lincoln Strategy employees who pitched the report to Brandt. She now serves as the utility's top lobbyist. The other executive who pitched the report also left Lincoln Strategy and is being paid by APS as an outside consultant.\The Arizona chapter of the Sierra Club posted a message on its Facebook page Wednesday saying the 2009 plan is similar to an ""effort by APS to convince the (Corporation Commission) to dismantle"" Arizona's rooftop-solar program.\""As the cost of solar falls, rooftop systems have become more popular in Arizona,"" the Sierra Club said in its post, encouraging members to join the protest. ""This is good news for the health of our electric grid and a great thing for our environment. But it is considered a major threat by the monopoly utility to its bottom line.""\Retired ASU professor Ron Roedel of Phoenix, who attended the protest, said APS is hypocritical about solar power.\""They say they stand for solar, but they keep putting obstacles in the path of it,"" he said.\Roedel, who used to teach courses in solar energy, questioned the position APS takes on solar subsidies, saying APS insists the solar industry should operate without them. He said, however, every fossil-fuel industry needs subsidies.\""To say solar should stand on its own is a bit preposterous,"" he said.\One of the non-profit groups supported by APS, Prosper, began airing new commercials this week portraying a man who approaches an ice-cream truck and uses the toppings for free, forcing the ice-cream man to raise his prices for the children in line. The topping thief is an analogy for solar customers who use the power grid for free, according to the ad.\""I resent the ice-cream commercials,"" said Eileen Kane, a programmer from Chandler who joined the protest. ""They are ridiculous. They are trying to say people with residential solar on their rooftops are stealing from the grid. They are enhancing the grid.""\APS' McDonald responded by saying it was not the company's commercial, although it was produced with money that ultimately came from APS.\""We absolutely support the message,"" he said. ""This (net metering) is a fairness issue.""\Some of the protesters Wednesday said that even if they don't plan to sell their homes, they don't like the APS proposal because it will wipe out the financial incentive to use solar and prevent more people from installing rooftop panels.\""What if my son wants to use solar?"" protester Barbara Gunderson said. ""What if my grandson wants to use solar? I'll be long gone and dead, but I still want a clean environment."""
78,"The state's largest utility and companies that install solar panels are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in a high-stakes battle over how much customers should be paid for the power their panels produce.\As part of its strategy, Arizona Public Service Co. sent cash to two non-profit groups that support the utility's goal to make solar customers pay higher bills.\Solar-panel companies have been equally aggressive, characterizing the utility as trying to ""kill solar.""\APS' marketing campaign includes its own television ads explaining its commitment to solar. The cash sent to the two non-profits is helping to pay for ads and websites that use a more negative tone toward the solar industry.\For most of this year, APS and solar companies have battled over the utility's proposal to change the rules for net metering, a system where utilities give solar customers credit for the electricity they send to the power grid.\That credit offsets the cost of the electricity they buy from the utility at night. APS' proposed changes would add $50 to $100 to solar customers' monthly bills, the company said.\APS says solar customers get too much credit for their excess power, which they say means solar customers push too much of the costs of maintaining the power grid to non-solar customers.\Solar representatives say the rules change would devastate the industry.\The state's energy regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission, is expected to begin hearings on the net-metering proposal in November.\The rooftop solar industry has grown at a breakneck pace in recent years, but industry representatives say the solar expansion will stall out if new customers can't save any money by installing solar panels.\The campaigns have involved many of the state's biggest political consultants, pollsters and advertising firms.\Major solar companies months ago began a marketing campaign to fight the proposed changes, which they see as a threat to the residential rooftop-solar industry.\The changes APS proposes would erase the financial incentive for using solar, officials say. Campaigns by a solar industry-supported group said APS is attempting to ""tax the sun.""\APS recently acknowledged to The Arizona Republic that it provided money to a Washington, D.C.-based conservative organization called 60 Plus, which focuses on seniors' issues such as taxes, Social Security and Medicare.\It also gave money to another non-profit called Prosper, which was launched this year by Republican Kirk Adams, a former Arizona House speaker.\The non-profits have supported APS' position in websites, online videos and television advertisements.\John Hatfield, APS vice president of communications, said the utility is contributing money to the non-profits, and potentially other groups, through political consultant Sean Noble and his firm, DC London.\""We needed to respond to these ridiculous assertions that we do not support solar,"" Hatfield said, adding that APS does not agree with all political positions at 60 Plus and Prosper.\Early this year, APS initiated a series of meetings with solar companies and other interested parties to address net metering.\In March, California rooftop-installation companies SolarCity Corp. and Sunrun Inc., with other partners, formed TUSK, or ""Tell Utilities Solar won't be Killed.""\The group opposed changes to net metering even before APS formally submitted its proposed changes to the Corporation Commission, which approves rates and related policies for most of the state's utilities.\TUSK began an online campaign to criticize APS. At first, a TUSK spokesman did not identify the solar companies behind the effort, but later confirmed their involvement. The group uses an elephant symbol in an appeal to conservatives. All five Corporation Commission members are Republican.\The companies, particularly SolarCity, control a large portion of the rooftop-solar market in Arizona, and their business has grown rapidly thanks to utilities' incentives and their net-metering policies.\Industry fears\If solar customers didn't get credit for their excess electricity, few likely would use solar, officials said.\Most new solar customers are installing the panels with leases, and with their new lower power bill and lease payment, they save from $5 to $10 a month, said Lyndon Rive, founder and CEO of SolarCity. Any additional cost to solar customers greater than a few dollars would prevent most people from using solar, he and other industry experts said.\Rive said a proposal from the Corporation Commission staff that would add about $2 a month to solar customers' bills would be better than the $50 or more APS proposes, but the best option would be for regulators to wait and address the issue in two years when APS files its next rate case.\""A $2 fixed fee, if that were the action, the industry could survive,"" he said. ""It would be a hit, but the industry could survive and we could continue to grow the industry.""\Rive said he supports the tactics of TUSK, which have prompted thousands of letters and signatures in support of maintaining net metering to be filed at the commission.\""Our goal is to educate consumers that they do have a rightful alternative source of energy,"" he said.\Rooftop-solar companies also contend that solar customers are saving utilities the cost of new power plants and power lines, and if anything should be compensated more.\APS-supported campaigns\Shortly after TUSK launched, 60 Plus began criticizing SolarCity and Sunrun, comparing them with Solyndra, the California solar company that took more than $500 million in federal assistance and then filed for bankruptcy.\Soon after, Prosper joined the debate on the side of APS. Prosper has been running television commercials calling for changes to net metering.\Money sent to non-profits is difficult to track in a timely fashion, because the Internal Revenue Service only requires non-profits to file annual reports. That can make the identity of their financial supporters unknown for long periods.\This is the first time APS has acknowledged it is contributing to the groups.\In July, APS officials suggested it was coincidental that they were paying Noble and that 60 Plus and Prosper were siding with the utility on net metering.\Noble did not return calls from The Republic.\Adams said he formed Prosper to promote free-market principles. He would not acknowledge the group is getting money from APS, even though company officials confirmed contributing to the group.\Adams said Prosper has several donors, and that he did not form the group to work exclusively for APS. ""That is categorically false in every respect,"" he said. ""Our organization had its genesis last fall.""\He said Prosper has also been campaigning to prevent the expansion of Medicaid. He said Prosper has had limited contact with APS regarding net metering and that he chose to get involved in the issue independent of any donations.\""We think the net-metering issue is a wonderful example of subsidies for a specific industry that are decidedly not free market and hurt the general public,"" he said.\No ratepayer funds\Hatfield said APS is not using ratepayer funds to finance its political campaign. Instead, he said the utility is using profits that otherwise would go to stockholders. APS' parent company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., is publicly traded.\APS officials declined to say how much they are spending on 60 Plus and Prosper, but costs of the television advertisements tied to the net-metering issue run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.\""We are in a political battle,"" APS spokesman Jim McDonald said. ""We didn't ask for it. But we are not going to lie down and get our heads kicked in. We are just not. We are obligated to fight. It is irresponsible to our customers not to fight back.""\He said APS supports solar -- the utility is ahead of its state-mandated goals for renewable energy and recently opened Solana, one of the world's largest solar plants. But the company views net metering as unfair to non-solar customers. The ads are meant to highlight that and counter the inaccurate claims from TUSK that APS doesn't support solar at all, he said.\""What the 60 Plus stuff is doing is at least pointing out, gee, (TUSK) is supposed to be for conservative principles, but the biggest supporters (TUSK) has are the Democrats that supported Obama,"" McDonald said. ""I don't see any conservative principles at play here.""\Hatfield suggested that APS is using the tactics because of the nature of the solar fight.\""What has characterized our approach to the regulatory environment is working in a collaborative and constructive way (with regulators and opposition groups),"" Hatfield said. ""That was the approach we would have preferred to take on the net-metering issue.""\|\Reach the reporters at ryan.randazzo@arizonarepublic.com or robert.anglen@arizonarepublic.com."

82,"Solar-industry leaders began making an odd argument this fall amid the debate over net metering, the credit paid to rooftop solar customers for their excess power that gets sent to the grid.\Court Rich, the attorney for the Solar Energy Industries Association, and Jason Rose, the publicity man for major rooftop installers including SolarCity Corp. and Sunrun Inc., began to argue that rooftop solar panels are just like shade trees, compact-fluorescent lightbulbs and other energy-efficient appliances that reduce the amount of electricity people use.\They argued that because utilities support efficiency measures that help customers cut their energy use, they should also support rooftop solar and net metering. At the time, Arizona Public Service Co. was applying to charge higher bills to solar customers.\Despite a rebuke from Arizona Corporation Commissioner Bob Stump during the regulatory hearing on net metering, the solar advocates continue to suggest that renewable energy and energy efficiency are the same. The Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association was the most recent to suggest the comparison in a tweet Dec. 24.\Energy-efficiency experts said the comparison is unfair, as efficiency is far less expensive and far more accessible to the average person than rooftop solar.\""Most people recognize they are a different species,"" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit that promotes energy efficiency to benefit the economy, energy independence and the environment.\Nadel and ACEEE support solar and other renewable energy, but like most energy experts, they suggest customers take efficiency measures first.\The cost to save a kilowatt-hour of electricity through such efficiency averages about 3 cents nationwide, he said. The absolute best deals that have been made public for solar power plants is about 6 cents a kilowatt hour, though most involve a higher price and rooftop solar is more expensive than those projects that benefit from their scale.\Unlike solar, efficiency measures such as repairing attic ducts also work around the clock, not just when the sun is shining, which makes them more valuable to utilities and customers, he said.\""(Solar) reduces load at particular times of day when nobody is controlling it,"" he said. ""Energy efficiency can save you over many more hours of the day and even when the sun is not shining. You have more flexibility in terms of load control.""\Then there is the most obvious difference -- solar panels generate electricity, which must be exported to the distribution power lines if the home is not using it, while efficient appliances and shade trees don't use the power grid.\""Energy efficiency is required to be cost effective in current terms,"" said Jeff Schlegel, Arizona representative for the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. ""It lowers people's bills. It doesn't do so by adding to the grid (like solar), it does so by reducing pressure on the grid. ... It is really not the same thing.""\The energy that solar customers send to the grid is purchased by the utility for full retail price, which can be 15cents or more through the system of net metering.\""No one from energy efficiency is asking for a net-metering subsidy,"" Nadel said, adding that when several homes on one power line install solar, it can require additional infrastructure to handle the load, which is paid for by all utility customers. ""There is some cost,"" he said.\Although the efficiency advocates consider renewable-energy advocates their allies, Nadel said not all rooftop-solar companies are trustworthy.\""Our view is we should do efficiency first because it is the least expensive,"" he said. ""Many renewable advocates do agree with us, and they would prefer to sell a small (solar) system to serve a home with an efficient energy load. But some would prefer to sell a larger (solar) system to serve an inefficient load, and we don't agree with that."""
83,"Arizona Public Service Co. and the solar industry have published conflicting studies estimating the value of rooftop solar panels, foreshadowing a debate that will determine the future of the budding solar industry in Arizona.\The APS report says that people with rooftop solar are being overpaid for the excess electricity they generate, which is directed to the power grid when they are not using it. The solar-industry report said those customers are being underpaid and that their solar panels provide value to the utility by helping APS avoid expenses like new power plants.\The two sides are making their arguments as APS prepares to ask regulators in July for a reduction in its credits. The five Arizona Corporation Commissioners will decide whether to keep or alter the payments.\The utility, like many others, gives customers a one-to-one credit for each kilowatt-hour of electricity their solar panels generate that gets sent back to the power grid. The policy is called net metering because customers are billed for their net usage.\If their solar panels generate excess electricity in the daytime, their meters run backward. Then at sunset, when their panels stop making electricity and they are using electricity from APS, the meters run forward again, effectively spending the credits they accumulated during the day. No money actually exchanges hands unless a customer has excess credits at the end of the year.\Most customers with solar panels accumulate credit for the electricity they generate during the day, then they start to redeem those credits in the evening when they get home, turning on lights, air-conditioners and other appliances. The average price for electricity in those evening hours is higher than usual, 15.5cents per kilowatt hour, according to APS.\Those prices include everything from the cost to build power plants to maintaining power lines. The electricity the customers redeem with their credits is much more valuable than the electricity their panels provide, officials said.\APS estimates the electricity those customers generate from solar panels is really worth only 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour today, the cost APS avoids in power-plant fuel, according to a report APS commissioned.\""They get a credit today based on their rate structure that allows them to take more credit for their solar production than what the value really is,"" said Jim Wilde, APS director of resource planning.\But the panels do not help much, if at all, when it comes to staving off costs associated with the construction of power lines, power plants and other infrastructure, and thus is not worth the full retail value of electricity on the APS grid, Wilde said.\Wilde said the value of electricity from rooftop solar could be about 8cents per kilowatt-hour by 2025.\The Solar Energy Industries Association trade group in Washington, D.C., released its own study last week that puts the value of electricity from APS customers' rooftop solar much higher, at 22 to 24cents per kilowatt-hour, more than what APS is giving solar customers credit for.\That study says that for every $1 that APS spends on rooftop solar, it gets about $1.54 back in electricity, avoided infrastructure costs, reduced pollution and other benefits.\""Net metering isn't broken and we don't think it needs to be fixed or adjusted at this time,"" said Sara Birmingham, Western states director for the SEIA.\She said that APS does not give a fair value in its study to the costs that are avoided by using rooftop solar, and the study commissioned by her organization and conducted by Crossborder Energy provides a more comprehensive analysis.\""If you put in solar, the (electrical) load required for APS to serve is lessened,"" she said. ""It obviously is going to make an impact. They are not going to need to build a power plant as they were if there were not that solar out there. They are refusing to recognize that.""\APS commissioned a similar study in 2009 that pegged the value as high as 14cents per kilowatt-hour. The new report for APS was produced by SAIC Energy, Environment and Infrastructure LLC, which acquired the agency that conducted the 2009 APS study.\The two new studies are at odds because of the assumptions they make. In 2009, APS was expecting growth in Arizona.\But today, after a long recession and with excess electricity production, rooftop solar isn't worth as much because there is plenty of electricity to go around. And the benefits that rooftop solar brings in avoiding new power lines aren't the same because with slow economic growth, APS doesn't need to build many lines, Wilde said.\""In the 2009 study, we were just coming off of growth projections made in the heyday of Arizona,"" Wilde said, adding that APS bought additional energy then to meet demand today. ""That is why we have surplus reserves on our system today. Now we don't have any significant transmission additions in the time frame (the study) looks at.""\The solar industry is gearing up for a major fight over net metering once APS makes its application to change the policy. Without credit for the excess electricity, the costs of rooftop solar would be too high for most customers to justify because they would not realize any utility-bill savings.\APS also pays customers a rebate to offset the installation cost of solar, and that is declining and likely to be gone soon, thanks largely to the fact that solar prices have declined dramatically in the past few years and the subsidy no longer is needed.\The federal tax credit worth 30percent for solar panels expires in 2016 unless renewed, which means that net metering will be the last financial incentive for rooftop solar.\APS and other regulated utilities in Arizona must get 15percent of their electricity from renewable sources like solar by 2025, but without rooftop solar, most of that power will continue to come from out-of-state wind farms and other projects, said Sean Seitz, president of American Solar in Scottsdale.\He said that neither of the conflicting studies takes into account the value of having an in-state industry.\""The studies do not include the external values (of solar) outside the utility system, things like workforce, jobs, employment, tax revenue collected from installations, all of that,"" he said.\The rooftop sector is the strongest for the solar industry in Arizona. A survey last year by the Solar Foundation trade group found Arizona had the most workers per capita employed by the solar industry, with about 9,800 people working in solar, or one in every 306 workers. Most of those jobs were in the installation business, not manufacturing or project development.\Birmingham said the Arizona debate could set a precedent for other states looking at net metering."
84,"WASHINGTON - Arizona saw a 6 percent increase in solar jobs in 2016, bouncing back from a sharp drop the year before but still trailing well behind the national average growth of 25 percent in solar jobs.\Arizona's 7,310 solar-related jobs put it seventh-most among states last year, according to the Solar Foundation's 2016 National Solar Jobs Census, released Monday.\But experts said the nearly 400 new jobs in the state last year followed a drop of more than 2,000 in 2015, when a change in utility company charges to owners of solar-powered homes drove down demand for solar power installation.\""We used to be Number Two, right next to California.

A lot of utilities are pushing back on that rate.""\Gilliland said solar-industry growth has started to spread from its traditional base in California and the Southwest, as payment incentives such as net metering have been effective in other parts of the country.\He said states like Massachusetts and Vermont, not typically thought of as centers of solar jobs, are going strong because they have encouraged solar development and have policies that support the industry. Massachusetts' 14,000 solar jobs put it second to California, which dwarfed other states with 100,050 jobs last year.\Nationally, there were more than 260,000 solar workers in 2016, a near tripling of solar jobs in just six years.\""We're not just having a good year, we're having a lot of good years,"" said Andrea Luecke, president and executive director of the Solar Foundation. ""Seventy-eight percent of jobs are on the demand side, they have to do with people saying, 'I want solar,' and all those companies clamoring to make that happen.""\Luecke said growth is a direct result of falling solar costs for consumers."
85,"The rooftop-solar industry and lawmakers negotiated a cease-fire of sorts on Thursday, dropping their competing ballot efforts to change the state laws on solar subsidies.\They also agreed to work on a compromise between utilities and solar-leasing companies.\Solar-leasing companies were seeking to change the state Constitution to benefit their business model, and in response, lawmakers were seeking changes that would have harmed the solar companies.\Both efforts would have taken away the authority of the Arizona Corporation Commission to decide on such matters. The five elected commissioners regulate utility rates and policies such as rooftop solar.\""It would have been a pretty ugly dispute between the ballot measures over the summer,"" commission Chairman Doug Little said, adding he was relieved to hear of a deal.\Sen. Debbie Lesko, R-Peoria, called an early-evening news conference announcing the end of the looming solar war at the ballot. She read a joint statement that reflects the agreement hammered out in afternoon negotiations between lawmakers, backers of the citizen initiative and Gov. Doug Ducey's office.\""It's a good night for Arizona,"" she said.\She and Sen. Don Shooter, R-Yuma, agreed to withdraw their bills, which had received preliminary Senate approval just hours before. The bills were designed to counter the Arizona Solar Energy Freedom Act, whose supporters were circulating petitions to get on the November ballot.\At the same time, Arizona Solar Energy Freedom Act Chairwoman Kris Mayes signed paperwork that withdraws the initiative she filed two weeks ago.\Mayes said the agreement creates an opportunity for mediated settlement talks to preserve solar with buy-in from Arizona Public Service Co. and, hopefully, other energy companies. ""This can be a model for the rest of the country,"" she said. ""This is a big deal.""\Lesko was pushing a referendum that would have let voters decide if utilities should pay less than retail rates for the electricity they take from rooftop solar panels. Today, utilities credit customers retail rates for that energy in a system called net metering, allowing them to significantly reduce their monthly bills.\Her referendum was House Concurrent Resolution 2041.\Shooter's ballot referral, HCR 2039, proposed regulating solar-leasing companies as public utilities, which have rates approved by the Corporation Commission. That effort also will end.\Those two resolutions were a response to Mayes' ballot initiative, which had been funded by rooftop solar-leasing company SolarCity. It would have changed the state constitution to preserve net metering, guaranteeing rooftop solar customers continue to get retail-value credits for power they send to the grid.\Mayes said that campaign had gathered close to 40,000 signatures.\Several utilities including APS are before the Corporation Commission seeking to amend net metering to either pay less than retail credit or otherwise raise solar customers' bills. The utility praised the compromise.\""Senator Lesko's leadership, in partnership with the Governor's Office and legislative leadership, created the environment in which this could happen, because they were focused on doing the right thing for Arizona,"" said Jessica Pacheco, vice president of state and local affairs for APS.\Pacheco said dropping all three efforts makes it easier to reach a compromise. ""SolarCity and the public-service corporations will enter into a dialogue,"" Pacheco said.\Mayes said the parties have agreed to hire a mediator, and settlement talks could begin as soon as today.\Thursday's developments, negotiated by representatives of Ducey's office, ends the possibility of three conflicting solar decisions on the November ballot.\""The governor's office is convening a negotiation process between both sides in hopes of reaching an agreement that takes Arizona in a positive energy direction and ends the controversy of recent years,"" Ducey's office said in a statement.\The deal also keeps utility regulation with the Corporation Commission, for now.\""I'm encouraged by what I'm hearing, and I encourage all parties to work towards solutions that work for solar companies, utilities and the ratepayer,"" Commissioner Tom Forese said after the deal was announced.\APS will file for a rate increase with commission in June. The utility will seek to change the way solar customers pay for electricity, and before that case concludes, the regulators will have to decide on a similar case for UniSource Energy Services, which serves customers in Mohave and Santa Cruz counties.\Little said dropping the voter initiatives will make that job easier. ""I'm happy that we as a commission are going to be able to do the job we've been given the Constitutional responsibility to do, and that we will have all the tools available to us to do that job as effectively as we possibly can,"" he said."
86,"As a longtime Arizonan, I was proud to add my name to the list of people who support a pro-solar energy organization chaired by Barry Goldwater Jr. called TUSK (Tell Utilities Solar won't be Killed.)\As a longtime community activist, I am convinced that solar energy in Arizona is one of these issues where liberals and conservatives can reach across the aisle and agree that solar is good for the environment and good for the economy.\Unfortunately, Arizona Public Service wants to sunset private rooftop solar energy by ending net metering, which requires APS to pay fair market value for any excess solar energy a rooftop solar customer sends back to the grid.\As a small-business owner, this strikes me as unfair. Why should APS get a free ride? Why should a utility monopoly be allowed to effectively end a thriving solar energy industry in Arizona?\I have served this community on the Phoenix Planning Commission, on the Board of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, and as board chair of Local First Arizona. I understand the value of a thriving economy. And I don't like it when a regulated monopoly seeks to press its advantage by driving competing industries out of business.\I have fought for numerous causes in Phoenix because I believe in activism for the greater good. Solar energy is a cause worth fighting for. This is a resource that should be available to everyone, not just monopolies such as APS. If net metering goes away, so do energy options for Phoenicians and the rest of the state.\Whether you are Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, I think we can all agree that rooftop solar gives residents a choice as to how they get their electricity while at the same time reducing the use of fossil fuels. It's good for the environment and good for the economy. Solar is currently a $16.2-billion industry in Arizona, providing 9,800 jobs.\It's my hope that the Arizona Corporation Commission embraces this message. Not because the message is conservative or liberal, but because it's what's right for Arizona. I never thought I'd be saying this, but thank you, Mr. Goldwater, and your fellow conservatives who are standing up to APS and standing for energy choice.\APS ratepayers deserve fair treatment and a choice as to where to get electricity. Our fragile environment deserves cleaner energy options.\|\James Mapstead is a small-business owner. He has served as a member of the Phoenix Planning Commission.

88,"Rep. Mesnard is wrong. Arizonans do not want payday lenders' ""flex loans.""\In his Monday op-ed, Mesnard defended his bill to allow 204 percent debt-trap loans without ever mentioning the interest rate. On the House floor, he even admitted that he has not had a single constituent say, ""I need this bill.""\In 2008, Arizona voters affirmed our current 36 percent annual interest rate cap. Nearly every year since, payday lenders have tried to overturn the voters' will and our Legislature has correctly rejected these shenanigans.\This year, dozens of groups - AARP, Arizona Children's Action Alliance, faith-based organizations and many others - vehemently opposed SB 1316, a back-door payday loan re-entry disguise. After the House approved these toxic loans, 45 Arizona faith leaders called on the Senate to reject these usurious and immoral lending practices.\When SB 1316 came to the floor of the House, Republican and Democratic legislators acknowledged that questionable payday lenders' alleged petitions supporting these high-rate loans might have included names of people who actually do not want loans that will cost $10,000 to pay back $2,500.

90,"Some Valley school districts want to bring solar power to their schools.\Scottsdale, Agua Fria, Deer Valley and Mesa school districts are working with Rep. Michele Reagan and utility companies to add solar panels. Reagan, members of the school districts and representatives from Arizona Public Service met recently to discuss solar plans.\The districts are still working out details, but one plan has districts leasing school rooftops to commercial businesses to install and maintain panels. The school district would purchase power from the businesses.\Districts would benefit from a flat rate on electricity and businesses would receive money from utilities such as APS and Salt River Project for adding electricity to the power grid.\""We are depending on this to be financed through an independent provider that would install the panels, and we would pay for power at a guaranteed rate,"" said John Schmadeke, assistant superintendent of operations for Agua Fria Union High School District.\David Peterson, Scottsdale's assistant superintendent of operations, said the plan could serve as a model for all Arizona school districts.\""We're kind of setting the tone because there's a lot of other school districts in the state that want to get it done but they don't know how to do it,"" Peterson said.\Most districts don't have the money to purchase solar panels, which are expensive and do not produce returns for a few years, said Craig McKee, the director of contracting programs for the procurement company Mohave Educational Services Cooperative Inc. McKee has worked with the districts to prepare a standard plan.\School districts, as government entities, cannot take advantage of federal and state investment tax credits for installing solar panels, Schmadeke said.\But third-party businesses can lease school property to install and maintain solar panels. And with a recently approved Arizona Corporation Commission measure to allow net metering, businesses can take advantage of adding power to the grid.\Those that make more power than they consume will be paid for electricity they put into the grid.\Arizona State University approved a similar plan in June, which Mohave has looked to as a model.\""We talked about the concept a couple of different ways, but that's the way that seems to make the most sense,"" McKee said.\Scottsdale approved a request for a proposal to add panels to Desert Mountain and Coronado high schools at an Aug. 12 governing-board meeting, but plans were put on hold because the federal tax credits, set to expire on Dec. 31, had not been renewed.\Those alternative-energy credits were extended on Oct. 3 for eight years.\Scottsdale's request for a proposal permits the district to enter into a power-purchase agreement for up to 20 years.\Peterson said the district could approve a contract as early as January.\APS and SRP have curriculum materials, which could make the panels a teaching tool, Peterson said.\Reagan, chairwoman of the House Commerce Committee, said she would check with the Corporation Commission to see whether third-party companies would need regulation.\""That may be something that will have to be changed statutorily,"" she said.\Deer Valley Unified School District would start by adding panels to the rooftops of its five high schools, according to Jim Migliorino, executive director of fiscal services.\He said that solar panels benefit more than just the environment.\""It makes financial sense as well to be able to have a known cost for 20 years established for a utility that we will need in order to operate our facilities,"" Migliorino said."
91,"Lost in the headlines about the political warfare between California-based rooftop solar giants and our state's largest electric utilities is a less-chronicled struggle: Arizona-based rooftop solar companies striving to keep our homegrown businesses alive while securing Arizona's sustainable energy future.\Though our struggle may not be as sexy as a firefight involving political campaigns and hundreds of potentially juicy text messages, the challenges faced by local rooftop solar companies merit the attention of every Arizonan interested in cheaper, cleaner energy. Why? Because the companies who comprise the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance are laser-focused on ensuring that solar energy is an option for Arizona residents, today and tomorrow.\Arizonans have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into renewable energy over the past decade, establishing Arizona as a national leader in solar deployment. This investment created thousands of jobs as hundreds of solar companies grew to support demand.\In recent months, numerous Arizona utilities have taken steps to ride roughshod over our industry. These companies have implemented faux ""grandfathering"" deadlines, unjustified base service charge increases, punitive solar-specific rate plans and now seek exemption from net metering statutes that support customers' decision to go solar.\Our alliance members' vision eschews conflict in favor of driving new technologies and new ways of thinking about solar. We believe rooftop solar technology can benefit all ratepayers. That's why we have come to the table with the utilities to develop pragmatic solutions. For example, when APS requested a surcharge for solar customers in 2013, we worked with all parties to come up with a solution that allowed for continued market adoption of solar.\During SRP's recent pricing process, our alliance was the only industry group to present an alternative plan to SRP's Board of Directors, a plan that would have gradually transformed the residential market in SRP service territory. Unfortunately, our plan was rejected and residential solar in SRP service territory has slowed to a crawl.\We understand the environment we operate in is changing, but we also believe Arizona's solar future won't be created through meat-cleaver politics or the adoption of unilateral policies. We offer customers real choices and access to the best technologies. We believe in striking a balance that leads to a sustainable future where rooftop solar can flourish and forward-thinking utilities can adapt to a new day.\We live here. We do business here. We are determined to flourish here.\Utilities committed to Dark Ages thinking have Arizona's homegrown solar businesses teetering on the edge. These predatory organizations must reverse their tactics and come to the table for the benefit of all Arizonans. Anything less should be questioned by all who believe solar energy is an essential part of Arizona's future.\Sean Seitz is president of the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance.\my turn Sean Seitz"
92,"With all due respect to Florida, Arizona is the ""Sunshine State.""\And whether the economy is up or down, it can't kill our sun.\Sun brought us the magnificent real-estate sector which has largely sustained this economy. Although the sun still shines, folks can't afford to move here right now, so real estate is napping and home builders are idle. We need an economic bolt -- solar-generated power can be the new home builder.\If, during this downturn, we treat the solar industry as positively as we have treated the real-estate sector, solar will be the new economic engine for Arizona. Our economy has always been tied to our sunlight, so let's not reinvent the secret of our success.\Whether you like it for the ""right"" reasons (good for the environment, in sync with nature, etc.), or you accept it for the potentially ""wrong"" reasons (the best source of immediate economic development for our state -- money!), there is no doubt we must help this industry thrive in Arizona.\Despite some rumors you may have heard, national studies done by the solar industry name the state of Arizona as the No. 1 place for solar energy because of the quantity and quality of our sunlight.\You may say it's a fad and only those folks who drink raw milk and resist the temptation to buy leather shoes will go solar. Not true. Because of mandates, tax credits and stimulus money, solar will expand quickly. Whether you like government intervention or not, both the state and federal government have mandated that 15 percent and soon likely up to 25 percent of all energy sold by utilities be created from renewable sources (solar, wind, etc.).\It doesn't matter if you are conservative or liberal; figuring out how to put Arizonans to work is in everyone's best interests.\Many in our state get it and are making massive advances in promoting the industry. The Arizona Corporation Commission has just approved the first net metering plan which will give APS customers the ability to get a check or credit back if they produce more power from their solar panels than they use. In this economy, if a person can receive a check at the end of the year just because it was sunny outside, we are definitely going to be selling more solar systems.\Corporation commissioners are also reviewing arrangements in which a homeowner, business owner, government or school district can install solar panels with no up-front cost. And the Legislature appears to be approving bills making it easier for schools to save money on energy by installing solar panels, allowing credits for manufacturing and giving municipalities the ability to set up special districts to finance solar projects.\If every Arizonan could figure out some small way to support solar energy, just as we support our real-estate industry by buying homes, shopping at retailers, and leasing commercial space, our economy could roar back to a time when headlines were reporting that your house only appreciated in value by 4 percent and that was slightly depressing.\While we can't specifically predict when the real-estate market will reawaken, one thing is for certain: The sun will always shine. And it's tanning weather for the Arizona economy.\|\Jordan Rose is founder and managing partner of Rose Law Group in Scottsdale, Arizona."
93,"Bob Stump, Arizona Corporation Commission:\Assuming Salt River Project's new rate structure will ensure that all customers share the true cost of grid upkeep, SRP will be acting upon a fundamental ratemaking principle: Rates must be fair for everyone, solar adopters and non-solar adopters alike. In other words, cost of service must be fairly apportioned among different consumers.\As Harvard's Ashley Brown has noted, net metering can be a socially regressive subsidy. It is unfair to shift the costs of our state's electric system to lower-income Arizonans.\I suspect SRP will design a rate structure that fairly values new customer-cited technology, especially if the technology reduces the system impact of the peak hours of the day. And I am optimistic that SRP can strike the proper balance between recovering costs to avoid undue subsidies while also encouraging new technology that has long-term benefits for the grid.\Arizonans should reject the disingenuous, self-interested claims of those who care more about their short-term profits than the long-term viability of solar power in Arizona.\Indeed, this debate over serious ratemaking issues has been degraded by ill-informed rhetoric and misinformation about ""energy choice"" and ""independence,"" as if adopting rooftop solar can enable one to live off the grid, in a manner resembling Henry David Thoreau at Walden Pond.\Thoreau's mother prepared meals for him during his sojourn in the wilderness; he was never entirely self-sufficient. Neither are rooftop solar adopters. Without the utility, rooftop solar is not viable.\""Energy choice"" is desirable. Utility reliability is essential. Let us not confuse desirability with necessity, nor disregard the imperative to treat all ratepayers equitably.\SRP's hike could kill solar\Barry Goldwater Jr., chairman of TUSK (Tell Utilities Solar won't be Killed):\There will be no rooftop solar industry in SRP territory and we know it. Applications to install rooftop solar systems have slowed from a steady several hundred per month to an industry-killing pace of less than two dozen since SRP announced its tax hike.\The SRP tax proposal is more than 10 times the amount the Arizona Corporation Commission granted Arizona Public Service in 2013. SRP General Manager Mark Bonsall even said the solar killing plan is so complicated for customers to manage and understand that the board should not consider applying these same principles to any of its 900,000 other residential customers.\You ask ""what if?"" At a time Gov. Doug Ducey promotes Arizona as business friendly, our state's utilities are trying to drive out innovative industries that help support our energy security and economy.\Landing Apple and providing it the ability to install solar to save money is great, but shouldn't SRP provide that same opportunity to its customers? After all, the jobs that Apple will bring, while welcome, pale in comparison to the number of solar jobs to be lost if this plan is implemented.\Courtesy of SRP, Arizona may officially become the most anti-solar state in the country. One solar company already took Arizona off its list for a new headquarters and 1,000 jobs due to the hostile environment. Another is deploying $3 billion in capital across the country, but none in our state.\We already know what if, and only SRP's board can change the answer.\What if"
94,"Making excuses for pension 'spiking' is like making excuses for thievery\Pension ""spiking"" is nothing more than stealing from taxpayers.\Vacation and sick days have a purpose in allowing employees to recuperate from an illness and to recharge physical and mental health. If a worker does not feel the need to take advantage of these benefits, one would assume the workday must not be very taxing.\It is equally absurd to consider on-the-job benefits such as a cellphone or car allowance to be used in calculating income. City employees are not being punished by having such extravagant privileges being eliminated.\As far as the fear of being able to attract or retain top talent, there is an abundance of qualified workers in the Phoenix area.

Being a person with a family member who was murdered, I know of the incredible work prosecutors do to help ensure that those who commit murder will be held accountable.\As the U.S. Supreme Court has observed, prosecutors have a special responsibility in the justice system. They have the duty to be impartial; not to win a case, but to see that justice is done, and this is exactly what prosecutors do. They do not want to convict the innocent.\As Kiefer points out in his series, most prosecutorial missteps are found to be ""harmless"" by the courts.\Thus, shouldn't our focus be on the heroes who help to hold those murderers, whose actions were not simply ""harmless errors,"" accountable?\--Dan Levey, Phoenix\|\Supporting Peoria, not the GOP\It was so refreshing to read about Peoria Vice Mayor Tony Rivero attending the Washington, D.C., immigration rally.\It's almost become taboo for Republicans to get behind any kind of immigration reform, but Rivero is doing what's best for his city, not his party.\He knows how important it is to get illegal immigrants out of the shadows and participating in our society.\He also knows that business and agriculture need the labor and that comprehensive immigration reform is the best way to achieve that.

95,"Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs, and Trent Franks recently signed a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke asking that four national monument designations in Arizona be rescinded.\Rescinding Arizona's national monuments flies in the face of overwhelming public support, and betrays the voters these three congressmen claim to represent.\Arizona's spectacular natural and cultural treasures belong to all of us. National monuments are a vital source of rural economic growth and local jobs.

Why make your life difficult?""\Furthermore students will choose subjects because they ""know"" a teacher always gives A's and B's.\The system explains why over 40 percent of high school students do not get a degree in four years at college.\Education administrators and teachers should come up with a graduation system based on external examination results graded outside the school. This includes examinations such as the Advanced Placement, the International Baccalaureate and Cambridge Overseas.\That way parents, students and the public will find out how good the teachers are and how good the school is academically.\--Alan Austin, Phoenix\APS rate case imperils the promising rooftop solar industry\Ryan Randazzo's July 7 report on 10 key developments of the upcoming APS rate case casts a dark shadow over the future of residential solar users in Arizona -- a group that has been optimistic while its energy independence has been affronted.\Working as an intern for Environment Arizona, I have been able to follow this case closely. I can say that the removal of mandatory demand charging is a big victory for environmentalists, but also a big victory for all residential rate payers across the state.\Still, plans to remove net metering over a 10-year period, and possibly raising basic service charges, lend to the impression that APS is taking a profit-driven, anti-solar stance.\It is a shame that one of Arizona's fastest growing industries, which can provide thousands of new jobs, could likely be strangled by monopolistic big business.\--Russell Quandt, Tempe\Yet another solution for the successful reform of health care\U.S. Sen.

96,"lcopenha@tucsoncitizen.com\Curtis Berry doesn't much worry about soaring utility costs, even in the face of Tucson's triple digit temperatures.\The electric bill for his four-bedroom Catalina Foothills home runs $5.18 a month, and that's for an administration fee, Berry said last week as Tucson approached an all-time record for consecutive days of 100 degrees or more.\He keeps the interior of his home at 75 degrees at night, 77 during the day.\Although connected to Tucson Electric Power's utility grid, the 39-year-old pharmacist and his wife Gina get power from solar panels on their roof and side yard.\Last week, his meter was running backward.\""I installed the first panel after buying our home in November 2002,"" Berry explained. He and Gina just couldn't see doling out $250 a month for cooling which the former residents did to keep cool.\That was a one-kilowatt unit, but he has continued to add panels and now has solar generating capacity of 5.5 kilowatts. The cost of solar panels runs about $4,000 per kilowatt. For Berry, that adds up to $22,000.\He has no storage capacity, and sometimes uses energy from the grid. But more often, he's feeding it.\He'll have to occupy the home for several years to come out ahead financially. ""It's only beneficial if you are going to stay in your home for a long period, more than six years.\""But after I get to that point, I'm way ahead,"" he said.\He also installed high-efficiency, triple-pane windows, replacing old aluminum framed single-pane glass that did little to keep torrid temperatures from radiating into their home.\""It's expensive, but it's part of the package,"" he said of the new window installation. ""If you're serious about saving energy, this is necessary.""\Windows typically are liabilities for heating and cooling, noted Katharine Kent, an engineer and owner of The Solar Store. But expensive improvements need to be weighed carefully to determine if they are cost-effective.\The same is true of other alternative energy improvements, such as solar water heaters, solar pool heaters and solar-electric panels, she said.\""For instance, if you don't use a lot of hot water, there isn't much savings in buying a solar water heater,"" Kent said. Such a heater typically costs about $4,000, about the same as a solar pool heater.\She said the people benefitting financially from solar energy are young people who have many years to recoup their investment. She encourages people to check out data on solar energy on the American Solar Energy Association Web site, www.seia.org.\Berry said going solar is as much about protecting the environment and limiting the nation's dependence on foreign oil as saving money.\Regardless of his power generating capability, he still must be connected to TEP's grid.\The grid levels the solar panel output, allowing customers to run the meter backward when home demands are low and solar-panel production is high, and allows customers to use TEP power if solar generation is not adequate to meet requirements.\That's called net metering, Berry said. ""Any excess I generate goes into the grid and is credited to me. ... It's like money in the bank.""\Berry first used solar energy to heat his pool at his former residence. And that's a good thing since the rest of his family, including the couple's two children, had reservations about committing so much money to a solar project.\""The kids thought it was some kind of George Jetson thing,"" Berry said. But they soon came around to appreciate the solar setup.\Berry's neighbors also have accepted an array of solar panels in the upscale neighborhood, he said.\*\HOW TO SAVE ENERGY, MONEY\*\* Use ceiling or oscillating fans to help feel cool without increasing air-conditioner use.\* Dry laundry loads right after each other so the dryer doesn't have to reheat. Run dryer during cooler periods of the day in summer. Clean lint tray after each load.\* Turn the thermostat up in the summer, down in winter. The U.S. Department of Energy recommends 78 degrees in summer, 68 in the winter. Heating and cooling costs account for about 40 percent of yearly energy spending. Turn the thermostat up if leaving home for an extended period.\* Caulk around windows, doors and plumbing penetrations. An average home built before 1990 can let in as much outside air as a medium-sized window left open.\* No peeking. Every time you open the oven door while cooking, you lose 25 to 30 degrees. Use a timer or meat thermometer.\* Use fluorescent bulbs and save up to 75 percent on energy over standard bulbs.\* Shade west-facing windows and walls to reduce afternoon temperatures.\* Shorten showers. Cutting a 15-minute shower in half can save substantially on yearly hot-water costs.\* Use shades or blinds to reflect sunlight out of a home.\* Keep cooling and heating systems efficient by not blocking vents.\*\Source: Tucson Electric Power\*\GETTING ADVICE, DISCOUNTS\*\Tucson Electric Power offers three options for investing in solar power. Options 1 and 3 require supplying your own photovoltaic equipment. Option 2 requires purchasing solar equipment from TEP. All options may potentially qualify for state tax benefits of up to $1,000.\* Option 1: Incentives up to $2,000 for every kilowatt of proven solar electric generating capacity that is connected to TEP's grid.\* Option 2: Buydown credit up to $2,000 to the $6,000 purchase price of each 1 kilowatt company system for systems that qualify.\* Option 3: Buydown rebate based on installed solar generating capacity at $2,700 per kilowatt DC for 2005 and $2,400 per kilowatt DC for 2006.\* For more information, call 745-3100 or 1-866-253-3690, or e-mail to sunshare@tep.com."

The $7.5billion solar industry, 70percent of which domestically is in California, has been growing at a rate of 35 to 40percent annually, according to the report.\The key challenge for solar researchers is producing chemical fuels from sunlight in ""storable, dispatchable thermal energy ... new materials that withstand the high temperatures of solar thermal reactors are needed to drive applications of this technology,"" the report states.\That's where Neal Armstrong, a chemistry professor at the University of Arizona and solar-cell researcher, comes in.\On a recent afternoon, Armstrong was working on a generation of cells, eight of which are on a 1-inch diameter chip, which is expected to have application years down the road.\""I'm working on organizing solar cells in conjunction with inexpensive dyes and turning them into semiconductor materials that can be turned into energy conversion,"" he said.\Armstrong feels that government and private-sector incentives will continue well past 2015 because ""all the renewable energies are going to have to be in play because of the competition with India and China and the rest of the industrialized world for fossil fuels.""\""Arizona has a combination of free sunshine and growth,"" Armstrong said. ""And, just as soon as we have a machine where you can put sand in one end and pure silicon cells come out the other, that's when we'll know that solar energy has really arrived.""\CAPTION: Selling cells\CAPTION: The new home of Rusty Weaver includes solar panels on the roof.

100,"Democratic groups want to see more solar energy and other forms of renewable energy in Arizona, and they are spending big in this year's election to try to make it happen.\So far, outside groups have spent $6 million to help the three Democratic candidates running for seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission. Meanwhile, the Republican candidates have seen only about $100,000 in spending from outside groups to help boost their campaigns.\The Corporation Commission sets utility rates and policies in Arizona. It currently includes four Republicans and one Democrat, but with three seats on the ballot this year the majority could shift, and clean-energy supporters see opportunity.\The money for Democrats has come from two sources: $2 million pledged by the Chispa Arizona PAC, an environmental justice and Latino group affiliated with the League of Conservation Voters; and $4 million from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's political action committee, according to records from the Secretary of State's Office.\The outside money injected into the race can play a big role in getting the word out to voters, especially since each of the three Republicans and three Democrats are running on Clean Elections funding. That means the candidates themselves have had less than $300,000 to spend on the general election from the Citizens Clean Election Commission, plus what they collect in individual contributions.\Up until about 12 years ago, these races were sleepy affairs spending-wise. That changed when solar issues drew more interest — and money.\In 2013, a group called TUSK, or Tell Utilities Solar won't be Killed, was launched to preserve net metering, a system where utilities credit customers for the solar power generated on their roof that is sent to the grid.\TUSK supported two Republican candidates for the commission in 2014, drawing the attention of Arizona Public Service Co., the state's biggest utility. APS previously had declined to get involved with races for the commission because the eventual winners would oversee the utility as regulators.\But during that election cycle, a mysterious group calling itself ""Save Our Future Now"" emerged and mailed voters fliers that criticized one of those GOP candidates for previous troubles with the Small Business Administration and a failed congressional campaign.\While APS was broadly suspected to be behind that funding, it was another five years before the utility confirmed its parent company gave more than $10 million that year to groups involved in the election.\During the next election in 2016, APS openly supported commission candidates. APS spent more than $3 million supporting Republican candidates, while a rooftop solar company matched that spending for Democrats.\Earlier this year, the new CEO at APS told regulators the company no longer would fund election efforts for the commission.\An even bigger money player has now come to the side of Democrats.\Bloomberg, who dropped out of the presidential race after spending a record $558 million on his campaign, is helping the Democratic commission candidates with mailers, television, radio and digital advertising.\His group supports a 100% clean energy plan.\Most of the spending has supported the Democrats, though some has funded opposition material against the Republicans.\Advertisements that benefit, or oppose, more than one candidate can be double counted, which is why the total amount spent benefiting or opposing candidates can pencil out to more than what actually is spent by the groups.\Chispa previously announced it would spend $2 million on the commission races supporting Democrats, as it has in the past. Secretary of State records show Chispa has spent more than $4 million in total this cycle including contributions to Legislative candidates.\The Arizona Republican Party has criticized the contributions from Bloomberg and liberal groups in light of the past controversies over APS supporting commission candidates.\Here's how the spending is promoting, and attacking, candidates for the commission this year:\Democrat William ""Bill"" Mundell has benefited from nearly $3 million in independent expenditures to support him.\Mundell has not seen any opposition from independent groups, at least according to Secretary of State records.\Mundell previously served nine years on the commission and the state Legislature, as a Republican, and co-authored the renewable-energy standard that required utilities to get 15% of their power from renewable sources by 2025.\Democrat Anna Tovar is not far behind Mundell with about $2.7 million in support from the clean-energy groups, according to state records.\But Tovar has seen $25,000 spent against her by a group called Independent Voices Arizona. The ads criticize her spending as mayor of Tolleson.\Tovar is finishing her term as Tolleson mayor, and previously worked as a grade-school teacher in her hometown, and as a lawmaker.\The clean-energy groups have given less support to Democrat Shea Stanfield, spending $959,000 to her benefit, and she's seen no independent groups spend money opposing her yet, according to state filings.\Stanfield is a former Cave Creek Town Council member and retired teacher who taught various grades from kindergarten through high school in Scottsdale.\Republican Eric Sloan has seen $352,000 spent to oppose his efforts to win a seat on the commission. Not only is Chispa targeting him, but so is a group called Arizonans for Energy Independence.\That group, whose source of funding is unclear, has taken out ads that highlight a state report about Sloan when he worked at the Arizona Department of Gaming. Sloan was investigated along with another employee for creating a hostile work environment and was fired shortly after that report was filed.\Sloan has benefited from $65,000 in spending to promote his candidacy from the Arizona Free Enterprise Club and the Home Builders Association of Central Arizona, state records show.\A variety of issues at the commission have caught the attention of the Home Builders group over the years, including policies regarding how much developers must pay to connect to utility infrastructure.\More recently, they have been involved with the partial moratorium on new construction in the Johnson Utilities water and wastewater territory in the far East Valley. Regulators imposed the moratorium, against the wishes of developers, because the utility didn't have a sufficient water supply to meet the needs of its existing customers.\Free Enterprise Club has opposed increasing clean-energy requirements in the state.\Sloan lost a primary bid for the commission in 2018 and is running again. He runs Sloan Lyons public relations firm with his wife and previously held jobs at Arizona State University and the state Department of Gaming.\Chispa and Bloomberg's Beyond Carbon group have both contributed to the $144,000 spent in opposition to Republican Lea Márquez Peterson.\Márquez Peterson has seen about $50,000 in support from the Home Builders Association of Central Arizona.\Márquez Peterson, who Gov. Doug Ducey appointed to the commission in 2019, now must win election to keep her seat. She served as director of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce until 2018, and quit to run a public affairs firm.\Chispa and Beyond Carbon both have contributed to the $144,000 spent in opposition to Republican Jim O'Connor as well.\O'Connor has gotten about $16,000 in help from the Free Enterprise Club.\O'Connor succeeded in a rare write-in campaign to land a spot on the general election ballot. The political newcomer lost a primary in 2018 running for the commission and didn't plan to run again until the Republicans found themselves short of a full slate following signature challenges that kept other candidates off the ballot this year.\Reach reporter Ryan Randazzo at ryan.randazzo@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4331.

101,"Salt River Project customers will save about $72 each from November to May after the board of directors voted Tuesday to postpone the majority of a rate increase amid the bad economy.\Customers still could see a change in their bills in November, but it appears the company managers and directors will shuffle the numbers to keep bills essentially flat until spring.\Director William Arnett also told the managers to take a harder look at expenses and return in December with a smaller rate-hike proposal.\Arnett called Thursday for an alternative to the rate increase, with other directors joining him. They again followed his lead Tuesday when he called for the hike postponement.\Arnett began the Tuesday board meeting with a customary prayer, where he noted the ""important role (SRP directors) play in people's lives.""\He asked for ""wisdom and judgment"" so that the company might ""bring people water and power for the lowest reasonable cost.""\Managers originally proposed a rate hike that would have averaged 8.8 percent across all customer types, or about $12 a month on the average household. It consisted of three parts:\* An 11.4 percent increase in base rates, which now won't be considered until next year, and could now be lowered.\* A 2.1 percent increase in the ""system-benefits charge"" to fund renewable energy and efficiency projects, which the directors still could implement in November.\* A 4.7 percent rate decrease to reflect lower natural-gas prices, effective November, which the directors can change.\SRP management has addressed the weak economy by eliminating more than 230 positions, slashing the budget by $40 million and cutting or deferring hundreds of millions in spending.\Chief Financial Executive Mark Bonsall said SRP could balance the slight increase and fuel-surcharge decrease this fall with no net change in monthly bills.\He said SRP might find additional capital projects to defer or find other ways to make due without the full increase.\""The other way you handle it is to let your financial results slip,"" he said, adding that the company could take on more debt.\Consumer advocates fighting the increase said they will be interested to see what cuts SRP managers propose.\""It's encouraging that they'll take a harder look at their proposal,"" said Tim Hogan, executive director for the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest.\Diane E. Brown, executive director of the Arizona Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, said SRP should increase energy efficiency, which she said is less expensive than building new power plants.\The directors will discuss options for the system-benefit charge and fuel prices at a public meeting Sept. 10 and vote Oct. 1 on any changes."
