0,"""We feel like we're the guys in the Alamo and the reinforcements actually did arrive.""\Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass, said of the conservative,\mostly rural Oregonians arriving in Salem for the rally\In the early morning hours Thursday, hundreds of truckers from across Oregon formed a multi-city convoy and joined hundreds more outside the Capitol building to rally against a controversial carbon emissions cap-and-trade bill.\At least 2,000 people filled the Capitol steps and mall.\Truckers came from as far away as La Grande and Coos Bay and Medford — some beginning their treks just after midnight.\If passed, Senate Bill 1530 would impose a sweeping, economy-wide cap on carbon emissions and charge the state's largest polluters for emissions over the cap.\Democrats control the Oregon House, Senate and Governor's Office, leaving many Republicans feeling under siege. Republican lawmakers attending the rally expressed support and gratefulness for the protesters.\""We feel like we're the guys in the Alamo and the reinforcements actually did arrive,"" Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass, said of the conservative, mostly rural Oregonians arriving in Salem for the rally.\In the summer of 2019, a walkout by Senate Republicans and a protest by the group Timber Unity — the group also behind Thursday's rally — proceeded the death of last year's carbon cap-and-trade bill.\Those protesting Thursday said the 2020 bill would destroy their communities, livelihoods and careers. They urged lawmakers to put the issue before the voters instead of pushing it through the Legislature.\The Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources started taking public testimony on the bill at 3 p.m. The hearing room was packed with onlookers and overflow areas started getting crowded as well.\More than twice as many people signed up to testify against the bill as those who signed up in support.\During the rally, Jeff Leavy, one of the founders of Timber Unity, ripped up a copy of the proposed bill in front of the crowd. ""We are under fire, and they are coming for us,"" he said.\Another speaker led the crowd in a chant, demanding: ""Let us vote!""\Semi-trucks, tractors, logging trucks and farming equipment snaked around the Capitol building, slowing nearby traffic to a crawl. The hum of the engines and blasts from their horns punctuated the sound of country music and C.W. McCall's ""Convoy.""\Earlier in the day, the influx of trucks on Interstate 5 and routes leading to the Capitol and meet-up spots at the Oregon State Fairgrounds caused delays during rush hour.\A volunteer manning a registration booth estimated about 2,500 were in attendance by 10 a.m. Buses carrying participants who parked their trucks at nearby fairgrounds continued to stream in well into the morning.\Timber Unity officials estimated about 1,100 trucks joined the convoy and rally.\The rally had only been going for a few hours when tensions spilled over during a 9:30 a.m. meeting of the Senate Housing and Development Committee.\Sen. Dallas Heard, R-Roseburg, was preparing to testify on a bill he is sponsoring.\Committee chair Sen. Shemia Fagan, D-Portland, began the hearing by saying that the ""chaos"" at the Capitol — referring to the trucks and noise outside — prevented the committee from starting on time so witnesses would need to limit their testimony to three minutes.\Speaking to two women who'd come to testify, Fagan said, ""It's frustrating when people try to shut down the Capitol. It makes it where folks like you, that came to be heard, don't get to be heard all the time. So, on behalf of Oregon State Capitol, (I) apologize for the chaos this morning. So, with that, Senator Heard.""\""All right then,"" said committee member Sen. Denyc Boles, R-Salem, as she stormed out of the committee.\""Wow,"" Heard said. Right then, a particularly deep truck horn blared and Heard leaned back in his chair, allowing the sound to fill the room.\""Your three minutes are going; would you like to testify?"" Fagan asked.\Heard shook his head. ""Nope."" He collected his things and stood.\""There's no respect in this building. That does not apply to you or you,"" he said, pointing to the other remaining committee members, Sen. Rob Wagner, D-Lake Oswego, and Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland.\""I guess there are no proponents for the bill,"" Fagan said, proceeding to call up a panel of opponents.\Heard crossed the room to get the rest of his paperwork. ""I don't believe the First Amendment only applies to one party,"" he said.\""You are the government, Sen. Heard,"" Fagan replied as Heard left.\The bill, Senate Bill 1555, would ""authorize development of certain parsonages on lots or parcels with places of worship either existing or being developed.""\At the end of the short hearing, Fagan said it would be hard to consider moving the bill forward because no one had testified in support.\A convoy of trucks surrounded the Capitol building. Some sported the American flag, the State of Oregon flag or Trump 2020 banners.\A crowd of several hundred rallied on the steps of the building. Families pushed strollers, people walked dogs and volunteers in neon vests registered voters. Their conversations were frequently drowned out by the honking of horns.\Dozens of families joined the rally. Evelyn Wakimoto, of Beaverton, manned a booth passing out veggie straws, organic popcorn and applesauce.\""I'm here to show my daughter how important it is to stand up for your human rights,"" she said, pulling in her 4-year-old daughter for a hug.\She chatted with other parents, kids in tow, about how the proposed bill would make the price of everything from groceries to toilet paper go up.\The issue is personal for her. Her dad contracts with the postal service to deliver mail. Her great-grandfather was a trucker.\""It's in our blood,"" Wakimoto said.\She said the bill would cause her father's company to shut down. An issue with such a monumental impact should go to the voters, she said.\Those trekking in from Lebanon said they woke up at 4 a.m. to join the convoy.\Phyllis Kerby, of Dallas, said she was lucky enough to have the morning off. She stood talking in the cold at dawn with Keith Kennedy, of Lebanon. Both were concerned with how the bill would affect their ability to work.\""I wouldn't be able to do what I love anymore,"" Kerby said.\Some who didn't have the day off were given paid time off to attend the rally.\""They're big supporters of this,"" said Arlyn Dunn, of Lyons, of his employer, Freres Lumber Co.\He and his fellow drivers talked about the impact the proposed cap-and-trade legislation would have on their livelihoods.\The rising fuel costs and stricter equipment standards will take their toll on mom-and-pop businesses, families and working Oregonians, said John Lotze, of Stayton. They want the issue taken to voters.\""It would get voted right out the door,"" he said.\A similar truck protest organized last year by Timber Unity caused lengthy delays in the city and on area highways as loggers, truckers and farmers congregated in Salem to speak out against statewide caps on carbon emissions.\Angelita Sanchez, a Sweet Home trucking company owner and secretary of Timber Unity's board of directors, said this year's rally is more organized than last year's.\The 2019 protest also occurred during the busy season and was quickly organized.\In contrast, Timber Unity has been planning this rally for months, and it comes during a slow time for many farmers, loggers and construction workers.\""I really hope legislators are inspired by the sheer volume of people from across Oregon who are going to show up tomorrow to share their concerns about the cap-and-trade tax,"" said Todd Stoffel, Vice President, Timber Unity Association. ""They're coming off their farms, out of the forests, and driving from hundreds of miles away to put a face to the impact that lawmakers will have if they don't listen to those of us affected by the policy agendas of special interests.""\Maybe lawmakers will be inspired to set aside their concerns about their own reelection and ""do what's right for the people of Oregon,"" Stoffel added.\Timber Unity officials said they are against the cap-and-trade bill and what members see as abuse of the short legislative session by Democrats.\Those involved instead want to take the issue to voters.\A litany of lawmakers, including Rep. Bill Post, R-Keizer, Sen. Herman E. Baertschiger Jr., R-Grants Pass, and Sen. Kim Thatcher, R-Keizer, spoke at the rally.\During her speech, Thatcher announced she will run for Oregon Secretary of State, making her the first Republican in the race.\Timber Unity leaders presented several lawmakers with ""Courage and Conviction"" awards for speaking out against the cap-and-trade bill.\This year the legislation, SB1530, has been amended to, among other things, phase in carbon fees on transportation fuel on a geographic basis, starting in the Portland area. More amendments are expected.\But some Republicans still object and want the issue referred to voters. They threatened another walkout if the bill went forward any other way.\Opposition doesn't just come from Republicans. After being given the ""Courage and Conviction"" award, Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, spoke out against both iterations of the cap-and-trade bill.\""This was a bad bill last session,"" the Democrat said to a round of applause and cheers. ""It's a bad bill this session.""\Timber Unity leaders also met with Gov. Kate Brown Thursday morning during the rally.\That same day, Renew Oregon, an environment advocacy coalition, held a news conference in Portland featuring youth from across the state who declared a climate emergency.\Spokesman Brad Reed said the group's rural supporters in the timber and farming industries plan to speak at Thursday's public hearing on the bill.\A pro-climate action rally is also scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 11. at the Capitol. Reed said turnout is expected to surpass the 800 people who attended their rally last year.\Meanwhile, the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources will take additional public testimony on SB1530 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday.\All of the hearings will be held in Hearing Room C at the Capitol. Those wishing to testify can sign up beginning an hour before the start of each meeting. Testimony will be limited to two minutes per person.

1,"
Climate change, including its root causes and possible solutions, is an issue that is being hotly debated right now at universities, in the media and in the Legislature.
\
To date, the Springfield Utility Board intentionally has stepped away from the debate. As a consumer-owned utility, we respect our customers' diversity of opinions on the matter.
\
Instead, we are focused on making informed policy decisions that provide our customers with cost-effective energy and water solutions now and in the future. This includes being mindful of the impact to the environment, a goal that has been unchanged for decades.
\
But the rapidly changing regulatory environment has highlighted the need to focus on the next generation of energy sources. While looking to the future, we can learn from the past.
\
Springfield Utility Board and other consumer-owned utilities have a long history of investing in renewable energy. As customers of the Bonneville Power Administration and with BPA's power being from predominantly hydroelectric generation, consumer-owned utilities have resources that are more than 92 percent greenhouse-gas free. Compared to the nation, which on average has a power portfolio that is only 26 percent greenhouse-gas free, local utilities have led by example.
\
SUB has been a customer of BPA for more than 50 years. We have invested in energy and water conservation measures in the effort to reduce customers' bills while helping minimize the impact on the environment.
\
Turning to the regulatory environment, it is extremely dynamic right now - unusually so compared to the past. SUB and other utilities are constantly reviewing regulatory proposals at the state and federal level. It is not unusual for them to conflict.
\
SUB's participation in the process is intended to ground theoretical ideas to practical solutions. While our underlying goals remain unchanged, how we respond to particular regulatory proposals depends on how they mesh with other proposals.
\
Sometimes they fit. Often times they don't.
\
We also don't want to have unintended consequences. For example - let's look at carbon cap and trade.
\
Carbon cap and trade is a mechanism where carbon credits (or fossil fuel emissions credits) could be traded. On day one, utilities would be given a limited, fixed allocation of credits that they could use to apply to new or existing generation or, if they have excess credits, sell credits to other entities.
\
Sounds workable. However, an unbounded trading structure could result in speculators buying large amounts of these finite credits. By cornering the market, speculators could set the price - driving up the cost of credits and the cost of generation, and creating an artificial economic stranglehold.
\
Does SUB support the environment? Absolutely. Would we support a structure that would allow speculators to hold us hostage in the name of the environment? SUB believes that making the environment into a commodity would ultimately backfire, turning something precious into pork bellies. The environment shouldn't be associated with Enron (which manipulated the power markets in the recent past).
\
SUB continues to strive for thoughtful solutions.
\
Through cooperation with other utilities, we supported Oregon's Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires utilities meet certain benchmarks for their renewable energy supplies. We're engaged in the Western Climate Initiative, which could establish carbon cap and trade for Western states. We currently have utility policies that exceed state requirements related to promotion of renewables. Commercial, industrial and residential conservation remains strong.
\
We look forward to working with our customers and other utilities to build on our successes, and SUB greatly appreciates the strong support of our customers in protecting the environment.

2,"When California passed its landmark cap-and-trade law in 2006, supporters were hopeful that the program would provide the template for other states — and eventually the federal government — to solve the climate crisis.\Now, many environmental groups are increasingly saying the program has done little to curb climate change. Worse, they say, it is harming the lower-income areas and communities of color most affected by pollution.\Those environmental justice concerns stopped President-elect Joe Biden from picking Mary Nichols, who leads the California Air Resources Board — the agency that oversees the program — to head the Environmental Protection Agency. And other states, from Pennsylvania to Washington, are now rethinking how they might create similar programs.\""Ten years ago, cap-and-trade was the centerpiece of federal climate legislation and much of the environmental community was really backing it,"" said Michelle Chan, vice president of programs at Friends of the Earth, a national environmental nonprofit.\""Fast forward to today,"" she said, and ""the environmental community has learned a couple of big lessons, and cap-and-trade has become less of an attractive policy tool in the last decade.""\In Oregon, the attempts by Democrats to pass a statewide gas emissions cap-and-trade bill in the past two Legislative session has been contentious. Oregon Republicans staged a week-long walkout protest at the end of the session earlier this year, largely because of Senate Bill 1530.\The plan would make Oregon the second state in the nation with such a program.\After failing to increase their margins in the 2020 election, Oregon leaders say they're unlikely to revisit the issue next year.\Division among environmentalists\While environmental justice groups have led the outcry over cap-and-trade, other well-known organizations in the environmental movement are divided over the issue. The Sierra Club opposed the 2017 extension of California's cap-and-trade program, saying it would not do enough to limit pollution. A Sierra Club spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\Other groups, including the California League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund, called the bill a ""hard-fought compromise"" in a news release and said, ""the benefits in the package outweigh the concessions to industry.""\Cap-and-trade programs work by setting a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted each year. Over time, that limit is reduced. Businesses must then purchase credits allowing them to produce certain amounts of carbon. Companies that exceed those amounts may trade for credits with those that have extra. The state uses the money generated from those credit auctions to fund projects to further reduce emissions. Polluters also may purchase offsets, such as funding to protect forests, that can substitute for some emissions reductions.\Many California leaders still call the program a national model and an example of bold climate leadership. But earlier this month, more than 70 environmental groups wrote to Biden saying Nichols had ignored environmental injustices created by the program. That letter put cap-and-trade in the crosshairs.\""Under cap-and-trade, large polluters buy credits instead of reducing emissions,"" said Jim Walsh, an analyst with advocacy group Food and Water Watch, which was among the groups that signed the letter.\""Those large polluters tend to be located near low-income communities and communities of color,"" he said. ""We've seen emissions increase in (those) communities because of cap-and-trade programs.""\Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, considered those issues when he recently proposed a cap-and-trade program for the state's largest polluters, including fuel and natural gas suppliers, electricity generators and importers. While the structure of the program is similar to California's, some Washington leaders think it's more tailored to address environmental justice concerns.\One of the tweaks would allow regulators to halt the sale of carbon credits if the price falls too low, preventing companies from cheaply hoarding pollution allowances, said Lauren McCloy, Inslee's senior energy policy adviser. Another mechanism would allow the state to intervene if carbon pricing alone is not driving down pollution in certain communities.\""If [the Washington State Department of Ecology] sees an entity is not reducing emissions or is increasing emissions, particularly in a community that's been highly impacted by health disparities, they would be able to impose an entity-specific emissions cap,"" McCloy said.\While details have not yet been finalized, McCloy said the bill would likely allow companies to purchase carbon offsets in place of some emissions reductions. Every investment made from the program's revenue would need to go through an analysis of its impact on low-income communities and people of color.\But many remain unconvinced that even a well-structured cap-and-trade program can be equitable.\""At the end of the day, we just want to see the (emissions) reductions, we want our people to see the difference on the ground in their neighborhoods,"" said Jill Mangaliman, executive director of Got Green, a Seattle-based environmental justice group.\""[The state] has the power with regulatory action to go right to the heart of it instead of creating these loopholes,"" she said. ""Credits and offsets are not real reductions. They're a way for polluters to buy out of their responsibility.""\Focus on emission limits, some say\Many opponents of cap-and-trade would instead like to see strict emissions limits and strong enforcement, regulating carbon like other pollutants instead of creating elaborate markets to incentivize gradual reductions. They also call for cutting off fossil fuel development, which is contributing to global carbon emissions that the U.S. can't regulate.\""We've always been in favor of direct reductions and regulation,"" said Ingrid Brostrom, assistant director at the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment, a California-based environmental justice nonprofit. ""That is going to be the best solution for environmental justice communities.""\While California has been successful at reducing its emissions, critics say the state has been too friendly to polluters and that the bulk of the progress has come from a recession, strict auto pollution standards and a requirement that power providers produce more clean energy.\""California's cap-and-trade program is a cautionary tale,"" Brostrom said. ""The concept of trading pollution is always going to have a tendency to entrench pollution sources where they're at, and that's going to be in low-income communities and communities of color.""\'Pay to pollute' mentality\Even with a more aggressive cap-and-trade program, many critics think the credit-trading and offsets built into the policy create a ""pay-to-pollute"" incentive. A large oil company can buy extra carbon credits from others and invest in a forest conservation project in New York, rather than reducing toxic pollution at a refinery in a marginalized California community. While cap-and-trade has helped reduce emissions to some degree, the benefits have not been equally shared, and some who live near the state's worst polluters have seen their air quality worsen.\""We warned policymakers that the way cap-and-trade was being packaged is racist,"" said Chan, who signed the letter opposing Nichols' appointment.\""Policymakers at the time said climate change is too important for us to let the disproportionate impacts that will occur in black and brown communities hold us back.""\Three years ago, California lawmakers passed a 10-year extension to the cap-and-trade program. Assembly member Cristina Garcia, then the chair of the Natural Resources Committee, helped move the bill through her chamber, while state Sen. Bob Wieckowski, who led the Environmental Quality Committee, did the same in the Senate.\Both Democrats had proposed revisions to the program, but when those failed, they felt pressure to pass the bill, a major priority of then-Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat.\""If I had the courage, I wish I would have put the brakes on that bill,"" Wieckowski said. ""It hasn't done anything (to reduce emissions). If we're supposed to reduce our emissions 40% (by 2030) with the cap-and-trade program, we're not gonna get there. It's not magic.""\Wieckowski said regulators have set the price of carbon too low and allowed emitters to hoard credits, essentially ""banking"" future pollution. He also criticized the offset program, which includes forests that have since burned down in wildfires. While Wieckowski thinks a carbon tax may be a better approach, he would like to see stronger ""guardrails"" on cap-and-trade such as higher minimum prices at credit auctions and an elimination of offsets.\Garcia offered similar criticisms, saying it's far too easy for the worst polluters to pay their way out of meaningful change.\""We sold this to people with the co-benefit of clean air, but we haven't seen that co-benefit,"" said Garcia, who lives in Bell Gardens, southeast of Los Angeles.\""We're still polluting in communities like mine,"" she said. ""It lets people keep polluting and offset it somewhere else. That's just trickle-down environmentalism. We've given cap-and-trade a chance for a while now, and maybe we can't fix it. Maybe it's time to walk away and try something different.""\In a letter to Wieckowski earlier this year, California Secretary for Environmental Protection Jared Blumenfeld said he was working to reevaluate the extent to which the state's climate strategy should rely on cap-and-trade, as well as considering changes to the program to address emissions projections.\Program leader: Criticisms unfair\Rajinder Sahota, who oversees California's cap-and-trade program as an assistant division chief with the Air Resources Board, said many of the criticisms of the program are unfair.\She said cap-and-trade has played a key role in driving down power sector emissions.\When California utilities need to purchase out-of-state power, the price on carbon makes it cheaper to buy renewable electricity, she said.\The program also has ""constrained emissions"" from growing further and will reduce allowances and offsets over the coming years, according to Sahota.\""The program is doubling in stringency over the next decade,"" she said. ""It looks nothing like it will look like over the next decade.""\Meanwhile, Sahota said, toxic pollutants, unlike greenhouse gases, have until recently been under the jurisdiction of local air districts. The state agency gained authority to regulate those pollutants in 2017, and it's still evaluating where the worst impacts are being felt.\The greenhouse gas regulations in cap-and-trade should not be tied in with air quality issues, Sahota said.\""There is no definitive correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and (hazardous pollutants) in a facility,"" she said. ""To say that reducing one automatically reduces the other is not reality.""\California has also sought to invest much of the revenue brought in from cap-and-trade into communities most affected by environmental issues, Sahota said.\Other programs\Other leaders also still see a role for cap-and-trade. A coalition of Northeast states is using a cap-and-trade plan to regulate power plant emissions, a program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI. Proponents say RGGI states have nearly halved their power sector emissions in a decade while generating billions in economic activity from the carbon payments.\But it's unclear if RGGI played a significant role in reducing emissions, as the replacement of coal plants with natural gas—a transition that has happened nationwide—seems to have driven much of the shift. Many of the states in the coalition are looking at a separate cap-and-trade program for transportation emissions, which would target fuel suppliers. Earlier this week, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia were the first to commit to the transportation sector cap-and-trade plan.\Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is seeking to join the RGGI coalition and has directed the state to participate in the transportation program as well. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) noted that cap-and-trade will not solve the climate crisis on its own, touting its enforcement of other air pollution regulations.\""Cap-and-trade programs have shown that they do play a useful and cost-effective role in reducing carbon and other types of pollution,"" said Jamar Thrasher, an agency spokesperson, in an email to Stateline. ""DEP is keenly conscious of the need to prioritize communities near those pollution sources.""\New Mexico's Climate Change Task Force, a group appointed by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, is currently evaluating market-based climate programs, such as cap-and-trade.\Maddy Hayden, a public information officer with the New Mexico Environment Department, said cap-and-trade can be effective at reducing pollution and boosting health outcomes. New Mexico is interested in working with other states or existing programs, she added."

Firms could sell cleanup credits to those needing more time to cut emissions
\
SALEM - A day after President Bush pushed renewable energy into living rooms across the country, the topic took center stage Wednesday in the Oregon Capitol.
\
But Gov. Ted Kulongoski and lawmakers made clear that their push for renewable sources of electricity and motor vehicle fuel derived from crops was under way long before the president took up the issue Tuesday in his State of the Union speech.
\
Kulongoski convened a roundtable of working groups he appointed months ago to recommend ways to reduce greenhouse pollution to fight global warming and to wean Oregonians off foreign oil.
\
Citing a newly released report from one of his clean-energy work groups, Kulongoski said he would expand his agenda by establishing a ""cap and trade"" system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The governor said he would pursue an in-state version and work with other Western states to create a regional version.
\
Such a system would allow companies that clean up their carbon emissions to earn credits and sell them to businesses that need more time to curb their emissions of gases that contribute to global warming.
\
That same day, the state House Environment and Energy Committee kicked off a series of hearings on a bill with incentives and requirements meant to create a stable market for biofuels and encourage their production in the state.
\
That proposal, House Bill 2210, is one of several being jointly pursued by Kulongoski and lawmakers.
\
Kulongoski acknowledged that Oregon won't be the first state to aggressively pursue the development of renewable energy resources.
\
However, Oregon is better positioned than most states to achieve its goals ""because all of the ingredients lie within our boundaries,"" he said, referring to Oregon's geographic, geologic and climatic abilities to generate geothermal energy, harness the ocean's waves, and reap electricity from wind and fuel from crops that can be added to gasoline and diesel fuels.
\
Rep. Jackie Dingfelder, the Portland Democrat who heads the committee considering the bill, told panel and audience members that many of the elements should be familiar, since they were taken from a near-identical proposal she backed in 2005, but which failed to win passage in the session's final days. The bill would:
\
Expand tax incentives for producers of biofuel and its raw materials.
\
Create an income-tax incentive for consumers' use of biofuel, available over four years.
\
Set fuel standards for biodiesel and ethanol based on in-state production.
\
Ban the sale of gasoline containing certain additives found to degrade water or air quality.
\
Set the same standard for the use of biodiesel to fuel state- owned vehicles already in place for ethanol.
\
Allow on-farm biofuel production facilities on rural land zoned for exclusive farm use.
\
At this first hearing, only invited speakers testified. Thomas Endicott, managing partner of SeQuential Biofuels, said his company relies on used vegetable oil from restaurants and food processors.
\
But with competition growing for this limited resource, it made sense to create tax incentives and market certainties for Oregon farmers to grow crops such as canola seed for oil that can be used in biodiesel, said Endicott, who helped found the company in Eugene. It now has stations up and down Oregon's Interstate 5 corridor.
\
Kulongoski supports the biofuels push. He also is promoting bills that would:
\
Set a ""renewable portfolio standard"" for Oregon's electric utilities to derive 25 percent of their power from renewable resources - biomass, wind, wave, geothermal and hydrodams that meet certain environmental standards - by 2025.
\
Expand tax credits for companies that meet clean energy standards in manufacturing and production.
\
Make it easier for people to qualify for the residential energy tax credit. Examples include allowing the credit for more than one project - such as buying a solar electric system and an energy- efficient appliance - in the same year.

4,"The Oregon Legislature kicked off its 2020 session Monday where the 2019 session ended: stuck on cap-and-trade.\In the House, Republicans made floor speeches decrying Senate Bill 1530, the greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill, insisting that additional debate would be fruitless and the bill should be referred to voters.\""Cap-and-trade, I must tell you, is just simply not going to work for rural Oregon,"" said Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass. ""And the fact that it isn't going to work is going to lead to no compromise on that bill whatsoever.""\Democrats contend significant changes have been made to the proposal compared to last year's House Bill 2020, which died after losing support from Senate Democrats amid a nine-day Senate Republican walkout.\Additionally, facing a slate of more than 250 bills and a maximum of 35 days to consider them in, Republicans raised concerns that Democrats are attempting to push through a bloated agenda.\Democrats maintained that priority bills are emergencies for the communities being impacted, as are the budget tweaks and one-time funding requests commonplace in the short session.\Proposed bills would: bolster wildfire resilience, address ocean acidification, ban flavored vaping products, require gun storage, increase access to mental health care services, improve accountability in the child welfare systems and end coyote-killing contests.\As far as cap-and-trade, Democrats are determined any climate change bill include that system because it is the only one that would allow the state to meet its carbon emissions reduction goals.\Republicans are against cap-and-trade as a framework and the threat of a walkout remains on the table.\""They also are not offering a different alternative to reach our emissions reduction goals,"" said House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland. ""So, absent that, I think we have to move the bill, I think we have to pass the bill because of the urgency of the issue.""\Substantive amendments to SB 1530 are expected to be released late Monday or early Tuesday. As word of these amendments trickled through the Capitol, Republicans continued to bash the legislative process that's led to the current iteration.\The Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the bill Tuesday at 3 p.m.\""Isn't that interesting? A bill that they said they've been working on for 10 years and we get one day (to read it),"" said Sen. Alan Olsen, R-Canby.\Additional public hearings will be held Thursday and Saturday. Opponents of the bill with Timber Unity are planning a rally at the Capitol on Thursday after a multi-city truck convoy.\Both sides also spent Monday asking the other to seek bipartisanship.\""In the days and weeks ahead, I hope that we have spirited debates, I hope we search from common ground and where our policy views diverge, I hope that we always assume best intentions from each other,"" House Democratic Leader Barbara Smith Warner, D-Portland, said on the House floor.\""The best policies are always bipartisan and inclusive with input from all of our constituents,"" said Rep. Jack Zika, R-Redmond. ""When one side dominates and has no reverence for compromise or even open to other viewpoints, the policy that is formed is flawed and biased.""\Meanwhile, Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, returned to his chamber to bipartisan applause and used a recent health scare to encourage senators to work together.\""There will be moments when some of us have to endure pain and suffering, (but I hope) that somehow we will see each other as human beings in this human struggle, for without each other we will collapse,"" he said.

Four months after the U.S. House of Representatives approved a landmark climate bill, Senate Democrats have finally introduced legislation that would even more aggressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the bill leaves key questions unanswered, and it faces fierce Republican opposition and a crowded legislative calendar that threaten to delay action until next year.
\
Lawmakers should not allow the current session to end without passing strong climate legislation. The bill should involve the entire U.S. economy in reducing greenhouse emissions, while both requiring and promoting technological innovation.
\
The White House and Senate leadership have signaled that the climate bill must wait until the health care debate is resolved, and that is understandable. But failure to approve climate legislation this session would cost this country precious time in the race against global warming and would cause U.S. businesses to fall further behind in the global competition to develop clean energy technologies. It would also preclude a U.S. leadership role in global negotiations this December in Copenhagen to replace the expiring Kyoto agreement on climate change.
\
The bill, authored by Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and John Kerry, D-Mass., would reduce the nation's greenhouse emissions 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 - more aggressive than the 17 percent limit in the House bill. It employs the same cap and trade strategy as the House-passed bill, and it would cover approximately 7,500 coal-fired plants, oil refineries and other facilities across the country.
\
There is much to like about the Kerry-Boxer bill, most notably its emission-reduction goals, which are more ambitious than the House-passed bill. But the legislation leaves too many core issues to be resolved in committees. As the health care debate has graphically illustrated, that's a recipe for compromise and capitulation. For example, the bill does not specify how the cap and trade system would distribute carbon allowances to polluting industries or which industries, if any, would receive free allowances. Nor does it specify how much federal support would be provided to the nuclear industry.
\
The bill also attempts to ""rebrand"" the climate debate by dropping references to ""cap and trade,"" which Republican critics deride as ""cap and tax."" Instead, Kerry and Boxer call the greenhouse gas trading system a ""Pollution Reduction and Investment"" program - a transparent ploy that should work about as well as Kerry's ""reporting for duty"" line worked in his 2004 presidential bid. They would be better off calling a ""cap and trade"" system a ""cap and trade"" system and defending it on its substantial merits. Doing otherwise plays into the hands of conservative critics who will quite happily pounce on a hamfisted rebranding effort rather than engage in a substantive debate over climate policy.
\
The bill's backers, which include Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, face an uphill fight. A mandatory cap on emissions has as much support among Republicans as the public option does in health care reform - in other words, none. Turf battles reportedly loom between the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is chaired by Boxer, and the Finance Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Max Baucus. Democrats from states that produce and consume large amounts of coal and have industries that use large amounts of power will demand concessions that could severely weaken the bill. Meanwhile, Republicans will focus on eliminating any mandatory cap on emissions.
\
If the Kerry-Boxer bill is to have any hope of passage, it will require an all-out lobbying effort from President Obama, who has made clear he intends to focus on health care until Congress passes a reform bill.
\
If, and when, that happens, Obama should be prepared to shift gears and make certain that Congress passes legislation that mitigates climate change by putting a price on carbon and that protects the climate future of young Americans.

6,"Environmental advocates and legislators rallied outside the Capitol Tuesday as their mood darkened after Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, declared House Bill 2020 dead.\Last week, Republican senators fled the state to avoid voting on the bill that would have placed economy-wide caps on greenhouse gas emissions, stalling the Senate for six days.\Republicans said the bill would drive business out of state and make gas and other fuels unaffordable. They said the measure should at least be sent to voters for their approval.\Then this morning, Courtney said that even if the missing Republican senators came back, there wouldn't be enough Democratic votes to pass the bill.\Advocates outside the Capitol refuted Courtney's statement and chanted for the legislators to come back and vote on the cap-and-trade bill.\""If Senator Courtney says there's not enough votes to pass the bill, then put it on the floor and prove it,"" said Paige Spence of the Oregon League of Conservation Voters, to cheers from the crowd.\But, in a statement read at the rally, House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, said she believes Courtney that the bill couldn't pass. But she urged activists to keep pushing for action to combat climate change.\Several Democratic legislators vowed to bring the bill back next year.\""""It is a very discouraging day. I have to beg you to keep going,"" Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Rogue Valley, told the crowd.\Though the bill has already been in the works for 10 years, Gov. Kate Brown spoke about continuing persistence and patience in passing climate legislation.\The legislation's goal was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.\Supporters said the bill would have created new jobs in clean energy and position Oregon for future federal action.\Brown also echoed the crowd in decrying the senators who fled. ""The Republicans are not standing against climate change, they're standing against democracy,"" Brown said.\Outraged constituents expressed disappointment in their elected officials.\""We're here to demand that the senators who are in hiding support the communities that voted them in,"" said Sandra Hernandez, who said she was at the rally representing youth and Latinos.\Especially vocal were several constituents of Sen. Brian Boquist, R-Dallas.\Last week, Boquist threatened to resist state police if they tried to bring him back to the Capital.\""Senator Brian Boquist is my representative,"" said Allyson Miller, a former farmer and logger. ""Nobody cuts and runs and represents me. Get back here and do your job.""\HB 2020 already passed through the House of Representatives, and Democrats from both the House and Senate applauded House Republicans for sticking around to vote on the bill, even if they voted against it.\""They at least abided by our laws, allowing democracy to work,"" said Rep. Alissa Keny-Guyer, D-Portland, at the rally.\Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-Lake Oswego, said Republicans played a huge role in shaping the bill. ""We took their comments and discussion and came up with 116 amendments. We are done,"" she said Salinas.\""We are not going to let the Senate hijack something we've been working on for ten years,"" Salinas said. ""We are not stopping here today.""\Tracy Loew of the Statesman Journal contributed to this report.\Reach Samantha Hawkins at shawkins@gannett.com or 503-798-1623\CREDIT: Samantha Hawkins"
7,"Statesman Journal\Even with a Democratic majority and support from the governor, environmental legislation this session couldn't contend with the state's economic woes.\A carbon cap-and-trade bill, Senate Bill 80, the core of the governor's climate-change legislation, has been amended so many times that the original backers are urging legislators to abandon it.\Most of the rest of the climate change and clean energy bills died in committee.\""There were really high hopes"" at the beginning of the session, said Jake Weigler, the campaign director for the Healthy Climate Partnership. ""The governor made climate one of his chief priorities, and this session was going to be the culmination of his work over the last eight years.""\Now instead of pushing a renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction agenda, environmentalists find themselves fighting threats to those initiatives or laws passed in 2007.\House Bill 2940 would weaken the 2007 renewable energy standard, House Bill 2472 would constrain the business energy tax credit that helps to attract green companies to Oregon, and House Bill 3039 would allow more carbon-intensive power under the renewable energy standard.\Climate and clean energy bills weren't the only ones struggling this session.\Producer responsibility, a big hit in 2007 with the e-waste law, only garnered enough support to move one of the six bills out of committee. House Bill 3037 requires paint manufacturers to create recycling programs. Other bills dealing with prescription drugs, fluorescent light bulbs, rechargeable batteries and a framework to propose additional products died in committee.\But it's not finished.\""I think in some form or fashion we'll keep trying to work on product stewardship issues,"" said Palmer Mason, a Department of Environmental Quality legislative analyst.\Two bills designed to reduce potentially harmful chemicals in children's products also died in committee. House Bill 2367 would have banned bisphenol A from children's products and six phthalates while the companion bill, House Bill 2792, would have given the state the authority to regulate chemicals in children's products.\Environmental groups also lost ground on the transportation bill, they said, with most of the funding going toward highway improvements instead of investments in mass transportation.\There are still a few bills in place that the environmental community is hoping to salvage -- an emergency fund for invasive species, a low-carbon fuel standard, energy efficiency for buildings and ground-breaking water management strategies.\""We are eager for the Legislature to pull a rabbit out of its hat and leave a legacy we are proud of,"" said Evan Manvel, the legislative affairs director for the Oregon League of Conservation Voters and the Oregon Conservation Network.\Water conservationists have high hopes for two bills aimed at protecting water flows in Oregon's rivers, streams and ground water in the face of growing demands. House Bill 3369 would create a water management master plan and offer money for water storage projects as long as they included certain water conservation practices. Senate bills 788 and 740 would increase fees to help the state pay for as much as 50 percent of the cost to manage water resources so it's not as dependent on highs and lows of the general fund.\""The absence of money has made this session very frustrating for all interests,"" said John DeVoe with WaterWatch of Oregon.\Expansion of the bottle bill is another major legacy environmentalists hoped to build on this session. House Bill 2184 would have added sport drinks, juice and similar noncarbonated drinks. After two attempts to take a vote on the House floor, the proposed bottle bill was sent to the House revenue committee where it remains. Bills aimed at banning field burning and increasing local foods in schools also are waiting in the house revenue committee.\That's not to say that no environmental legislation will make it into law this year.\The pesticide-use reporting program was expanded to offer more precise data; all diesel school buses in Oregon will be retrofitted by 2017 to reduce cancer-causing pollution; and those who break environmental laws will face stiffer penalties. Infrastructure to establish marine reserves also likely will pass.\""These are challenging time for the state, Oregonians and the Legislature,"" said Rep. Ben Cannon, D-Portland, who has championed environmental bills. ""We are in a budget crisis, and that constrains what we are able to do on the environment. Given that context, we've done a pretty decent job at moving forward environmental legislation. While not meeting every objective, we still managed to move the state forward in environmental policy.""\Cannon also is not willing to take a final stand on this session's environmental legacy. He has high hopes for garnering votes for the bottle bill and low-carbon fuel standard.\""I think the jury is still out,"" he said about the session. ""We have a number of significant bills still in play.""\The bright spot for environmental legislation has been invasive species. Two bills have already been signed by the governor and a conservation community priority -- increasing penalties for intentionally introducing potential invasive fish -- is at the governor's office.\And yet, conservationists are fighting hard for House Bill 2020 that would set up a $5 million emergency fund, using lottery dollars, for dealing with invasive species threats.\""What would it look like if that did not pass? It's really ugly. It's not like the state is not going to have to pay. If we get zebra and quagga mussels, we have two choices: have the infrastructure in place or call up the e-board and scrape up money we don't have. ... But the bottom line is that it's not like the state is not going to have to respond.""\Even with all of the reasons to pass House Bill 2020, it looks like environmentalists may have to settle for an emergency fund without funds or with minimal funds.\""The lottery is too oversubscribed as it is,"" said Sen.

Note: GOP incumbent has experience, proven leadership
\
The Oregon Legislature will need every ounce of experienced, capable and creative leadership it can muster to deal with a budget shortfall that could easily top $1 billion in the 2009 session. House District 7 voters can help meet that need by re-electing Republican Bruce Hanna.
\
The 48-year-old Roseburg soft drink distributor was appointed to the Oregon House in March 2004 when incumbent Rep. Jeff Kruse decided to run for the Senate. As House minority leader, he is hard at work these days trying to get Republicans elected across the state, while keeping an eye on his own race against Democrat Don Nordin.
\
Hanna, a moderate Republican, is a comfortable fit for this rural district, which takes in all of northern and eastern Douglas County, as well as much of southern and eastern Lane County.
\
While a fiscal conservative, he recognizes the need to improve health care and adequately fund the state's educational system, from kindergarten to higher education. He wants to boost the state's economy by increasing timber production in state and federal forests, and by giving cities and counties increased say over land use - all positions that resonate with District 7 voters.
\
He believes the best way to help Oregon emerge from its economic slump is to cut government spending. As a member of the budget-writing Ways and Means Committee, he is well positioned to monitor spending and propose efficiencies. He proposes creation of a legislative audits office - a move he should reconsider because it would duplicate unnecessarily the auditing function of the secretary of state's office.
\
Hanna wants to provide tax relief to low-income Oregonians by doubling the lowest tax brackets. That's a worthy goal, but it could prove difficult to achieve in the current budget squeeze. The same is true of his goal to lower and eventually phase out the capital gains tax.
\
Hanna wants to expand health care for children of low-income families by providing increased access through the Oregon Health Plan to community- and school-based health clinics and federally funded health centers. He wants to find a dedicated revenue source for public safety, although he wisely opposes Measure 62, which would dedicate 15 percent of lottery profits for that purpose.
\
While Hanna merits re-election, he should rethink his opposition to a proposed cap-and-trade program to limit carbon emissions that Gov. Ted Kulongoski plans to bring before the next Legislature. Hanna is right to worry about the plan's impact on Oregon businesses. But he should balance that concern against scientists' warnings that, without cuts in the emissions that Oregon and other Western states will suffer disproportionately from water shortages, severe wildfires, coastal flooding and species die-offs.
\
Nordin, 63, has lived in Cottage Grove most of his adult life. He runs a company that makes bicycle trailers and has served on the Cottage Grove Planning Commission and the Lane County Rural Community Improvement Council. He was the chief petitioner for Friends of LTD, the organization that succeeded, after four tries, in bringing Lane Transit District bus service to southern Lane County.
\
Nordin's primary issues are transportation and the environment. His top priorities are putting in place a cap-and-trade program for limiting carbon emissions, and creating a new statewide strategy that emphasizes alternative transportation. He wants to increase funding for higher education, provide universal health care and revamp the state's tax system by creating a new consumption tax.
\
Nordin has a solid understanding of state issues ranging from public safety to land use planning, and he would make a good legislator. But Oregon needs Hanna's experience and proven leadership.
\
District 7 residents should vote for Bruce Hanna.

9,"
The subject of climate change is a heated one, literally and figuratively. And it is particularly hot at the federal level right now.
\
Because of this, several SUB board members traveled with me to Washington, D.C., to meet with lawmakers. There, we discussed climate change and other important environmental issues - from water quality to fish protection - that affect SUB's operations and our ability to provide responsible, Earth-friendly and cost-effective services to our customers.
\
Of particular interest is pending federal legislation that would regulate greenhouse gases. Utilities and power producers have increasingly come under scrutiny on this issue because fuels used to generate electricity also can generate emissions that lead to climate change.
\
Take coal, for example. Since 1990, the United States has increased its electrical generation by 1 million gigawatt-hours, and of this 40 percent has come from coal-fired resources. Coal burning is a significant contributor of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas implicated in global warming.
\
Of the electricity that SUB delivers to its customers, 93 percent is generated from clean sources that don't emit any greenhouse gases. Still, we could be unfairly burdened by this proposed legislation if the final law doesn't take into consideration the efforts SUB and utilities like us already have made regarding the use of Earth-friendly fuel sources.
\
Currently, the legislation aims to freeze carbon emissions through the use of a ""cap-and-trade"" system that would allocate a limited number of carbon credits to utilities and power plant owners. These recipients could then use the credits to offset emissions from new power generation, or could invest in technologies that reduce emissions, then sell their surplus credits to other power generators who need them.
\
This market-based system is not new. It has been used in California and other states that have taken steps in the past to regulate pollution-causing emissions.
\
The question of fairness comes into play when deciding how the initial credits are allocated.
\
Some argue that credits should go to existing power generation that produces carbon dioxide. We disagree. If credits are allocated based on generation, customers of utilities such as SUB who have pursued renewable energy sources will be punished economically for their past decisions, while owners of newer, ""dirtier"" resources would be rewarded.
\
If carbon credits are allocated based on load (customer energy use), then credits will be blind to the past resource choices made by utilities and a more ""level playing field"" will be assured. SUB strongly believes that creating a level playing field in this arena requires that any cap-and-trade law should allocate credits based on load.
\
While it is true that the Pacific Northwest benefits from a naturally clean source of electricity in the form of its extensive system of rivers and dams, there is choice in the matter. For example, as mentioned above, SUB's fuel sources are 93 percent free of greenhouse gas emissions, while a look at fuel decisions made by most consumer-owned utilities statewide shows that more than 80 percent comes from renewable resources.
\
This trend is particularly striking when SUB is compared to privately owned utilities in Oregon. Their resource portfolios are just 46 percent greenhouse gas free. Check out the national picture and the amount of ""clean"" generation plummets to just 26 percent.
\
Clearly, SUB and other customer-owned utilities are leading by example. And our message is equally clear: a level-playing field must be reflected in any law that is passed.
\
Doing so will ensure that our strong support of renewable resources and conservation is recognized in a tangible and fair way for the positive contribution it has and will continue to have on our environment.

Victims of a disease
\
No one who has read of Andrea Yates' mental history or followed the medical testimony in her trial can deny that she is a woman with a severe mental illness. Even the prosecution admitted this fact, although it argued that Yates was guilty because she still knew ""right from wrong.""
\
While Yates may have known that drowning her children was wrong in the eyes of man-made law, her mental illness caused her to believe it was ""right"" in the eyes of a higher law, a ""god"" borne of her disease. Something is very wrong with a criminal justice system that is incapable of making this critical distinction.
\
As an attorney and long-time advocate for the mentally ill in the criminal justice system, I can assure readers that discrimination against and ignorance of mental illness thrives, even in this community. Until that changes, and until we admit that the mentally ill are victims of their disease, just as diabetics and cancer patients are victims of their diseases, we cannot call ourselves enlightened. A society is successful only to the extent that it is mindful of and accommodating to those who have special needs.
\
Andrea Yates, like the many thousands of other people with mental illness who have been snared by the unyielding criminal justice net, stares at all of us from her two prisons: her cell and her madness.

Cut and cap flexibility
\
As an economics instructor, I scan The Register-Guard each morning in search of articles that teach economic principles or display economic illiteracy. I often use these articles as teaching tools. I could scarcely contain my delight on the morning of March 10 when I discovered a truly special piece: a letter to the editor that explains an economic theory at work and displays economic illiteracy.
\
As Marlen Clough explains in ""Cut-and-cap morality,"" in the current cap and trade system of pollution control, government regulators give emission credits (permits to pollute) to an industry, which can then trade or sell the permits. Because these permits can be traded, the companies that value the permits the most are the companies that end up with the permits. This system is widely supported by economists because it allows pollution to be reduced more efficiently than inflexible governmentally mandated pollution control policies.
\
Referring to the proposal to use the same technique for the control of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury, Clough asserts: ""We know that the government could simply require industry to reduce these emissions."" While it is true that the government could simply force businesses to cut emissions, in a cap and trade system the government doesn't relinquish the ability to reduce emissions. The government can still reduce emissions to any level by simply issuing fewer tradable permits (or by buying back existing ones).
\
Clough also compares the use of permits to pollute to the use of permits to commit murder. In an economic sense, it is important to recognize a key difference between pollution and murder: Pollution is an unfortunate byproduct of an otherwise useful activity. In no way can we imagine that murder is an unfortunate byproduct of an otherwise useful activity.

Parkway ruins wetlands
\
The coverage of the land purchase by the Bureau of Land Management to add to the community's wetlands inventory (Register Guard, March 11) missed a key point.
\
The article states that the BLM has spent over $12 million in Land and Water Conservation Funds to preserve the west Eugene wetlands. However, it fails to mention that if the West Eugene Parkway is built, a good portion of this ""preserved"" land would be filled and paved over.
\
Did you get that? Twelve million dollars was supposed to guarantee this land would be protected. Instead, a portion of that money is being used to facilitate the destruction of our wetlands.
\
LWCF was established to protect important areas from development. According to the BLM, the parkway would be the dominant feature of the west Eugene wetlands. The highway would dump a 300-foot-wide (the length of a football field), 30-foot-high mound of sand, gravel and concrete through the heart of the wetlands. Does that sound like protection to you? No wonder citizens distrust the government.
\
The LWCF was not established to build highways. To do so is a violation of federal law - unless you create an exception, of course. Every law has a loophole.
\
This is just one of the many legal hurdles the West Eugene Parkway must get over. As an advisory vote to get the sense of the community, the November parkway vote was essentially a tie. It does not guarantee the parkway can or will be built.

Who's winning the war?
\
In the wake of the past year's events, I feel less secure than I've felt in a long time. Well, obviously, you might say. But it's not the terrorist threat that causes this feeling; it's the actions of the Bush administration.
\
Who can trust in people who talk with a straight face about fighting ""bad people"" and ""evil ones,"" and use a slogan like ""Let's roll"" and call it a creed? These people invite top Enron officials to write their energy policy and fight to keep the records secret.
\
They declare a military mission of ridding the world of evil, proposing gigantic increases in military budgets that would keep federal funds from being spent to meet real human needs. They justify it by undermining warming relations between the Koreas and talk openly of forcibly removing Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from power and of using tactical nuclear weapons in combat.
\
They unilaterally withdraw from cooperative global agreements and ballistic missile treaties and alienate many of our allies. They quietly undo regulations that support air and water quality, workplace safety, energy conservation and roadless areas protections. They are pushing hard to open priceless wildlife habitat in Alaska to oil drilling.
\
They restrict press access and redefine civil liberties to suit their agenda. Their definition of terrorists likely will lead to a surveillance of domestic groups that is reminiscent of J. Edgar Hoover. They want billions more for corporate welfare and fight increases in the minimum wage. Their love of secrecy is Nixonian. They seem to have chosen the path of madness.

Mental illness no lie
\
I was dismayed to read the March 6 letter ""Mental illness is a lie."" Mental illness is a reality.
\
The fact is, many mental illnesses have biological causes that are often treatable with medication and other interventions. When you see someone ""wandering around mumbling,"" as Hugh Massengill describes, you are probably not seeing ""someone who has been released from a traumatic environment."" It is far more likely you are seeing someone who could benefit from medical intervention as well as a stronger social support network.
\
I don't question the importance of nurturing for the development of any human being. However, generalizations about mental illness - particularly ill-conceived blaming of current culture - serve no purpose. They only perpetuate outdated myths such as: Schizophrenia is caused by demonic possession or autism is caused by refrigerator mothers.
\
That I even have to acknowledge this rambling diatribe with a response is ridiculous. Would The Register-Guard's editors print a similar letter titled ""Heart disease is a lie""? Let's focus on what realistically needs to happen - better services for disabled people and more funding for research.

Too little class time
\
Financial and political support for public education in Oregon has sunk to its lowest level in recent memory. When revisiting the failure of the state to adequately fund education - and revisit it Oregon must, perhaps with a guaranteed sales tax dedicated to education - another educational shortfall should be recognized: the length of the school day and year.
\
The average length of the school year in Oregon is now 171 days, the shortest in the nation. Some school districts are considering cutting additional days to balance budgets. A 171-day school year means school is in session only two-thirds of the weekdays in a calendar year.
\
The marquee at one local elementary school reads, ""School is out at 1:50 on Wednesdays."" At a time when the earning power of the college graduate vs. the high school graduate is widening and brainpower is at a premium in the job market, why are we sending students home in the middle of the afternoon and dismissing school entirely for 11 or 12 weeks in the summer?
\
It mystifies me that we accept the notion that excellence in athletics demands year-round training - note the number of summer camps and leagues for athletes - but somehow believe, if current educational practice is the norm, that academic excellence can be achieved with minimum exposure to classroom instruction.
\
Restructuring the school day and school year must be part of rethinking the financing of public education.

U.S. abdicates leadership role on global warming
\
The world's first legally binding agreement to reduce the volume of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming goes into effect today in 141 countries. Eight years in the making, the Kyoto Protocol will be celebrated from Canada to Japan to Brazil.
\
There will be no celebration in the United States, which is responsible for one-fourth of the world's greenhouse gases. The United States has rejected the treaty.
\
The Kyoto accord is far from perfect. It exempts developing nations and fast-growing industrial powers such as China. Scientists say carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased to a level where the reductions called for in the treaty are unlikely to produce a significant slowing of warming trends.
\
Yet it's a start - and an important one. The treaty requires participating nations to cut greenhouse emissions by 2012 to 1990 levels or below. Despite its limitations, the pact could lead to new negotiations for even deeper emissions cuts and the inclusion of other countries. Under the Bush administration the United States has abdicated its proper role as a participant and leader in this process.
\
President Bush could have justified the United States' withdrawal by embracing an approach that dealt more effectively with climate change. Instead, he has blocked bipartisan efforts in the Senate to establish a nationwide emissions limit and a cap-and-trade program that would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The president also has bowed to the auto industry by blocking efforts to increase fuel-efficiency standards for U.S. vehicles. And he's turned away from a national energy policy that emphasizes conservation and alternative-energy sources.
\
The rest of the world is moving forward on climate change, while the United States has chosen to play the role of obstructionist. As a result, U.S. companies will not participate in the emerging cap- and-trade markets for greenhouse emissions. By refusing to participate in Kyoto - or enact a meaningful substitute - the Bush administration has handicapped U.S. industry, which could have led the world in developing technologies ranging from alternative energy to carbon storage.
\
Meanwhile, congressional conservatives cling to the silly argument that there's no scientific evidence to support concerns about global warming. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, recently declared that ""global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people."" Jurassic Park refugees gleefully cite Michael Crichton's novel, ""State of Fear,"" in which opportunistic environmental groups manipulate public fears through false claims about global warming. Someone should remind them that it's Crichton who is creating fiction, not scientists.
\
The evidence supporting the global warming theory is compelling. A team of scientists commissioned by the United Nations has determined that global temperatures could increase by more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if current trends continue. Studies have shown that more than 20 percent of the arctic ice sheet has melted since 1979 and that the 1990s were the hottest decade in the last 1,000 years.
\
Yes, Kyoto is flawed. But it's an historic first step taken while the United States has chosen to sit back and watch.

14,"Statesman Journal\It's cool to rally around climate change these days, but taking real actions to cut greenhouse gases is not nearly as easy.\It's true even in Oregon -- where the governor pushed to adopt stricter tailpipe-emission standards, multiple groups have outlined specific ways to cut Oregon's global warming contributions, and individuals are doing their part by driving less and making their homes more energy efficient.\Concern about the environment has been a hallmark of this legislative session, yet two bills that would have set a clear path for reducing Oregon's global warming emissions went no further than one committee hearing.\In comparison to neighboring Washington and California, Oregon looks like it took the easy route: focusing on the trendy energy-efficiency movement and renewable-energy mantra rather than stringent standards to cut emissions from sources.\In a session packed with environmental legislation -- expanding the bottle bill, implementing an electronics waste recycling program and encouraging renewable energy -- something as broad as climate change needed to wait, legislators and environment advocates said.\""We need to do more work ... reaching out to both members of the Legislature, as well as industry and agriculture and forestry, to get everyone on the same page in terms of how to be part of the solution,"" said Rep. Ben Cannon, D-Portland. ""In general, industry understands that it can be and needs to be part of the answer. We can work hard in 2009 with real consensus around cap-and-trade and performance plant standards.""\The cap-and-trade bill would have established an emissions cap for all significant carbon emitters and allowed emitters to trade ""credits"" for carbon reductions.\The other: A power plant performance standard would have forbid utilities from investing long term in a new power plant that pollutes more than a combined-cycle natural gas plant, which currently is the cleanest fossil fuel plant.\That's not to say that climate change was ignored in Oregon's legislative session.\Cannon is a sponsor of the climate change integration act, House Bill 3543, which would set targets for reducing greenhouse gases to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 75 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. It also would create a global warming commission and a research institute.\""I am concerned that we need to do more than set targets,"" Cannon said. ""But (House Bill 3543) creates a framework for developing political will.""\Other bills that would reduce future greenhouse gas emissions are moving through the Legislature -- under less controversial titles, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.\""The cap-and-trade and emissions performance standard legislation both involved very complex issues, and it's clear there is a lot more discussion and education that needs to happen of what the issues are and how these two pieces are an essential part of the solution,"" said Jane Lubchenco, co-chairwoman of the Governor's Advisory Group on Global Warming. ""The bills that have passed or are moving are less complex and easier to see some immediate benefit.""\The centerpiece of those bills -- and a priority of Gov. Ted Kulongoski -- is a renewable energy standard that requires most utilities to purchase 25 percent renewable energy by 2025. The idea is to meet future energy needs with wind, solar, wave and geothermal energy rather than greenhouse gas-emitting facilities such as coal-fired electricity plants.\Oregon's standard will cut 5.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2025, an amount equivalent to that emitted annually by about 950,000 cars, according to the nonprofit Environment Oregon.\Other renewable-energy and energy-efficiency measures, which have an effect on greenhouse gas emissions:\*House Bill 2876 requires the state by 2015 to reduce energy use in all structures used by the state by 20 percent from 2000 levels. It means an annual reduction of 83.5 million kilowatts of electricity, 3.5 million therms of natural gas and 110 gallons of fuel oil.\*Senate Bill 576 requires state agencies and other large public entities to construct or renovate buildings to be 20 percent more energy efficient than state building code.\*Senate Bill 375 establishes minimum energy-efficiency standards for commercial appliances such as walk-in freezers, exit signs and clothes washers, and residential products such as DVD players, audio products and electric spas. The bill would reduce total carbon emissions by about 70 tons. By 2020, the more energy-efficient appliances save enough electricity to power 20,000 Oregon households and enough natural gas to power 28,000 households. By 2030 those figures rise to 27,000 and 59,000, respectively.\*House Bills 2210, 2211 and 2212 expand the business and residential tax credits for renewable energy.\""These bills move the (climate change) agenda forward and we are going to have significant measurable reductions,"" said Gail Achterman, who was a member of one of the governor's task forces on global warming.\The package of energy efficiency and renewable energy bills slows the state's drastic increase in global warming emissions projected through 2025. In 2003, Oregonians emitted 11 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person. The worldwide average is about 4 metric tons per person.\""It is pretty clear that climate change is altering the Pacific Northwest as well as the rest of world,"" said Lubchenco, a distinguished professor of zoology at Oregon State University. ""We are seeing changes in temperature, snowpack, timing of precipitation and sea-level rise. Those are well-documented, and there is every reason to believe these changes and others are likely to continue.""\Proponents of the legislation say it will make a difference, even though Oregon is a small state.\""The problems are real but we can address them,"" Lubchenco said. ""There are very real tangible things that can be done to make a difference. The governor and Legislature are moving systematically in the direction of addressing the issues.""\In comparison to Washington and California, however, Oregon is falling behind -- even if all energy efficiency, renewable energy and global warming legislation passes.\Washington's bill puts into law a timeline for reducing global warming pollution from transportation, industry and power production. The bill severely restricts the carbon emissions from power plants built or used to meet Washington's customers needs; reduces climate pollution to half of 1990 levels by 2050, and triples the amount of clean-energy jobs in the state to 25,000 by 2020.\California already has set a timeline and a cap for greenhouse gas emissions, but it still is working on a mechanism for those reductions. They also have a power plant performance standard. Its renewable energy standard is more aggressive than Oregon's -- with a goal of having 20 percent renewable energy by 2020.\In addition, California has very aggressive efficiency standards for buildings and appliances, a solar initiative to encourage at least 3,000 megawatts of solar power on rooftops by 2017, and a fuel standard that requires low carbon.\""We don't have the same set of happy circumstances (as California and Washington),"" said Sallie Schullinger-Krause, the global warming program director for the Oregon Environmental Council. ""We went into this session prepared to work hard on a (renewable energy standard) and a biofuels package, but we simply didn't have the legislative support to see the global warming bills through with the exception of the climate change integration act, which puts a body in place to help us steer a course but it doesn't have any teeth to help us meet the goals. And that's the biggest weakness of our legislation.""\In reality, the biggest impact Oregon's actions may make is in forcing a national policy, which has been elusive under the Bush administration.\""There are 3.5 million people in Oregon ... It is a relatively smallish state, so whatever is done here is mostly symbolic,"" said political analyst Bill Lunch. ""Oregon is not totally trivial, but for any serious efforts to address global warming to be successful or even have a chance of success, they have to be national in scope or international.""\bcasper@StatesmanJournal.com or (503) 589-6994\Tracking greenhouse gases\Oregon is one of 30 states to create a multi-state effort to track and manage the emissions that cause global warming.

Change follows years of environmental rollbacks
\
For the past six years, environmentalists have had to play defense against a Republican Congress that has worked with the Bush administration to roll back traditional protections for the nation's air, water and natural resources, and to create an energy policy based on the myth that America can drill its way to oil independence.
\
That should change in the 110th Congress, as a new Democratic majority makes important decisions on global warming, fuel efficiency, offshore drilling, Superfund cleanups and more.
\
It remains to be seen how much Democrats can accomplish - and how far they are willing to go. The party's leadership will be constrained by narrow majorities in the House and Senate, and any major environmental initiatives will require Republican support, especially if President Bush wields his veto power.
\
Still, it's hard not to be optimistic when considering the pending changes in leadership. In the House, Republican Richard Pombo, the Stetson-wearing chairman of the House Resources Committee who relentlessly pushed to open public lands to resource-extraction industries, will be gone. In his place will be California Democrat Jerry McNerney, a wind-power executive who wants to dramatically increase fuel efficiency standards.
\
In the Senate, James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who once called the scientific consensus on global warming ""the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on mankind,"" is out as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. He will be replaced by Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who strongly advocates mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Despite concerns about not overreaching and ""governing from the center,"" the new Democratic leadership should make the fight against global warming its No. 1 priority. A good starting point would be a major increase in fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks - a move that would reduce America's contribution to global warming, as well as its dependency on foreign oil.
\
The essential next step - one that will require unity, focus, boldness and bipartisanship by Democrats - will be mandatory caps on heat-trapping greenhouse emissions. Congress already has a half- dozen cap-and-trade proposals, in various stages of maturity, to consider, the most promising of which is a bipartisan bill introduced by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joe Lieberman, I- Conn.
\
Other priorities should include new policies to increase energy conservation and efficiency, with an emphasis on renewable energy solutions that include wind power, solar power and biofuels. Congress must also flex its dormant oversight muscles and monitor the Energy Department and problem-plagued federal Superfund cleanups.
\
In the meantime, Democrats must remain alert to prevent any further environmental damage by the lame-duck Republican Congress. GOP lawmakers are likely to attempt to slip through additional rollbacks as riders to appropriation bills or as last-minute conference committee trade-offs in the final weeks of the session.
\
The Democratic ""watch list"" should include Oregon Congressman Greg Walden's misguided proposal to speed up salvage logging by shortcutting critical environmental protections. Other dangerous bills seek to open more coastal areas to offshore drilling, and to allow oil and gas pipeline construction through national parks and monuments. Some in Congress may also be plotting final efforts to eviscerate the Endangered Species Act and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve for oil and gas exploration in the final days of the session.
\
It won't be long before the 110th Congress takes charge and the environmental pendulum swings a different direction. Until then, watchfulness is the order of the day for Democrats.

17,"In response to Milon Whittier's Jan. 26 letter (""Clean Energy Jobs bill a misnomer,"" page 6C) asking that if Oregon's share of global warming carbon emissions is small, why should we do anything to curb it, I would quote Gandhi who said, ""What you do may seem insignificant, but it is most important that you do it.""\Ask if everyone behaved as you, would the world be a better place or a worse place? If an individual acts contrary to the good of all just because they believe their actions are insignificant, that is an action of the morally bankrupt.\Oregon must do its small part, even if it is a small part of the whole, because it is the right thing for all of us to do.\Joseph Harchanko\Salem\As almost everyone now knows, the climate crisis is an imminent threat to our planet's ability to support life. Oregon's contribution to the global carbon pollution problem is small, like that of other states, or even most nations.\To solve this global problem, each person, community, state and nation must do its part to reduce carbon emissions. Cap-and-trade approaches, like the Clean Energy Jobs bill, use a system of free market-driven incentives to reduce emissions. They provide options to invest in technology to reduce emissions or purchase credits from other polluters.\This is the approach used in the successful 1990 plan that has reduced the emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides that cause acid rain. The plan was embraced by industry because of its flexibility under our economic market system.\The other approach is a carbon tax where polluters pay for each ton of carbon emitted with the revenues returned to taxpayers. This system can work as well, but it seems like industry and Republican legislators would prefer the market-based approach of a cap-and-trade policy.\The crisis demands action, massive in scope and immediate in time. Rather than picking nits, I urge the Oregon Legislature to take action now.\Michael Cairns\Independence\I am very concerned about the cap-and-trade bill that's coming back to life.\My utility company projects an increase of double digits in the first year for natural gas. Natural gas is a big part of our business. Any increase threatens our bottom line and would force us to raise prices, lay off employees and decrease any kind of business investments.\This is nothing more than a way for the state to tax business even more. Businesses are facing uncertainty with the money grab called gross receipts tax (which the voters rejected but the Legislature jammed down our throats anyway).\Cap-and-trade has zero effect on emissions. This is just another redistribution of wealth by the fools that are ""in charge"" of the state.\Tina Musshorn\Salem\The Opinion Page of Jan. 26 was the same as most opinion pages — all against our President, accusing him of being a liar, a cheater, etc.\Unfortunately for the writers, they can't believe the truth that over the last three years, the Democrats have spent $40 million of our money to try and undo their embarrassment of losing. Nothing has been proven, so they keep coming up with more lies.\You are upset because President Trump did not tell Pelosi that a terrorist leader who is behind thousands of deaths of Christians and Jews would be taken out. If he had, she would have told the terrorist and sent him another billion dollars because he already spent the billions Obama sent him.\You all think it was a horrible crime to kill a terrorist, yet you are all in the same bunch who believe it is good to kill millions of babies through abortion.\Yes, supporters are behind President Trump because he is doing what we elected him for. Unemployment is way down, the Dow is way up, the military is rebuilt, illegal entries are down — and it goes on.\What have the Democrats done during this time for America? Nothing but tell lies.\Larry Crompton\Salem\The Friday, Jan. 24, Statesman Journal had several stories that remind me how awful Donald Trump is.\On page 8A is an article saying the world is closer to destruction than we have been since the Doomsday Clock was created in 1947, yet Mr. Trump has ended yet another environmental protection (page 9A, same date). Now waterways can be polluted again. Good for business, bad for humans and creatures.\On page 4A, it said nine children who had been separated by ICE were returned to their parents. I think that leaves about 3,991 in limbo?\Mr. Trump attended the March for Life rally, showing he cares more about unborn children than living ones. While the Republican senators were playing with toys, I listened to the Democratic senators.\Mr. Trump cares more about himself than he does about us. Holding money from Ukraine was illegal and only helped Russia.\Mr. Trump does not understand the damage he is doing to the environment, children or to the constitution. Maybe he needs to retire and relocate to Florida on a permanent basis.\Kay Myklebust\Salem\As a college freshman, I didn't truly realize the exorbitant cost of textbooks until I was standing in line, waiting to purchase ""Principles of Microeconomics"" and its online access code for $159.\And while I spent $159 on my book, paying over $200 on a single book is common. Big publishers control the textbook market, having raised prices over three times the rate of inflation during the last decade. Professors, lacking resources to explore alternative options, continue to assign these cost-prohibitive books.\I know students who work instead of study, give up food and increase their loans to obtain reading materials and online access codes. Others scour for online alternatives, hope to pass without these expensive books, or just drop the class entirely.\There is a solution to this crisis: open-source textbooks. They're proven just as effective, and they're free. Grants and programs can help professors develop and access open resources, reducing the market power of publishers and helping students.\Books shouldn't come at the cost of food security, so I believe it's important that schools like Oregon State University, the University of Oregon and Chemeketa prioritize supporting student learning, engagement and success by investing in accessible and affordable open resources.\Eden McCall, University of Oregon student\Salem\My heart soared when I saw the Jan. 24 article about gardening with Oregon native plants (""Native nirvana,"" page 1C). Oregonians are justifiably proud of the northwest, and growing local plants is a celebration of the place we call home.\Displaying Oregon native plants in your yard is like putting out an ""I heart Oregon"" sign, whereas when I see exotic plants in yards, I feel like the homeowner is saying ""I'd rather be elsewhere.""\When I discovered native-plant gardening some years ago, I found it to be nothing less than spiritually transformative. Though I was always an outdoors person, getting acquainted with native plants in my own yard fostered a sense of place and a connection with nature deeper than I'd thought possible.\Once I learned to recognize plants, the experience of hiking became like a joyous visit to dear friends. All of this is in addition to the facts the article points out: that native plants help native wildlife and pollinating insects like no others, require no fertilizer and pesticide and need little or no irrigation once established.\Native plants are win-win-win. They're good for the environment, animals and our spirits.\Jessica L. Kolman\Salem"

New EPA chief should change course
\
By the Environmental Protection Agency's own estimates, 15 percent of the 4 million babies born each year in the United States may be exposed to levels of mercury in the womb that can cause neurological damage and learning problems.
\
Yet the EPA is bulldozing ahead with plans to finalize mercury pollution rules that favor industry and already have been discredited by the agency's own inspector general. The EPA should do a U-turn and enact tough mercury emissions rules that place the well- being of pregnant women and children over the interests of power companies.
\
Last month, the EPA's inspector general reported that agency administrators had ordered staff members to overlook scientific evidence and agency protocols to ensure that proposed mercury pollution limits were acceptable to the Bush administration and to affected industries.
\
Now, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office says the EPA did, in fact, distort the analysis of its proposed limits, making it appear the administration's pro-industry approach was superior to an alternative favored by public health advocates.
\
The GAO report says the EPA neglected to document the toxic effects of mercury on the health of children and women of childbearing age in its analysis of two approaches to limiting mercury emissions. The GAO urged that this critical omission be corrected before the EPA takes final action on the new rule.
\
That seems unlikely, given the Bush administration's Spockish mind-meld with industry interests - and its resulting indifference to the health of pregnant women and young children.
\
In early 2004, the EPA offered two options for reducing the 48 tons of mercury emitted annually by U.S. power plants. Both industry and the administration from the outset heavily favored the cap-and- trade approach, which allows electric utilities to trade in mercury pollution credits. Environmentalists generally favored an alternative that would impose strict mercury pollution limits at every plant.
\
Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of 29 senators urged newly appointed EPA Administrator Steve Johnson to reverse course on the mercury rule in light of the inspector general's and the GAO's reports.
\
Johnson should heed the request and call an exorcist to rid his agency of political demons. If the new EPA chief, a career agency scientist, caves to White House pressure and puts the trading system into place, he will damage his agency's credibility and his own. He also will have put in place a rule that's unlikely to survive court challenges and that, most importantly, increases the risk of health complications for millions of women and children.
\
If Johnson is concerned about industry complaints about the cost of alternative approaches, he should take the time to read a new study on the economic impacts of mercury pollution. The study, by researchers from the Mount Sinai Center for Children's Health and the Environment, estimates that up to 637,233 children are born each year with mercury levels associated with IQ loss. The study estimates the resulting loss in earnings potential at $9 billion a year.
\
Johnson should reject the cap-and-trade plan and put strong mercury limits in place - limits that place the needs of children and women over those of industry.
"
19,"House Republicans walked out of the Oregon Capitol on Tuesday, joining their Senate colleagues in protest of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill.\""Oregon House Republicans are taking a stand, with working families, in opposing cap and trade and this rigged process,"" House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, said in a statement.\House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, said she has and will continue to make an effort toward compromise, but that isn't possible if Republicans are not in the Capitol.\""I have routinely reached out to Republicans in a genuine effort to hear their ideas and compromise where we can. My door is always open,"" Kotek said. ""We may disagree on policy, but one thing is for sure — we can't reach consensus if the Republicans don't show up for work.""\Walking out denies the House of Representatives the quorum it needs to conduct business on the floor. House Democrats hold a supermajority of 38 members, but they need two Republicans to reach the two-thirds quorum of 40.\It's the fifth denial of quorum by Republicans over the past two Oregon legislative sessions.\In a stream of statements released Tuesday, House Republicans cited the process of crafting Senate Bill 1530, as well as the policy itself, as their reasons for leaving.\Republicans said SB 1530 would increase the cost of living in rural Oregon and do little to combat climate change. Democrats say cap-and-trade is the only way to reduce the state's carbon emissions and the bill has protections for rural Oregon.\Republicans also said their amendments were dismissed without consideration, while Democrats point to significant changes in the legislation as proof rural voices were taken into account.\The only path to secure their return, Republicans said, is to either kill SB 1530 or refer it to the ballot and allow Oregonians to vote on the proposal.\They contend that the state and the Capitol are too divided for lawmakers to vote on this issue.\""Republican legislators have pleaded repeatedly with our Democrat colleagues to refer cap-and-trade legislation to the voters,"" said Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass. ""This is the only acceptable solution when the Legislature cannot come to a resolution.""\Democrats do not support referring SB 1530 to voters. They said they have the votes to pass it through the Legislature and urgent action on climate change is needed.\Outside the Capitol, a couple hundred people protested Republicans absconding the Capitol under the banner ""No More Costly Walkouts.""\Democratic lawmakers from both chambers, along with union leaders and environmental activists, called on Republicans to return to the building and allow the Legislature to vote on SB 1530.\""I know House Republicans don't want to hear this, but the voters have spoken,"" said House Democratic Leader Barbara Smith Warner, D-Portland.\SB 1530 would set gradually declining limits on statewide carbon emissions and create a marketplace for polluters to buy credits, or allowances, for each ton of emissions they release annually.\The major target of the program is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035, and 80 percent below by 2050.\It's similar to House Bill 2020 from the 2019 legislative session, which sparked a nine-day Senate Republican walkout. Republicans returned for the final weekend of session last yearafter HB 2020 lost Senate Democratic support.\Senate Democratic Leader Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, told Republicans that they are ""guilty of dereliction of duty"" and are ""violating (their) oath of office.""\Senate Republicans left Monday after SB 1530 passed out of the Joint Ways and Means Committee, the last hurdle before the bill could receive a vote on the Senate floor.\As the walkout by Republicans in the upper chamber stretched into a second day, Senate Republican Leader Herman Baertschiger Jr., R-Grants Pass, said his caucus will stay out until the end of session if they have to.\Constitutionally, session must end no later than midnight March 8.\He also pushed back on the argument that Republicans were taking a vacation from work.\""We are doing our job. Our districts say stop this horrible legislation,"" Baertschiger said. ""Because we're in the minority, the only tool we have to stop this terrible piece of legislation is a denial of quorum.""\The Senate held a floor session at 11 a.m. Sen. Tim Knopp, R-Bend, was the only Republican in attendance, as he was Monday.\Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, begged Republicans to return, saying there was still time to complete the many bills still hanging in the legislative process.\""(We will) continue to work in our committees.

20,"For the second consecutive legislative session, Senate Republicans have walked out of the Oregon Capitol to block passage of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill.\""The Senate Republicans who walked out are not against climate policy, they are against the democratic process,"" Gov. Kate Brown said. ""Oregonians should be outraged and I am, too.""\Senate Republicans say they are facing a Democratic majority unwilling to compromise and intent on pushing a bill through the Legislature that will harm rural Oregonians.\Democrats say they have been responsive to Republican's concerns over Senate Bill 1530 and were given a mandate by a majority of voters to pursue climate change legislation.\Hanging in the balance are dozens of bills, including funding appropriations for mental health services, homelessness and combating wildfires. There also are policy bills on issues from education to gun control.\The walkout was triggered Monday morning when the budget writing Ways and Means Committee sent SB 1530 to the Senate floor as Timber Unity truck horns blared from the streets outside.\When the Senate floor session began 30 minutes later, only one Republican arrived.\The other 11 were gone.\Democrats hold a supermajority of 18 members, but a walkout denies the Senate a two-thirds quorum of 20 needed to conduct any business on the floor. Senate Republicans deployed this tactic twice during the 2019 session — first in protest of a multibillion dollar education revenue package and then against House Bill 2020, the previous cap-and-trade bill.\The biggest difference between this session and 2019 is that the bill has enough support to pass the full Senate and ""that will not change,"" according to Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem.\Democratic staffers said the bill also has at least the 31 votes needed to pass the House of Representatives, were it to reach that chamber.\Senate Republican spokeswoman Kate Gillem said the senators decided this weekend that for those walking out, only the members of the Ways and Means Committee should come into the Capitol on Monday. The rest should stay away and be ready to leave.\Gillem described it as a precautionary measure.\Minutes after the bill was voted on, Republicans began leaving.\Sen. Tim Knopp, R-Bend, was the only Republican senator present at the 11 a.m. floor session. The other eleven members were absent, though Sen. Brian Boquist, R-Dallas, and Senate Republican Leader Herman Baertschiger Jr., R-Grants Pass, were excused by the Senate President's Office.\After having Senate staff search the building, Courtney announced the Senate did not have enough members for a quorum and they could not proceed with a floor session. The upper gallery erupted in applause, which Courtney quickly quieted.\Courtney gave a short statement and then adjourned the floor session until 11 a.m. Tuesday.\""We need to continue to work very hard and be prepared should we find a way to have another member come here,"" Courtney said.\Knopp said after the floor session that he decided to stay because there are bills he wants to continue working on. He said he was not in contact with his Republican colleagues and that his presence at the Capitol was ""day-by-day.""\Gillem said Republican senators are prepared to deny quorum for the remainder of the session — which under statute has to end no later than midnight March 8.\""I can no longer stand by and watch this poorly crafted cap and trade legislation get steamrolled through the capitol,"" Sen. Kim Thatcher, R-Keizer, said in a statement. ""Sometimes a boycott is the best way to stop bad laws from happening to good people.""\Unlike during last year's cap-and-trade walkout, Courtney said he would not ask Brown to direct Oregon State Police officers to locate missing Republicans.\SB 1530 never would have had a chance to reach the Senate floor had Courtney not used a long-standing Senate rule to join the Ways and Means committee and vote in support of the bill.\This was necessary because co-chair Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, opposes SB 1530.\There are 12 senators on the Ways and Means Committee — seven Democrats and five Republicans.\Johnson's ""no"" tied the vote 6-6 on the Senate side of the joint committee.\Courtney's vote broke the tie. Without it, Johnson's opposition would have been enough to keep the bill in committee.\""Sen. Courtney's actions leave no other option for Senate Republicans but to boycott and deny quorum because cap and trade is on the way to the Senate floor,"" Baertschiger said in a statement.\SB 1530 would set gradually declining limits on statewide carbon emissions and create a marketplace for polluters to buy credits, or allowances, for each ton of emissions they release annually.\The major target of the program is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035, and 80 percent below by 2050.\Climate activists praised lawmakers for passing the legislation out of Ways and Means. HB 2020 from last session died in the Senate after the bill lost Democratic support amid a nine-day Republican walkout.\""It's impossible to turn your back or run away from the climate crisis,"" said Tera Hurst, executive director of Renew Oregon. ""From wildfires to water shortages to food sources dying off, Oregon will face devastation if business as usual is allowed to continue.""\Republicans say SB 1530 would increase the cost of living in rural Oregon and do little to combat climate change. Democrats say cap-and-trade is the only way to reduce the state's carbon emissions and the bill has protections for rural Oregon.\Throughout session, Republicans have called for SB 1530 to be referred to voters because they contend that the state and the Capitol are too divided for lawmakers to vote on this issue.\Democrats are not in support of that proposal. They say Oregonians sent lawmakers to the Capitol precisely so they could make hard decisions on complicated issues.\""We are not interested in referring the bill because we have the votes in the building to pass it outright,"" Brown said. ""Our environment, our children, demand that we take action now.""\Gillem said that if Republicans were to return to the Capitol, Democrats would need to agree to send the bill to voters.\""I cannot in good conscience represent the citizens and constituents of Senate District 30 or the 2 million other Oregonians who have rightfully opposed this legislation and allow it to go through,"" Sen. Lynn Findley, R-Vale, said in a statement. ""If my colleagues will not allow for a fair process in the building, then I will represent my constituents from outside the building.""\Despite Senate Republicans' absence, work at the Capitol building will not completely cease.\The House of Representatives passed a pair of bipartisan bills Monday and is scheduled to consider bills throughout the week.\Committees will also continue to meet, albeit without their Republican members. A simple majority quorum is all that is required for committees to conduct business.\""Committees can still meet, committees can still move bills forward and we're going to continue to do the people's work,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward, D-Portland. ""If we can't go any further than getting them out of committee without our Republican colleagues being here ... then we'll just do what we can do, just like we did last year.""\Contact reporter Connor Radnovich at cradnovich@statesmanjournal.com or 503-399-6864, or follow him on Twitter at @CDRadnovich\Baertschiger\Knopp\CREDIT: Connor Radnovich"

Single-payer plan would cut costs
\
In regard to Reginald Jensen's Nov. 21 letter, the following information is from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Statistics and University of Massachusetts economist Gerald Friedman:
\
From 2000 to 2015, Oregonians' income rose 62 percent while health care spending rose 200 percent. From 2000 to 2015, health care spending grew to 16.25 percent from 12.75 percent of Oregon's gross domestic product. Under the Affordable Care Act, it's projected that by 2020, 17 percent of Oregon GDP will be spent on health care compared with 13 percent under a single-payer plan.
\
While Jensen cited waiting times for non-essential services in the United Kingdom under its National Health Insurance system, which is favored by most Brits, he made no reference to waiting times and unavailability of primary care physicians and specialists under the present U.S. system, which is worse than all but two industrialized nations.
\
Thirty-three percent of the U.S. population experience financially restricted access to health care compared with 14 percent in nine other countries. Also, medical costs are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States but ""medical bankruptcy"" is unheard of in other developed economies.
\
While Jensen attacked a single-payer system without offering any viable alternative, in Oregon the projected overall savings in 2019 from a single-payer plan would be about $8 billion, or $2,000 per person, much of which would be from insurance company profits, overhead and excess CEO compensation.

How to get the parties' attention
\
Political parties engage in continuous power struggles with one another. That doesn't create cooperation, compromise and effectiveness in government, it simply perpetuates what we have now.
\
We can change that by registering as nonpartisans instead of as members of a political party. If a majority of the people did so, it could help remind the parties that ours is indeed a pluralistic society comprised of decent, common-sense people who, despite our differences, all want practical solutions to domestic and international problems.
\
It could stop the parties from fighting one another by drawing their attention back to us and finally getting them to begin working for us.
\
It's the nature of political parties to seek power, and increasing their memberships is part of how they strive to do that. Registering as nonpartisans would get them to stop taking us for granted or placing us in rigid ideological categories.
\
Candidates should talk to us as individuals, not as members of a homogeneous herd. As a rallying cry, I paraphrase that master of paradox, Groucho Marx: I refuse to belong to any political party that would have me as a member.

A carbon tax might be necessary
\
Climate change is already causing disasters. The genocide in Darfur was partially the result of global warming, as is the civil war in Syria. President Obama's regulations don't do enough. The other possibilities are some form of a cap-and-trade system, or a carbon tax such as the Citizens' Climate Lobby is proposing. The CCL is betting the farm on grass-roots activism and prefers a solution people can easily understand.
\
Its revenue-neutral carbon tax would cover the entire U.S. economy and goods coming into the United States (people sensitive to higher prices would change how they spend their money). If the United States were willing to do more to fight global warming, other countries such as China would follow suit.
\
On Sept. 17, Rep. Chris Gibson, R-N.Y., and 10 other Republicans in Congress introduced a non-binding resolution urging the House of Representatives to work on solutions to the problem. They plan to introduce legislation, perhaps early next year.
\
In another sign that we may be moving beyond the partisan impasse on global warming in Congress, four Republican senators - Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mark Kirk of Illinois - announced on Oct. 29 the formation of the Energy and Environment Working Group.
\
Given that time is short, people wondering what the U.S. government should do about global warming might consider supporting a carbon tax, because inaction would also be risky.

Don't fret about Syrian immigrants
\
In response to the reactions of the Republican presidential candidates and members of Congress (Democrats included) to the extreme measures for vetting and disallowing Syrian refugees to immigrate to the United States, maybe they need to realize that unless they're 100 percent Native American, their ancestors were allowed to immigrate.
\
Take Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for example: His father immigrated from Cuba in 1957 at the height of the Cold War. What if he hadn't been allowed to immigrate because he ""may"" have been an undercover communist collaborator?
\
Labels can be put on anyone. Who gets to decide that because someone may not be of a religious faith you approve of, that person shouldn't get a chance to start a new life? There may be some zealots in the bunch, but we know some are already here and our security system has worked fairly well since Sept. 11.
\
I worry more about the nuts with guns on our college campuses and at our elementary and high schools, movie theaters and shopping malls. They're the ones who go undetected - until they explode.

Oregon's homeless also need help
\
Last April, Gov. Kate Brown gave her first State of the State address. After pointing out that she'd signed a bill to ""sustain the well-being of the sage grouse,"" she moved on to the topic of homelessness; like most politicians, she was against it, saying the needs of the homeless were ""immediate and urgent.""
\
In October, Mayor Kitty Piercy sent a resolution to Brown asking her to declare a ""homeless emergency"" (all those ""travelers"" were getting on the mayor's nerves).
\
What's happened since then? On Nov. 17, Brown acted. She took a firm stand on helping the homeless, tweeting: ""Clearly, Oregon will continue to accept refugees."" Meanwhile, over at WhiteHouse.gov, President Obama touted his $4.5 billion Syrian refugee aid program.
\
But what about Oregon's homeless population? With the country more than $18 trillion in debt, when will they get the help they need?

Rename Dunn Hall for Al Smith
\
The Nov. 21 report on the University of Oregon's pledge to confront racism left me thinking it's past time to change the name of the UO's Dunn Hall. Its namesake, as the report noted, served as an exalted cyclops in the Ku Klux Klan.
\
A name change would send a welcome message to victims of Klan violence in Oregon, their descendants and generations of African-Americans who've survived Klan terror campaigns.
\
Few people deserve the honor of having a hall named after them more than the late Al Smith. A Klamath Tribe spiritual leader, he has long been hailed nationally as a hero for religious freedom in the United States.
\
Naming a building after Smith, who hasn't received adequate recognition in the community he called home for many decades, would allow the UO to turn away from the exclusions of the past and move toward greater inclusiveness.

22,"Statesman Journal\Proponents of the governor's climate-change legislation emphasized the benefits to the economy rather than the environment at a news conference at the Capitol on Tuesday.\Healthy Climate Partnership, a new organization formed to promote Oregon's climate-change legislation, announced its campaign called RePower Oregon 2009.\Legislators, environmentalists, members of the religious community and business leaders focused on how the governor's package of bills would create jobs, bring millions of dollars to rural communities and create new manufacturing facilities.\Kulongoski's proposals include developing a system to cap carbon emissions and allow trading of carbon credits; creating incentives for renewable-energy development; increasing energy efficiency in existing and new buildings; and promoting alternative transportation choices.\The most controversial part of his proposal is the cap-and-trade system, which opponents say would hurt business and the state's economy.\Dave Van't Hof, the governor's sustainability advisor, points to a recent draft ECONorthwest economic analysis that shows an increase of between 14,000 and 43,000 jobs in Oregon by 2020 under a cap-and-trade program. The jobs would be in the renewable energy, energy efficiency and transportation fields.\""These programs will create jobs and economic growth much faster than through normal channels,"" he said about the governor's climate-change package. ""It's about growing the economy and having environmental benefits.""\That's not the last word on the economic effects of a cap-and-trade policy and other climate-change proposals.\John Ledger of Associated Oregon Industries said the draft ECONorthwest report was not released publicly Jan. 15 - the date on the front page of the report - because the data were preliminary. The report, however, since has been made public.\Ledger said another report, based on more accurate numbers, will be released in March.\He said the cap-and-trade proposal will undergo ""a lot of scrutiny"" this session.\""Cap-and-trade is designed to push up energy costs, and that in turn makes energy efficiency have a better payback,"" he said. ""The idea is that as people pay more and it costs them more, they would want to invest in alternative technologies.""\He agreed that energy efficiency is a great way to tackle climate change and that renewable energy is a growing segment of the Oregon economy. But he also said that renewable energy is a small part of the entire economy.\""It's a piece of the whole economy,"" he said. ""If you manufacture computer parts or precision bearings, (the renewable energy industry) is another source of customers.

For more than a century, the timber industry has created products, jobs, incomes and revenues from Oregon's forests. Its ability to deliver these benefits is waning, however, and today's realities require a new approach. It's time to pull timber to the sidelines and put carbon to work.
\
Carbon comes to prominence because carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels threaten to devastate our environment, economy and way of life. They intensify heat waves, droughts and storms. They acidify the oceans and threaten to raise sea levels, inundating coastal cities.
\
We can offset some of these threats by halting the logging of federal forests in western Oregon. Trees capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store carbon in their roots, trunks and limbs. The draft National Climate Assessment, just published by America's leading scientists, shows that the forests of western Oregon are the national champions in this process.
\
There are two theories about how forests can best remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. One is to log the biggest trees, convert the wood to building materials, and plant seedlings to repeat the cycle. The other is to allow trees to grow.
\
Last year, scientists at Oregon State University tested these theories, modeling the amount of carbon that would be stored or released through 2100 by federal forestlands. They considered all forms of carbon: live vegetation, dead vegetation, charcoal, soil carbon, and manufactured products derived from wood.
\
Their conclusion: industrial timber production would increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but letting trees grow would reduce it. The difference between the two approaches would average about four metric tons of carbon dioxide per acre per year.
\
Is storing carbon more valuable than producing timber? Yes! West side federal forestlands currently available to be logged, if sold for timber production, would sell for about $5,000 per acre. Currently available information indicates most of the land would be worth at least this much, and perhaps 10 times more, if managed to store carbon.
\
The carbon-storage value is measured by looking at the cost of the harm caused by leaving the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Current evidence suggests this cost is between $50 and several hundred dollars per metric ton. It is impossible to know where this damage would occur, but Oregonians would bear some of it. A 2009 study from the University of Oregon calculated that if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue growing, the average annual costs to Oregon's residents, businesses and communities would total at least $3.3 billion per year by 2020, or $1,900 per household.
\
A properly designed carbon-storage program for Oregon's federal forests can generate revenue for businesses, workers and counties, just as selling timber does now. California's new cap-and-trade program for reducing carbon dioxide emissions points the way. It requires major emitters to cut back or pay forest owners to increase their stored carbon by an equal amount. Emitters spent more than $230 million on the program in 2012; future years will see much larger amounts.
\
Some of these funds can come our way if Oregon's congressional leaders act. Expanding the cap-and-trade program to cover emitters in Oregon would raise the revenue potential even more.
\
As the timber industry steps aside and carbon shoulders more responsibility for generating jobs and revenue, we should not abandon those who will be harmed by the transition. Because all of us would benefit from removing carbon dioxide from the air, we all should accept our obligation to provide worker retraining and other programs to help those most harmed. For some, the transition will be difficult, but we must move forward nonetheless. Today's reality is that the timber-based economy sits in the rearview mirror; the carbon-based economy lies ahead.
\
Some of our political leaders, however, are looking in the mirror. Last year, Reps. Peter DeFazio, Greg Walden, and Kurt Schrader introduced legislation that would markedly increase logging on lands in western Oregon managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Gov. John Kitzhaber also just announced his support for increased logging on these lands. Neither the proposed legislation nor the governor's announcement includes any mention of carbon.
\
Before they expend more effort to increase logging, I urge Kitzhaber and our congressmen to show us that they have fully considered the benefits of putting carbon to work on Oregon's federal forestlands. An important first step would be to convene a panel of scientists, forest managers and economists to describe these benefits more clearly and map the best opportunities for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, creating jobs, and generating revenue.
\
It's time to put carbon to work. Our forests, families, and future depend on it.

24,"""The constraining factor has always been\political feasibility, not economic feasibility.""\Mark Jaccard\Professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC,\and a political economist and energy modeling expert\To the rest of the world, the United States' Pacific Northwest and Canada's British Columbia represent one of the supposedly most eco-friendly regions in North America, if not the globe.\And yet on climate change, the biggest environmental challenge of this generation, the governments of Washington, Oregon and British Columbia not only over-promised what they would do to stem the tide. They actually underperformed compared to all the other states and provinces in the two countries, according to a new analysis by InvestigateWest.\More than a decade ago, the three governments set some of North America's first mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And if any place on earth can show the world how to confront the climate crisis, it should be this region, also known as ""Cascadia"" after the mountain chain shared by the two countries. Cascadia's abundant hydropower provides a head start toward living without fossil fuels, and the majority of voters in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon say they want to make that transition.\Yet Washington, BC and Oregon were not on track to meet their 2020 targets. In fact, until COVID hit last year, emissions were rising. Between 2013 and 2018, the most recent five-year period for which Cascadia's governments have completed counts, emissions rose by about 5, 6 and 7 percent in Washington, Oregon and BC, respectively, according to InvestigateWest's analysis, which enabled apples-to-apples comparisons primarily by counting emissions associated with power imports in BC.\""Emissions don't lie and the emissions keep rising,"" said Andrea Rodgers, an environmental attorney involved in litigation brought by youths in the states and BC charging Oregon, Washington, and Canada with a dereliction of duty in failing to live up to their promises to reduce climate-warming emissions.\Cascadia's broken promise\Technologically speaking, climate change is neither insurmountable nor unaffordable. It's the politics that have fallen short, according to experts and activists interviewed by InvestigateWest.\""I wouldn't say we've done nothing. But there's been an awful lot of dithering. We were supposed to do a whole hell of a lot better,"" says KC Golden, who spent over a decade at Seattle-based think tank Climate Solutions and now serves on the board of international activist group 350.org.\The region's fight to head off climate change has been beset by partisan wrangling, fear of job losses, disagreements over how to ensure equity for already polluted and marginalized communities, and misinformation obscuring the full potential of well-documented solutions.\""The constraining factor has always been political feasibility, not economic feasibility,"" says political economist and energy modeling expert Mark Jaccard, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC, and a former chair of the British Columbia Utilities Commission.\The story of Cascadia's decade of policy delay and emissions backsliding is a story of ambitious goals eroded by inertia. It's a story of overestimating faith in economic logic and underestimating the enduring allure of economic growth. And, south of the 49th Parallel, it's a tale of a bipartisan consensus split asunder, such that fighting for a cleaner future is seen, in some quarters, as an attack on freedom. Or worse.\Powering down coal\After 2005's Hurricane Katrina and 2007's record-breaking loss of Arctic sea ice, Cascadia lawmakers acted, mandating emissions reductions by 2020 and steeper cuts by 2050. As of 2008, Washington, BC and Oregon were among only four provinces and eight states to legally commit to decarbonization.\Oregon and BC set ambitious long-term goals of 75-77% reductions from their 1990 emissions, reflecting the global carbon cuts scientists believed were needed by mid-century to avert the worst of the impending climate disaster. Washington state came in with a relatively modest 50%-by-2050 goal.\All three governments chalked up quick wins in their power sectors.\BC immediately scrapped plans for a new gas-fired power plant and two coal generators. Washington voters and Oregon's legislature passed some of North America's first requirements mandating privately owned utilities to add a rising share of wind, solar and other types of renewable power to their hydropower-rich energy portfolios.\This quick action unleashed a boom in wind power development, especially along the Columbia River Gorge, the natural wind tunnel that separates Oregon and Washington.\And guess what? It actually saved consumers money. Falling prices for wind and solar driven by innovation and scale made the mandates more economical.\Cascadia's problem was the rest of its economy. Buildings, industry and especially transportation generate more than two-thirds of Cascadia's emissions. Carbon-cutting options for those — such as electric heat pumps to replace gas furnaces and urban redesigns to reduce vehicle travel — were more complex and costly than swapping out coal smokestacks for wind turbines. And none of Cascadia's governments had policies strong enough to forcefully drive those options into use.\Greenhouse gas emissions fell for several years thanks to cleaner electricity, as well as the global financial crisis of 2008. People traveled less, consumed less and produced less. Fossil fuel use dropped. Cascadia's emissions fell by 8%. Then the economy rebounded. People moved more. Production and consumption rose. And climate-warming emissions came roaring back.\By 2018 robust economic growth across Cascadia had restored over four-fifths of the 19.5-megatons of annual emissions that the region shed during the downturn.\Surging emissions from cars, trucks, trains and planes led the way. Transportation accounted for nearly two-fifths of Cascadia's emissions by the time its economies rebounded from the global economic meltdown in 2012. Six years later vehicle emissions had ballooned by over 10% in Washington and Oregon and 29% in BC.\While some say increasing emissions are a price of economic growth, InvestigateWest's analysis puts the blame squarely on Cascadia's weak decarbonization policies. Political backlash and game-playing blocked measures to guide economic growth toward green technologies and strategies, and Cascadia's economies kept growing along the path of least resistance. In a world awash in cheap fossil fuels, that meant more carbon emissions.\Not so in California, where climate policy moved forward, and emissions from transportation grew at less than half the rate in Cascadia.\Between full economic recovery in 2012 and 2018, the most recent reporting year, California and Cascadia both booked a robust 26% increase in GDP (see 'A tale of two economies' chart). Over that period California drove its annual emissions down by more than 5%. Washington's emissions —and Cascadia's as a whole — ballooned by over 7%.\Tracking Arnold\California ""decoupled"" economic growth from rising carbon via a raft of laws and policies that encouraged or mandated use of efficient products and cleaner energy. Many were legislated in 2006 under then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, including the centerpiece: a system known as cap and trade. It set a cap on carbon emissions that declined annually, and enforced that cap by requiring polluters to buy credits — sold at auction — for every ton of carbon they released. By putting a price on carbon, cap and trade created a financial incentive to reduce pollution.\Cascadia's governments all sought to match the breadth of California's carbon-cutting policies. They failed.\Early efforts in Washington and Oregon to enact cap-and-trade schemes fizzled. Washington approved a bill in 2008 that was later deemed unenforceable. Oregon ran out of time when the global economic meltdown struck that year.\BC, in contrast, raced ahead. Like Schwarzenegger, then-Premier Gordon Campbell was a center-right politician who embraced climate action. BC's parliamentary government, with its fewer checks on power than the U.S. system, enabled him to move fast.\By the end of 2007, Campbell had a climate package in place. And in May 2008 his Liberal Party government formally approved North America's first carbon tax. It took effect that July — five years before California's system went into effect.\The tax was set to increase annually. Within a few years economists were reporting small benefits and a reassuring lack of harms. The tax had trimmed fuel consumption in BC compared to other provinces in Canada while stimulating BC's economy. BC used its tax take to lower income and business taxes, and sent rebate checks to protect lower-income residents from rising energy costs. Other measures protected energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries such as cement producers.\But in 2011 — after the rival New Democratic Party ran an ""Axe the Tax"" platform alleging that the carbon tax hurt working families — Campbell's party dumped him for a more populist leader. Premier Christy Clark took her lead from BC's business lobbies. She froze the carbon tax, rolled back funding for other climate measures and rolled out a sales pitch for LNG investment.\So despite its early policy lead, BC's decarbonization results proved worse than underwhelming. Instead of declining versus 2007, emissions rose through 2018.\The price of partisanship\To the south, high hopes similarly tanked because of politics. Washington and Oregon governors returned to carbon pricing with their eyes on California's cap-and-trade program rather than the political bloodbath up north. Alas, the same political crossfire leveled at BC's tax — along with some novel attacks — would doom their carbon trading schemes in the state legislatures.\Washington Gov. Jay Inslee pushed carbon pricing after he became governor in 2013, in spite of Republican control of the state senate, where Sen. Doug Ericksen, an opponent of climate action whose district includes two refineries, chaired the environment committee.\Inslee tried several times, and voters rejected two ballot measures, before Washington took a year off from carbon pricing battles in 2019.\Oregon Gov. Kate Brown led repeated charges over the same ground after she took office in 2015. Republican pushback there led to the strange events of June 2019, when Oregon state senators exited the capitol in Salem, denying Democrats the quorum they needed to outvote the Republicans.\The senators' run from lawmaking — a ruse they reprised last year — capped years of political dissolution that transformed an earlier consensus on climate action into open political warfare. In 2007 Oregon's package of climate bills passed on bipartisan votes. In 2020 not one Republican would even cast a vote on a cap-and-trade measure backed by the state's utilities.\Lower-income voters in Oregon and Washington understandably worry about new taxes and higher energy costs. Regressive tax systems in both states mean the lowest 20 percent of earners already pay the highest proportion of their income in taxes. Some unions paint carbon pricing as a job killer, in spite of contrary evidence from BC and California. Climate justice groups attack industries' ability to buy rights to continue polluting the often minority, low-income communities nearby.\And then there's the influence of corporations that sell fossil fuels or profit most when they are cheap.\Former Oregon legislator Jackie Dingfelder, who led passage of the 2007 climate bills, sees Oregon's vulnerability to ideology and misinformation as a legacy of decline in Cascadia's long-standing forestry and mining industries.

Court rejects administration's rules on mercury
\
In Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" the mercurial Queen of Hearts is fond of shrieking ""Off with her head!"" before learning whether the accused is guilty. ""Sentence first - verdict afterwards,"" she declares.
\
It's fitting that a federal appeals court last week cited the example of the capricious queen when it ruled that the Bush administration's Environmental Protection Agency violated the law by adopting rules allowing power plants to evade the Clean Air Act by exceeding limits on mercury emissions.
\
Saying the EPA had followed its own industry friendly desires and ignored the ""plain text"" of the law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit tossed out the EPA's cap-and-trade approach to limiting mercury emitted from power-plant smokestacks.
\
The administration's approach to mercury emissions was an extraordinary example of regulatory capitulation to industrial polluters. Under the EPA's trading scheme, flagrant polluters could avoid reducing mercury emissions by purchasing credits from cleaner power plants hundreds of miles away. For obvious economic reasons, coal-burning utilities favored this approach over traditional ""command and control"" alternatives that require polluters to invest in equipment that captures mercury before it is released from smokestacks.
\
Administration officials defended the cap-and-trade approach by noting that it has been effective in reducing some types of pollution such as acid rain. True enough. But it's a horribly ineffective strategy for dealing with mercury, which tends to concentrate in narrowly contained ""hot spots."" Under the administration's plan, mercury levels would, in fact, eventually decrease nationwide. But many areas would become steeped in mercury contamination as major polluters happily bought credits from distant plants rather than making the investments in new technology.
\
The appeals court found that the EPA ignored the ""plain text"" of the Clean Air Act when it scrapped a mercury-control policy established in 2000 under the Clinton administration. That policy, which required utilities to install the best-available technology to capture mercury from power pant smokestacks, would have eventually captured more than 90 percent of mercury releases. By contrast, the administration's cap-and-trade approach would have captured only 70 percent.
\
The Bush administration should not waste any more taxpayer dollars - or further endanger public health - by appealing this decision or devising a new cap-and-trade variation. Instead, it should move swiftly to put in place a straightforward command-and- control mercury emissions policy that fully complies with the Clean Air Act.
\
Failure to do so would put the interests of the utility industry above those of children and pregnant women. Scientists say 8 percent of U.S. women of childbearing age have enough mercury, a virulent neurotoxin, in their blood to cause serious developmental problems in their childrens' brains.
\
The ruling was the latest in a series of richly deserved court rebukes to the administration's efforts to repeal, roll back and generally ignore settled environmental law. They include the Supreme Court's ruling last year that the EPA should regulate greenhouse gases in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
\
The verdict is in, whether the Queen of Hearts likes it or not. It's time for the EPA to live up to its name by actually protecting the environment.

26,"From the news in the media, it appears the proposed ""cap and trade"" bill before the Oregon Legislature, along with the opposition to a natural gas pipeline, are somewhat of a ""smoke screen"" to cover up the increase in passenger vehicles.\With much of the infrastructure dependent on personal motor vehicle use, the polluting passenger car has become a sacred cow. Never mind that most of air pollution is caused by cars. Most of the water pollution is caused by automobile residue that settles on roads before it is washed by rains into streams and eventually out to sea.\It's ironic that ""natural gas"" is censored when it burns cleaner than petroleum-based fuels.\There is a forecast of a large increase in the population for the Salem area. Along with this comes more cars and more population. Many of these persons are moving away from places like California that are swamped with cars. As a ""sanctuary state,"" more persons are attracted to move here.\For the future health of our area, we should encourage cleaner fuels that will decrease the overall carbon footprint on the sensitive lands and water resources of the Far West.\Pete Dane\Salem\I strongly support responsible citizen activism and free speech in its myriad forms. Nonetheless, I was disappointed in Timber Unity's decision to send some 1,000 logging trucks to the Oregon State Capitol to demonstrate against greenhouse gas emissions Cap and Trade legislation.\The trucks traveled long distances, using significant quantities of fossil fuels — one gallon of gasoline produces approximately 19.6 pounds of CO2; one gallon of diesel fuel approximately 22.38 pounds.\That caravan represented an astonishing dismissal of the issue at hand — a balance of economic and environmental concerns.\Yet the parade of trucks is not why I write. I write because Oregon and our nation must become global leaders in actions to address global warming. Cap and trade legislation will encourage industry innovation responsive to this global climate crisis; it should not be an industry-specific or partisan issue. The health of our planet is critical to the health of present and future generations; that must take priority.\Climate matters. Courage matters. It is time to ""speak science"" to guard the environment, it is not time to guard a political party.\Sheryl W. Dawson\Salem\I'm convinced that Republicans at virtually all local, state and federal government levels are a bunch of whiny, belly-aching, self-indulgent, ego-driven hypocrites.\For example, the Statesman Journal on Feb. 4 (""New session, same issue,"" page 1A) quotes state Rep. Jack Zika regarding proposed Cap and Trade legislation: ""When one side dominates and has no reverence for compromise or even open to other viewpoints, the policy that is formed is flawed and biased.""\So says a member of the party which wrote the federal 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act in private, failed to hold any public hearings with expert testimony, did not consider or accept any amendments from Democrats and lied about it paying for itself with increased revenues and economic growth. So much for reverence or compromise.\The hypocrisy of these two examples stinks. My proposed solution is to give the conservative Republican 2nd Congressional District to Idaho or Nevada or whoever else will take them and their claptrap nonsense.\The rest of us won't have to listen to their complaining or watch them threaten to hold the Legislature hostage over quorum issues and we would probably save some good money by not having to subsidize such nonsense.\Stuart Hirsh\Salem\After reading the Statesman Journal article ""No charges over injuries at academy,"" (Feb. 2, page 1C) I felt angry and sick.\The Marion County District Attorney's and Salem Police detectives' lack of due diligence and the rushed investigation show a callused disregard for uncovering what really happened.\More investigation is needed.\This is what angers the public and gives honest, hard-working officers a bad overall reputation. And the three involved are going to be on the streets protecting and serving us? I hope none settle in Salem.\I wonder if those involved would have behaved this egregiously if the recruit almost mortally wounded were their brother?\Laney Furr\Salem\I don't think we should kick homeless people off public property, but I can also understand why shopkeepers would want them not to be there.\If we kick homeless people off of public property, where are they going to go to the bathroom?\If they don't have anywhere to go, they will just keep coming back. We need a designated area for homeless people to ""live."" I know that this might cost a lot of money.\Put yourself in their shoes — not being able to go to the bathroom, everyone looking at you weird, not being valued in society.\Grace Parry\Salem\I take this momentous moment, a la the president's youthful euphoria over his botched impeachment trial, to recall the conscientious self-reflexivity of two Kings: Zhu Youjian (1627-44) of Ming China and Louis XIV (1643-1715) of Bourbon France.\The disgraced Ming monarch confessed prior to committing suicide: ""I die... dejected and ashamed. May the rebels dismember my corpse and slaughter my officials, but let them not... harm a single one of our people.""\His younger contemporary, the Grand Monarch of France, advised his great-grandson (the future Louis XV) just before death: ""Dear child ... never forget the duty you owe to God. Try to remain at peace with your neighbors ... Lighten your people's burden as soon as possible, and do what I have had the misfortune not to do myself.""\How do these two early modern royals compare with the behavior and boasts of the most powerful democratic ruler of postmodern America?\Narasingha P. Sil\Salem"
27,"It's one thing to talk about expensive and unworkable proposals such as the ""Green New Deal"" in the abstract.\It's quite another to be on the ground, where these pie-in-the-sky plans threaten jobs, budgets, and the environment itself.\That's why I was in Oregon this week with President Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara, meeting with loggers, truckers, and other rural Oregonians whose livelihoods are under assault from the Democrat-led state government's rush to adopt feel-good ""green"" nonsense.\Timber Unity is a rare grassroots success story in an era where American politics is increasingly dominated by multinational corporations and coastal elites. By banding together, these loggers and truckers were able to pressure the Oregon Legislature to drop a disastrous ""cap-and-trade"" bill — even if they did have to drive hundreds of log trucks into Salem a few times to let lawmakers know how serious they were.\From the vantage point of faculty lounges, corporate boardrooms, and legislative offices, paying ridiculous prices to reduce carbon emissions by minuscule amounts might seem sensible. If it's your livelihood that would be devastated by high fuel prices and restrictive regulations, however, such schemes appear downright nefarious.\The issue is not whether protecting the environment is important — both sides agree that it is. The point is that liberals' obsession with passing laws designed to win approval from the green lobby does not justify impoverishing people who are just trying to provide for their families.\That's exactly what was happening here in Oregon.\The biggest corporations — those with the resources to withstand regulations that would put smaller companies out of business — joined forces with the green movement to support bills that would squash the little guys.\Supporters of HB 2020, the ""cap-and-trade"" bill, admit it would hardly make a dent in global climate change. HB 2656 would have closed off big portions of timberland — supposedly to preserve clean water, despite no evidence of polluted drinking water.\I'm proud to stand with Timber Unity and celebrate their defeat of both bills. The Trump 2020 campaign takes great pride in the President's legacy of doing things differently from establishment politicians. In this context, that means addressing issues such as water quality and forestry management head-on without harming rural blue-collar workers.\Last year, President Trump signed an executive order to protect watersheds and encourage logging in areas where better forest management can prevent the wildfires that are devastating the American West.\I look forward to working with groups like Timber Unity to come up with new and innovative ways to clean up the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while still growing the economy and preserving traditional ways of life.\Standing here on the ground, where environmental fantasy meets reality, I'm proud to be able to say that the president puts the livelihoods of rural Americans over the feelings of coastal liberals with an environmental policy that achieves the goal of ecological conservation without harming hard-working Americans who are just trying to provide for their families.\Brad Parscale is the campaign manager for Donald J.

28,"Electricity produced by burning garbage at the Covanta Marion incinerator would be considered renewable energy under a bill in the Oregon Legislature.\Senate Bill 451 would allow the Brooks incinerator to be certified under Oregon's Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires 50 percent of the electricity Oregonians use to come from renewable sources by 2040.\That means the incinerator could earn credits for producing renewable energy, which it could then sell to other energy companies needing to offset fossil fuel production.\The bill clarifies the intent of 2016 legislation, which should have included Covanta as eligible for the state program, Covanta spokesman James Regan said.\Regan said he couldn't estimate the value of the credits.\But opponents are gearing up for a fight, saying the garbage, much of which is plastic, is not a renewable resource.\""In no sense is Covanta Marion either clean or renewable,"" leaders of the climate action group 350 Salem wrote to lawmakers.\A coalition of 10 health and environment groups also is protesting legislators' decision to exempt Covanta Marion from pending cap-and-trade legislation, which would make the state's largest polluters pay for their greenhouse gas emissions.\Opponents say Covanta is pushing now for inclusion in the decade-old Renewable Portfolio Standard to ensure the garbage burner won't ever be included in the proposed cap-and-trade program.\Regan said the company requested the bill this year because officials only recently discovered conflicting language in the statute. He said the efforts are not related.\""They're different bills,"" he said.\Sen. Lee Beyer, D-Springfield, is sponsoring SB 451 at Covanta's request. He did not respond to an interview request.\The bill is set for a public hearing at 1 p.m. Tuesday in Hearing Room C at the Capitol.\Covanta Marion, Oregon's only garbage incinerator, has operated in Brooks since 1986. It's a subsidiary of New Jersey-based Covanta Energy Corp. and burns about 550 tons of municipal waste per day, generating up to 13.1 megawatts of energy.\The facility is Oregon's 20th largest emitter of carbon dioxide, according to the state Department of Environmental Quality.\It emitted 160,843 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2017.\About half that amount is anthropogenic emissions, from burning man-made materials such as plastic, much of it out-of-state medical waste.\""We're bringing in other people's waste to burn and pollute the skies of Oregon,"" said Lisa Arkin, executive director of Eugene-based environmental group Beyond Toxics. ""We need to be reducing our use of throwaway plastics, certainly not burning them.""\Regan said garbage incinerators generate less greenhouse gases than landfills, even those that use technology to capture methane.\Incinerators should be treated the same as landfills that capture methane, which also are exempt from the cap-and-trade proposal, Regan said.\Covanta made $30,000 in campaign contributions to lawmakers during 2018, more than it contributed over the previous five years combined.\But the individual amounts were relatively small. The largest amount, $2,500, went to Gov. Kate Brown.

31,"A bill that would cap greenhouse gas emissions in the state still needs plenty of work as it moves through the legislative process, according to advocates from fields that would be impacted by any action the Oregon Legislature takes to combat climate change.\""I'm still waiting to hear from someone to say this is perfect just as it is,"" Sen. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, joked near the end of a three-hour meeting of the Senate Interim Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.\Monday's hearing of was the first opportunity to comment publicly on Legislative Concept 19, which would place gradually declining limits on statewide emissions and create a marketplace for polluters to buy credits, or allowances, for each ton of emissions they release annually.\The major target of the program is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035, and 80 percent below by 2050.\It has the same framework as House Bill 2020 from the 2019 Oregon legislative session, which passed the House of Representatives but died in the Senate after sparking public protests and a nine-day Senate Republican walkout.\The 2020 session starts Feb. 3 and will last for a maximum of 35 days. The greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill is the biggest policy change that lawmakers will consider this session.\LC 19, which was released Friday, has yet to earn the support of any Republicans.\Special interest groups — from environmentalists, to union representatives, to trucking advocates — also have concerns, while also praising lawmakers for the changes made since the end of the 2019 session.\Waylon Buchan, representing the Oregon Trucking Association and other transportation stakeholders, said the state's Highway Fund already is experiencing pressures that LC 19 could exacerbate.\Much of the fund is generated from taxes on motor fuels, and as consumers gravitate toward more efficient vehicles, those tax revenues decrease.\Part of the cap-and-trade program is expected to increase gas prices for consumers.\However, Buchan said that the program doesn't raise enough revenue to adequately incentivize people toward electric, zero-emission vehicles, but gas prices might move high enough that people might purchase less gas and be more efficient, further impacting the Highway Fund.\""Without further study, without further analysis, without meaningful incentives, the cap-and-trade program appears, from the transportation stakeholder sector, to be all pain and no gain,"" he said.\Buchan advocated for more significant incentives for consumers to purchase electric vehicles beyond the price signal of rising fuel prices.\Meredith Connolly, Oregon director of non-profit Climate Solutions, called LC 19 an ""over-correction"" to concerns raised about HB 2020 that might not secure the benefits of climate change legislation that other states have seen.\She identified three areas where improvement was required: oil companies need to pay their fair share regardless of where their product is sold; polluters need to be held accountable for their pollution; and investments must be guaranteed to areas most impacted by climate change.\""Please don't underestimate the urgency and the importance of what you're doing today,"" Connolly said.\Martha Sonato, political director of farmworker union PCUN, said LC 19 was better than other proposals and approved of several additions to the bill including labor standards, a definition of impacted communities and a methodology for designating impacted communities.\But she raised concerns about investments, saying that there needs to be more certainty that investments are sent toward impacted communities. Such investments should include job creation, training and infrastructure, such as grants for building retrofits and farm worker housing.\""By investing in resilience, we are increasing the well-being of all of our communities, and especially our children,"" Sonato said.\Contact reporter Connor Radnovich at cradnovich@statesmanjournal.com or 503-399-6864, or follow him on Twitter at @CDRadnovich\CREDIT: Connor Radnovich"

33,"Statesman Journal\Oregon is poised to be a national leader in renewable energy and responder to climate change if the legislature acts on a series of biofuel, tax credit and renewable energy proposals this session, program proponents said Wednesday.\In addition to his five energy legislative proposals, Gov. Ted Kulongoski is backing a proposal that would force utilities to increase energy efficiency, increase their reliance on renewable energy and limit greenhouse gas emissions.\He said he would work with other Western states to discuss a regional program called cap-and-trade, but an initial program just within Oregon also is viable, said David Stewart-Smith, the chairman of the governor's task force on this program.\Stewart-Smith made his formal recommendation to the governor as part of a discussion on the next steps the state should take to address global warming and move toward energy independence.\Stewart-Smith said the program would reduce the average cost to utility customers, but only if energy conservation measures were also adopted.\The cap-and-trade program is only one piece of the governor's plan to reduce greenhouse gases within the state -- which would help halt, or even reverse, the global warming trend.\Among the state's goals are:\*By 2010, arrest growth of greenhouse gas emissions.\*By 2020, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels.\*By 2050, reduce greenhouse gases to 75 percent below 1990 levels.\Oregon State University professor Jane Lubchenco, who was chairwoman of the governor's advisory group on global warming, said that it is urgent that global-warming policies are enacted now. She said that conclusive evidence shows that climate change is real and it's happening even faster and with more detrimental consequences than originally predicted.\Lubchenco said that Oregon's leadership -- in concert with actions in California and other states -- could force federal dialogue on global-warming policies.\""If we enact our priorities this session, we will create a sustainable economy and a sustainable environment for future generations,"" Kulongoski said. ""We can't wait any longer.""\""Global-warming pollution takes awhile to have an effect on temperature, and temperature takes awhile to have an effect on snow levels and the sea,"" said Jeremiah Baumann of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group. ""Even if we could stop all global-warming pollution now, the Earth would continue to warm. It's good news for the country -- and the planet really -- that Oregon is ready to take a leadership role.""\Just an hour after the governor's remarks on climate change, the House Committee on Energy and the Environment began hearings on biofuels legislation. The package of proposals includes a requirement that biodiesel and ethanol are ingredients of fuels sold in Oregon, expansion of property tax incentives for biofuel production facilities and creation of an income tax incentive for consumer use of biofuel.\The biofuels package is one of the pieces of the governor's climate change initiative, but it also is touted as a key to economic development and energy independence for Oregon.\It's the third legislative session for some of these proposals.\Jeff Kropf, a former Republican legislator and grass seed farmer from Sublimity, testified in front of the committee Tuesday. He proposed similar legislation last session with Rep. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Portland, who supports the biofuels package this year.\Kropf said that promoting the biofuel industry in Oregon is also good for air quality. Burning biodiesel instead of regular diesel reduces particulates in the air, and both biodiesel and ethanol reduce carbon emissions, said Andrew Ginsburg of the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.\bcasper@StatesmanJournal.com or (503) 589-6994\Governor's legislative proposals\Senate Bill 232: Authorizes state agencies to develop renewable energy on state forests, campuses and other state lands.

The Republican Party has a long tradition of environmental stewardship - but today's GOP is turning its back on that proud legacy.
\
It was Teddy Roosevelt who established the national park system, Richard Nixon who created the Environmental Protection Agency and supported the Clean Air Act, Ronald Reagan who championed the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer and George H.W. Bush who embraced the cap-and-trade program that reduced acid rain.
\
In recent years, Republicans have done an about-face, staking out the wrongheaded position that protecting the environment conflicts with conservatism, damages the economy and costs jobs. Denying climate change, increasing U.S. reliance on fossil fuels and rolling back bedrock environmental regulations have become litmus tests for Republican lawmakers and for anyone seeking the party's presidential nomination.
\
Nowhere has this Republican transformation been more evident than in Congress. GOP lawmakers are trying to cut a broad swath through environmental regulations, including clean air and water protections stretching back to the Nixon presidency. Tea party Republicans, many of whom ran for office promising to eviscerate the EPA, are leading the charge, heedless of opinion polls that show a majority of Americans still want clean air and water, and support regulations to achieve those goals.
\
On Wednesday, Senate Democrats, backed by a presidential veto threat, defeated a Republican bid to block the EPA from setting the first federal standards to reduce toxic air pollution from power plants. The GOP measure would have overturned a long-overdue regulation to reduce mercury and other toxic emissions from the oldest and most polluting coal- and oil-fired power plants.
\
Never mind that the new regulation will profoundly benefit the health of Americans. Never mind that mercury is a known and notorious neurotoxin that is especially dangerous to young children and developing fetuses. And never mind that the EPA has estimated that enforcement of the new rules will save the country an estimated $100 billion a year by preventing premature deaths, birth defects, lung disease and asthma.
\
On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled House passed legislation that would allow the U.S. Border Patrol to circumvent more than a dozen environmental laws on all federally managed lands within 100 miles of the borders with Mexico and Canada. The bill also would allow increased logging along the Tongass River in Alaska, transferring control of more than 65,000 acres of centuries-old trees in the Tongass National Forest, the nation's largest national forest, to a private corporation.
\
The House measure has little chance in the Senate, but the Republicans have vowed to double down on their efforts to repeal ""job-killing"" environmental rules and protections.
\
Republicans should pause to reflect before further tarnishing their party's legacy of environmental stewardship and consider whether Americans really want to eliminate rules that help clean the air and water, reduce pollution, protect centuries-old forests and safeguard environmentally sensitive border areas.

As the effects of climate change come into sharper focus, we must decide what our course of action will be in the altered physical environment and carbon-constrained economy of the future. Will our community thrive, merely survive, or will we let this chance for action pass by? Seizing the opportunities posed by this crisis requires a two-pronged response from government, public agencies, businesses, organizations and individuals:
\
Prevention, to slow and gradually reverse greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Preparation, for the environmental and regulatory changes that can no longer be prevented.
\
While national cap-and-trade legislation will produce some emissions reductions, such a top-down approach will be slow to take effect and will create relative winners and losers among those bearing the burden of reducing carbon emissions, which is why we feel there has to be local involvement.
\
Thankfully, we all have a chance to participate in a local process to address these critical issues.
\
The city of Eugene, along with community and agency partners, is leading the development of a Community Climate and Energy Action Plan and seeking public participation during a community kickoff at the end of this month.
\
A key aim of the plan will be to reduce total current communitywide fossil fuel consumption by 50 percent by 2030. The plan will set forth strategies to meet this goal and identify targets along the way to help us measure progress.
\
Aside from regulatory changes in the pipeline, the Willamette Valley faces significant physical effects that demand strategic preparation to ensure: 1) sufficient water supply for drinking, agriculture, power generation, residential needs and wildlife, despite declining snowpack and changes in precipitation patterns; 2) a food system resilient to shocks to the distribution systems from storm events or high transportation fuel costs; 3) social service and public safety delivery systems that can respond to migration, disease and natural disasters; and 4) housing and shelter adapted for new climate conditions and energy sources.
\
If our community is not prepared for physical changes in all sectors, cultural and social cohesion is at risk. The duty to invest in our future through prevention and preparation belongs not to a single entity, but rather to individuals, organizations, leadership and our community as a whole.
\
The city of Eugene has convened a planning process to set forth its comprehensive Community Climate Energy Action Plan. The aim is to set fossil fuel reduction targets adopted by the Eugene City Council, along with specific measures to meet those goals. Environmental stewardship aside, this type of comprehensive policy planning is essential to ensure our community adapts to adverse physical changes in the environment, and thrives in an altered economy that no longer subsidizes greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The action plan can help government develop infrastructure based on tomorrow's assumptions, not the specifications and design standards of the past. Government can also support emission reductions and increased resilience by providing incentives to companies positioning themselves for tomorrow, rather than to those hanging on to old paradigms based on a perception that resources are infinite.
\
A plan can help businesses embrace a more nuanced view of risks of ""carbon prices"" by looking at their whole value chain and forecasting where businesses' biggest opportunities and liabilities lie. A plan can address businesses' financial and regulatory concerns, as well as those driven by customers' expectations.
\
A plan can assist individuals in identifying ways to promote their well being while reducing their carbon footprint. This includes using alternative modes of transportation, which saves households money and in some cases improves health.
\
It can also include energy saving measures such as adding insulation or even simple no-cost solutions such as turning off lights and turning down thermostats. Individuals can also raise the issue at workplaces, community group meetings or other areas in which they have influence.
\
Investments and other measures to reduce carbon emissions, along with prudent planning for the inevitable effects of climate change, are no longer just virtuous options. They are the only way we can ensure that our area is just as great a place to live, work and play in this century as it was in the last.
\
An energy action plan cannot be created in a vacuum. It needs involved citizens to participate in the process and provide information.
\
We invite the citizens of Eugene, Springfield and Lane County to learn more and share their views at the upcoming Community Climate and Energy Action Plan kickoff at North Eugene High School at 9 a.m. Saturday. For more information, go to www .sustaineugene.com/eugeneclimate.

36,"Oregon would adopt one of the country's most ambitious timelines for eliminating carbon dioxide emissions from its power grid under a major bill advocates believe will pass the Legislature this year.\House Bill 2021 – a product of intensive negotiations between the state's largest utilities, environmental justice groups, renewable energy boosters and more – advanced out of one House committee last week. It must now navigate the state budgeting process before final votes in the House and Senate.\In a legislative session when police reform, COVID-19 assistance, racial equity and wildfire relief have been at the forefront, HB 2021 could be among the most impactful bills lawmakers will decide.\The bill sets a timetable by which Oregon's two major power companies, Portland General Electric and Pacific Power, must eliminate emissions associated with the electricity they provide. Five ""electricity service suppliers"" in the state also would face regulation, though their emissions are tiny compared to the big utilities.\HB 2021's central thrust isn't groundbreaking by today's standards. At least 17 other states and the District of Columbia have already adopted similar goals, according to the Clean Energy States Alliance.\But advocates say Oregon's plan stands out in both approach and timeline. The bill requires PGE and Pacific Power to submit plans to reduce emissions by 80% from a baseline amount by 2030, 90% by 2035 and completely eliminate emissions by 2040.\That end date is notably ambitious. It's a nearer deadline than nearly every other state that has adopted a clean power plan, including Washington and California.\Oregon would measure its progress in an atypical way, too. Most states have opted to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions by requiring utilities to gradually increase the amount of power they get from renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Oregon, which already has had such a ""renewable portfolio standard"" since 2007, is taking a more straightforward approach: requiring PGE and Pacific Power to reduce their overall carbon emissions, which are tracked by the state's Department of Environmental Quality.\""What we're doing is harder, but I think it's more honest,"" said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, which advocates on behalf of utility customers and supports the bill.\By targeting emissions, Jenks and others say, Oregon can focus on more than just ramping up its use of renewables. It can also place a premium on helping the state use power in a smarter, more efficient manner.\""It's going to lead to a lot of renewable energy development; it's going to lead to a lot of efficiency development,"" said Jeff Bissonnette, a consultant with the Northwest Energy Coalition, which also backs the bill. ""We're really asking utilities to change the way they do business. That's a big deal.""\Jumping together\Advocates of clean electricity have been talking about decarbonizing Oregon's power grid for years.\In 2015, Stanford University researchers laid out a roadmap for what switching to 100% clean energy might look like in each state by 2050. A proposed ballot measure for 2020, ultimately abandoned, would have forced Oregon power providers to transfer to clean power by 2045. And President Joe Biden campaigned on a proposal to switch to 100% clean power as a nation by 2035, though that proposal's chances of clearing Congress are unclear.\With HB 2021, Oregon appears to be on the verge of setting its own ambitious goal in stone.\The bill got its start last summer, months after Republicans cut the 2020 legislative session short with a walkout over Democrats' sweeping proposal to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions with a cap-and-trade system.\HB 2021's origins, backers say, lie in a listening tour a coalition called the Oregon Just Transition Alliance held in cities around the state as it worked to develop an Oregon version of the ""Green New Deal.""\""What we heard from communities is our energy policy is not serving our frontline communities and is not meeting our climate goals,"" said state Rep. Khanh Pham, D-Portland, who at the time of the listening tour served as interim director of the OJTA.\Pham and the environmental justice groups that form the alliance emerged from the tour with ideas for how Oregon might decarbonize its energy grid, create jobs and ensure that people disproportionately impacted by climate change were not left behind. Soon, OJTA members were talking with utilities, labor organizations, renewable energy developers, lawmakers and more.\What has emerged nearly a year later is a climate bill that supporters say has buy-in from an uncommonly broad coalition. Pham, who was sworn in to the Oregon House in January, is a chief sponsor of HB 2021, alongside Rep. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland, chair of the House Energy and Environment Committee.\Though the bill's centerpiece is cleaning up Oregon's power grid, it contains a lot more. HB 2021 also:\bans expansion or new construction of power plants that burn natural gas or other fossil fuels\sets strong labor standards for any large-scale renewable energy projects built in the state\includes $50 million in grants for community renewable energy projects in cities other than Portland, which has its own fund for such projects\allows cities in Oregon to create so-called ""green tariffs,"" where they agree to pay utilities more money for power from a cleaner mix of sources in order to meet their own climate goals\requires power companies to consider input from low-income ratepayers, environmental justice communities, federally recognized tribes and others as they develop strategies for reducing emissions.\While all of those provisions – hashed out over months of sometimes-tense discussions – have given HB 2021 a solid support base, a big reason the bill seems to have a shot at passing this year lies in something else: a lack of organized opposition.\Unlike the ambitious cap-and-trade proposal that would have ratcheted down emissions throughout the economy, and developed many enemies as a result, HB 2021 touches far fewer entities. And many support the bill.\""We feel optimistic enough that we can get [to zero emissions] that we were willing to move forward to support this,"" said Sunny Radcliffe, director of governmental affairs and energy policy at PGE, the state's largest electric utility.\PGE already has a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2030, but to date has only set an ""aspirational"" target of eliminating emissions entirely by 2040. That's because of a sticking point common to clean energy requirements: No one's entirely sure how utilities will eliminate the final 10% or 20% of their emissions, the fossil fuel-generated power that can help ensure lights remain on when sun isn't shining and wind isn't blowing.\""There is a lack of clarity for how we as an industry are going to get the last bits out,"" Radcliffe said. ""I don't know anybody in our industry who knows how to get to zero with the technology we have today.""\Boosters for clean energy targets point out that renewable energy has become far cheaper as technology improves, and they expect that trend to continue. As Radcliffe put it: ""As an industry focuses on an outcome, [research and development] tend to follow.""\Pacific Power, the provider responsible for the largest single share of the state's emissions from electricity use, also supports the bill, as do electricity service suppliers that sell power directly to large industrial and commercial customers in the state.\""I think the whole industry is kind of holding hands and jumping together here,"" said Spencer Gray, executive director of the Northwest & Intermountain Power Providers Coalition, a trade group that represents the state's five active electricity service suppliers.\Gray and others say HB 2021 takes a reasonable-yet-ambitious approach to decarbonizing, and offers power companies a range of options for reaching state goals. But they're also relying on two caveats embedded in the bill as insurance.\One is a so-called ""cost cap"" that says utilities can be temporarily exempted from the regulations in instances where the rates for customers would rise more than 6% in a year, compared with other options. The other is the option for a ""reliability pause"" – that is, an exemption when the regulations could hamper a utility's ability to provide reliable power.\The utilities view these provisions as necessary assurance customers won't be overburdened by rising rates or left in the dark. Environmental justice advocates and others pushing the bill, say they're logical concessions that likely won't be necessary. Similar safeguards built into the state's 14-year-old renewable portfolio standard have never been invoked.\""We are all acutely aware that that's such an important piece to have in all of this: you have to keep the lights on for everybody,"" said Damon Motz-Storey, who tackles climate issues for the group Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility, and helped negotiate HB 2021. ""If that means increasing your emissions for a little bit, then fine. But you have to submit a plan for getting back on track.""\Clear path to passage?\The lack of outspoken opposition to HB 2021 comes with a tradeoff: Even if successful, the proposal only addresses a segment of the state's carbon dioxide output.\According to DEQ, emissions from electricity accounted for 30% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. The entities regulated under HB 2021 are responsible for the vast majority of that, but some providers are left untouched.\Several dozen small consumer-owned utilities around the state are not impacted by the bill. Nor is Idaho Power, the state's smallest investor-owned utility, which was removed from HB 2021 after pressing for an exemption and touting its own decarbonization goals.\The state's largest source of carbon dioxide emissions, according to DEQ, are cars, trucks and other forms of transportation, which were responsible for 36% of emissions in 2019. They would not be regulated under the bill, though Gov. Kate Brown last year took executive action aimed in part at curbing transportation pollution. Lawmakers this year have also passed a bill requiring PGE and Pacific Power to invest an estimated $8 million to $10 million a year in helping Oregon drivers switch to electric vehicles.\While HB 2021 hasn't spurred the big political rallies that Democrats' cap-and-trade proposal drew in 2019 and 2020, the bill does have opponents. Nearly every Republican lawmaker who's had a chance to vote on the bill this year has found reasons to vote ""no.""\Perhaps the most outspoken opponent to date is state Rep. David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, who's been a mainstay in the Legislature's discussions over reducing emissions in recent years.\Smith's objections to the bill are legion. He believes HB 2021's development was rushed, lacked transparency, and left out the input of critics like him who might have made it better.\He also favors a separate strategy for ramping up clean energy by increasing the amount of electricity utilities are required to source from renewable projects over time, an approach that resembles the strategy other states have adopted. Smith insists that by using this approach, and ensuring a certain percentage of renewable energy is sourced from Oregon, the state would see a rush of jobs in rural districts like his.\""I believe there are no green energy jobs associated with this legislation,"" he told OPB.\A bill that would have instituted a strategy Smith agrees with, House Bill 3180, was ultimately scrapped in favor of HB 2021.\""It's a travesty that we could have had a transparent process on bipartisan and bicameral legislation,"" he said. Instead ""we have a bill that will be a party-line bill. I hope it dies under its own weight.""\Proponents of HB 2021 argue it will lead to plenty of investment in the state even without explicit requirements – including, potentially, new offshore wind energy projects in Smith's district. But the bill's final major hurdle may be the money it guarantees for new projects.\Because it includes $50 million for cities to create their own renewable energy projects, HB 2021 is currently sitting in the Legislature's Ways and Means Committee, which is already running behind in its central duty of passing out agency budgets this year. Senate Republicans' ongoing insistence that bills be read in full before passage could slow the bill's path to passage even more.\""Everybody's eyes are on the clock,"" said Radcliffe, the PGE lobbyist.\Still, HB 2021 has a lot working in its favor, including a jaw-dropping recent revenue forecast that should ensure the $50 million it requires is readily available, and enthusiastic support from House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, whose office says the bill ranks among her top priorities this session.\Everyone OPB interviewed for this story suggested the bill is likely to pass this year, marking a significant milestone in Oregon's energy policy – even if it's one other states got to first.\""Our energy systems are going to have to evolve with climate change,"" said Jenks, of the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board. ""Scientists are telling us we must do that as a society. So the question is: How do we do it?"""
37,"After a decade in the Oregon Legislature, Democratic state Sen. Chris Edwards of Eugene is leaving office to take an administrative position at the University of Oregon, where he will work on the proposed Phil and Penny Knight scientific campus.\Edwards, 43, submitted his letter of resignation on Tuesday, effective Dec. 31. He has represented Senate District 7, which includes much of Eugene and Junction City, since 2009. The former general manager of his family’s small timber business served in the Oregon House from 2006 to 2009.\Edwards will start work as the UO’s assistant vice president for strategic initiatives on Dec. 15. His first major project will be coordinating the new science complex project across Franklin Boulevard from the main campus, underwritten by a $500 million pledged donation from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny.\The Knights’ donation must be matched by $500 million in state funding and private donations during the next 10 years to reach the $1 billion needed for the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact.\By law, Edwards must be replaced by a fellow Democrat, who will finish the last two years of his elected term. Edwards last won re-election in 2014.\The Democratic Party of Lane County has 20 days to submit a list of three to five potential candidates. The Lane County Board of Commissioners, which has a conservative majority, then will have 10 days to pick from that list of names. That should allow Edwards’ replacement to be in place for the start of the 2017 legislative session on Jan. 7.\Edwards’ abrupt resignation could serve as a political revival for Val Hoyle, a Democratic state representative and House majority leader who gave up her seat to run, unsuccessfully, for secretary of state earlier this year.\Hoyle said Tuesday that she will be submitting her name for consideration for Edwards’ seat. Also Tuesday, Gary Crum, a retired Junction City teacher and counselor, said he would seek the post. No other candidates have yet stepped forward, said Chris Wig, the Lane County Democratic Party chairman.\Edwards will receive an annual salary of $150,000 at the UO. He made $23,568 a year as a state senator, plus $140 per day when the Legislature was in session.\Edwards said in an interview that he’s “proud of the work” he’s done in the Legislature and will have “fond feelings and reflections” on his time there.\The Knight science complex “is going to be a game-changer to shape the future of Eugene and the Willamette Valley,” he said.\Michael Andreasen, the UO’s vice president for advancement, said in a prepared statement that Edwards “has a unique set of public service and private industry experiences that will serve him well in this new endeavor.”\Using his experience as a state lawmaker, Edwards will work with local government officials and business people to help make the Knight campus a reality, the UO said. “I am delighted that he will be joining us during this critical early stage in the development of the Knight campus,” Andreasen said.\Edwards earned a reputation as a moderate Democrat and a dealmaker in the Senate. In 2013, he voted with Republicans to kill a Democrat-backed K-12 public schools budget, in a successful effort to force Democrats to keep negotiating on a package of public employee pensions cuts and tax increases.\In his early days as a legislator, Edwards worked on such issues as protecting the rights of manufactured homeowners and limiting forcible annexations by cities. In late 2014, he was appointed as chairman of the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee, making him a key player on debates about restricting aerial pesticide spraying on timberlands and environmental protections for wolves in Eastern Oregon.\Edwards also was the leading proponent of a carbon cap-and-trade bill for Oregon during the past two years, but the policy failed to advance. He was one of several local lawmakers who strongly advocated for a tax increase on hotel stays this year to pave the way for a $25 million state subsidy for the 2021 World Track and Field Championships in Eugene. That tax increase was a priority for the University of Oregon and Phil Knight.\“Chris Edwards has served his constituents and the state of Oregon with integrity and honor,” Senate Majority Leader Ginny Burdick, a Portland Democrat, said in a prepared statement. “He is a pragmatic leader with a keen ability to bring together differing interests to create compromises that work in the best interest of all parties.”\Hoyle, 52, said she feels she is the “most qualified” person to replace Edwards, given her seven years in the Legislature and three years as House majority leader.\“This is not going to be an easy cycle with the budget hole we’re facing,” she said of the Legislature. Having represented half of Edwards’ district for years, “I know that I have the support of the people of the district.”\Crum, 74, said he would provide an alternative to Hoyle, because he only wants the seat for two years to finish out Edwards’ term. That would allow for an open primary among Democrats in 2018, with no one holding the advantage of incumbency, he said.\“I’m not a big fan of insiders,” Crum said. “We do need fresh ideas, and they usually only come from new people.”\In an odd instance of local political dé jÃ vu, Hoyle and Crum were among the candidates to fill Edwards’ house seat in 2009, when he moved to the Senate. Hoyle unanimously won that appointment from the Lane County Board of Commissioners.\Follow Saul on Twitter @SaulAHubbard . Email saul.hubbard@registerguard.com ."

Bush proposes yet another global warming study
\
In a move that gives new meaning to the phrase ""political science,"" President Bush has released a new global warming initiative that calls for a 10-year study to find out what scientists, and most Americans, already know - that emissions of greenhouse gases are a primary cause of global warming.
\
Bush is seeking slow-track answers on global warming because he doesn't like the answers he's already gotten from two other studies produced for - and by - his administration.
\
A quick review may be helpful:
\
As a candidate, Bush promised to limit the industrial production of carbon dioxide, the No. 1 greenhouse gas. Then he backed out of the Kyoto protocol after taking office, denouncing its CO2 limits as ""flawed, unfair and economically unsound.""
\
The president defended his position by expressing newfound doubts about the validity of the science underlying the theory that emissions from smokestacks and tailpipes are heating the atmosphere.
\
Those doubts conveniently ignored a strong consensus among the world's top scientists that accelerated warming could have severe ecological effects, including rising sea levels and shifting weather patterns that threaten to disrupt agriculture and to disturb wildlife migration and habitat.
\
Bush asked for a new global warming study from the prestigious National Academy of Scientists. It concluded that industrial greenhouse gases are accumulating in the earth's atmosphere as a direct result of human activities, and that the heat-trapping gases could cause temperatures to rise by more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit before the end of the century.
\
Next, the administration's own Environmental Protection Agency concluded that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will increase 40 percent over the next two decades (the United States already generates a full fourth of the world's carbon emissions). Bush dismissed the report, and the White House made certain that the EPA's annual report card on the environment deleted most references to the study.
\
Bush is right on one count - many important questions need to be answered about global warming. Much remains to be learned about climate change and its impacts on human civilization and the natural world. But the president can no longer claim with any credibility that there is any doubt that global warming is occurring or that the time has come for decisive steps.
\
Congress will soon have several prime opportunities to take meaningful action on global warming. When lawmakers take up the new energy bill this week, they should increase fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, a move that would both reduce carbon dioxide emissions and curtail this nation's dependence on foreign oil.
\
A more direct impact could be achieved by approving an amendment to the energy bill proposed by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joe Lieberman, D-Conn. The measure would set cap-and-trade limits on emissions of greenhouse gases from major sectors of the economy, while allowing exemptions for agriculture, households and small manufacturing facilities.
\
Before rejecting these proposals, Congress should take a hard look at the polls, which show Americans have a strong and growing interest in averting the floods, droughts, disease and widescale disruptions that threaten everyone's future if global warming goes unchecked.
\
In the Northeast, a bipartisan group of governors from 10 states recently announced a plan to develop a regional greenhouse gas trading program of their own - a clear sign they are no longer looking to the White House for leadership on global warming.
\
But global warming is a national - and international - issue, not one that can be addressed effectively in regional isolation. Congress should move swiftly and decisively to acknowledge the reality of global warming and approve legislation needed to deal with it.
"

Fear is often a great motivator. But with elected officials it frequently works the other way. From health care to financial industry reform, members of Congress seem paralyzed by the fear of voter backlash if they support new policies. On climate change, however, new polling indicates Congress should have no fear. Passing sweeping legislation is smart politics for Republicans and Democrats alike.
\
A lefty group did not do the polling. It was conducted by no less than Republican pollster Frank Luntz, who helped Newt Gingrich craft the ""Contract with America."" This is the same guy who in 2002 wrote a memo advising the Bush administration to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate about global warming.
\
Actually, an environmental group was involved. Luntz was hired by the Environmental Defense Fund to do the polling. Politics makes strange bedfellows.
\
Luntz conducted a series of studies this past November and December and found that most Americans do believe that climate change is real and that there is strong bipartisan support for congressional action on the issue.
\
He concluded, however, that focusing on climate change alone is insufficient. There is strong bipartisan support for legislation that boosts national security and energy independence, promotes innovation and new technology, creates jobs and reduces pollution as part of a declining cap on carbon emissions.
\
""A clear majority of Americans believe climate change is happening. This is true of McCain voters and Obama voters alike,"" Luntz said. ""And even for those that don't still believe, it is essential for America to pursue policies that promote energy independence and a cleaner, healthier environment.""
\
What is especially interesting about Luntz's polling is that, although a majority of Americans believe global warming is happening, the percentage who think so appears to be declining. This is not surprising. Jobs and the economy are the top issues for most American's today. The raucous health care debate, anger over the bailout of Wall Street, and other lunchpail issues have also diverted the public's attention.
\
But Luntz's polling points to other reasons for the slump in public concern. Due to its ""low threat saliency,"" global warming is tailor-made to be a low human priority. Many people believe the effects of global warming will occur far in the future, or in other regions of the world. Humans respond best to clear and present dangers.
\
The causes of global warming, such as the carbon dioxide our vehicles emit, are difficult to see, and there is no clear enemy. Humans, on the other hand, react most forcibly when the threats are intentional and personal or when our moral sensibilities are violated.
\
And there is no single, simple or quick fix for the problem. Humans are most apt to engage in solutions that are easy to implement, straightforward and produce swift, easily measurable results.
\
Global warming has also been framed as a scientific, environmental and technological problem. As a result, most Americans can't see how it affects their everyday lives. This is one of greatest mistakes of those working to address the issue. Few people understand that the consequences of a warming planet will directly affect their jobs, their family's health and their security.
\
Even with the sag in concern, Luntz's polling shows that the public wants Congress to act. ""People are much more interested in seeing solutions than watching yet another partisan political argument,"" he said.
\
Although Luntz's polling focused on congressional action, his findings likely apply to the state and local levels as well. As in Congress, many elected officials are fearful of supporting new policies.
\
Gov. Ted Kulongoski's top priority, the cap-and-trade-focused Western Climate Initiative, never left the launching pad in the 2009 Oregon legislative session. It also failed in other Western states. Not much else of significance on the energy or climate front was accomplished, either. Only a few bills dealing with energy or the climate are being heard during this month's short Oregon legislative session.
\
Luntz's polling indicates this is a mistake. State officials should step to the plate and enact bold legislation.
\
Similarly, the Eugene City Council, Lane County and other local governments should not shy away from adopting policies that promote safe and healthier energy options and reduce carbon emissions.
\
Local jobs in energy efficiency and many forms of renewable energy will be generated. Air quality will get better, improving local residents' health. And we will enhance our energy security by weaning ourselves from foreign sources.
\
Despite all of the trials and tribulations our nation has endured in the past few years, and despite a well-funded campaign to derail climate legislation, the American public has stood firm and wants action. Let's see if our elected officials can rise to the challenge.

40,"Statesman Journal\Oregon's Secretary of State Bill Bradbury was the lone elected official among teachers, retired military officials, a former Miss America and a country music singer getting trained to deliver Al Gore's Oscar-winning ""An Inconvenient Truth"" slideshow last fall.\Former vice president Gore vowed to train 1,000 people to get the word out about the science behind global warming. By mid-April, Gore will have trained 1,000 volunteers in the United States and about 150 in Australia.\Bradbury was among the first 50 people to be trained. Since then, he has given 20 slideshows in cities across Oregon and he has almost 30 more scheduled through July.\Question: Why did you want to be trained to deliver the slideshow?\Answer: Frankly, the reason I got to go was because I called Al Gore's chief of staff, a guy named Roy Neel, ... and I said, you know, it really occurs to me that I am sure Al Gore gets more requests for his slideshow than he can possibly deliver. And so I would love to sign up to be a lieutenant to give these slideshows. I used to do that for John Kitzhaber on the Oregon Health Plan and speak to groups all over the country who were interested in what's going on with the Oregon Health Plan. John just couldn't do them all, so I would just do some of them. I said I would assume Al Gore would like the same thing. He said it was very interesting that you've called because the staff and I just decided today that we are going to actually seriously start to do trainings because Mr. Gore had said offhandedly he wanted to train 1,000 people, so you are in the first group.\Q: Why did you sign up?\A: I've been aware of global warming as a problem for 10 years. But I hadn't really been involved. It just became clearer and clearer to me. I saw ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" and we had Kyoto and the United States not signing (the treaty), and frankly we are the world leader on this problem, and the European Union is really making progress on it -- it just became really clear to me that we are really blowing it. You know I am the father of two wonderful daughters, and I think every parent wants to leave their kids -- ideally -- a better world, but at least a world that is as least as good as the world they've had. It just became increasingly clear to me that we are blowing that. We are not doing that, we are not succeeding at that, we are not leaving our kids a better world. We are leaving our kids a very, very, very challenging world. Our kids, our grandkids. I just became more and more concerned about it. I was interested in doing what I could to spread the word further.\Q: In spreading the word, you are talking to individuals. But is this a problem that can be solved by individual actions?\A: No. Well, that's a trick question. The problem with greenhouse gas emissions cannot be solved by all of us buying compact fluorescent lamps and all of us weatherizing our homes and all of us driving hybrids. That would all help. But it is not going to be solved until you really have real carbon-emission controls, which is the first thing George Bush said he wasn't going to do after he said he was going to do it during his campaign against Al Gore. He said during the campaign in 2000 he was going to implement carbon controls and then he changed his mind and he hasn't done anything since. You have got to have government as a part of the larger picture. Yeah, you can help with individual actions, but it is not going to be enough until you get society as a whole saying, ""OK we have got to control this kind of emissions."" Then all kinds of amazing things can happen.\I mean there is already the carbon exchange in Chicago, which basically allows people to sort of buy and sell carbon credits and the need for carbon credits. People don't need them in this country but if they want to compete in Europe they need them. Basically California has enacted a bill and we will be considering a bill that basically says we are going to impose a cap on carbon emissions and we are going to create a carbon cap-and-trade system.\That is what we have to have. I don't have any question about it. It needs to be national ... I mean we just had 10 CEOs of 10 of the biggest corporations say we need to have a carbon-cap system nationally because it is way too complicated to deal with 50 different states' carbon emission caps.\(The CEOS said) we need to have a national standard -- it can be a tough standard -- but it has to be national standard. And then we can all deal with it and do what is called carbon cap-and-trade where basically you let the free market help industry solve the problem. It is just really great. You create a carbon cap and some people can get way below the carbon cap -- easily and cost effectively. They then have a carbon credit: the amount of carbon they reduced below the cap. They can then sell that to someone else where it is very expensive for them to reduce carbon so it creates this market in reducing carbon. It is great.\Q: Are you hoping to educate Oregonians so that they understand the science and push for national policies?\A: Al Gore is going to testify before the Senate House and Environment Committee about global warming. But what he is trying to do is make this effort much more of a grassroots effort so that people all over the country not just understand any one specific policy, but understand what's behind the need to do something. I think that's what's critical. The point of the show is not to be advocating for any one specific solution. The point of the show is really to get people to understand that this is a big deal and we have to deal with it and quickly. There are a number of different things that need to be done but it is not specifically focused on any one of those. It is focused on getting more and more and more people to understand the need to do something.\I mean polling shows that 70 percent of people in the country think global warming is in fact a problem. I would have said that 6 years ago.\The challenge is to really get people to understand -- get a better understanding -- that it is not just a problem, it is a crisis.\The Chinese characters for crisis are danger on one hand -- and there is clearly serious danger here -- and opportunity on the other. And you are seeing that in this (Oregon) legislature.\You are seeing an incredible number of bill being enacted that relate to renewable energy development, that relate to biofuels development and additional efforts like that, that all have a huge benefit in terms of reducing global warming pollution, but they also have a huge benefit in terms putting rural and urban Oregonians to work and reducing our dependence on a very, very, very unstable region of this world, called the Middle East.\Q: What specific Oregon information do you offer in your presentation?\A: I do Oregon stuff that relates to glacier loss on Mount Hood. It is pretty dramatic if you look at glacial loss from 1900 to today. It varies, but it ranges from 60 percent to 20 percent that every glacier on Mount Hood is reducing -- it's just how much.\We talk about weather loss. We are expecting more intense rain not just nice drizzly rain, but harder. Also more heat.\We talk about the ocean dead zone, which happened last summer. The nearshore largest dead zone in recorded history was off the Oregon Coast. Scientists, such as Jane Lubchenco from Oregon State University is very careful to say that we can't say absolutely that this is global warming. What we can say is that it is caused by changes in wind patterns and changes in wind patterns are very consistent with what you are seeing happen with global warming.\We talk about forest fires. A dramatic increase in forest fires, in all of the Americas, but particularly in the West.\We talk about wine grapes -- there will be a dramatic shift in what wine grapes will grow where. Our premier grape is the pinot noir grape -- guess what? In 40 years, pinot noir won't grow in Oregon. Other grapes will but not pinot noir. Have you ever thought of the coast of Oregon as the place where pinot noir would grow? Neither have I. But that's what the scientists are saying -- that will be the place to grow pinot noir -- the coast of Oregon and the Puget Sound region.\On one hand, if you look at the migration of wine grapes -- California, which today is a multibillion dollar wine producer, is basically, all gone. Basically there will not be good conditions for grapes in California. A little bit, on the coast but not much.\And guess what? Olympia is going to be better known for wine than beer. That's the kind of change that is going to be taking place. So I show those kinds of changes -- the reduction in the number of days of frost: there is a chart about reducing the number of days of frost in McMinnville as an example. So you see all these kinds of local impacts that are very much related to the kinds of changes going on around the globe.\Q: How have Oregonians responded to your presentation?\A: It has been great.\They have kind of been how I was, which was, I knew global warming was a problem. Most of the people who come to the presentation know -- there are a few doubters. The people who come sort of go, oh, this is serious.\I was in Tillamook last Friday night. We did a thing at the fairgrounds with 200 people. It was just superb. I have specific slides about Oregon sea level rise. The sea level rise maps show very clearly that the entire Tillamook Valley is under water -- under ocean water. So it ain't going to be growing nothing. OK?\So you will have new beachfront property ringing Tillamook Bay, well no, it will be a new Tillamook Bay. And all of those people have farms in that region and sea level rise will basically eliminate the Tillamook Valley.\There were some other scientists there who did presentations on specifically sand movement and beach erosion that made it real clear that they are really in a very sensitive, vulnerable place. So my sense of it was that people really got that this is not just a problem, this is called survival.\And I have to say there have been -- actually more lately -- people who come as doubters. And I always appreciate doubters because they get to sit through the whole presentation and absorb it, in whatever way they absorb it.\If you look at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, they basically said the debate is over. The debate about our human activity causing an increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere -- they are saying it is over 90 percent, highly likely.\Now people are discussing things like, well ,what does that mean for the snowpack in the Northwest. And there are very legitimate debates about what that does particularly in the mid-level elevation of snowpack. There was a big convention of climate scientists at the University of Washington because they were really concerned because the mayor said snowpack declined 50 percent, and they said, we are not sure we can support that. They said snowpack declined 35 percent.\It is wonderful to have scientific debate, but there is really no debate -- not any real peer-reviewed debate -- that climate change isn't a reality and needs to be dealt with.\Q: What do you hope Oregonians do after seeing your presentation?\A: There is not any one action. What I hope is that they will become understanding of climate change as a crisis that we need to do a number of things about -- they range from individual actions, to who we elect, to what our elected officials do and whether we support them in doing that. So it is governmental action and individual action.\Q: Have you gotten any grief about being an elected official delivering presentations about global warming?\A: No. People are very accepting in that I do it.\What we are careful about (is the separation between this role and my official role). In other words, I have to travel to these events and the state is not paying for that.\It fits in with what I do.\bcasper@StatesmanJournal.com or (503) 589-6994\Bill Bradbury\Title: Secretary of State\Age: 57\Residence: West Salem/Bandon\Family: Wife, Katy Eymann; two grown daughters from a previous marriage\Education: Antioch College, three years\WORK EXPERIENCE: Oregon secretary of state since 1999; executive director, For the Sake of the Salmon, 1995-99; former television news reporter and video producer; former restaurant owner\PUBLIC SERVICE: Oregon Senate, 1985-95, majority leader, 1987-93, president, 1993-95; Oregon House, 1981-85\Related to the environment: Chairman of the Oregon Sustainability Board; one of three members of the Oregon Land Board."

Politics are changing on global warming
\
Hot enough for you, Mr. President?
\
Your administration's own National Climatic Data Center reported Tuesday that last year was the warmest in the continental United States of the past 112 years - and that 2006 capped a nine-year warming streak ""unprecedented in the historical record.""
\
You might have noticed the cherry trees and azaleas in bloom along the Potomac River on New Year's Day. Government scientists say that's at least partly the result of the long-term effects of accumulating greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
\
By the way, some of those scientists over at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must have chewed off their muzzles. They're not only acknowledging the reality of global warming - they're warning that the rate at which temperatures are rising is speeding up and that they could lead to widespread melting of the polar ice caps, producing higher sea levels and more extreme droughts and storms.
\
In case you drifted off during your morning briefing, you might be interested to know that NOAA scientists have found that the northern hemisphere temperatures have not been this high for more than a thousand years. The rate of temperature increase has been far greater in the past three decades than at any time since the government began charting national temperature data.
\
You don't seem to get it, Mr. President. Or if you do get it, you're stubbornly refusing to seriously address the most urgent environmental issue of our time - an extraordinary failure of leadership.
\
NASA scientists say the Arctic Ocean has lost a fifth of its sea ice since the 1970s, an area twice the size of your beloved Texas. Last month, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorn designated polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. They're starving and drowning as their habitat literally melts beneath them. But like his boss, Kempthorn refuses to acknowledge that industrial emissions are causing temperatures to rise in polar regions.
\
While you may not admit the climate is changing, you have to admit that politics are changing. The ""thumpin' ' your party took last fall has put the Democrats in charge of Congress. Sen. James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who has insisted for years that climate change is a ""hoax,"" is out as chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He's been replaced by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., whose goal is to impose the nation's first mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. In the House, Democrats are preparing to redirect federal funding and tax breaks that now go to oil companies toward the production of renewable and alternative energies.
\
Even Republicans are getting in on the act. Sen. Gordon Smith, R- Ore., has joined with Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., to propose dramatic increases in efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is pushing a bill to establish a mandatory cap- and-trade system to restrict emissions. Guess they took you seriously when you promised last year to break the nation's ""addiction"" to foreign oil.
\
Out West, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is busy putting global warming burrs under your saddle. This week he proposed requiring oil companies to reduce fuel carbon content in his state. Last year he signed legislation to reduce emissions from refineries, power plants and factories to 1990 levels by 2020.
\
Temperatures are rising - and so is the pressure on you to pull your head out of the sand and lead the fight against global warming.
\
Hot enough for you, Mr. President?

Note: UO's Lillis Business Complex is chosen for the governor's ceremony because of its LEED credentials
\
Gov. Ted Kulongoski and an entourage of lobbyists, legislators and state bureaucrats made a road trip to Eugene on Wednesday for the governor's ceremonial signing of seven bills meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The bills signed into law make a number of changes, most of them invisible to consumers, that will nonetheless help reduce industrial- and transportation-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases known to contribute to global warming.
\
Kulongoski acknowledged before the bill signing that his top priority for curbing greenhouse gas emissions - a bill allowing Oregon to join a regional ""cap-and-trade"" program with other states and Canadian provinces - failed to pass the 2009 legislative session.
\
But the bills that did make it through gave a measure of state leaders' willingness to combat global warming at a time when economic travails have compelled other states to take a do-nothing posture.
\
""We could have hunkered down, taken cover and just tried to weather this economic storm,"" the governor told an audience of about 100 people at the University of Oregon's Lillis Business Complex. ""But we chose to continue to put one foot in front of the other and not only preserve critical services like education, but to also protect our environment.""
\
So why Eugene as the bill-signing setting?
\
Kulongoski spokeswoman Anna Richter Taylor said the governor chose Eugene because it is home to one of the greenest buildings around: the Lillis Business Complex.
\
""We were looking for a place that would be an example of what we're trying to achieve with these bills,"" Richter Taylor said. For that, the campus business complex was made to order. Photovoltaic panels are imbedded in the glass walls of its four-story atrium, providing much of the building's electrical needs, and classrooms are designed to maximize natural light and minimize the need for electrical lighting.
\
The six-year-old complex has received one of the highest ratings for energy efficiency by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, program.
\
Its ""silver"" rating made the Lillis complex the greenest business school in the nation and among the most environmentally conscious buildings on any U.S. college campus, the UO declared in 2005.
\
Some of the participants and witnesses on hand for the bills' signing acknowledged that getting to such a green backdrop required many of them to drive more than 100 miles from Portland to Eugene.
\
The governor's two-vehicle caravan included his state-owned Chevrolet Tahoe SUV, which uses electric-gas hybrid technology to reduce emissions and maximize fuel efficiency, Richter Taylor said.
\
Likewise, Portland-based An-drea Durbin of the Oregon Environmental Council pointed out that she and other green-policy advocates carpooled in a fuel-efficient Toyota Prius hybrid to reduce their carbon output for the trip.
\
Among the bills signed by Kulongoski were:
\
Senate Bill 38, which expands reporting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions.
\
House Bill 2186, which calls for the development of a low-carbon fuel standard.
\
House Bill 3039, which creates a pilot program to work small-scale solar energy into Oregon's electricity mix by using a ""feed-in tariff"" - a mandate that an electric utility buy back energy from solar projects at above-market rates, to make such undertakings pencil out financially during solar energy's infancy.
\
House Bill 2626, which allows homeowners and building owners to get low-interest loans, which would be repaid on utility bills, for renewable energy and conservation improvements.
"
43,"
The race to set a price on carbon dioxide has begun.
\
The governors of seven Western states, including Oregon, and four Canadian provinces recently unveiled their framework for a regional cap-and-trade program. Beginning in 2012, the Western Climate Initiative proposes to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions that decrease over time, along with a system that would allow utilities and other businesses to trade pollution rights or offset emissions.
\
The idea behind the initiative is that reductions should be done at the lowest possible cost. Setting a price on emissions is thought to be one of the best ways to achieve that. Price setting can be done through a direct tax on the use of fossil fuels, or by capping the overall level of emissions. Most politicians see tax increases as dead on arrival. So the initiative aims to cap emissions and establish a trading system.
\
Initial reactions to the initiative proposal were muted. After all, it is merely a framework. The real action will take place in the legislatures of each state, which must authorize the plan. But the trend seems clear.
\
Although they publicly voice support for emissions reduction, many industries that would be regulated by the initiative are preparing to oppose it strongly. Most fail to grasp - or perhaps are fearful - that fundamental changes in their entire business model will be needed if they are to remain competitive while phasing out emissions.
\
Support from the environmental community is also uncertain. Many are concerned that the initiative proposes to give away 90 percent of the pollution allocations for free to regulated companies. In addition, the initiative allows companies to count tree plantings and other suspect ""offsets"" for up to half of cuts.
\
Even legislative support is uncertain. With tight budgets and limited staff, some legislators I spoke with voiced concern about their governments' capacity to effectively administer a complex program that seeks to regulate hundreds of polluters in multiple states across two nations.
\
If the initiative gains political traction, I'll be the first to support it. But it faces rough sledding.
\
The uncertain future of the initiative once again raises an important question: Where should the focus of climate protection efforts be? Should the chief emphasis be on expanded policy options, or should equal or even greater weight be given to change? It's the difference between a bottom-up shift in thinking and beliefs and top-down regulatory changes - that is, political strategy. The two do not necessarily conflict, but they lead to very different strategies and most likely to different policies in the long run.
\
A number of authors recently analyzed the longtime approach of the environmental community. ""Break Through"" by Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger and ""The Bridge at the End of the World"" by James Speth, dean of the Yale School of Forestry, for example, both concluded that the environmental community almost always has shunned cultural change in favor of political strategy. As a result, although it has grown in size and sophistication and achieved its share of successes, the climate and natural environment continued to deteriorate.
\
New research shows that despite the economic downturn, the United States generated 1.75 billion tons of carbon emissions in 2007, an increase of 2 percent over 2006. This trend is the type that led the authors to conclude that the policy approach of the environmental community, on the whole, must be considered a failure. If we are to solve the climate crisis, cultural change is needed.
\
The policies people support are a reflection of their thinking. Their thinking, in turn, is determined by their beliefs and assumptions. Cultural change therefore focuses on a change in thinking.
\
New thinking about the risks of global climate change and the benefits of solutions will produce much more than voluntary emission reduction efforts. It is the key to generating the widespread political support needed to enact strong climate protection policies.

Americans, like people in most ""developed"" countries, tell pollsters they strongly support environmental protection, such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions. We also strongly support economic growth. However, growth increases CO2 emissions.
\
So two goals are at odds. We cannot support both, can we?
\
No. But supporting mutually exclusive goals appears to be the new normal, and that is pathological. We feel anxious about the state of the environment and really want the problems corrected. We also feel anxious about jobs, the cost of gasoline and general prosperity - and we want economic growth to continue.
\
We live each day with those powerful but opposing impulses. Do we really have to choose?
\
Yes. But so far we haven't chosen, and we are just coasting on inertia. Exponential growth in the goods economy still reigns supreme. No politician wishing to get elected dares to oppose growth in the economy, consumerism or population - those are all sacred. Economic growth and consumerism have been the context of our lives; they appear to have been the basis of the ""American dream."" But we are now more aware that exponential growth in the goods economy is unsustainable, and growth has become the ""American nightmare.""
\
At the same time, we also know in our hearts that we have not taken any significant and timely steps toward correcting our environmental crises - global warming, for example, or our global energy crisis, or toxic chemicals in our environment. We are in denial about the need to choose, unable to act.
\
Psychologist Kathy McMahon calls it ""Panglossian disorder,"" when we know there's a crisis we must deal with but decide to go shopping instead. That is our new normal. Normal once was a comfortable place to be, but that is no longer true.
\
Conflicting goals are the new normal for politics as well. The government, under all administrations, supports growth. Both major political parties promote it. A fundamental function of our government and political system since our founding has been to support and facilitate economic growth.
\
Environmental protection is, in contrast, quite young. Most of our foundational environmental law is just 35 years to 50 years old, and it has been subjected since adoption to continuous attack - never more so than today.
\
Like individuals, our political system is torn. The political response is to continue to support growth while paying lip service to the environment. That lip service consists of, among other things, adopting symbolic legislation.
\
As an example, last year's House-passed climate change/global warming legislation used a mechanism (cap-and-trade) known to be corruptible, slow and inefficient, and it set very low targets and long schedules for emissions reductions, ignoring shorter schedules suggested by climate scientists. It was a symbolic effort at best - and it died in the Senate because it was ""too radical"" and might interfere with economic growth.
\
Another form of lip service is to have good environmental laws but fail to enforce them. That notably occurred under President George W. Bush, but in all other administrations as well.
\
Governments also use coded language and phrases; examples include ""sustainable development"" or ""smart growth."" In practice, so-called ""sustainable development"" is just more unsustainable economic growth. Of the three ""legs"" of so-called ""sustainable development"" - social, economic and ecological - the ecological leg is critical, enabling the other two to exist. A sustainable world requires an intact and robust global ecosystem. It is our life-support system.
\
We live in a world of symbolic actions and coded language, all functioning to sedate us, to allay our sense of insecurity and uncertainty in the face of unsustainable growth and our failures to address environmental crises. I suspect we have a level of willingness to be deceived, and want to hear that everything is OK.
\
It is what has been termed the ""politics of unsustainability"" - the politics of a culture with its feet stuck in concrete. We live with irreconcilable realities that basic and radical change is required to live sustainably, but that unsustainable economic growth and consumerism appear to be inescapable givens.
\
Why is growth in the goods economy unsustainable? Virtually all production of goods involves the use of natural resources. We think of nature as our enormous shopping mall or supply warehouse, and we just buy, take or convert what we want - no problem, no consequences.
\
But nature is not like a shopping mall. Instead, nature is living organisms in habitats. The organisms interact with each other and with their physical environment. These assemblages of living organisms in physical habitats are ecosystems, not shopping malls.
\
Some parts of ecosystems are renewable - all the living parts - but cannot be considered renewable if renewal takes more than, say, half a human life-span. Some parts of ecosystems are not renewable on any human time scale: soils, mineral deposits, fossil fuels and pure water. Characteristics of ecosystems such as diversity, climate stability and biological productivity, once degraded, cannot be restored in a lifetime, if ever.
\
Ecosystems are the means of production of natural capital - as opposed to human capital such as shipyards or sawmills. If the desired product of natural capital is, for example, gravel, the means of natural production involve geologic processes that grind and transport rock over many millennia. If the natural product is made from trees, the means of natural production involves photosynthesis, water, sunlight, carbon dioxide and nitrogen provided by soil microorganisms.
\
All those raw materials are essential. In ecosystems, every little detail matters.
\
Details matter in our human economy as well; they are the essence of modern factory production. Factory managers pay close attention to raw materials, energy, machinery, waste disposal, distribution and payment. If anything breaks down, production is halted. No water? Wet processes stop. No power? Go home. No production? No payments for goods? Out of business. Enormous efforts are undertaken in factories to ensure continuous production. In factories, as in ecosystems, every little detail matters.
\
Yet we pay vastly more attention to the details of the human production than we do to the details of natural production, which we take for granted. We tend to ignore natural production entirely. We take natural capital for granted, and we use it heedlessly. Consequently, we often disrupt and sometimes arrest natural processes.
\
In that way, we have created degraded ecosystems everywhere. We pollute our drinking water with chemicals. We cause oceanic dead zones, toxic waste dumps, fouled air and an unprecedented rate of anthropogenic species extinctions.
\
We put the planet on track to have average temperatures 7 degrees to 9 degrees higher by the year 2100. We act as if these vile deeds do not exist or do not matter.
\
Protecting and restoring life in all life's varied habitats is our first priority. Economic growth means more destructive activity in more places and to more creatures. Perpetual exponential economic growth in the production of goods, and in population, is simply unsustainable, because this is a finite planet with finite resources.
\
Future technological fixes are faith-based; we cannot rely on them. We know of no adequate substitutes for diminishing resources such as ores, potable water or portable fossil fuels. Yet we make more cars that depend on more fossil fuels. Our population is almost 7 billion today, on course to be 9 billion by 2050, and 10 billion soon after. If we do nothing, we are requiring our children's children to live radically different and far more difficult lives than ours today.
\
Through our historical reliance on growth, we have made our civilization into a planetary Ponzi scheme: We are borrowing heavily from all future generations' resources to feed our growth today. Ponzi schemes always end badly. And the longer they last, and the bigger they become, the worse the outcome.
\
The plain fact is that we not only need to stop growth - we also need to shrink to a size the planet can sustain: We need negative growth.
\
The crucial things missing in our society are focused, persistent and unyielding actions - personal, political and social - to change how we live, and rapidly.

EPA ignored findings of its own study
\
Just when you thought the Bush administration's industry- friendly approach to mercury pollution couldn't get any worse, along come the jaw-dropping details of the Harvard cost/benefit study that the Environmental Protection Agency commissioned - and then chose to ignore.
\
First, a quick review: The Bush administration recently released new rules to limit mercury emissions from power plants. Instead of selecting the traditional approach of imposing limits on individual power plants, the administration opted for an industry-favored strategy that sets a national cap on mercury emissions and allows companies to either reduce emissions or purchase credits from other companies that do so.
\
The Bush administration justified its choice of the ""cap-and- trade"" plan by saying its analysis concluded that the costs to industry of across-the-board limits far exceeded projected health care savings.
\
However, The Washington Post reported this week that a study by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis concluded that the tougher approach would yield health benefits of approximately $5 billion per year by reducing heart and neurological disorders. That's 100 times higher than the amount that the EPA listed in its public statements.
\
Although the Harvard study was paid for by the EPA, co-authored by an agency scientist and peer reviewed, it was removed from the agency's documentation of its rulemaking process. Agency officials justified the omission by claiming they did not receive the study until after a deadline and that its methods were faulty.
\
Such claims might have more credibility if the EPA's own inspector general hadn't earlier issued a report criticizing the agency for ordering its scientists to support the industry-favored approach. And if a separate report by the Government Accountability Office hadn't found that the agency had intentionally skewed its analysis to make the cap-and-trade approach look superior.
\
The EPA's approach to regulating mercury pollution has been so tainted that it's merely a matter of time before the courts overturn the new rule. The agency should save them the trouble - and preserve what shreds of credibility it still has - by withdrawing the new mercury rule and replacing it with an alternative that takes public health and the environment, not just the desires of industry, into account.

Note: Senator would back cloture on global warming bill
\
Meaningful action to arrest and reverse the buildup of the atmospheric gases that are changing the Earth's climate depends on the participation and leadership of the United States. For a decade or more, the world has waited in vain for such leadership.
\
A bill pending in the U.S. Senate would trigger a belated but essential start toward reducing the volume of greenhouse gases produced by the world's biggest economy. The bill has a chance of passage if senators such as Oregon's Gordon Smith get behind it. He hasn't done that - but at least he's said he would vote to end a filibuster to block the bill.
\
The bill, sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va., is called America's Climate Security Act. It would cap greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, transportation and manufacturing sources at 2005 levels in 2012, and ratchet them downward every year after that.
\
Three-quarters of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions come from those sources. Emissions from other sources, such as appliances and buildings, would be addressed by energy efficiency standards. By 2050, the United States' contribution to climate change would be reduced 70 percent from its 2005 level.
\
The Climate Security Act would employ a cap-and-trade system. Utilities, industries and others that reduce their emissions below the yearly targets would receive credits for their success. These credits could be sold or traded to companies that fail to meet the emissions targets.
\
The advantage of a cap-and-trade system is that it provides an economic incentive to reduce emissions. At the same time, it provides an escape hatch for businesses that can't meet the targets - albeit an increasingly expensive one.
\
The Lieberman-Warner bill's prospects are improved by the fact that it has a bipartisan group of sponsors, including Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. The broad sponsorship reflects a widening awareness of the threat that global climate change presents to the United States' economy, security and environment.
\
Among the bill's most vocal opponents are environmental groups who complain that it doesn't go far enough - although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calculates that the Climate Security Act would prevent the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide from exceeding 500 parts per million by the end of the century, a level that would avert the worst-case projections of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
\
Other environmental organizations, however, are working to pass the Lieberman-Warner bill, arguing that it would at least start the United States moving in the right direction. Among them is the National Wildlife Federation, which has assembled a coalition of 670 groups of hunters and sport fishermen in support of the bill. Twenty-eight of those groups are based in Oregon, and their representatives recently tried to persuade Senator Smith to sign on as a co-sponsor.
\
Smith wouldn't do that. The Oregon Republican did, however, say that he would vote to invoke cloture - that is, to end a filibuster. It takes only 51 votes in the Senate to pass a bill, but it takes 60 to invoke cloture. Smith's promise, confirmed by his office, makes it less likely that a minority of opponents can block a vote on the Lieberman-Warner bill.
\
It would be better if Smith signed on in support of the Climate Security Act. Just as the world needs American leadership on climate change, Oregonians need leadership from those they send to Washington, D.C. But if Smith won't lead, at least he's ready to help stop others from obstructing the nation's first step toward a serious response to climate change. That's a particularly modest sign of progress, but progress nonetheless.

Note: Waxman to lead climate, energy debate in House
\
U.S. automakers took another hit and environmentalists won a major victory Thursday when Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., dethroned Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., as chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee.
\
Waxman's stunning victory provides a huge boost to President-elect Barack Obama's ambitious climate and energy agenda, which includes a cap-and-trade system for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and spending $150 billion on research for producing renewable fuels and 1 million new plug-in hybrid cars.
\
For nearly three decades, Dingell, 82, has been the top Democrat on the committee, which originates much of Congress' environmental and energy legislation. A tireless defender of Detroit's auto industry, Dingell has resisted efforts by fellow Democrats, including Waxman, for tighter limits on greenhouse gases and higher fuel standards.
\
Waxman, 69, has represented Los Angeles in Congress since 1974, and has been the hard-hitting chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He is a longtime critic of the oil and auto industries, and an unrelenting advocate of climate change legislation.
\
Waxman's victory, along with Dingell's departure and Obama's election, gives the nation its strongest environmental leadership since the early 1970s. That's when Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency, passed the Clean Water Act and put in place an array of air quality, auto emission and anti-pollution standards.
\
As chairman, Waxman will get his marching orders from a president-elect who has called energy ""the most important issue that our future economy is going to face"" and who this week told a global climate summit in Los Angeles that he envisions ""a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change.""
\
Waxman's victory gives Obama the green leadership he needs to realize that green agenda. While Dingell was a foot-dragging defender of the nation's foundering automakers, Waxman will be an aggressive and enthusiastic champion of energy and climate legislation.
\
Not surprisingly, Dingell fiercely resisted Waxman's takeover, calling him ""an anti-manufacturing left-wing Democrat"" and warning that his leadership would deal a heavy blow to a reeling auto industry and the nation's vaporizing economy.
\
Like a dwindling number of fellow Rust Belt dinosaurs, Dingell failed to grasp the need for what New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has called an E.T., energy technology, revolution, one that will span the entire economy from smart biofuels to high-tech solar to plug-in cars.
\
For far too many years, Dingell played the role of co-dependent to the auto industry's fatal excesses by shielding it from environmental and mileage concerns and the full impact of global competition. Without that damaging protection, the industry long ago would have been forced to adapt and would not have been pleading with lawmakers this week for a federal bailout.
\
Dingell also was a key ally of the Bush administration's outrageous efforts to block California's request for a federal waiver to allow it and at least 14 other states, including Oregon, to set higher limits on automobile emissions.
\
With Waxman at the energy helm in the House and fellow California Democrat Barbara Boxer heading the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Obama should move quickly next year to grant California's request - or even render it moot it by imposing tougher new federal standards.
\
Waxman's victory should also clear the way for two environmental bills that Boxer has promised to introduce when the new Congress convenes in January. The first would create a $15 billion-a-year grant program to reduce global warming emissions and promote clean energy innovations. The second would direct the EPA to establish a cap-and-trade system to limit emissions for businesses and create tradable emissions credits.
\
Congress is finally within reach of breakthrough legislation that will give Americans the rational energy and climate policies they need and deserve. Obama and his congressional allies still face an uphill battle, but Waxman's victory - and Dingell's departure - do much to increase their chances of success.

51,"Efforts to tighten rules for new and expanded megadairies, launched in response to a regulatory and environmental disaster at Oregon's newest large dairy, have failed.\Senate Bill 876, put forward by a legislative work group that met for months, died in committee Tuesday as a key deadline to move measures forward passed. So did two related bills pushed by a coalition of 22 health, environment and animal welfare groups.\""Even the most reasonable reforms were blocked by lobbyists working with these big corporate agribusinesses,"" said Ivan Maluski, policy director for Salem-based Friends of Family Farmers.\Other environmental protection measures also failed to advance in the Oregon Legislature this past week. Bills aimed at reducing algae blooms, restricting pesticides and establishing more rules governing aerial spraying either died or were watered down.\Lost Valley Farm opened in April 2017 to supply milk to the Tillamook County Creamery Association, which makes Tillamook Cheese at its nearby Boardman factory. Its permit allowed it to have 30,000 cows.\Lost Valley's owner, California dairyman Greg te Velde, had previously leased property from Threemile Canyon Farms, another area megadairy supplying milk to Tillamook.\Between its opening and February 2019, when a bankruptcy trustee sold the dairy and auctioned off its herd, Lost Valley was fined nearly $200,000 for more than 200 environmental violations.\State regulators had allowed the dairy to open before construction was complete, before it had secured access to water for the cows and for dairy operations, and before its animal waste management plan was approved.\The workgroup, led by Sen. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, had proposed tightening the permit process to ensure construction is complete before dairies open. It also would have limited the use of the stock-watering exemption in Oregon water law, which allows dairies to tap wells outside of the normal permitting process, even in areas with water shortages.\The advocacy groups also wanted a moratorium on new and expanded megadairies until Oregon could put rules in place to ensure a similar disaster wouldn't happen again.\And they called for large dairies, generally over 2,500 cows, to be defined as industrial, rather than farming operations, meaning they wouldn't qualify for regulatory exemptions available to farmers.\Both Tillamook and Threemile Canyon Farms testified against the bills, saying the entire industry should not be punished for the faults of one bad actor.\Threemile Canyon did support a last-minute amendment to Dembrow's bill, spokeswoman Anne Struthers said.\The ""gut and stuff"" amendment kept the two-part permitting process but did not close the stockwatering exemption. The Senate committee considering the bill did not take up the amendment.\Meanwhile, Easterday Farms, based in Pasco, Wash., has purchased Lost Valley Farm and has indicated it will reopen it as a dairy.\Threemile Canyon is expanding as well.\In a January 2019 application for $15 million in state tax-exempt bonds to finance an expansion of its manure digester, Threemile wrote that the project was to support ""a planned herd expansion.""\Struthers said that referred to Threemile's 2017 expansion into te Velde's previous leased dairy. She declined to say how many cows that added to the dairy's previous 70,000. Other bills that health and environment groups had called priorities also died or were significantly watered down as the deadline passed:\Four bills aimed to improve prevention, detection and response to harmful algal blooms in drinking and recreational water supplies. The push followed several recent incidents, including a toxic algae bloom that shut down Salem's municipal water supply for more than a month last year.\Among the bills' proposals: Requiring the state to identify susceptible water sources, develop a system to monitor and test those sources, and develop a protocol for issuing hazard advisories to the public; requiring state environment officials to identify sources of pollution contributing to algal blooms; and creating a task force to study how to prevent and control toxic algae blooms.\One proposal would have cracked down on possible contributions from forestry, banning clearcuts, pesticide applications and new logging roads on private forests.\One bill made it past the deadline, but has been watered down. House Bill 3326 continues temporary funding, approved last year, for state laboratory services related to algae blooms. And it allocates an amount, not yet set, for the state to hire a recreational algal bloom coordinator.\Lawmakers debated several bills to ban or restrict certain classes of pesticides.\The bills would have made neonicotinoid pesticides, which can harm bees and other pollinators, available only to licensed applicators. And they would have banned chlorpyrifos, a widely used organochloride pesticide tied to health problems in humans. Farmers said the chemicals are safe when used according to directions, and said no good alternatives exist.\Both bills have moved forward, but with amendments.\HB 2619 has been amended to ban chlorpyrifos. HB 3058 now simply calls on the Oregon Department of Agriculture to review the safety of chlorpyrifos, and report to an interim legislative committee by Jan. 1, 2020. Neither bill addresses neonicotinoids.\""A lot of bills died in the last few days. We're really excited there remains something to take action on with chlorpyrifos, because of the harm it causes to children's developing brains,"" said Lisa Arkin, executive director of the Eugene-based environmental group Beyond Toxics.\Three bills took aim at aerial pesticide spraying, a target of environmental groups for several legislative sessions after a series of high profile incidents where neighboring residents and farms were accidentally sprayed with pesticides.\Two bills would have required aerial sprayers to record and share more information about applications. Another would have prohibited aerial spraying on state forestland.\All three died in committee.\So what items on environmentalists' lists are still alive?\The big one is pending cap-and-trade legislation, which Gov. Kate Brown and legislative leaders have identified as among their top priorities for the session. HB 2020 aims to stem climate change by capping the amount of carbon released across all sectors of Oregon's economy. Several bills to reduce plastic waste also are moving along: HB 2509 would ban single-use plastic bags, with some exceptions. SB 90 would make restaurant customers ask for plastic straws, rather than get them automatically. And HB 2883 would ban polystyrene take-out containers. A bill putting a 10-year moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has passed the House and is headed for the Senate, although there aren't currently any plans to frack in Oregon.\And Brown has signed into law a bill banning offshore drilling in Oregon's waters, as well as construction of any infrastructure that would allow drilling in federal waters. That, too, was unlikely to happen any time soon.\Contact the reporter at tloew@statesmanjournal.com, 503-399-6779 or follow at Twitter.com/Tracy_Loew\Lost Valley Farm, owned and operated by Greg te Velde, near Boardman March 18, 2018.\MOLLY J.

52,"
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are pressing governments to impose a price tag on planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, using economic leverage and technical assistance that institutions like the United Nations cannot muster.
\
The campaign by two of the largest international lenders comes as world leaders have begun to sign the Paris agreement on climate change, the U.N. accord that is supposed to commit nearly every country to take action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
\
But the leaders of the World Bank, the IMF and other major global institutions say cutting emissions enough to stave off the worst effects of climate change will not be possible unless all fossil fuel polluters are forced to pay for the carbon dioxide they emit.
\
""There is now an overwhelmingly obvious scientific consensus that the more carbon pollution we put into the air the more impact it has on warming the massive melting of the Arctic, the cycles of droughts and flooding, the die-offs of coral reefs,"" the World Bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, said in an interview. ""And to our economists, who have been studying this for quite some time, there is an equally obvious consensus that putting a price on carbon pollution is by far the most powerful and efficient way to reduce emissions.""
\
He added, ""We strongly urge people to prepare for the carbon pricing that is to come.""
\
The World Bank's central mission is to alleviate global poverty, and in a twist on that mission, bank leaders have identified climate change as a key driver of poverty. A World Bank report last year concluded that climate change could beggar 100 million more people by 2030.
\
""We cannot poison the planet and thrive,"" Kim said at the adoption of the Paris agreement in December.
\
To press that case, the bank has created a Carbon Finance Unit to give financial and technical assistance to countries that are creating a system to put a price on carbon. This is usually set up as a tax on fossil fuels like coal and oil or as a ""cap-and-trade"" system that sets limits on overall carbon emissions then allows companies to buy and sell emission allotments sold by the government.
\
The bank is already working with 18 countries with emerging economies, including China, which has received an $8 million grant to develop what is expected to be the world's largest cap-and-trade program. South Africa and Chile have received similar grants, and World Bank officials are meeting with the governments of Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Panama to help them create carbon pricing systems.
\
Under the Paris agreement, all countries submitted plans to reduce their carbon emissions, and they are required to update and strengthen those plans over the coming years. Already, about 90 countries have included some form of carbon pricing in their plans. The World Bank has reviewed those U.N. plans, hoping eventually to link the systems into a global carbon trading market.
\
""We've now got carbon pricing on the radar screen in a way it hasn't been before,"" said John Roome, the senior director for climate change programs at the World Bank Group. ""We're moving from why to how.""
\
The IMF, often seen as the world's lender of last resort, is also consulting and advising countries on how best to introduce carbon pricing, in part as a way for struggling nations to raise more revenue.
\
""We can't make a loan conditional on carbon pricing, but for a country facing a large deficit, we could recommend that they use carbon pricing as a way to simultaneously meet their pledges in Paris and close their deficit,"" said Ian Parry, principal environmental fiscal policy expert at the IMF.
\
Any policy that drives up the cost of fossil fuels can be expected to generate intense opposition. In the United States political groups funded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and others stand in the way.
\
""It's frustrating to watch unelected bureaucrats like the World Bank and other institutions try to leverage their power to force elected leaders to take actions that harm their citizens,"" said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed advocacy group.
\
About 40 countries, including the 28 members of the European Union, along with 23 cities, states and regions around the world, have introduced carbon pricing policies. They cover about 12 percent of the world's carbon pollution.
\
Last week, the World Bank, the IMF, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the heads of state of Canada, Chile, Ethiopia, France, Germany and Mexico released a statement calling for more carbon pricing. Their goal is to reach enough countries to cover 25 percent of the world's carbon emissions by 2020 and 50 percent of emissions by 2030.
\
""Our government has heard loud and clear that Canadians care about standing up for our environment and our livelihoods,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said.
\
Four of Canada's 13 provinces and territories already have some form of carbon pricing, and Trudeau hopes to enact a national plan.
\
The Oregon Legislature is considering its own trading regime, and a ballot initiative to create a carbon tax is expected to be on the Washington state ballot in November.

55,"The bill that ground the Oregon Legislature to a halt and rallied hundreds of rural Oregonians to Salem in 2019 is back for the 2020 session with a series of modifications that supporters hope will get the bill to Gov. Kate Brown's desk.\However, changes to the greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill that occurred over the past few months have not secured any Senate Republican votes and have also thrown into doubt support from major environmental advocates.\Inside the Oregon Capitol, fears of another Senate Republican walkout are still present as the top Republican involved in negotiations has already stepped away saying his plan was dismissed by Democratic senators and the governor's staff.\The legislation itself — Legislative Concept 19 — still maintains the overall framework of House Bill 2020 from the 2019 session.\It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035, and 80 percent below by 2050 by using a cap-and-trade system. It would place gradually declining limits on statewide emissions and create a marketplace for polluters to buy credits, or allowances, for each ton of emissions they release annually.\The number of allowances would also decline each year.\Supporters say adjustments in the new legislation address concerns raised last year, including: creating more economic protections for rural Oregonians; reducing the number of regulated manufacturers; changing the bureaucratic oversight of the program; and providing more investments for wildfire mitigation.\They also hope that if this bill is signed into law, other states might look to Oregon's example and pass similar legislation.\This was an argument in support of HB 2020 as well and a counter to a Republican argument that Oregon reducing its emissions would have a negligible impact on global emissions.\""We remain in a situation where, for the foreseeable future, our country, at the national level, is not going to take action, and so action has to come at the local and regional levels,"" said Sen. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland.\Those in opposition still have philosophical differences with the proposal, but add that their previous concerns have not been appropriately addressed and this version could be even worse for rural Oregon.\""(HB) 2020 was the worst bill I've ever seen, but it was straight up,"" said Sen. Fred Girod, R-Stayton. ""In this bill, they try to candy coat it and make it sound like rural Oregon won't be impacted when that's absolutely not true.""\Girod said it's still unknown if a walkout is on the horizon. Conversations among Republican lawmakers are ongoing.\Senate Republicans fled the Capitol building — and the state — for nine days near the end of the 2019 session, derailing the passage of HB 2020 and slowing the entire legislative process.\""Most of us have concluded that the concept (LC 19) is something that we can't tolerate,"" Girod said. ""I think we'll show up for the short session. I don't know how long we're going to stay there.""\Clean energy advocacy coalition Renew Oregon was still in the process of analyzing the bill after it became available on Thursday, but spokesman Brad Reed said there are initial concerns that the legislation gives too much away to industry.\""That's what makes this particular version not something we would support as a final version,"" Reed said.\However, Reed said it appears there has been a good-faith effort to negotiate on both sides and the bill is on the right track to being something Renew Oregon could support.\Lawmakers will hold the first public meeting on LC 19 on Monday, Jan. 13, at 8 a.m. in the Senate Interim Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.\There are four main differences between LC 19 and HB 2020.\In arguably the most significant change, LC 19 would create a geographical phase-in of the requirement for transportation fuel suppliers to acquire allowances. The phase-in would start with the Portland metro area in 2022 and five other metropolitan areas identified in the legislation in 2025.\This section targets fuel suppliers that deliver transportation fuels to these regions.\The bill is silent on transportation fuels delivered to rural areas of the state.\Revenues generated by transportation allowances would also be restricted geographically, with most of the benefit heading toward Portland.\Dembrow said the Department of Transportation and Department of Environmental Quality have confirmed they could implement this regional program as intended and it would protect rural Oregon from rising fuel prices, the biggest concern raised by many in 2019.\Girod disagreed, saying that suppliers would pass the costs of allowances down to consumers statewide since there is no realistic way to confirm which gas is going to rural Oregon and which is headed for the Portland metro area.\In addition, transportation allowance revenues wouldn't be going to rural Oregon, so this part of the bill did not address any concerns.\""I think it's worse, not better, than the original bill,"" he said.\The other main changes are: new exemptions and subsidies for manufacturing companies; a change in the how much allowance allocation will be invested in different funds; and the creation of an Office of Greenhouse Gas Regulation within the Department of Environmental Quality to oversee the program.\Negotiations over what would become LC 19 began during a chance meeting in the Capitol parking garage between Republican Girod and Sen. Arnie Roblan, D-Coos Bay.\Roblan had a central role in the death of HB 2020 as he was one of three Senate Democrats who did not support the final version of the bill.\At that meeting, Girod and Roblan agreed to work on a proposal that they could both support. Girod said what they devised was more ""carrot"" than ""stick"" focusing on tax credits to encourage people to take actions such as buying electric cars and switching to LED light bulbs.\However, Girod said that during a meeting in mid-December that included Roblan, Dembrow, himself, Sen. Lee Beyer, D-Springfield, Sen. Kathleen Taylor, D-Milwaukie, and members of the governor's staff, his proposal was tossed out.\""It's pretty much dead,"" Girod said. ""They made it very clear they don't care about my support.""\What they have now, he said, contains only a little of what he and Roblan suggested and is largely a re-tread of HB 2020.\Dembrow said that his recollection of the meeting differed from Girod's.\He said the December meeting was one of several between lawmakers on this issue and he didn't remember Girod and Roblan having a concrete proposal.\Dembrow said that while Girod was more interested in a program built around incentives, he believed that having set emissions reduction targets was also critical.\""The bill as it is now includes incentives but it also includes firm targets for emissions reductions,"" Dembrow said.\When reached for comment, the governor's office said they are still working to improve the legislation.\""While the latest Senate bill draft is a work in progress, it protects rural manufacturers and drivers from impact as we lower statewide carbon emissions, which was a central goal,"" spokeswoman Kate Kondayen said in a statement.\""Our staff worked collaboratively alongside legislators, businesses, and advocacy groups throughout the fall to actively create forums to share ideas and feedback from all viewpoints,"" she said.\Dembrow and Roblan said there is still room for amendments to the legislation, as other legislative leaders are also hoping for some additional compromises. However, with only 35 days in the 2020 short legislative session and much tighter legislative deadlines, any changes to the proposal will have to happen quickly.\""There is some room for compromise as long as we don't get pulled apart by both of our bases,"" said Senate Republican Leader Herman Baertschiger Jr., R-Grants Pass. ""This state is so divided over this issue, it's unbelievable.""\Contact reporter Connor Radnovich at cradnovich@statesmanjournal.com or 503-399-6864, or follow him on Twitter at @CDRadnovich\Baertschiger\Roblan\Dembrow\Girod\CREDIT: Connor Radnovich"

Luckily, his injuries were not life-threatening. But the fact remains that it happened, and may happen again in the absence of community information and a vigilant law enforcement presence.

Exclusion zone targets homeless
\
This is a view from a former tramp.
\
People always talk about how they will help the homeless, so why is it still illegal to fall asleep when you are homeless in Eugene? This new ""exclusion zone"" reminds me of Berlin in 1933-45. People accused, not convicted, of a crime are to be exiled from Eugene's rotting city center?
\
I will never again do business with any shop or restaurant that is within the exclusion perimeter. Eugene can take its Nazified laws and go jump off of a cliff.

Zenon workers deserved better
\
Cafe Zenon's owner Brian James declared, ""I pat myself on the back for doing the right thing for the business"" in an Oct. 29 Register-Guard article about the restaurant's sudden closure.
\
A pat on the back? Certainly not for the 40-plus people who lost their jobs Monday morning with no advance notice. Some of these employees had been working at the popular downtown cafe for decades.
\
Cafe Zenon has been fading for some time, well before the current economic meltdown was a twinkle in Wall Street's eye. The demise cannot be blamed on skipping wine with dinner, or deciding to split an entree. As co-founder Donna McGuiness was quoted, ""This didn't happen overnight; it's been coming on for the last 18 months.""
\
Ours is one of many families who shared more than 20 years at Cafe Zenon, treating our kids, parents, in-laws and visitors to wonderful food and a dynamic environment. My thanks and appreciation go out to the dozens of employees I knew who set tables, offered suggestions, served our meals, cooked our dinners, created desserts, cleaned our messes and washed our dishes, year after year.
\
These individuals deserved more than the surprise of a locked door and homemade ""Closed"" sign. Much more than a pat on the back.

What did RiverBend insert cost?
\
I was aghast to receive RiverBend Magazine and immediately asked myself these questions:
\
How much did this cost to produce and mail? How many hospital costs could be reduced if the hospital were not wasting money on this level of promotion? How many people have gone bankrupt because they couldn't pay their hospital bills? Why is it being sent to me, a resident living in another county and town, 60 miles away, with a perfectly good hospital just minutes away? Why is a hospital of no interest to me sending me an expensive, heavy piece of junk mail that will end up in the recycling?
\
Somebody at RiverBend is oblivious to the concern many of us have for what is happening to our nation, current financial crisis aside, because of excessive health care costs driven in part by waste and inefficiencies. To flaunt the wealth of a hospital by mailing, willy nilly, such a prospectus defies good judgment.

Cap-and-trade poses problems
\
I wish to thank our terrific state legislators. They have put legislation in place to further protect us from those terrible air-polluting smokers.
\
Now they are working on legislation to protect us from business-produced air pollution. It is called ""cap-and-trade"" (aka bait and switch).
\
Here is basically how it works: The Legislature creates a new bureaucracy, funded by our tax dollars. The bureaucracy's agents go to all these businesses, from hospitals to pulp mills, and decide how much the business can pollute. They then issue the business ""pollution credits"" in this amount. If one of these businesses pollutes more than its allotted pollution credits, it will be punished with a heavy fine.
\
But wait: If they can find a business that is not using all its pollution credits, they can buy these credits and not be punished! Which business will you live downwind from?

Bunny suicide book isn't funny
\
Once again I shake my head and wonder about the world we've created. It's a place where Taffey Anderson, who has the good sense to speak out on the insensitive reading material at her son's middle/high school, rather than being applauded, is depicted as a censor (Register-Guard, Oct. 20). Worse, ignorant critics ship more Bunny Suicide books to the school as replacements.
\
Do those people live under a rock? The rate of real teens, not bunnies, committing suicide has risen every year. That is not a funny statistic and neither is the book.
\
I'm a writer and take our First Amendment quite seriously. I'm also a parent, and I applaud Anderson for her stand. If the school board of a middle school does not see the wisdom of her argument, its members should go talk to parents of children who committed suicide. They may take a different view of ""age appropriate"" reading material.
\
If parents deem Bunny Suicides as simple fun, let them buy it themselves, without community funds. Lots of things set off the emotions and actions of children. Let's not forget Thurston.

Do we want true equality for all?

I appreciated the Oct. 26 Commentary article, ""There's no way to separate core values from religion.""
\
Song Nai Rhee did a wonderful job of supporting the view referred to in the headline of the article. I would only have one quarrel with his article - his conclusion.
\
I sincerely believe that most candidates stand for justice, peace, service and equality. The question is not whether they espouse these virtues; the question is which one of them, in your opinion, has the best grasp on how to achieve the goals of justice, peace, service and equality.
\
Liberal America is convinced that people with conservative world views do not support these goals. I would propose that is not the case.
\
At the heart of the question is how do we dispense justice, whose peace are we searching for, whom do we serve, and is it truly equality for all we want?

57,"When Gov. John Kitzhaber signed a regional climate change agreement in October, he promised that Oregon would join California and British Columbia in putting a price on carbon emissions.\Now, lawmakers need to figure out how to make that happen.\The Legislature has allocated $200,000 from the general fund to study what a carbon tax or fee might look like here.\State officials have hired the Northwest Economic Research Center, led by former state economist Tom Potiowsky, to model the impacts of such a tax on various economic and geographic segments of the state.\One goal is to achieve the drastic greenhouse gas emission reductions necessary to meet the state's stringent targets. Oregon aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, and by at least 75 percent by 2050.\But more importantly, the tax or fee would create new state revenue that could augment or replace portions of existing revenues, backers told a legislative committee last month.\British Columbia imposed a carbon tax in 2008, starting at $10 per ton and increasing each year to its current price of $30, or about 25 cents per gallon of gas.\California recently adopted a cap-and-trade system. It sets an overall emissions cap, then auctions off emission credits, which can be bought and sold.\Oregon's scheme would be modeled on British Columbia's, said Jeff Renfro, senior economist at the Northwest Economic Research Center.\Oregon would ""repatriate,"" or give part of the revenue back in the form of corporate tax cuts, low-income tax relief, and targeted investments in certain industries.\""We're going to model the effect of taking that revenue and distributing it back to the economy in different ways, to figure out what the tradeoffs are between different repatriation scenarios,"" Renfro said. ""The centerpiece of the study is modeling what's going to happen to different industries in different areas when we increase their energy price.""\Business Oregon, the state's economic development arm, has been charged with identifying industries that would be favored under the plan.\The plan may be a tough sell.\""I'm pretty skeptical about this,"" Rep. Vicki Berger, R-Salem, said at the committee meeting.\""If we want to put a tax on carbon, we want to be sure not to hurt our existing industries or the poor,"" Berger said.\The Northwest Economic Research Center will present a final analysis to the Legislature in November 2014.\Washington's Legislature also has commissioned a report on options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\tloew@StatesmanJournal.com or (503) 399-6779\Online\See this story at StatesmanJournal.com/news to read a copy of the Northwest Economic Research Center's early study on a possible carbon tax or fee in Oregon.\ID_Code: J0-312150014"
58,"Statesman Journal\Initiated by Gov. Ted Kulongoski, five Western states are collaborating to reduce global warming pollution -- citing declining snowpacks and severe forest fires as climate change problems unique to the West.\Under the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative -- signed Monday by the governors of Oregon, California, Washington, New Mexico and Arizona -- the five states will adopt goals for reduced levels of greenhouse gas pollution.\""Our regional strategy will deliver a cleaner environment and healthier economy,"" Kulongoski said. ""It also sends a message to Congress and the White House that if they fail to enact policies at the national level to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and do our nation's part to combat global warming -- that states will do it on our own.""\Oregon Sen. Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, criticized the agreement for not crediting Oregon for its hydropower -- which provides 40 percent of the state's energy.\""We should be building on our success with hydropower, not chasing incremental increases in new, but extremely expensive and sometimes experimental technologies,"" he said.\Kulongoski already has ramped up efforts in Oregon to address global warming. He is pushing several renewable energy proposals to reduce the state's reliance on fossil fuels; promoted adoption of stricter car emission standards; and advocated for programs to reduce diesel emissions.\Oregon's efforts are admirable, but they make a much bigger difference when combined with other states, advocates said.\""This regional global warming solution will benefit the environment on a global scale,"" said Jeremiah Baumann, an environmental advocate with Portland-based Oregon State Public Interest Research Group.\If the five western states involved in this agreement were one nation, it would be the sixth or seventh largest emitter of carbon in the world, said David Van't Hof, the governor's sustainability advisor.\To reduce carbon emissions, the states are working on a regional ""cap-and-trade"" program. Individual companies, including utilities, could either reduce their pollution or pay other companies to reduce their pollution more than required, so that total pollution levels meet the cap.\The states also will track emitters of greenhouse gases and the levels that companies reduce emissions.\bcasper@StatesmanJournal.com or (503) 589-6994\Links\http://governor.oregon.gov/Gov/pdf/letters/mouclimate.pdf"

COLLEGE COSTS: Paying for college and university tuition will get plenty of attention. The governor wants to raise taxes on corporations to expand the Opportunity Grant financial aid program, which is running out of money because of high demand. Also, lawmakers plan to investigate recent losses in the state college savings plan in funds intended to be safely invested in low-risk bonds and equities. The new treasurer has proposed prepaid tuition as an alternative.
\
EDUCATION: Although the governor's budget would modestly increase appropriations to public schools from $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion for the biennium, boards and administrators say it's not enough to maintain current offerings. Head Start would expand to 700 more eligible 3- and 4-year-olds.
\
GREEN ENERGY: Lawmakers will debate whether to increase a business energy tax credit from 35 percent to half the cost of industrial-scale investment in energy efficiency. The governor also wants to combat global warming by joining a regional effort to establish a ""cap and trade"" system limiting carbon emissions and allowing polluters to buy and sell carbon credits.

HEALTH CARE: A legislatively created task force has recommended Oregon take another step toward universal health care coverage by extending medical insurance to 80,000 children and at 75,000 low-income adults. The governor wants health care providers and insurers to pay for much of this expansion through higher taxes.
\
LAND USE: The Legislature-created ""Big Look Task Force"" has recommended that lawmakers change Oregon's statewide planning system by increasing flexibility for local governments to avoid what it calls a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to protecting farm and forest lands.
\
PUBLIC SAFETY: Lawmakers and the governor want to avoid a repeat of the state police layoffs of six years ago and retain the 112 recently added troopers. The governor also has budgeted for half the $120 million cost of the voter-passed Measure 57, which increases sentences for some property crimes and expands drug treatment for those convicted.
\
PUBLIC WORKS: The governor has proposed borrowing $2 billion through bond sales for public works. The money would pay for transportation projects, building construction, and maintenance projects. Local projects include campus improvements at the University of Oregon and beginning construction of a psychiatric hospital and state prison in Junction City.
\
SOCIAL SAFETY NET: The Legislature must decide whether to accept the governor's proposed cuts, which would reduce in-home care for some 6,500 seniors and the disabled, cut child care subsidies for 3,500 families, turn 3,000 people away from community-based mental health and drug treatment programs and eliminate dental and vision benefits for 100,000 poor adults on the Oregon Health Plan.
\
TAXES: Lawmakers will decide what to do about the governor's recommendations before tackling their own ideas. He wants a health care provider tax (4 percent for hospitals and 1.5 percent for insurers), a 2-cent increase on the gas tax, higher vehicle fees, an added 60 cents-per-pack for the cigarette tax and a raise in the corporate minimum tax from $10 to between $25 and $5,000.
\
TRANSPORTATION: The governor's gas tax and vehicle fee increases, if approved by lawmakers, would pump more than $3 billion into roads, bridges and other transportation projects over five years. Lawmakers say they want to go in that direction but haven't settled on the details of the increases.

61,"As milk prices plummet, Oregon's largest dairy hopes to cash in on another kind of commodity produced by its cows:\Manure.\Boardman's Threemile Canyon Farms is partnering with a Portland investment fund in a $55 million project to convert methane from the waste produced by its 70,000 cows into natural gas, which will be sold to power buses and garbage trucks in Southern California.\Because it's designated renewable energy, the manure-produced biogas sells for 10 times more than fossil fuel natural gas, Threemile general manager Marty Myers told a state Department of Treasury panel last summer, as the company sought tax-exempt state bonds to help pay for the project.\That's because fossil fuel companies need to buy carbon offset credits, produced by renewable energy projects like Threemile's, to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions.\""The most valuable product that we have out there is natural gas,"" Myers told the panel.\Threemile spokeswoman Anne Struthers declined to expand further this past week on the project's financing or sales strategy, saying it is premature to comment.\The move comes as the Tillamook County Creamery Association, which buys Threemile's milk, signals a possible expansion of its Boardman cheese factory along the Columbia River.\It also comes as the Oregon Legislature considers whether to ban new and expanded megadairies, following an environmental and regulatory disaster at the now-closed Lost Valley Farm, another Boardman-area Tillamook supplier.\The Legislature also is considering a carbon cap-and-trade program that could make the manure-generated biogas even more valuable.\The public can weigh in on the new manure digester's proposed air pollution permit until April 25.\Threemile started its farm and dairy in 2001, to supply milk to the Tillamook County Creamery Association's new Boardman cheese factory.\Since then it's drawn praise for its closed-loop system, which uses manure from the cows to fertilize crops and its state-of-the-art irrigation system that helps conserve water.\At the same time the dairy, one of the largest in the country, has drawn criticism for the sheer amount of wastewater and air contaminants its thousands of cows produce.\Tillamook, meanwhile, has been on an expansion tear: In 2004, it doubled the size of its Boardman creamery; in 2013 it partnered with Threemile to add a whey processing plant to the Boardman factory; in 2017 it opened a new Portland office; and last year it rebuilt and expanded its iconic tourist center in Tillamook.\The company grew its revenues from $477 million in 2012 to $800 million in 2017, according to the trade magazine Food Navigator. It's expanding its distribution east of the Rocky Mountains, adding 6,000 outlets in recent years. Now, three-quarters of Tillamook Cheese is made in Boardman.\A year ago, Tillamook purchased 18 acres bordering its current Boardman site, effectively doubling its footprint there. Tillamook officials did not respond to questions about its plans for the property.\Threemile Canyon Farms already is home to the largest cow manure digester in the western United States, producing electricity, not natural gas.\It started in 2009 with a small digester demonstration project. In 2012, Threemile added a larger digester, which feeds a 4.8-megawatt electric generation facility.\The digester captures methane that otherwise would rise off the dairy's manure lagoons and escape into the atmosphere, and uses it to produce biogas that creates renewable energy.\Myers told the treasury panel the dairy's digester so far has broken even financially.\The digester cost $31 million to build. Threemile received about $7 million in federal grants for construction under the 2009 American Recovery Act, and an additional $2 million from Oregon's controversial Business Energy Tax Credit (BETC) program.\NW Natural gas customers who chose the Smart Energy option, a voluntary carbon offset program, ahelped pay for the digester's construction and operation. Pacific Power electricity customers who choose the Blue Sky Renewable Energy option also support the digester.\Threemile also has received two kinds of renewable energy credits for the digester:\In 2007, the Oregon Legislature established the Biomass Tax Credit program. Among other things, it provided a tax credit, of about $70 per cow per year, for dairy manure digesters.\Between 2014 and 2018, while the program was administered by the Oregon Department of Energy, Threemile received $10.9 million in biomass tax credits. That's about half the total amount awarded during that period.\The controversial biomass tax credit was set to sunset on Jan. 1, 2018, along with the energy department's other tax credit programs. But the 2016 Legislature partially extended the credit, just for animal manure and rendering, until Jan. 1, 2022. It will be capped at a total expenditure of $5 million per year.\In 2017, the Legislature moved the tax credit program under the authority of the Oregon Department of Agriculture.\Threemile also has sold more than 200,000 metric tons of carbon offset credits to The Climate Trust, a nonprofit that administers the Oregon Carbon Dioxide Standard, created by the Legislature and aimed at curbing emissions of carbon dioxide.\The process of creating energy from methane creates and emits carbon dioxide, said Sheldon Zakreski, The Climate Trust's chief operating officer.\But methane has a much higher global warming impact than carbon dioxide, so Threemile is paid for the difference between the two, Zakreski said.\The price paid for the credits is confidential, Zakreski said. But at the current credit price of $13.25 to $13.50 per metric ton, they would be worth at least $2.7 million.\""It's been a successful project,"" Myers told the treasury panel. ""Now we're looking at what the marketplace really desires today out of renewable energy.""\Now, Threemile has partnered with Equilibrium Capitol Group to convert the digester to produce natural gas, and to extend a natural gas pipeline to the facility.\Equilibrium is an Oregon benefit company, which means that it considers its impact on society and the environment in addition to earning a profit. Its investors include retirement funds held for teachers, public servants, clergy and religious orders.\The company's Wastewater Opportunity Fund, founded in 2015, specializes in food, agricultural and municipal wastewater infrastructure. It's completing a similar dairy waste to natural gas project in central Arizona.\""Threemile Canyon's project is world class,"" said Bill Campbell, a company principal. ""It is great to be able to do things like this in our home state.""\Threemile's anaerobic digester works by providing an oxygen-free environment for microorganisms to break down the organics in the manure, as well as in vegetable waste trucked in from area food processing companies. That produces a biogas that's about 60 percent methane and 40 percent carbon dioxide.\Currently, the biogas is combusted to produce electricity. When the conversion is complete, the biogas instead will be routed to a gas treatment system that removes hydrogen sulfide, then separates the biogas into pipeline grade natural gas and tail gas.\The digester will employ 13 workers, with an average annual compensation of $70,000, including benefits, Struthers said.\Threemile has asked the state Department of Environmental Quality for a new, five-year air pollution permit for the modified digester's emissions.\Its emission limits will stay about the same, even falling slightly for two pollutants. However, the digester so far has not come close to meeting those limits, so there is room for emissions to increase.\For example, the permit allows the digester to emit 74,000 tons of greenhouse gases, the equivalent of about 57,608 passenger vehicles driving for one year. Last year, it emitted 32,529 tons.\Other pollutants covered by the permit are particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds.\Like the pilot project, the new digester will get some public help.\Last summer, the Oregon Treasurer's office approved issuing $40 million in state tax-exempt bonds to help finance the project.\Private Activity Bonds help construct critical facilities that benefit the public throughout the state.\There's no cost to taxpayers, but there is a limited amount of money available. That means Threemile competed with affordable housing and other projects for the money. It also gives Threemile an advantage over competitors who finance projects with taxable instruments.\In January, Threemile asked that the bond be reduced to $15 million, for tax reasons.\The project also has been approved for an Enterprise Zone tax abatement. That means it won't pay any property taxes for five years.\And it will continue to receive Oregon's Biomass Tax Credit until that program expires, Myers told the state panel.\But the biggest revenue stream will come from taking advantage of incentive structures like Oregon's Clean Fuels Program and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Mary Macpherson, then an Equilibrium vice president, told the panel.\The technology will provide a huge environmental benefit to the entire state, Myers told the panel. It also will be profitable business, he said.\Contact the reporter at tloew@statesmanjournal.com.\Air pollution permit\The public can weigh in on a proposed five-year air pollution permit for Threemile Canyon Farms' manure-to-natural-gas project.\The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality will hold a public hearing on the proposed permit at the request of at least 10 people or a group representing 10 people.\Comments must be received by 5 p.m. April 25. Mail to Nancy Swoffard, air permit coordinator, DEQ Eastern Region – Bend Office, 475 Bellevue Drive, Suite 110, Bend, OR 97701; fax to 541-388-8283; or email swofford.nancy@deq.state.or.us.\CREDIT: Tracy Loew"
62,"Democratic newcomer Ramiro ""RJ"" Navarro Jr. wants to represent District 25 in the Oregon House of Representatives. To do so, he has to beat Bill Post, the three-term Republican incumbent who intends to serve two more years.\Post has represented House District 25 since he was first elected in 2014. The district includes Keizer, Newberg and St. Paul, as well as rural parts of Marion and Yamhill counties.\The two candidates, in many ways, are starkly different.\Navarro, a native Oregonian, is 30, Hispanic and a member of the Democratic party. He's a veteran with a felony marijuana charge on his record. He struggled with mental health issues following his time in the service and has gone through addiction recovery. He's divorced, and is the father to five children.\Navarro earned his GED, some college credits and a welder's certificate. He's worked in several sectors, including fast food and manual labor industries. He now works to support veterans through the nonprofit Project ABLE.\Navarro has no publicly-elected political experience. He supports Oregon measures 107, 108, 109 and 110 on the November ballot.\Post was born on an Air Force base in Arizona but has spent much of his life in Oregon, including having lived in Keizer since 1995. He did not serve in the military. He is 59.\Post and his wife have one son and a daughter-in-law. Post has a high school diploma and bachelor's degree, as well as a 40-year career in broadcast and radio.\Keeping his reputation as ""No Bills Bill,"" he opposes all Oregon ballot measures this November. He is a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump on social media.\But while the two candidates differ, they each feel he is the best person to represent the district. They've each adjusted to campaigning during the COVID-19 pandemic. And they each have ideas on how to improve Oregon.\When Navarro completed high school, he started working to help his mom pay the bills. He joined the military at 18, serving in the U.S. Army and on a deployment to Iraq.\""Once I got out of the military, I went through a rough transition,"" he said, explaining his mental health issues after returning from Iraq. He turned to alcohol and marijuana, eventually being charged with unlawful delivery of marijuana and coercion, and being sentenced to 18 months of jail time.\He now works as a program coordinator with Project ABLE, a nonprofit that provides peer support for individuals and veterans experiencing mental health challenges and ""co-occurring issues,"" such as homelessness and addiction recovery.\Navarro said it was programs like this that helped him realize he needed help and had to stop self-medicating.\Because of his past, Navarro initially didn't think he would be a good political candidate.\""There's this stigma that people with felonies ... there's no recovery. Their past defines them,"" he said. ""But that's not the case. I've dealt with my demons.""\He went back to school and attended Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, he said. And he said others encouraged him to run, telling him he's a ""great representation of what our community needs.""\Navarro said his life experiences would aid in policy decisions. He said there aren't many serving in office who can share first-hand the negative impact of some of those decisions.\For example, he said Measure 11 disproportionately impacts people of color, something he experienced firsthand in prison.\Measure 11, passed by Oregon voters in 1994, sets mandatory minimum prison sentences on certain crimes, removing the possibility for any reductions in sentences, including for good behavior. It also mandates juveniles ages 15 and older charged with the same felonies be tried as adults.\""In prison, I remember seeing a lot of Latino and Black people,"" Navarro said. ""My first thought was, 'Where did you come from?' I've lived in Oregon my whole life and I'd never seen as many people of color.""\Post planned to retire his political venture at the completion of his third term last year.\""Frankly, after the 2019 session, I really was done,"" he said. ""It was the longest, hardest, most contentious, most brutal session I'd been in, and I think Oregon had been in.""\But he said a ""whole lot of people,"" constituents and others, told him they wanted him to run again.\""Really, I'm running because people asked me to run,"" he said.\Post said he and other Oregon Republicans are excited at the opportunity to pick up more seats this year, arguing more would get done if there wasn't a Democratic supermajority.\""Being in the superminority, you're not super effective, no matter who you are,"" he said. ""If it's 38-22 and I want to pass my bill, I have to get nine Democrats to vote 'yes' on it. They need zero Republicans. So, who's reaching across the aisle more?""\""For me to pass a bill, that's monumental,"" he said. ""I better have some darn good communication skills and darn good interpersonal skills.""\Post takes pride in bills he pushed over the years that have had a significant impact, some of which took more work to get bipartisan support. One example he gave was the 2019 highway safety corridor bill, which is intended to make some of the deadliest highways safer for Oregon drivers.\House District 25 has historically been considered a safely Republican district. Even as the ratio between Democrats and Republicans has narrowed, Post said he has still won each time by a comfortable margin.\In 2018, Post won with 16,736 votes, compared to his opponent Dave McCall, who garnered 11,926 votes.\""A lot of this district is very conservative, whether you're a Democrat, an Independent, a nonaffiliated voter or a Republican,"" he said.\If re-elected, Post said he will take a third run at a bill he co-sponsored in 2017 that would allow Sudafed and other pseudoephedrine products to be sold behind the counter, rather than requiring a prescription.\He would also like to complete work on a bill from earlier this year to limit and regulate the sale of the herb kratom to minors.\Navarro, if elected, plans to focus on issues related to education, veteran support services and the environment.\He wants to add more options in public schools for career technical education courses, to improve education funding and to help reduce class sizes. He also wants to address veteran poverty, saying Oregon has some of the highest rates of suicide, homelessness and food insecurity among veterans in the country.\And he wants to address climate change by providing incentive programs to make it easier and more accessible for Oregon families and businesses to ""go green.""\Last year, Oregon Republicans held a walkout protest lasting nearly two weeks to halt voting on Senate Bill 1530, a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill.\Navarro said he hopes that doesn't happen again because ""nothing gets done that way.""\""I understand the other side saying they're not being included in the conversation,"" he said. ""But to me, that's what amendments are for. You should be trying to work with other legislators to make some effective change.\""If you're not happy with something, that's fine, but you don't abandon your post to make a statement,"" Navarro said. ""That's not something that would ever be tolerated in the military, and I don't think that's something that should be tolerated out here as well.""\However, Post argues, ""We had to.""\Post said Republicans only wanted one thing from the bill and that was for it to be put to the voters.\""I don't believe we should tax our way out of climate change,"" he said, adding he thinks incentive programs for businesses would be far more effective. ""I prefer the carrot over the stick.""\Navarro's campaign prides itself on being a grassroots effort. According to campaign filing reports, Friends of RJ Navarro has secured a total of $7,718 in campaign contributions as of Tuesday.\His campaign has received primarily cash donations under $100, with a handful of exceptions. The Safety and Justice PAC, for example, donated $500 and Yamhill County Democrats donated another $200.\He is endorsed by groups such as Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, the union known as PCUN, and a pro-abortion rights group, NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon PAC. Navarro said he is proud of the latter endorsement because he and his partner got help from women's health organizations when she miscarried.\Post estimates his campaign this year will cost about $15,000. Starting with a previous balance from last year of $37,533, the Friends of Bill Post committee has recorded a total of $87,151 in campaign contributions to date, according to the Secretary of State's Office filing reports Tuesday.\Finance activity shows several political action committees have contributed to Post's campaign in 2020, including Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, based in Washington D.C.\He also received a $2,000 contribution from the Timber Unity PAC and $500 from Law Enforcement for Responsible Public Safety, among others.\Navarro said he can speak to being Latino in Oregon, which his opponent cannot. The son of a teacher and migrant farmworker, and backed by various unions, agricultural workers, environmental and social organizations, he believes he can relate more to the district's constituents.\From his perspective, HD 25 is more politically diverse than people may realize.\""There hasn't been a supportive environment for democratic views to come forward,"" he said.\Navarro said some people have made comments about his age, with some assuming he's younger than he is. But in his nearly 31 years, he said, he's lived through a lot.\""Age shouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""I encourage anybody to run for office. If you're the most qualified individual, people will see that and vote for you.""\Post described Navarro as a great young man. He honored his service to the country as a veteran and applauded his ability to move on from a troubled past.\""Politically, he is not what this district is. He is not what this district votes for, traditionally (and) historically,"" Post said. ""I think he's a little on the radical side. But I do wish him all the best.""\For more information on Navarro and his campaign, go to ramironavarro.org.

63,"In the past year, climate change has been in the news on a daily basis. Advertising campaigns are now all about ""being green."" One thing is certain: It's hard to be much greener than Salem Electric.\Only three states have a lower carbon footprint than Oregon. As a member of Salem Electric, you are using electricity that is 97 percent carbon free. Your co-op purchases power from the Bonneville Power Administration, which is primarily clean, renewable hydro power with a mix of wind and nuclear, with occasional emergency purchases, by BPA, of small amounts of gas and coal generation. It all adds up to affordable electricity and a very small carbon footprint. Salem Electric also purchases environmentally preferred power (wind) to offset 4.5 percent of the co-op's power needs.\Salem Electric has been very involved in discussions about climate change through our state, regional and national trade associations that advocate for consumer-owned electric utilities. Our message to elected officials is to focus on affordable, workable and sustainable programs to meet carbon objectives. Climate change is a global problem, and Oregon's electric ratepayers cannot solve the problem alone.\We have, however, been doing our part -- and more. Oregon electric co-ops have brought forward legislation to increase our energy efficiency and conservation programs in a way that makes sense for small utilities and rural communities. We believe this approach is superior to a complicated, bureaucratic cap-and trade program that will simply drive up the cost of electricity and create wealth for Wall Street speculators.\Oregon co-ops are proud of our record of providing reliable, affordable electricity while protecting the environment. It's harder to be greener than your electric cooperative. But we're always trying. Please contact us if you want to learn more about ways our efficiency programs can save you electricity and money.\Robert J. Speckman is the general manager at Salem Electric. He can be reached at se@salemelectric.com."
64,"Oregon lawmakers heard testimony Tuesday on three bills that would set a price on carbon emissions in Oregon.\House Bill 3250 would be the nation's strongest state-level effort against climate change, according to Oregon Climate, a Portland-based advocacy group that developed the concept.\The bill would put a price on emissions and send the revenue directly to Oregon residents. Oregon Climate estimates each resident would receive between $500 and $1,500 per year.\""Oregon's role in this global crisis is to build the model that inspires federal action,"" Dan Golden, Oregon Climate's policy director, said in a written statement. ""HB 3250 is a revenue-neutral proposal: it would prove that the climate crisis need not be solved on the backs of low-income families.""\Oregon is aiming to cut greenhouse emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and by at least 75 percent by 2050.\Last year, former Gov. John Kitzhaber pledged that Oregon would join California and British Columbia in putting a price on carbon emissions.\Another bill under consideration, HB 3252, would emulate California's cap and trade system, which sets an overall emissions cap, then auctions off emission credits, which can be bought and sold.\And HB 3252 would phase in statewide greenhouse gas emission limits.\People hoping to testify on the bills packed the hearing room as well as two overflow rooms, and submitted pages of written testimony.\""Oregonians are already paying for climate change, through damaged shellfish, lost snowpack and increased wildfires,"" said Kristin Eberhard, senior researcher at Seattle-based Sightline Institute. ""Climate models predict that, without urgent action, the Oregon drought could morph into something like the California mega-drought. It's time to act.""\The legislation is supported by three dozen Oregon environment and natural resource economists, who submitted a letter in support of the bills.\""We see carbon pricing as an absolutely critical market-based step to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Don Negri, an economics professor at Willamette University.\Associated Oregon Industries testified against the legislation, saying climate change is a global problem.\""Whatever we do in this state may not change the trajectory,"" said Mike Freeze, AOI vice president. ""Oregon businesses, ratepayers are going to be forced to pay for that non-change.""\Rep. Phil Barnhart, sponsor of one of the bills, addressed that issue in his testimony.\""Oregon is a very small place in the world,"" Barnhart said while referring to the third bill, HB 3470. ""Why are we talking about a bill like HB 3470? I submit it is because we have an obligation to do our part.""\tloew@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6779 or follow at Twitter.com/SJWatchdog\CREDIT: Tracy Loew"
65,"Jeff Merkley is sort of like the U.S. economy: He's at the bottom, working his way up. In Merkley's case, the bottom has to do with the U.S. Senate's seniority system. But being a freshman senator hasn't curbed his determination to help improve Oregon's economy.\Merkley has a seat at the table for some of the most important issues coming through the Senate. He has been appointed to four committees:\-Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which will deal with whatever health-care reform comes out of Congress.\-Environment and Public Works, which will tackle highways and carbon cap-and-trade legislation.\-Banking, Housing and Urban Development, which will handle everything from Wall Street regulation to transit.\-Budget, which sets the framework for overall federal spending.\As he told the Statesman Journal last week, ""I'm going to be very busy.""\With a gloomy economic forecast looming for the rest of this decade, Merkley is focused on helping boost the housing sector. That would greatly benefit Oregon, as many of our manufacturing, construction and related jobs are tied to housing.\Merkley noted that mortgages have become so convoluted that many borrowers don't know who owns or operates their loans. But it benefits all sides if a borrower and a lender can renegotiate the loan terms to avoid foreclosure. The borrower gets to stay in the house; the lender makes at least some return on its loan.\Government, Merkley said, can have a positive role in encouraging the renegotiation, and possibly the reissuance, of loans.\As a freshman senator, Merkley doesn't have the influence of senior senators.

Note: Obama administration taking a regulatory route
\
In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming - and that it had shirked its duty by not doing so.
\
The Bush administration just kept fiddling: Yes, climate change is a serious problem, but more study is needed. Capping greenhouse gas emissions would wreak havoc on the economy. The Clean Air Act is the wrong tool for the job. The Supreme Court didn't really mean what it said. Besides, what's wrong with arctic shipping lanes and longer growing seasons for vegetables?
\
The Bush administration succeeded in running out the clock on its second term without taking a single meaningful action to arrest or reverse global warming. Meanwhile, it did everything in its power to prevent other countries, Congress and individual states, including Oregon, from acting to address climate change on their own.
\
Now, the Obama administration is about to change the tune.
\
Last month, President Obama ordered the EPA to reconsider a request by California, Oregon and a dozen other states to put in place tough new limits on emissions from cars and trucks. On Feb. 17, Lisa Jackson, the EPA's new administrator, said she will review the Bush administration's decision not to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. One day later, she said she will consider acting on the Supreme Court's decision that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act.
\
The Obama administration's shift comes as scientists are warning that the pace of global warming is exceeding earlier predictions. That's because industrial greenhouse emissions have surged more quickly than expected as a result of increased burning of coal in developing countries. Meanwhile, surprisingly large amounts of carbon dioxide are being released into the atmosphere as the result of self-reinforcing ""feedback loops"" that are speeding up natural processes, such as the melting of arctic permafrost.
\
President Bush's response to such warnings would have been a categorical refusal to do anything that might further stress an already overstressed economy. But Obama refuses to buy the spurious argument that what's good for the environment must be bad for the economy. The economic stimulus package recently approved by Congress includes tens of billions of dollars to create green jobs, many of them in Western states such as Oregon that have positioned themselves to become the nation's renewable resource basins.
\
Obama understands that an economic downturn is no excuse for standing down on climate change - and that it provides an opportunity to create new clean-tech industries and jobs that cannot be outsourced.
\
But regulatory changes should be just the beginning for the Obama administration. Eventually, Congress must take its rightful ownership of this complex issue and put a price on carbon-based fuels through either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.
\
But smart, effective regulation is a necessary first step. It will induce automakers and the energy industry to start making the technological changes that are both achievable and necessary to reduce emissions. Eventually it will prod Congress into action, as industry lobbyists push for a comprehensive federal climate policy that spreads the burden of reducing emissions more evenly among all polluters.
\
Then there's the matter of the law and a landmark Supreme Court ruling that the Obama administration, unlike its predecessor, appears unwilling to ignore.
"
70,"Supporters of a bill to cap carbon emissions in Oregon gathered Tuesday at the state Capitol for a noon rally that organizers said was the largest ever backing the proposal.\About 1,000 people from across the state showed up for the event, which took place just a few hours before lawmakers were to debate the bill in committee.\""I think it's imperative to stand up for the planet,"" attendee Diana Huntington, of Eugene, said.\The event followed a similar rally by opponents last Thursday, when hundreds of loggers, truckers and farmers staged a multi-city truck convoy to Salem, then rallied at the Capitol. An estimated 2,000 people filled the Capitol steps and mall.\That event was staged by Timber Unity, a group that formed last June to help kill similar legislation.\The proposal, Senate Bill 1530, would impose an economy-wide cap on carbon emissions, charging the state's largest polluters for emissions over the cap.\""The urgent need for bold climate action is underscored as our communities experience the impacts of the climate crisis — like the flooding in Eastern Oregon right now and the longer, more intense wildfires of the past several years,"" Renew Oregon, a coalition of groups supporting the bill, said in a statement.\""Voters overwhelmingly support holding large, corporate polluters accountable for the climate pollution they put into our air and investing in clean energy projects and building up our communities to withstand the climate crisis,"" the group said.\Protesters last week said the bill would increase fuel prices and put many companies out of business.\At Tuesday's rally, speaker Eric Richardson implied opponents have been ""duped"" by corporate polluters.\""Rural people and marginalized communities and communities of color are on the front line of climate change. We do this for you,"" said Richardson, executive director of the Eugene/Springfield NAACP.\Timber Unity officials did not immediately respond to an interview request Tuesday.\The rally concluded with a march around downtown Salem.\Attendees also were urged to sign a petition in support of a proposed ballot measure that would fine legislators with unexcused absences, and prohibit political contributions form being used to pay fines or legal fees or replace an absent legislators salary.\The proposal is a direct response to the Republican walkout last year, said Lamar Wise, a paid signature gatherer.\Democrats have been trying to pass a carbon cap for more than a decade, and came close last year, when the House approved HB 2020. But a walkout by Senate Republicans killed the bill.\The Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources held three marathon public hearings on the 2020 bill last week.\It held a work session on the bill Tuesday, where members began discussing nearly two-dozen proposed amendments. That discussion will continue Thursday, committee chairman Sen. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, said.\Unlike during hearings last week, the hearing room was nearly empty.\Contact the reporter at tloew@statesmanjournal.com, 503-399-6779 or follow at Twitter.com/Tracy_Loew\Inside\Senate GOP leader says timber deal with environmentalists demoralizing to caucus. 3A\Debby McGee, left, and Patty Hine, both of Eugene, dance with a banner as about 1,000 carbon cap-and-trade bill supporters rally at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem.\ANNA REED/STATESMAN JOURNAL\CREDIT: Tracy Loew"
71,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Jeff Merkley has positioned himself to play a potentially pivotal role on clean-energy legislation that Senate Democrats hope to consider this summer.\The caucus will meet privately today to consider what course to take to reduce the nation's dependence on fossil fuels, which environmentalists say is having a global impact on the climate.\Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says he wants a clean-energy bill to pass this summer, but a clear consensus has not emerged about what to do.\The House approved sweeping climate-change legislation a year ago that would regulate industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., have co-authored similar ""cap-and-trade"" legislation but acknowledge that they don't have the votes to pass it.\The Senate Energy Committee has proposed an alternative that provides industry incentives to promote alternative energy use, but environmental advocates say it does too little.\Enter Merkley.\The Oregon Democrat on Monday unveiled an aggressive energy conservation plan that he claims would allow the U.S. to wean itself off foreign oil in two decades. The plan relies heavily on boosting electric cars and mass transit.\""Certainly this will be a very significant caucus, and hopefully we will have the caucus come together around a more aggressive efficiency strategy,"" Merkley said.\Merkley unveiled his plan during a speech at the Center for American Progress, saying it would save 8.3 million barrels of oil per day -- more than the 7 million barrels that the U.S. imports daily from overseas.\On Tuesday, Merkley hosted a press conference in the Capitol, where the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy released a report calling on senators to consider aggressive energy efficiencies in whatever energy bill they consider.\""If they really juice up and expand efficiency, we can get real benefits,"" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the council.\Merkley is proposing a greater investment in electric vehicles, particularly in developing better batteries and the infrastructure to get those batteries recharged. The nation also needs to improve the efficiency of trucks and encourage more cargo to be shipped by rail, he said.\Merkley also thinks that a NASA-like administration is needed to provide the leadership needed to turn goals into realities.\The National Council on Energy Security could be a game-changer, according to David Roberts, a writer for Grist magazine, which focuses on the environment.\""The NCES would ensure that energy goals don't get lost from administration to administration,"" he wrote. ""They would monitor progress, determine whether things could be moving faster, and make recommendations to the president and Congress. This, more than anything else, would count as elevating oil reduction to genuine national priority.""\Merkley, who's in his first Senate term, he has emerged as a leader on energy conservation, said Frank Maisano, an energy expert with Bracewell & Giuliani, a law firm in Washington, D.C.\""He has inserted himself into that position,"" Maisano said.\Merkley has sponsored legislation to promote energy-efficient homes and commercial buildings as well as loan guarantee programs for rural power suppliers to shift away from coal or oil to geothermal or biomass fuels to generate electricity, he said.\""These are the types of programs that have wide bipartisan support and make sense,"" Maisano said. ""They are going to be a big and important part of what this Congress can do once they come to the realization that the votes just aren't there for Kerry-Lieberman.""\Contact Peter Urban at purban@gannett.com"

Bush finally acknowledges greenhouse effect
\
President Bush is reportedly a movie buff with a weakness for action flicks, so maybe the recent Hollywood schlockbuster ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is partly responsible for a new administration report that, for the first time, blames emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases for global warming.
\
If that's the case, then Bush needs to watch the movie again and this time pay more attention to those disaster scenes. While the new report to Congress by the secretaries of energy and commerce and the president's science adviser finally acknowledges that warming trends are caused by heat-trapping gasses, it inexplicably advises against taking any ""regulatory action.""
\
Then again, Bush's silence may actually be a blessing. Two years ago, an administration report to the United Nations acknowledged that greenhouse gas emissions might play a key role in global warming, and Bush snidely dismissed the findings as bureaucratic fluff.
\
But the question remains: How does the Bush administration issue a report concluding, for example, that perennial sea ice in the Arctic has declined by 9 percent in each decade since 1978 and then offer no support for immediate and mandatory controls on emissions?
\
Come to think of it, there's really no need to watch disaster movies to become alarmed about global warming. There's plenty of evidence all around us. Bush might start by reflecting about last summer's European heat wave, which killed more than 30,000 people, or the unprecedented monsoons in India and Bangladesh this spring that killed 2,000 and left more than 30 million homeless.
\
Temperatures across the world, including here in the United States, are breaking records. Droughts, famines, hurricanes and floods are all on the increase. Swiss Re, one of the world's largest re-insurers, recently warned that global warming is helping to double the cost of natural disasters, which could hit $150 billion a year in a decade.
\
Four years ago, candidate Bush called for mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions. After he was elected, he reversed his position and refused to join most of the world's nations in signing the international Kyoto accord to control carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, the administration has put voluntary initiatives in place that lack both the backbone and bite needed to make a difference.
\
Now, Bush is a candidate once again. In the weeks to come, his opponent, Sen. John Kerry, should challenge Bush to join him in committing to a comprehensive national policy to cut greenhouse emissions.
\
Strong bipartisan support already exists in Congress for legislation introduced by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., that would set a nationwide emissions limit for the utility, industry and transportation sectors, which produce four- fifths of U.S. global warming emission.
\
The bill also would reduce carbon dioxide through a cap-and- trade formula that would allow companies to either lower their own pollution or buy emission allowances from other businesses.
\
The administration has finally joined the rest of the world in recognizing that the buildup of greenhouse gases is having grave impacts on our environment.
\
That's a good start. But recognition without action fails the leadership test.
"
73,"
For the past four years, Republicans in Congress have done everything they could to deny the Environmental Protection Agency the money it needed to run its programs and the authority it needed to regulate pollutants ranging from mercury to greenhouse gases.
\
They failed - and the main reason was the agency's bulldog administrator, Lisa Jackson. She refused to abandon her agenda or her defense of the Clean Air Act and other landmark environmental statutes.
\
Jackson, the first African American to serve as EPA administrator, announced Thursday that she is stepping down as the Obama administration's chief environmental watchdog. ""I will leave the EPA confident the ship is sailing in the right direction,"" said Jackson, who reportedly is a candidate to become the next president of Princeton University, where she received one of her two degrees in chemical engineering. She also has been mentioned as a possible candidate for governor of New Jersey, where she once ran the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
\
Jackson's laudatory self-assessment is well warranted. Under her impressive tenure, the EPA established a scientific finding that carbon dioxide and five other gases that contribute to climate change qualify as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. That historic ""endangerment finding,"" which has withstood the fossil fuel industry's court challenges and an all-out assault by GOP lawmakers and some coal-state Democrats, enabled the EPA to set aggressive new emissions standards for cars and light trucks. In March, the EPA proposed emissions limits for new power plants, making it nearly impossible to build heavily polluting coal-fired ones. Earlier this month the agency finalized tougher limits for emitting fine-particle soot from smokestacks, wood-burning stoves and diesel vehicles.
\
Along the way, Jackson's ability to withstand political broadsides earned the grudging respect of her fiercest critics. Sen. James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who calls climate change a ""hoax,"" professes grudging regard for Jackson, who led the administration's push for action to deal with risks associated with rising global temperatures. He's called her ""one of my favorite liberals.""
\
Jackson had less generous critics on the left, some of whom blamed her for the administration's inability to fully deliver on the sweeping environmental promises that President Obama made in his 2008 campaign. But those critics failed to take into account the unexpected challenges posed by the implosion of the nation's economy and the extraordinary opposition by Republican lawmakers who incorrectly insisted that environmental protections threatened the nation's economy. Jackson also had to deal with Obama's political advisers, who often showed dismayingly little enthusiasm for environmental issues.
\
Jackson had disappointments along the way. She pushed for a cap-and-trade bill to limit greenhouse gas emissions while allowing companies to buy pollution credits from those under the limits. The bill passed the Democratic-controlled House in 2009 but died in the Senate. A federal court rejected the EPA's limits on industrial pollution crossing state lines.
\
Obama will have a hard time finding a replacement for Jackson, who will be remembered as an unrelenting, politically savvy proponent for public health and the environment.

74,"As a local resident, businessman and parent, I share the concerns of many who are alarmed about the unprecedented threat posed by global warming to our environment, economy and our children's future.\The impact in Oregon is real. A glance at old photographs of glaciers on Mount Hood is shocking - some have completely melted away!\Scientists estimate a 50 percent reduction in the average Oregon snowpack by the 2050s, meaning less water for farms, fish, recreation and drinking. In some streams, salmon and steelhead are already experiencing stressful and even lethal water temperatures above 70 degrees.\Many in Congress support reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But what's the best method? A carbon tax, new government spending on clean energy sources, or voluntary reductions?\I believe that a cap-and-trade system is best because it puts a clear limit on carbon emissions and gives us targets. This approach caps the total amount of global warming pollutants generated.\That cap will be gradually reduced, and polluters who reduce emissions below their cap can sell their unused allowances to others, creating incentives to reduce emissions without government spending and new taxes.\Such a solution was on the table last week in the U.S. Senate. The Climate Security Act (CSA) - co-sponsored by Sens. Lieberman, Warner and Boxer - would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 70 percent by 2050, beginning in 2012. We would cut emissions gradually by about 2 percent every year to reach the goal.\But because of a filibuster, the Senate didn't act on the legislation. And if Congress delays even two years, we'll need to cut pollution at twice that rate.\Economic analyses of the CSA conclude that we can afford to fund new investments in clean energy technologies while growing our overall economy. In fact, President Bush's Department of Energy predicts the CSA would not impact economic growth. Further, the CSA would decrease oil imports by more than 8 million barrels a day by 2025, saving more oil than we currently import every day from OPEC countries.\The CSA would also help create opportunities for Oregonians to continue to drive innovation by adding to the ""green collar"" jobs already created in wind, solar and biofuels. Salem is already home to Oregon's only commercial biodiesel production facility that truly produces energy by using locally collected, used cooking oil as its primary feedstock.\The Willamette Valley is a magical place for growing things, and Oregon universities are on the cutting edge of energy research. Our local farmers and foresters can provide cellulosic feed stock for ethanol instead of the wasteful shipping of corn around the country chasing subsidies.\Our congressional delegation has a wonderful opportunity to push this legislation.\John Miller of Salem is president of Wildwood/Mahonia, a group of Salem-based companies involved in agriculture, urban design and development and biofuel production.

75,"""The harsh reality is future generations will judge, not on the fact of global climate change, but on what we've done to tackle it.""\Gov. Kate Brown\Gov. Kate Brown told Salem business people Monday now is the time — while Oregon's experiencing a strong economy and steady job growth — to push through innovations for schools and health care.\Brown made it clear to the audience of nearly 200 at the Salem Area Chamber of Commerce luncheon that challenges remain for Oregon. On her list: Reducing class sizes; creating more affordable housing; and establishing long-term funding for the Oregon Health Plan.\It's a list state legislators are already well-versed in. Her 30-minute presentation, which included taking questions, came in the home stretch of the 2019 Legislature.\On health care funding, she said one piece of her proposal that's no longer in play is a financial assessment on employers with 50 or more workers that don't offer insurance benefits.\""We're going to set it aside,"" Brown said. ""That may get some cheers from the audience.""\""Frankly, the proposal's not ready,"" she said. ""We couldn't get the support from the business community.""\Across Oregon, about 94% of adults and 98% of children are covered by insurance.\Other sources of revenue for the health care plan include a $2-a-pack tobacco tax increase.\Brown also stressed the need for affordable housing, noting that the state's past investment of about $300 million ""felt like a drop in the bucket.""\Brown's seeking a $400 million investment that is aimed at children and families, homeless veterans and communities with an inadequate housing supply. Brown said a lack of market-rate housing has stopped economic growth when businesses want to expand.\Meanwhile, Democrat-sponsored cap-and-trade gas emissions legislation is needed to preserve Oregon's environment and prepare future generations for the impacts of climate change, Brown said.\""The harsh reality is future generations will judge, not on the fact of global climate change, but on what we've done to tackle it,"" she said.\However, Brown said her effort has ""lost support from left-wing organizations"" who don't back her market-based approach to reducing greenhouse gases.\Brown faced audience questions about the state's taxing strategy, including House Bill 3427, which would put billion in business taxes into public schools with a gross receipts tax. The House has passed it.\Questions centered on the fairness of a gross receipts tax on businesses instead of a tax on profit margins and the long-term future when another recession impacts tax revenues.\""I think it is a good solution for Oregon,"" Brown said, adding that her office looked at different models for the proposal.\Brown also said investing in infrastructure and workforce development is needed to close the gap so employers can continue hiring.\""The challenge is finding good skilled employees,"" Brown said.\Brown also faced questions about whether the business tax should include resale certificates that would lessen the impact on the construction industry.\But she suspects there will be language to fix technical issues, adding ""this legislation has been a compromise.""\Ben Botkin covers Oregon state government.

We won't reverse climate change. But we will make a start.\So on Tuesday, do one new thing:\-Leave the car in the garage and take the bus or walk to school or work. You'll save gas; pollute less; ease traffic congestion for a day; take up one less parking spot at your destination.\-Change one room's worth of lightbulbs to the low-energy kind, if you've been putting off this chore. You'll lower your own electric bill and help postpone the day when the Northwest must build new power-generating plants.\-Recycle one thing more than you are used to. Start a compost pile for kitchen scraps; take that old computer monitor to a recycling station; start saving foam cartons for the next collection day. You'll create less burden for Marion County's trash burner or landfills.\-Buy some of those cloth bags for shopping, and remember to use them. You'll save the energy that goes into manufacturing paper or plastic bags, transporting them to stores and getting rid of them after a single use.\-Start noticing stormwater. Apply pesticides and fertilizers sparingly; avoid doing this chore before expected rain. Pick up pet waste. You'll help the health of the watershed you live in.\Sure, they're small things.

Hope is growing that, working together, we can shift to clean energy before climate change has irreparably damaged the ecosystems that sustain our economy and quality of life.

It's no longer a question of ""if"" we should act, but ""how."" This month, top energy officials from 23 of the world's largest economies joined business leaders and elected officials for the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial in San Francisco to share solutions.
\
With the world's attention on the West Coast, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and the leaders of Washington, California and British Columbia gathered to sign an agreement to move forward with ambitious ideas to build on our climate successes, supercharge our clean economies and slash the pollution from our region.
\
Known as the Pacific Coast Collaborative, these three states and one province make up the fifth-largest economy in the world, serving as a powerful example of leadership.
\
A top priority: account for the true cost of pollution, and hold polluters accountable. While California (with a cap-and-trade system) and British Columbia (through a carbon tax) have begun this work, Oregon and Washington must also design and pass plans to achieve this major goal.
\
In Oregon we're showcasing the fact that environmental protections and a thriving economy are linked, not at odds. Since 2010, we've created more than 4,800 clean economy jobs -- a growth rate of 11 percent, higher than overall job growth. Our clean economy GDP was $7 billion in 2014 alone, and we're not done yet.
\
Oregon is leading with smart, forward-looking policies. The Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Act makes us the first state in the nation to remove coal from our electricity mix and replace it with renewable power. Our Clean Fuels Standard holds oil companies responsible for reducing their pollution and uses business innovation to give consumers more choices. These policies orient Oregon's economy toward the future, create the climate for job growth and innovation, and blaze a trail for other states to follow.
\
The Pacific Coast Collaborative leaders, and mayors from six large West Coast cities, pledged to transform vehicles, buildings, energy and waste to cut global warming pollution by 80 percent by 2050.
\
The agreement sets ambitious goals to build clean energy in communities and get more electric vehicles into families' driveways. It's a call to design more energy efficient buildings and homes that will eventually produce as much power as they consume. Just as cars are assigned miles-per-gallon ratings, we should rate buildings by how much power they use. We must do these things and more to achieve a clean energy economy.
\
The agreement also requires that we work to protect those most affected by climate change. Both urban and rural low-income communities need more access to clean energy, cost-saving technology and investment. The Pacific Coast Collaborative agreement brings new focus to guarding against forest fires, protecting our ocean resources, helping our family farms adapt to prolonged drought and limiting ""super pollutants"" such as black carbon, smog and methane to protect our health and our climate.
\
The message of the Pacific Coast Collaborative agreement is that city and state action matters. Local action will drive changes throughout the world. For example, Eugene Mayor Kitty Piercy represented us at a summit of world mayors in China this month, holding Eugene up as a global example with its pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2020 and to cut fossil fuel use by half, across the community, by 2030.
\
Hope is a starting point, not a solution. We need a strong sense of resolve as we find ourselves on the brink of another wildfire season -- after many years in a row where megafires broke records in the West for destruction and money spent to fight them. Firefighters lost their lives. Homes burned. Smoke choked our air.
\
Our snowpack is disappearing early despite the wet winter. Arid conditions and high temperatures will once again deprive our farms and forests of life-sustaining water. Extreme allergies and asthma -- triggered by high temperatures and air pollution -- create unnecessary suffering. Climate change affects our health, our economy and our communities.
\
The Paris agreement demonstrates a worldwide understanding of the problem and a commitment to fixing it together. Seeing diplomats, mayors, industrialists, farmers, doctors, nurses, workers and families come together to find solutions that will protect our environment and grow our economy inspires the hope and conviction that this problem is not beyond repair and that our local actions matter.

Congress should set a deadline for emissions ruling
\
In December 2005, California asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for a waiver allowing the state to impose stricter limits on vehicle emissions as part of its landmark initiative to combat global warming.
\
Nineteen months later, the EPA still hasn't given California an answer. The agency's inaction has left California, Oregon and 10 other states unable to put in place the nation's toughest regulations on tailpipe emissions.
\
That's unacceptable. The Bush administration's stonewalling of 12 states, along with several others waiting to see how the EPA rules before adopting the new standards, has gone on long enough. The Senate should approve legislation introduced by Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., that would force the EPA to make a decision on California's waiver request by the end of September.
\
Under the federal Clean Air Act, California can set stricter anti- pollution rules than the federal government, but only if the EPA grants a waiver. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has threatened to sue to force the EPA to stop its foot-dragging, but it could take months for the courts to provide resolution.
\
EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson recently told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is headed by Boxer, that he had committed to a decision by the end of the year. But he cautioned that the agency needs time to go through the 60,000 comments it has received on California's request.
\
No one should hold their breath. The Bush administration shows no signs of cooperating with individual states or Congress in restricting greenhouse gas emissions. It refuses to do so, even though the U.S. Supreme Court in May ruled that the EPA has the authority - and responsibility - to regulate heat-trapping greenhouse gases in auto emissions
\
There also are disturbing indications that the administration already has made up its mind on the waiver request. Even as the EPA was soliciting public comment on the waiver in recent weeks, the Department of Transportation secretly was lobbying members of Congress and governors to state their opposition to California's request. According to documents recently released by the U.S. House Oversight Committee, federal transportation staffers - using talking points prepared by a trade group representing automakers - called members of Congress and governors and urged them to register their opposition to the waiver.
\
Meanwhile, President Bush, the global warming ostrich in chief, has ordered federal agencies to develop proposals for regulating vehicle emissions and reducing fuel consumption by the time he leaves office in January 2009. That's solid evidence that he intends to run out the clock and leave the problem of global warming to his successor.
\
California and other states understand that delay is no longer an option. In addition to the new emissions standards that Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski put in place through an executive order last year, the 2007 Legislature approved one of the toughest renewable energy standards in the nation and set an aggressive goal of reducing greenhouse emissions in Oregon to levels that are at least 75 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Kulongoski also has joined with California and other Western states in devising a strategy for further reducing emissions, with discussions focusing on a regional cap-and-trade system that allows polluters to buy and sell greenhouse pollution credits.
\
As promising as these initiatives are, they're a poor substitute for a comprehensive federal global warming policy. If the Bush administration refuses to lead the way in creating such a strategy, then it should get out of the way and let the states do it on their own.
\
A good place to start would be for the EPA to approve California's waiver request. Congress should make sure that the agency issues its ruling before Oct. 1 by approving the Boxer- Nelson legislation.
\
Make EPA do its job

Congress should set a deadline for emissions ruling

Environment played key role in 2007 session
\
Oregon has no official state color, but the recently completed 2007 legislative session suggests green - a very deep shade of green - would be appropriate.
\
Not since the era of former Gov. Tom McCall three decades ago has the Legislature produced such an impressive roster of environmental legislation.
\
Topping the list was passage of a renewable energy standard that should reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming and help make Oregon a leader in clean energy technologies ranging from solar power to wave energy.
\
The product of years of tough negotiations and compromise, Senate Bill 838 will require the state's three largest utilities - Portland General Electric, Pacific Power and the Eugene Water & Electric Board - to obtain 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025.
\
In a last-minute concession, lawmakers regrettably dropped a requirement that medium-sized utilities meet the ""25 by '25"" requirement. Instead they'll be required to generate only 10 percent of their power from renewable resources. The change was unnecessary. The 25 percent mandate would not have imposed unworkable hardships on medium-sized utilities such as the Springfield Utility Board. But even with this compromise, Oregon will still have one of the most rigorous renewable energy standards in the nation.
\
Notable green legislative accomplishments also include:
\
A rewrite of the retrograde Measure 37 property rights law. The bill, which will appear on next fall's ballot as Measure 49, is a huge improvement over the original, and it gives voters a chance to turn Measure 37 into the law they thought they were getting in the first place - one intended to ensure that the little guy gets a fair break from the state's land use system. While it can be argued that lawmakers should have found a way to make these critical fixes themselves, the decision to put them on the ballot was a make-or- break compromise. It also shows proper deference to the voters who approved Measure 37.
\
A long-overdue update of the state's landmark Bottle Bill. Lawmakers expanded the law to require a 5 cent deposit on plastic water bottles. While many, including this newspaper, hoped for a more ambitious expansion, including an increase in the 5-cent deposit, the change should double the recycling rate for empty water bottles. The legislation also creates a task force that will examine ways of improving the bill in the future, offering hope that the next expansion will not be 36 years in coming.
\
Legislation requiring that all gasoline sold in Oregon eventually include 10 percent ethanol. Senate Bill 2210 also creates tax incentives for companies that turn agricultural and forest materials into biofuels for vehicles. Combined with the state's existing business energy tax credit, the new legislation gives Oregon one of the nation's most ambitious incentive packages for development of alternative fuels.
\
Passage of the Climate Change Integration Act, which sets a lofty goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon to levels that are at least 75 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The bill also establishes a permanent commission that will advise the Legislature on climate change-related policies, and develop programs that help the state's businesses and residents reduce greenhouse emissions.
\
A 12.4 percent increase in the budget of the state Department of Environmental Quality. With all the fanfare over other green legislation, this move received scant attention. But its importance is both practical and symbolic. After years of cutbacks, the agency will finally be able to hire the additional employees needed to monitor water and air pollution across the state.
\
Other legislation included a moratorium on drilling for oil, gas or sulfur off the Oregon Coast; a new program requiring manufacturers to provide free recycling for computers and televisions, and authorization of a DEQ study to identify toxins in the Willamette River and develop a plan to reduce those that pose the greatest risks.
\
It's a remarkable list, made possible by Democratic control of the House, Senate and governor's office - and, just as importantly, focused leadership from Gov. Ted Kulongoski, whose failure to champion environmental causes in the 2005 session rankled many conservationists.
\
The governor and Legislature must now find a way to carry this momentum over to future sessions. After years of legislative neglect, much remains to be done on the environmental front.
\
The No. 1 priority should remain dealing with climate change and working with other Western states to fill the void in federal leadership on the most critical environmental issue of our time. The next challenge should be to establish statewide or regional caps on greenhouse emissions, preferably as part of a market-based ""cap-and- trade"" system.
\
Another big challenge will be modernizing the state's decades- old land use program. Pressure to update the system may ease if voters approve the proposed rewrite of Measure 37 next fall, but the expected arrival of a million new Oregonians by 2030 makes a comprehensive update a necessity.
\
The Legislature should also establish marine reserves along the Oregon Coast to boost the recovery of dwindling fisheries and put in place a long-range program to clean up the Willamette River.
\
After a session of extraordinary environmental accomplishments, the Legislature should take a well-deserved bow - and then start preparing for the next session.

Note: Energy specialist Daniel Kammen shares his candidate's plans to cut carbon emissions and develop renewable fuels
\
The United States may be late to the battle against global warming and the move toward energy independence but decisive action can still save the day, a Barack Obama adviser who was stumping for the Democratic presidential candidate in Oregon said Thursday.
\
Daniel Kammen, senior policy adviser on energy and the environment, conducted town hall meetings in Eugene and Portland with a message balanced between fear and hope. On the one hand, the damaging effects of climate change; on the other, a raft of proposals that will cut carbon emissions, develop new sources of renewable fuels and clean technologies, and usher in an era of ""green-collar"" jobs.
\
Kammen knows a thing or two about those issues. He's a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in energy. He's the founding director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory that is affiliated with the university. And he's a lead scientist with the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, one of the groups that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore.
\
Kammen spoke to a group of about 50 students and community members at the University of Oregon for an hour. Some, such as Glen Spain, Northwest regional director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, wanted some clarity on local issues. Others, such as UO ROTC senior Christopher Hall, were there to support their favorite candidate.
\
""I feel like this is one of the first campaigns where my voice can be heard,"" said Hall, who has followed the Illinois senator since he was elected in 2004.
\
Obama promises an aggressive campaign that would cap and trade carbon to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050. He proposes a move to 50 percent renewable fuels by 2030.
\
""That's not a small or incremental change. It's huge,"" Kammen said. ""We have a reasonable shot at getting there, but not if we delay.""
\
Kammen touted Oregon as a leader in sustainability for efforts such as its renewable portfolio standards that will require the largest utilities to provide 25 percent of their electricity from clean, renewable sources by 2025.
\
He warned that meaningful change will require bipartisan effort. ""If we can't collaborate, we all basically cook the planet,"" he said.
\
He took some tough questions from audience members. Among the issues they raised: Obama's support for corn-based ethanol, China's booming coal-fired power plant industry, Oregon's salmon crisis and disputes over the location of liquid natural gas terminals.
\
Kammen acknowledged that corn makes a better food than a fuel and pointed to promising research that would turn algae and food scraps into fuels.
\
He said China suffers as much as anyone from its pollution problems, with its agriculture 30 percent less productive because of the impact of acid rain. With the United States showing the way in research and policy, China will follow, he said.
\
""The only way to get there is to be a respected international leader,"" Kammen said.
\
Regarding salmon, an Obama administration would not give the hydropower dams of the West a free pass simply because they're a clean source of power, Kammen said. Their impact on fish also would be a consideration, he said, adding that Obama is interested in so-called run-of-river dams that don't store water.
\
Liquid natural gas, the cleanest of the fossil fuels, still doesn't get the nation to its renewable energy goals but is an important step toward them, Kammen said. ""It's a better choice than coal or oil,"" he said, ""but you can't do it over the objections of local communities.""
\
Obama has been criticized by both of his opponents - Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton and Republican Sen. John McCain - for supporting the 2005 Clean Energy Bill, legislation that, among other things, allowed the federal government to override states in locating natural gas terminals.
\
But there are surprisingly few differences among the three presidential candidates when it comes to energy and environmental policies, said Jim Moore, a political science professor at Pacific University in Portland.
\
That makes it unlikely that the issues will come into play during the campaign, Moore said.
\
""It's important because everybody sees that it's going to be a change from the Bush administration,"" he said. ""But unless they tailor their message to specific Oregon issues, it's not going to have that much of an impact here.""
\
Spain, the fisheries advocate, said he was glad to see candidates tackle environmental topics.
\
Bush policies have so damaged salmon that environmental lawsuits have driven policy-making into the courts, he said.
\
""Right now, we have every major salmon river system operated by court order because of eight years of failed administration salmon policy. Anything has got to be better than that,"" he said.
"
82,"Hold polluters responsible for greenhouse gas emissions\The recent news from the Paris Climate Conference alerts us to the growing danger of human-caused climate change.\Much greenhouse gas comes from for-profit enterprises. These polluters often have little economic incentive to decrease their impact because it is cheaper to create atmospheric pollution than to use non-polluting alternatives. That shifts the ""cost"" of pollution away from the polluter and onto society -- us. The polluter saves the money while we are stuck with the bill of global warming. Shouldn't the polluter be held responsible to clean up their mess?\Oregon should follow the lead of other state and national governments in adopting a carbon cap and trade plan. Under these plans, polluters receive a license to emit only a limited amount of greenhouse gases or face sanctions. Companies that don't use all their credits can sell them to other companies in need. Total credits decrease annually, capping emissions and providing polluters with an ongoing incentive to cut their pollution.\Sen. Edwards is proposing such a plan for Oregon in the upcoming legislative session. We should adopt it and shift the clean-up cost to the polluter as a cost of doing business.\Gary Wallmark\Salem\Remember leaders who deny global warming at election time\Global warming is real. It's happening now. And it's going to get way worse unless we do something about it.\We're already seeing record-breaking rain, heat and drought in Oregon. This is just the beginning of natural disasters if temperatures keep increasing because of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.\Yet climate change denial is widespread in this town. I can tell from letters to the editor in this newspaper, where readers either choose to ignore inescapable scientific facts or don't understand them.\More disturbingly, the same seems to be true of our city leaders. Salem needs a mayor and city councilors who both grasp basic truths about global warming and realize that local policy decisions should reduce rather than increase greenhouse gas emissions.\Yet in 2014 I wrote to them asking if they believed global warming was happening, humans are mostly responsible and we need to do something about it. Only two out of nine top city of Salem officials said ""yes.""\The rest cowered in a science-denying hidey-hole, likely because they want to waste a billion dollars on an unneeded third bridge that would be hugely harmful to the environment. Remember this come election time.\Brian Hines\Salem\Don't celebrate Christmas? Fine, but don't destroy our holiday\If people are offended with the concept of Christmas, it's OK for them to start a new concept of their own. However, it's not fair for them to take on a dictatorial role in taking Christmas out of our holiday.\All we want is to be able to enjoy our Christmas.\We will be glad to let you enjoy your holiday, whatever that may be. Just don't piggyback on our Christmas.\Merry Christmas ...\James Mogle\Salem\Avoid fear-based selection of president; seek sober reflection\According to an April 2015 Pew Research report of over 25,000 people, 39 percent of people identify themselves as Republican or leaning Republican.\So, who are they?\They are overwhelmingly white, older, more male, less college educated and more have incomes over $75,000 than others.\The rhetoric of their candidates makes this much clear: They're fearful of Muslims, Hispanics, Democrats and government. Yet they support mass deportation of 14-plus million people by government agents and they seek broad government surveillance of another 3 million people and churches, based on religion. They abandon the Statue of Liberty in favor of walled borders and Christian preferred immigration. They actively pursue more war as a solution to our problems.\They are very, very scared.\This country should never select a president out of fear. Sober reflection, rather than runaway emotion, is the best way to find solutions to reduce conflicts at home and abroad.\If we succumb to fear, the result can easily be a police state, and the end of our democracy.\Bob Woods\Salem\Enlightened Theatrics show was exceedingly enjoyable\Hat's off to Jamie Rea, Enlightened Theatrics and the talented cast and crew of the clever, richly produced and exceedingly enjoyable ""The 1940's Radio Hour"" at the Historic Grand Theatre. This production -- and a full house midweek -- is yet another testament to the quality and depth of Salem's fine arts programs.\Eden Rose Brown\Salem\A successful Trump will alienate most of world, destroy US\In seminary I spent time in a Muslim community. My choice of the Muslim community was because I had misgivings about them, but wanted to learn more.\I'd read the Quran but missed the angry, bigoted, dangerous message that is touted by Islamic radicals. I talked to both women and men and came away from that experience grateful to see the real side of Islam.\Political theorists have opined that Trump's followers will continue to follow him no matter what he says or how outrageous he is. Why is this? Are his supporters sheep, just following the leader, or has he somehow hypnotized them? Can't they see that his lack of integrity has already disgusted many of our allies and alienated the potential support we have in the Middle East?\My fear is that if Trump were to be successful, he would alienate most of the world and bring about the beginning of the end of the USA as we know it. Most of the world hates us because of the power and riches we possess, so I don't think it would take much for them now to be supportive of the entire Muslim/Islamic world community -- thus potentiating the ultimate downfall of this country.\Janet M. Crumley\Salem\Erupting volcanoes could really mess up Obama's climate plan\The paper reports of the volcano Mount Etna erupting. This goes along with the not-too-distant past eruptions of volcanoes in Central and South America.\This has to be a major disaster to Obama's climate saving plans. I suppose he will swing into action and get laws passed in these countries forbidding them to have erupting volcanoes or perhaps he could spend large amounts of money getting Al Gore to construct some large corks.\Maybe he can come up with some scheme like he did in China and India to save the climate.\I have no bias against Democrats, I voted for Harry Truman after he authorized the dropping of two atomic bombs, saving an estimated million American soldiers. I voted all Republicans since then. Some were real dillies, but none as bad as Obama.\Howard Heinkel\Salem\Good to highlight issues and stir up public\Contrary to Lowell Smith's Dec. 11 letter, I applaud the editor, Michael Davis, for posting his commentary on the front page. In this dynamic and contentious presidential campaign (which began way too soon), I am pleased to see additional emphasis placed on the issues before the American public.\I would recommend going one step further and that is publishing ""PolitiFact"" daily on the front page from now until Election Day 2016. With the plethora of statements of questionable veracity espoused by all the candidates, an immediate fact check would provide for a more informed public.\Sometimes demand ""in your face"" opinions to stir the public.\As Michael Davis said, this is no time to be silent or neutral.\Archibald Millis\Salem"
83,"Hang on to your wallets, folks. It again appears that a majority of our inept and incompetent city council is ready to balance their budget by adding yet another charge or fee to our utility bills.\First, they added sidewalk fees. Then they added street light fees. Now they want to add a ""balance our budget fee."" These expenses should be covered by our property taxes as they are city services.\Public utilities commonly include items such as water, sewer, electricity, natural gas and sometimes telephone and transportation, like bus service. A ""balance our budget fee"" is not a utility and should not be added to our utility bills. A ""balance our budget fee"" is a perversion of what utilities are commonly considered.\By balancing their budget with an addition to our utility bills, the city council is denying folks the opportunity to deduct city expenses from their state and federal tax returns because while property taxes are deductible, charges for utilities are not.\My message to the city council: this dishonesty and deception must stop. Do your job, balance your budget and keep your grubby mitts off our utility bills.\Stuart Hirsh\Salem\In a Sept. 19 Statesman Journal article about the Covanta-Marion trash incinerator, Marion County Commissioner Kevin Cameron faulted ""whackos that are running things over there"" for the failure of a bill that would allow the incinerator to have renewable emergy credits for the electricity it generates.\What's ""whacko"" is the notion that burning trash is environmentally sound, renewable energy. It's dirty energy, with toxic emissions, and the incinerator is the biggest single source of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions in Marion County.\Marion County residents have higher charges for garbage than other Oregon places with comparable service because of the cost of running the incinerator.\We can do better by reducing waste, composting all of our food and yard waste, recycling what we can and burying what's left in modern sealed landfills like Coffin Butte.\Laurie Dougherty\Salem\The costs of the climate crisis are clear and present, causing damage from disasters like fires and hurricanes. Policy to reduce climate danger is being considered on the local, state and national levels.\Amid all of the press about Oregon's Cap and Trade bill this year, it may have been easy to miss that there is a bipartisan carbon pricing bill in the U.S. House of Representatives.\Economists, businesses, environmental groups and leaders from across the political spectrum are supporting HR 763, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. The bill has 63 co-sponsors, and I strongly encourage Oregon's District 5 representative, Kurt Schrader, to join them in supporting a bill that will be a game-changer in maintaining a healthy economy while creating a safe environment for ourselves and our kids.\Paul Justus\Salem\The Statesman Journal on Friday, Sept. 20, produced the following headlines:\Front page: ""Student assessments show low, declining test scores""\Back page: ""Students to skip school, fight climate 'emergency' ""\The front-page headline, unfortunately, addresses what a bunch of dullards we have as students in Oregon. The second headline points out that these knuckleheads would rather skip school than spend time in the classroom to improve their national test scores.\No way will Gov. Kate Brown, or these school administrators with fancy initials behind their professional names, accept blame for the poor performance of Oregon students. And who gets the blame for not utilizing our taxpayer-funded classrooms on a Friday? Student protests outside the classroom should take place on weekends.\The blame rightfully falls on the shoulders of the dunderheads who place absence from school ahead of national academic achievement.\Oh, you say it's time for more money for education? I'm sorry. I'm going to have to think about it.\Dwight Simpson\Salem\The recent student walkout over the global warming/climate change/climate crisis illustrates a sad state of mass hysteria.\Climate alarmists repeatedly tell us we have but a few years before it's ""too late,"" forgetting the fact that alarmists have been saying that for 40 years.\It is deplorable to see them now going after our children. Kids are now worried about world issues at a young age, an age they should be enjoying each day for what it is and having fun. Repeatedly clanging the climate alarm bells has children unhealthily upset and distressed.\Shame on you, all you climate Chicken Littles.\Michael Robinson\Salem\I want for my children and grandchildren what I was able to experience in my earlier years: a life that was blessed.\Certainly, we were aware of WWII, the Cold War, the threat of nuclear war and the Korean War. However, we felt safe. We learned the value of work and living a modest life. We always felt that we had enough. When did that change?\I could speculate the downward spiral began with the Nixon presidency and the Vietnam War. We rebounded. Then along came George W. Bush and our intrusion into the Middle East when we attacked Iraq.\Now we face the worst challenge of all: a person intent on obtaining absolute power, treating non-white people like the trash that he proclaims them to be. This person cares not about you and me. He does care about his supporters if they are completely loyal and obedient to him.\Is this the beginning of the end of this once-proud nation? Time will tell as we near the 2020 election. We can't afford to do it wrong this time. We must elect the right president and remove those in Congress that blindly follow the current president and his evil policies and desires.\Wake up and do the right thing.

Energy models for the proles
\
It's always great to get a lecture from green warrior Tom Friedman (Register-Guard, May 20). Poor Friedman is upset that President Obama missed a chance to ""end"" oil addiction. Is this the same Friedman who lives in an 11,400 square foot mega-mansion and whose family bulldozed 2.1 million square feet of pristine Hawaiian land to build a shopping mall?
\
The ever slippery Friedman seems to idolize the very sustainable Sen. John Kerry, owner of five large mansions, a private jet, a yacht and, when his wife lets him drive hers, the dreaded SUV!
\
Perhaps Friedman could refer the president to Al Gore, who just closed escrow on a villa in Montecito, Calif., which looks out over the steadily rising (21 feet, according to Gore) Pacific Ocean. Gore now has several large properties, handily cutting commute time in his private jet. Nine bathrooms and a huge swimming pool mean that the Gores will have more water than the Delta smelt.
\
Maybe Friedman could form a coalition to teach the proles sustainable living with other eco-activists such as Barbra Streisand (five homes on her estate in Malibu plus a 12,000-square-foot barn with air conditioning), Laurie David who suffers life in a 25,000-square-foot fixer-upper in Martha's Vineyard, or John Travolta with his fleet of private jets.
\
Even the soon-to-be-defenestrated Rep. Peter Defazio agrees that cap-and-trade legislation is a terrible idea. Maybe it's time to wake up and get this economy moving again!

Use existing building for vets
\
This area needs a veterans facility. No question. However, our government does not need to spend upwards of $40 million to build a facility from the ground up in order to provide for our veterans.
\
The hospital at 11th Avenue and Willamette Street in Eugene appears to be a perfect fit. If the criterion is room for expansion, then the hospital is 40,000 square feet larger than the proposed 100,000 square feet for the new building. If the criterion is a bus stop, the central bus depot is two blocks away.
\
This country is in terrible fiscal shape. It is wasteful and insulting to the taxpayer to spend this kind of money when a ready-made facility is on hand and retrofitting would be a fraction of the cost for a new building. Yes, we all like shiny new things. However, we need to be fiscally frugal in these hard times. Reinventing the wheel is not necessary or smart.

Check out Washington initiative
\
As candidates for state office discuss revenues and expenditures, they will, as goes the common wisdom, run into business community anger, most recently attributed to Measures 66 and 67 that voters approved last January. As during the 66 and 67 campaign itself, much of the rhetoric is knee-jerk anti-tax simplifications and generalizations, oft repeated. Advocates of Measures 66 and 67 have indicated that it is vital to expand the base of business support for continuing to rectify the instability and inequity of Oregon's revenue system. This strategy should be pursued within a framework of future-oriented, positive, evidence-based messaging, with business community sign-on.
\
The idea of getting value in state services - particularly, control of above-inflation cost drivers - is not an idea held only by the government-can-do-no-good crowd. Public officials at all levels should routinely emphasize efforts and successes in the continuous improvement (a quality-system term) of the efficiency and effectiveness of public programs. When audits reveal programmatic problems, corrective actions should be taken and publicized. A transparent, information-rich environment inoculates against ideologically driven attack and spin.
\
What's important is that the new governor and legislators not let the proclaimed ""scorched earth"" prevent them from continuing to vigorously engage the business community in productive dialogue about revenue adequacy, stability and equity.
\
Of great interest is what could be considered a sequel of Measures 66 and 67: the Washington state ballot measure, Initiative 1098, to create a high-tier income tax and provide lower-tier income and property tax relief, while more fully funding education.

Can't tell Latinos not to dream
\
Create an inclusive classroom where the individual differences of students are acknowledged and valued. Make it a place where students feel safe and challenged. Encourage them to pursue their dreams of a higher education. Teachers do this every day. It is what is expected of us.
\
I am a recently retired teacher. I return every week to my former high school in Eugene as a volunteer to tutor Latino students who are enrolled in the school.
\
These are bright, hard-working young people, some of whom may not have the legal documents to live in the United States. They will tell you how much they appreciate their teachers and how grateful they are to have the opportunity to learn. Like Eduardo, the young man featured in a May 23 Commentary article by Briselda Molina, many of them dream of one day going to college.
\
The message from the editors of The Register-Guard (editorial, May 23) runs counter to everything I know as a teacher. I should be telling them that in spite of being promising young students, they don't belong here if they don't have papers?
\
How can I tell them not to dream? I can't and I won't.

New lines will cause an accident
\
I am not sure whose idea the white lines were around the Lane Transit District bus station, but apparently it was approved by the city. Once again, someone who obviously does not spend a lot of time downtown made a decision without thinking it through. As an LTD bus driver, I think it is clearly a safety issue as well a traffic issue.
\
The city and LTD are not ever going to get rid of the loiterers, and now they've just put them in danger. Who decided it was a good idea to push them closer to moving traffic? Do the decision-makers have any idea how little attention those kids pay to moving traffic? None. I foresee a serious accident.
\
I'm sure the next move to fix this problem will be to ban smoking on the public sidewalks around the station. Then they'd not only be teetering precariously on the curb, but darting back and forth in traffic.
\
I find it ironic that the segregation lines between riffraff and humans leads right to the feet of Rosa Parks.

Yes to sewers, goodbye to Coburg
\
If Coburg residents say yes to the proposed $27 million sewer plant, they will be saying goodbye to Coburg as we know it today. Once committed to this huge investment, Coburg also will be committed to a future of growth. The city will have no choice but to grow as fast as possible to get new residents and businesses to help shoulder the debt.
\
Coburg residents enjoy a quiet, stable, small-town environment in a bucolic setting with a low cost of living. All of this will change. Current plans are for tripling the local population in the next 20 years. As soon as the sewer plant is approved, the city will start planning which tracts of farmland are to be added to the urban growth boundary for future annexation and development.
\
As a professional planner, I know that all this new development will generate new costs. Residents will see a steady stream of new fees, tax increases, bond issues, levies and local improvement districts designed to fund the new infrastructure that will be needed.
\
Coburg voters do have a choice. The world will not collapse if they say no to this sewer plant. A more modest plan can be developed that does not hitch the city to a future of growth, and instead keeps Coburg the charming and coveted small town that it is today.

Some breeders still inhumane
\
The Feb. 16 guest viewpoint by David Calderwood was very disturbing.
\
Calderwood made several good points and imparted some important information. It is very good to let people know the true nature of organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States, and the even more radical People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
\
Many people support these groups without knowing what the groups' aims really are. As an animal welfare advocate, I much prefer would having people support Greenhill Humane Society and other local agencies that actually help animals locally. On the national scene, I support Best Friends.
\
However, the radical agenda of animal rights groups has nothing to do with the puppy mill problem. I cannot follow Calderwood's leap of logic.
\
The inhumane treatment of animals by irresponsible breeders needs to be addressed by legislation. Paranoid ranting about radical agendas will not help the hundreds of unwanted pets born every day in this country.
\
I worked at Greenhill for four years and know firsthand that beautiful, healthy dogs and cats are being killed daily for no reason except overpopulation.

Free advice for the Democrats
\
If I could stealthily funnel advice to the Democrats, I'd start by urging continued efforts to slam through the federal takeover of health care by any means necessary. Ignore the swelling public opposition. Keep up the audible public snickering when you are asked whether your policies are constitutional. Dumb down the definition of socialism even further so the label can't stick to any of your legislative crusades.
\
Next, I'd advise cranking up the global warming alarmism every time the claim is refuted by new Climategate scandal revelations. Get that cap-and-trade bill through Congress and onto the presidential desk at all costs.
\
The obsessive Sarah Palin-slamming also must continue and be ratcheted way up. The left flank considers her an easy target, so take full advantage.
\
Same strategy for conservative radio and TV talk show hosts, and of course Fox (""not a real news channel"") News. Its growing audiences probably are composed of nonvoters anyway.
\
Don't stop insulting the tea partiers, I'd say, and definitely keep referring to them by that perverse sexual nickname that the old media reflexively picked up. That's been really effective - and clever!
\
I would suggest more printing and spending of mega-dollars that we don't have and never can repay. But I'd be afraid they actually would succeed before the November elections could stop them, further impoverishing the future children of my little grandchildren.
\
Of course, this self-destructing party doesn't need any such advice from me. They're obviously getting it all from their own consultants.

We can't change Afghanistan
\
Over the past two months, there have been three potential terrorist bombing attacks on our country that have been foiled by our diligent security agents. We owe them a debt of gratitude for a job well done.
\
Meanwhile, we are fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that were supposed to keep us secure. We are killing countless civilians and children, and destroying property because we can't isolate the terrorists from the general population. In many cases, the terrorists are a part of the normal population. Our killing of unsuspecting civilians with drones and missiles is itself terrorism, and it adds many bereaved family members to the terrorist ranks.
\
We cannot change a way of life in Afghanistan that has been going on for centuries. We are attempting to impose our way of governing on a culture that we know very little about and don't seem to care to understand. There are learned people who understand the problem, but the political and military entities that make the decisions and spend our money won't give credence to them. Instead, we hear the same old rhetoric and tired excuses that we've been hearing since the Korean ""conflict.""
\
The money that the current troop buildup ($30 billion) is costing would better be spent on solving the economic problems of Americans instead of squandering it on lost causes in Iraq and Afghanistan. When we leave Afghanistan, it will return to the tribal warlord culture that it always had, no matter what we do - short of occupation for many generations.

Accuser, too, deserves concern
\
University of Oregon football player LaMichael James may be guilty of the domestic violence charges against him, or not. Likewise, the alleged victim may have been screamed at, shoved and strangled, or not. The near-celebrity status of football players at the UO guarantees that our community is made fully aware of the consequences that James faces and the current steps that are taken to assist him in finding living arrangements and in continuing his classes.
\
Although unidentified, I hope that the woman in this case is not invisible to our community. Specifically, I hope that her friends, family and acquaintances will believe her - because not to do so will add to any trauma that she experienced. I hope that fellow students consider the discomfort she may feel because of the publicity of charges directed at a prized university athlete. I hope that university administrators and professors support her by allowing extra time for assignments and accommodating absences that might be needed for her to attend counseling or take care of obligations related to the case.

I hope everyone will keep this woman in mind to the degree that they do LaMichael James.

87,"Four years ago, a Republican won the race for Oregon's secretary of state — the first to do so since 1980.\Sen. Kim Thatcher, R-Keizer, is hoping to repeat that success this election, but also vying for the spot are Democratic Sen. Shemia Fagan of Portland and minor party candidates Nathalie Paravicini and Kyle Markley.\For Democrats, winning back control of the Secretary of State's office — paired with Democratic incumbents winning re-election in the other two statewide races — would once again give them control of every top elected position in the state.\For Republicans, winning a statewide seat during an era where Democrats are the dominant party in Oregon would be seen as a huge victory.\Among the secretary of state's responsibilities are overseeing Oregon's elections and auditing state agencies. They are first in line to replace the governor and are a member of the State Land Board.\As calls for greater election security and voter participation continue to grow louder, major agency failings capture headlines and a redistricting fight looms on the horizon in 2021, Oregon's secretary of state will play a pivotal role in the coming years.\""There's a lot at stake in this secretary of state race,"" said state political analyst Jim Moore, professor at Pacific University.\Republican Bev Clarno currently serves as secretary of state, having been appointed to the position after former Secretary of State Dennis Richardson died of brain cancer in February 2019. She pledged to not run for the seat.\Moore said Fagan is favored in this race, in large part due to the fact that there are far more Democratic voters in the state than Republicans.\Of Oregon's 2,924,292 registered voters, more than 1 million of them are Democrats — 35.7%. Nonaffiliated voters are the second largest group at 32.1%, and Republicans make up 25.7%.\Moore said a greater percentage of Republicans tend to turn out than Democrats — which helps the GOP's chances. Nonaffiliated voters participate at a much lower rate than either major party.\Democrat Shemia Fagan\Civil rights attorney Fagan joined the House of Representatives in 2013, and made her way to the Senate in 2019 by defeating a long-time Democrat incumbent in a contested primary.\She has pushed and voted for bills against the wishes of her party leadership during her time in the Legislature, and she said she will bring the same independence to auditing the state government.\Leading the audits division, Fagan said, she will focus on trying to improve the function of state government as opposed to playing ""gotcha"" with agencies.\""It's not about bashing services. It's about improving services,"" she said. ""I am committed to making sure that public services work best for the people who need them most.""\Fagan has been a part of efforts to expand ballot access and said that would continue in the secretary of state's office. She said she will expand Oregon's automatic voter registration system beyond the Department of Motor Vehicles to other state agencies to boost voter participation.\She will also work to change state rules to allow all ballots postmarked by election day to count. Currently, ballots only qualify if they arrive at a counting location by 8 p.m. on election day.\The state got closer to the goal of making every mailbox a ballot box, but ""we need to complete that,"" Fagan said.\She said that she supports efforts to expand voter access because those are inherently pro-Democracy. She said the secretary of state has a responsibility to push back on misinformation peddled about the elections or incidents of voter fraud.\""I don't believe that voting rights should be a partisan issue,"" Fagan said.\Fagan has raised more than $1.5 million for her campaign this year and spent $1.36 million, according to the latest available campaign finance data. Her largest contributors include unions and national progressive organizations, including Emily's List.\As of Oct. 9, she had about $230,000 in her campaign account.\Republican Kim Thatcher\Small business owner Thatcher said much of her work over the past 16 years in public office has been geared toward accountability and transparency in government.\""These are issues that relate directly to the secretary of state's office,"" Thatcher said.\She joined the House of Representatives in 2005 and served there for 10 years before winning the Senate District 13 seat in 2014. She won re-election two years ago.\Thatcher said that she would particularly like to make public records more easily accessible for Oregonians.\""Average Oregonians need to be able to follow the money,"" she said. ""They need to be able to find it out for themselves.""\In the short legislative session earlier this year, Thatcher carried a bill that would have improved the independence of the public records advocate position. The bill was among many that died after Republicans walked out of session in protest of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill.\Thatcher also said that the state needs to conduct studies into why voters don't participate in the electoral process and figure out ways to encourage them to vote. She said that strides have been made in Oregon to increase the number of voters, but the rate of participation could still improve.\While rates of voter fraud in the state are vanishingly low, Thatcher said an analysis of the system should be conducted so voters can have confidence that their vote will matter.\On audits, Thatcher said that she wants to use the office of secretary of state to ""get Oregon back on track"" after a challenging year that required government responses to COVID-19, historic wildfires, ongoing protests and a recession.\An audit into the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic would in particular be a ""target-rich environment,"" she said.\Thatcher has raised nearly $550,000 for her campaign this year and spent about $380,000, according to the latest available campaign finance data. She's received money from groups including timber companies, the Oregon Firearms Federation, Timber Unity and her own businesses.\As of Oct. 9, she has about $180,000 in her campaign account.\Progressive and pacific green Nathalie Paravicini\As a candidate representing the Progressive and Pacific Green parties, naturopathic doctor Paravicini is campaigning to bring more attention to the issues she cares about.\Chief among these is ranked choice voting, which is a system where voters rank candidates for office by preference instead of giving their vote to just one candidate. This year, Benton County is using ranked choice voting for applicable elections and there is some effort to expand the practice statewide.\""For me, winning is changing the political debate, in addition to getting to the office,"" Paravicini said. ""Making ranked choice voting something that everyone has heard of and a dinner table discussion, I consider that winning the election.""\Before moving to Oregon, Paravicini was involved in politics and community organizing in Texas, which included running for lieutenant governor in 2002.\She believes the Democratic party needs to be pushed in a more progressive direction, similar to how the Tea Party moved the Republican party further right.\According to Secretary of State records, Paravicini does not have a political action committee to raise or spend money on her campaign.\Libertarian Kyle Markley\The 2020 Secretary of State race marks the fifth time Markley has run for public office in Oregon. The four previous attempts were to represent House District 30, the seat currently held by Rep. Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro.\Markley did not return several attempts to contact him for this story.\On his website, Markley described the Secretary of State job as mostly administrative and said he would strive for independence in the role, saying Republicans and Democrats could not be trusted to act in an honest manner.\""As a Libertarian Secretary of State, I will hold both major parties in equal disdain and will simply work to improve systems impartially and without regard to political fallout,"" he wrote.\According to Secretary of State records, Markley does not have a political action committee to raise or spend money on his campaign."

Tracking health care costs
\
As our nation and Congress debate health care reform, conservatives are voicing concerns about the potential costs; whether reform is really necessary, particularly when we face so many other challenges; and whether this will have a positive or negative effect on our nation's economic recovery and job creation.
\
Taking the three objections in turn:
\
1. The Congressional Budget Office recently released estimates that universal coverage would result in annual health insurance premiums of about $5,000 a year, or $15,200 per family. Although this amounts to a $1.5 trillion price tag, it represents only slightly more than half of the $2.4 trillion we currently spend on health care. If you add all individual, government and private industry contributions, made either directly to providers or insurers, each American already pays almost $8,000 a year.
\
2. Because of demographic trends and expensive high-tech advances, health care costs are rising worldwide, especially in the developed world. But compared to our NATO allies, who spend 8 percent to 9 percent of their gross domestic products on health care, the United States spends almost 17 percent, and costs here are rising at almost twice the rate as elsewhere. At its current rate of growth, health care threatens in less than two decades to consume 25 percent of our GDP, costing a typical family not $15,000 but $36,000 and bankrupting taxpayers and private industry.
\
3. There has never been any direct link between the federal tax rate and investment and unemployment. Just look at the 1950s.

Cheney, Bush need a day in court
\
Like Roger Hite (Commentary, Dec. 20) I've served on juries. Unlike Hite, I don't compare this service to that rendered by soldiers in Afghanistan or Iraq. Most of our soldiers are not there out of a sense of duty. Rather, they were lured out of desperate situations into the armed forces by recruiters, who often make misleading promises of specialized training and placement. Most don't believe that they will come home mentally or physically crippled, but they do.
\
Those soldiers do not fight for ""our right to a day in court."" Afghanistan and Iraq never have represented a significant threat to the security of the United States. The terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks were Saudi Arabians and members of an organization with bases in many nations.
\
In the last five decades, the greatest damage to our constitutional rights was initiated by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and confirmed by a terrified Congress. Their unprecedented intrusions into personal privacy included warrantless wiretapping, global Internet monitoring and secret confiscation of library and bank records. They imprisoned U.S. citizens without charges or access to legal representation. Cheney institutionalized torture as a primary means of interrogating prisoners of war, which by his definition could include U.S. citizens.
\
Both men should have been impeached. There is little doubt that either could be found guilty of war crimes if they were brought to trial.
\
All citizens would breathe more freely if Bush and Cheney could have their day in court.

Keep all pets contained
\
In her Dec. 17 guest viewpoint, Betty Kang held pit bulls responsible for the death of her cat. But this was not a pit bull issue; this was an irresponsible-owner issue.
\
She wrote, ""Yes, we want irresponsible owners held accountable."" Absolutely, those dogs should not have been loose, no matter what their breed. But her cats should not have been out either.
\
People acknowledge that all dogs should be restrained securely by fence or leash. Why do so many think it acceptable for their cats to roam freely? As soon as a cat is let outside, it is in danger. As predators, cats pose a documented danger to native bird populations.
\
The feral cat problem is the result of irresponsible cat owners, just as overflowing shelters are the result of irresponsible pet owners. I agree with Kang: Loose dogs can be a big problem, and sometimes cause grievous harm for which their owners should be held accountable. The inarguable fact remains that, whether they have dogs or cats, when people choose to let their pets roam, they are subjecting them to the risks that are out there. For that, they must hold themselves accountable.
\
All pet guardians should keep their animals contained, for their own pets' safety and for the safety of others.

Government seeks total control
\
Totalitarians want to control your total personal universe, which is composed of two segments: everything from your skin outward and everything from your skin inward.
\
For a government seeking total control, nothing is more logical than enacting laws putting itself in control of both segments, arguing that government now has a financial interest in both and must rule for the masses, not the individual.
\
A lawmaking government responsible for the environment, controlling everything ecological and every energy transaction, is an excellent start on controlling everything from your skin outward. Small units of ""liberty"" to utilize energy in your external universe can become a currency, a medium of exchange, dispensed by central government in a new kind of controlled economy.
\
A lawmaking government responsible for health care, virtually controlling your internal universe, is more than a start on dictating everything from your skin inward. Every decision that might affect your body becomes the government's business, because of its financial stake in your health. So government must make those decisions for the good of the public at large.
\
The Washington majority made huge progress with the first half of this agenda pushing the cap-and-trade bill with its carbon credits, then temporarily set it aside to make time for the health care bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid considers that one his 2009 Christmas gift to us, which had to be wrapped up by Christmas Eve and then pounded, jagged edges and all, down our unwilling throats.

Don't lose track of the big picture.

Jesus and the ballot measures
\
Measures 66 and 67 would tax the rich for the common good (Register-Guard, Dec. 23). Voters must decide what principles will guide their decision.
\
A reader argues we should instead raise everyone's taxes (Brian Watts, letters, Dec. 20). But too many Oregonians are already poor. Should people out of work be made to pay more?
\
Of course not. That's why about 270,000 unemployed Oregonians will get a tax cut if the measures pass.
\
Can the already well-off afford a little more? During the economic cycle ending in early 2008, Oregon's economy grew at 4 percent a year, but the earnings of the highest-paid fifth outdid inflation by 9.5 percent. Estimated corporate profits rose from $8.9 billion in 2000 to $21.3 billion in 2007.
\
A letter writer praises an ""unselfish"" businessman for supporting the measures (Ellen Columbo, Dec. 15). But as Tim Berry pointed out (Commentary, Dec. 13), business support for the measures is just enlightened self-interest. Taxes support the infrastructure and services that enable businesses to operate, and profit. Fair taxation is not a ""job killer"" but is essential to having jobs at all.
\
When the infant whose birth is remembered at Christmas grew to be a man, he called upon us to live by these principles: If you have two coats, give one to your brother who has none. Give to everyone who asks of you. From each according to ability; to each according to need (Acts 5:34-35).

The message of the Hebrew prophets was the same. I'm going with them.

I hope you will, too.

89,"
Let's keep seven digits
\
A couple of weeks ago, I received a notice in my bill from Qwest that the Oregon Public Utility Commission had decided to create an overlay of a new area code in Oregon. A new area code for the state will float over the existing area codes and new numbers will be assigned the new code as the need arises.
\
All fine and good, as we undoubtedly need more numbers for those of us, discouraged by the marginal service offered by Qwest, who are flocking to an alternative means of communication.
\
But the downside is that we all will now have to dial 10 digits for every single number we call, so no more 485-1234 to get The Register-Guard, we now have to include the whole shooting match. For those who use automatic dialing, no big deal, but the rest of us, who use a phone book, scratch-pad or our memory to reference various numbers, this is going to be a hassle.
\
I would rather see the state split into another distinct area code, with Roseburg and south and maybe much of Eastern Oregon put into a unique code, which would allow us (and them) to continue to use the seven-digit phone numbers. Many states have done this. I would certainly rather learn a new area code for my home phone than have to start dialing dozens of extra digits every day.
\
If you are as outraged about this arbitrary action as I am, call the PUC in Salem and fuss at them.

No RV license is needed
\
The June 26 letter from Phyllis Atwood makes absolutely no sense.
\
There is no special license requirement for a private RV driver because none is needed. Statistically, RV operators have a better driving safety record than the general driving populace. Requiring a special license is solving a problem that doesn't exist. An irresponsible driver is dangerous regardless of the vehicle type, and an RV license requirement won't change that.
\
People of all ages drive all kinds of vehicles while using prescription medications, most of which don't cause driving impairment. What do medications have to do with RVs or their safe operation, as compared to other vehicles?
\
How does where a motorhome is built relate to driving safety? The new RV delivery people are professionals and probably safer drivers than the general public. Both Monaco and Country Coach are still in business, albeit under stress (a bit more attention to local facts would help) so you'd be even safer with their hired drivers on the road. Smaller-vehicle operators need to be aware of the size and mass of an RV just as they should be around commercial truck traffic. The only ""death trap"" is a poorly driven vehicle of any kind. The death of Kailee Coontz is a major tragedy, but it could have happened with any type of motor vehicle. It's not the RV's fault.
\
As an automotive journalist working with and driving RVs for 24 years, I speak from reasonable experience in the field.

Serial robbers show up in stats
\
The June 27 front page article about bank robberies in Eugene showed the annual up and down trend for that crime - 13 in 2004, 11 in 2005, 23 in 2006, 12 in 2007, 27 in 2008, and 8 in 2009. The presumptive sentence under state law for a defendant who has already been convicted of unlimited prior crimes and then commits a typical bank robbery is 15 to 16 months incarceration with eligibility for early release after about a year.
\
Well, no kidding. The statistic bounces up and down from year to year. Bank robbers have been serial offenders since before Jesse James. They commit a robbery, get locked up for a year, and then they get out and do it again. Recall the definition of insanity about trying the same thing over and over in expectation of a different result.
\
Which segues naturally to the article on the same front page about the Legislature. Salem is suspending Measure 57, which increases sentences and rehabilitation resources for repeat property offenders, and passed with 61 percent of the popular vote. Doubtless the Democratic leadership cabal reversed some initial naysayers by creating a politicians' dilemma of voting either against Measure 57 or against heightened sentences for drunk drivers and child molesters. That's fine, nobody likes those criminals either. But the next time someone breaks your car window to steal the change from your ashtray, just consider it a tax and be satisfied that at least somebody is seeking change.

Lots of dual purpose taxes
\
I like the sugar tax proposed in the June 28 Register-Guard. This ""lifestyle tax"" would serve the dual purpose of raising health care revenue and discourage unhealthy behavior. This excellent philosophy has proven to be successful with tobacco and alcohol taxes.
\
Why stop there? This system should be expanded to all aspects of society. On the next page a column suggests a dialogue on our counterproductive prison system. Instead of paying $24,000 a year to house and feed five times as many prisoners as other nations, why don't we use monetary fines to punish minor nonviolent offenses?
\
Of course violators would need drug rehabilitation, training and education, so they could get jobs and make wages we could garnish, but restitution and rehabilitation are vastly superior to and cheaper than the existing system of retribution, which results in more crime. We could pay for incarceration of violent offenders with taxes on guns, ammo, pornography, strip joints and drug use. Why don't we tax all of the companies that pollute, create toxic waste, or harm the environment in some way, both to discourage environmental damage and pay to for reversing climate change? A carbon tax would be much simpler and more effective than a cap-and-trade system, and the revenue could be given back to consumers to offset higher fuel costs. Why don't we have a small transaction tax to discourage leveraging, currency speculation, and the type of risky economic behavior that caused the financial meltdown? Reduce deficits by taxing fairly.

All should share Waldo
\
Waldo Lake needs protection. Including protection from the selfish exclusive wants of the elitist crowd. Waldo Lake is a beautiful place; wilderness it is not. Campgrounds and improved access were developed in the 1960s with timber money, the same money this county now so sorely misses. The three campgrounds on Waldo Lake are the largest in the entire Willamette National Forest; they have amenities for ""everyone,"" including handicapped accessible restrooms, trails and boat docks. You can even ride a bike around the entire lake; bikes are not permitted in a wilderness.
\
I have considered the Waldo area as one of my favorite places, having camped, hiked, biked, fished, hunted, paddled my canoe, motor-boated and snowmobiled over the entire basin. I have no problem whatsoever sharing this area with everyone who respects and enjoys this Oregon treasure. Why can't others share these experiences? Should the elderly, handicapped or those unable to row a boat or canoe be excluded from enjoying boating on this lake? Excluding someone from this pleasure is discriminatory. As I've said for years, if the issue is noise, then restrict motors to clean and extremely quiet four-stroke gas and electric motors. Due to the lake's size and tendency of sudden wind, electric motors will not guarantee a safe, timely return. Solution: Respect the area and everyone's rights. Otherwise, tear out the campgrounds and roads and give in to the elite.

90,"Four years ago, a Republican won the race for Oregon's secretary of state — the first to do so since 1980.\Sen. Kim Thatcher, R-Keizer, is hoping to repeat that success this election, but also vying for the spot are Democratic Sen. Shemia Fagan of Portland and minor party candidates Nathalie Paravicini and Kyle Markley.\For Democrats, winning back control of the Secretary of State's office — paired with Democratic incumbents winning re-election in the other two statewide races — would once again give them control of every top elected position in the state.\For Republicans, winning a statewide seat during an era where Democrats are the dominant party in Oregon would be seen as a huge victory.\Among the secretary of state's responsibilities are overseeing Oregon's elections and auditing state agencies. They are first in line to replace the governor and are a member of the State Land Board.\As calls for greater election security and voter participation continue to grow louder, major agency failings capture headlines and a redistricting fight looms on the horizon in 2021, Oregon's secretary of state will play a pivotal role in the coming years.\""There's a lot at stake in this secretary of state race,"" said state political analyst Jim Moore, professor at Pacific University.\Republican Bev Clarno currently serves as secretary of state, having been appointed to the position after former Secretary of State Dennis Richardson died of brain cancer in February 2019. She pledged to not run for the seat.\Moore said Fagan is favored in this race, in large part due to the fact that there are far more Democratic voters in the state than Republicans.\Of Oregon's 2,924,292 registered voters, more than 1 million of them are Democrats — 35.7%. Nonaffiliated voters are the second largest group at 32.1%, and Republicans make up 25.7%.\Moore said a greater percentage of Republicans tend to turn out than Democrats — which helps the GOP's chances. Nonaffiliated voters participate at a much lower rate than either major party.\Civil rights attorney Fagan joined the House of Representatives in 2013, and made her way to the Senate in 2019 by defeating a long-time Democrat incumbent in a contested primary.\She has pushed and voted for bills against the wishes of her party leadership during her time in the Legislature, andsaid she will bring the same independence to auditing the state government.\Leading the audits division, Fagan said, she will focus on trying to improve the function of state government as opposed to playing ""gotcha"" with agencies.\""It's not about bashing services. It's about improving services,"" she said. ""I am committed to making sure that public services work best for the people who need them most.""\Fagan has been a part of efforts to expand ballot access and said that would continue in the secretary of state's office. She said she will expand Oregon's automatic voter registration system beyond the Department of Motor Vehicles to other state agencies to boost voter participation.\She will also work to change state rules to allow all ballots postmarked by election day to count. Currently, ballots only qualify if they arrive at a counting location by 8 p.m. on election day.\The state got closer to the goal of making every mailbox a ballot box, but ""we need to complete that,"" Fagan said.\She said she supports efforts to expand voter access because those are inherently pro-Democracy. She said the secretary of state has a responsibility to push back on misinformation peddled about the elections or incidents of voter fraud.\""I don't believe that voting rights should be a partisan issue,"" Fagan said.\Fagan has raised more than $1.5 million for her campaign this year and spent $1.36 million, according to the latest available campaign finance data. Her largest contributors include unions and national progressive organizations, including Emily's List.\As of Oct. 9, she had about $230,000 in her campaign account.\Small business owner Thatcher said much of her work over the past 16 years in public office has been geared toward accountability and transparency in government.\""These are issues that relate directly to the secretary of state's office,"" Thatcher said.\She joined the House of Representatives in 2005 and served there for 10 years before winning the Senate District 13 seat in 2014. She won re-election two years ago.\Thatcher said she would particularly like to make public records more easily accessible for Oregonians.\""Average Oregonians need to be able to follow the money,"" she said. ""They need to be able to find it out for themselves.""\In the short legislative session earlier this year, Thatcher carried a bill that would have improved the independence of the public records advocate position. The bill was among many that died after Republicans walked out of session in protest of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill.\Thatcher also said the state needs to conduct studies into why voters don't participate in the electoral process and figure out ways to encourage them to vote. She said strides have been made in Oregon to increase the number of voters, but the rate of participation could still improve.\While rates of voter fraud in the state are vanishingly low, Thatcher said an analysis of the system should be conducted so voters can have confidence their vote will matter.\On audits, Thatcher said she wants to use the office of secretary of state to ""get Oregon back on track"" after a challenging year that required government responses to COVID-19, historic wildfires, ongoing protests and a recession.\An audit into the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic would in particular be a ""target-rich environment,"" she said.\Thatcher has raised nearly $550,000 for her campaign this year and spent about $380,000, according to the latest available campaign finance data. She's received money from groups including timber companies, the Oregon Firearms Federation, Timber Unity and her own businesses.\As of Oct. 9, she has about $180,000 in her campaign account.\As a candidate representing the Progressive and Pacific Green parties, naturopathic doctor Paravicini is campaigning to bring more attention to the issues she cares about.\Chief among these is ranked choice voting, which is a system where voters rank candidates for office by preference instead of giving their vote to just one candidate. This year, Benton County is using ranked choice voting for applicable elections and there is some effort to expand the practice statewide.\""For me, winning is changing the political debate, in addition to getting to the office,"" Paravicini said. ""Making ranked choice voting something that everyone has heard of and a dinner table discussion, I consider that winning the election.""\Before moving to Oregon, Paravicini was involved in politics and community organizing in Texas, which included running for lieutenant governor in 2002.\She believes the Democratic party needs to be pushed in a more progressive direction, similar to how the Tea Party moved the Republican party further right.\According to Secretary of State records, Paravicini does not have a political action committee to raise or spend money on her campaign.\The 2020 Secretary of State race marks the fifth time Markley has run for public office in Oregon. The four previous attempts were to represent House District 30, the seat currently held by Rep. Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro.\Markley did not return several attempts to contact him for this story.\On his website, Markley described the Secretary of State job as mostly administrative and said he would strive for independence in the role, saying Republicans and Democrats could not be trusted to act in an honest manner.\""As a Libertarian Secretary of State, I will hold both major parties in equal disdain and will simply work to improve systems impartially and without regard to political fallout,"" he wrote.\According to Secretary of State records, Markley does not have a political action committee to raise or spend money on his campaign.\Reporter Connor Radnovich covers the Oregon Legislature and state government.

Socialist references outdated
\
I was struck by Norm Fox's reference in the Nov. 23 Mailbag to the media's ""dumbing down of the definition of socialism so it would not be applied to Obama.""
\
Media references to socialism during the campaign followed John McCain's and Sarah Palin's attacks on Barack Obama as a socialist, Marxist and communist. Both are, as Bill Maher says, so last millennium.
\
What is dumb is that people still talk this way any more. I know it worked for Richard Nixon of ""We're all Keynesians now"" fame, but isn't this the point? Nixon founded a political career by going after Commies while he instituted wage and price controls.
\
Wall Street and Detroit beg for bailouts with no strings attached while trembling about the leftists descending upon Washington. The utter confusion extends to Rep. Paul Braun of Georgia who fretted publicly about an impending Obama-instigated Marxist dictatorship.
\
Braun's comments border on what Michael Shermer, in the same Commentary section, calls the cultic delusions of those who talk too much to people like themselves. Shermer advises that we listen to the other side once in awhile.
\
As someone who voted for Obama, I have been listening to Kathleen Parker, who seems to have followed the late William Buckley back into the wilderness. Parker is one conservative who refuses to yield her reason to those who purport to think like her and, from the sound of things, the same crowd is making her pay the price.

This experience made me feel like tossing my computer out the window.

U.S. has demonized Muslims
\
Jaymes May (letters, Nov. 20) asks the right question - ""What has become of America?"" - but provides the wrong answer.
\
May perfectly reflects decades of U.S. media propaganda dehumanizing and demonizing Arabs and Muslims, including more than 300 Hollywood films that have unrelentingly cast Arabs as fools or villains, culminating most recently in a hysterical, racist, Islamophobic DVD distributed in Sunday advertising supplements to 28 million households (thankfully not in The Register-Guard) to influence voters toward warmongering candidates.
\
Only the most gullible and historically naive buy the fiction that Islamic anger is about our way of life or different belief systems.
\
More realistically, perhaps it's because we have twice attacked Iraq which never did us harm, causing several hundred thousand Muslim deaths and over 4 million displaced Muslims, bookending 12 years of sanctions imposed upon their helpless population which, it is believed, caused about a million deaths, half of them children.
\
Perhaps it's because we used 9/11 as an excuse to unjustifiably attack two Muslim nations.
\
Perhaps it's because we deposed the democratically elected leader of Iran in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator there for 25 years, then supported Saddam Hussein in attacking Iran while covertly arming both sides in a genocidal war killing over a million Muslims.
\
Or perhaps it's our uncritical support of Israel's 60-year theft of Palestinian lands, destruction of Palestinian properties, brutal oppression and asymmetrical violence against Palestinians using American weaponry and our 41 United Nations vetoes blocking sanctions against Israel for violating international law.

Teens' kindness misunderstood
\
I am a senior at Sheldon High School and am involved in a group called the ""Random Acts of Kindness Club.""
\
Our goal is to make the world a better place and to spread happiness into people's hearts through random acts of kindness. One of our club's trademarks is we give a little business card to the receiver of our kind act, encouraging them to do something nice to someone else, and to pass it on.
\
We have given out free hugs at football games, raked the lawns of random people in neighborhoods and on Black Friday, we handed out cards at Valley River Center with a mint attached that said things like ""Have a great day."" The reactions for the most part have been positive.
\
However, we are trying not to be discouraged by some of the obstacles we are facing. While we were raking lawns, someone called the police because they thought we were breaking in. When we were giving out the cards and candy, security was called on us repeatedly saying that there had been complaints. We were asked to leave.
\
It's sad that people today do not believe that other people would do something nice for another person just out of the goodness of their heart, with no strings attached. When teenagers try to do something positive, we still get complaints.
\
We will continue our random acts of kindness and encourage everyone to be a little kinder to each other as well.

Better get to know Obama soon
\
Well, Democrats, wobbly-kneed Republicans and gutless moderates, you have elected Sen. Barack Obama as our next president.
\
I hope you grant him recognition for accomplishments and hold him accountable for failures. You're certainly not holding responsible those persons taking the world into this economic mess we're in.
\
What party mandated that our lending institutions participate in high risk loans? What is the party of the individuals mismanaging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into bankruptcy?
\
What party sits in committee leadership positions with oversight of those two institutions in the U.S. Congress? What party denied those institutions were in any trouble until just several months ago? What party rebuffed all attempts to heighten control of the lending practices of those institutions? That's right, put a big ""D"" after every one of those questions.

Remember high gas price habits
\
It's amazing how $4 gas has been able to change our driving habits in just a few months (Register-Guard, Nov. 22).
\
Suddenly, we became responsible adults, driving less, conserving energy, reducing greenhouse gases and reducing our reliance on foreign despots.
\
High prices encouraged conservation, which lowered fuel prices again. Will we return to our wasteful ways if gas prices stay low? To save the environment and cut our dependence on fossil fuels, we need to discourage their use by supporting Barack Obama's cap-and-trade system, or better still, a carbon tax.
\
The dark side of high fuel prices is that shipping and processing costs, and therefore the cost of food and everything else, increases, which is not helpful in a recession. We could keep costs down by subsidizing and encouraging the good forms of energy and transportation like trains, which are already hybrids, and by developing compressed air hybrid trucks using clean-burning natural gas.
\
We should subsidize biofuels from non-food materials like algae, which is hundreds of times more efficient than corn.
\
Why stop with carbon caps? Why don't we impose green taxes to discourage the use of toxic chemicals, poisons, and everything else that damages the earth? This would provide jobs, encourage the use of organic and sustainable products, and protect our disappearing wildlife and damaged oceans.
\
The extra revenue could be used to subsidize renewable energy, reduce income taxes on the middle class, or to reduce the national debt.

Downtown needs more people
\
The strange belief that tall buildings shoulder to shoulder will frighten vagrants away from downtown needs to be rethought. In big cities, police officers on foot, along with door attendants at each of those buildings, do the job.
\
It would be a lot more urbane and possibly cheaper to provide such a permanent human presence in downtown Eugene. Adam's Place does just that. The dark little safety building across from the Kiva doesn't quite do it. Something between that and the Saturday Market might.

Don't worry about teen caffeine
\
The article about caffeine usage by teens (Register-Guard, Oct. 30) was interesting in that right below the article was an ad for a study aimed at teenagers who get migraines.
\
The caffeine article didn't mention that a withdrawal sign from caffeine is headaches. It didn't mention ""tolerance,"" (one has to drink more caffeine to keep the headaches away).
\
It seems we are a society driven by a need to alter our mood by ingesting something. Then it seems we avoid looking at our compulsions by focusing on and then judging others for whatever is their mood-altering method.
\
We adults continue to model behaviors and then seem amazed when teens copy us. Some of our parents said, ""Do as I say, and not as I do."" I would rather have kids drink legal speed than do the illegal stuff. If one has to alter their mood, caffeine might be a lesser of evils (I love coffee).
\
Adults who worry about teens drinking coffee and other kinds of energy drinks are probably the same ones who get all hopped up on caffeine. These are probably the same adults who complain about cars speeding in their neighborhoods and then they themselves drive a million miles an hour in other people's neighborhoods.
\
Please slow down, no matter what you ingest. Eugene used to have more courteous drivers, who didn't honk just because they were annoyed at another driver.

Clear-cutting is like strip mining
\
The Oct. 29 article ""A Clear-Cut Solution"" doesn't provide very many solutions, except for mill owners.
\
Research has shown that diverse, old forests prevent disease, resist fires and provide the best habitat for animals and plants. Turning our forests into a mono-crop, with a single cloned species, is inviting disaster.
\
With global warming we should preserve our diverse forests and plant more drought-resistant trees, so more trees survive the coming changes. Our water is becoming scarce, and our fish endangered. We need to protect watersheds more, instead of decreasing the buffer zones around streams.
\
Using herbicides after a clear-cut to eliminate all trees and vegetation in an area results in loss of habitat, loss of topsoil, landslides and pollution of our water. Use of Round-up-ready crops is creating herbicide-resistant weeds. The same is happening with pesticides. We should minimize spraying, eliminate clear-cutting altogether, and go back to the selective cutting programs that worked so well before. Clear-cutting is like strip mining and is not sustainable.
\
Instead of more roads, we should investigate sustainable, small- scale logging, like horse logging. This provides more jobs and protects the environment. We should cut only the diseased trees, or those in need of thinning. Clear-cuts create fire dangers. Our communities do need more funds, but instead of government handouts, they should advocate a cap-and-trade carbon offset program, where polluting industries would pay for planting more trees to absorb their carbon dioxide and pollution.

At least one real man in Eugene
\
Though the general tone of the letters to the editor in The Register-Guard sounds like the moaning of the deep depression ward at the local mental institution, there is an occasional contrasting note which still offers some hope for the population of our sister city across the broad Willamette.
\
In this case, the contrast is provided by two letters published on Oct. 29. The first features the whining of a young man, Benjamin Morales, whose complaint is that the armed forces recruiters are pestering him. That's a situation - if it is true - which will be soon solved when the military reads his letter and realizes they have been trying to buy a pig in a poke.
\
The other letter offered the intelligent, manly observations from Steve Hawke, which immediately followed the missive of the neurasthenic adolescent.

I appreciated having Hawke show that Eugene is not populated solely by anti-American, anti-war, anti-everything aunties masquerading as men.

Lender using sleazy tactics
\
While others are having difficulty obtaining new mortgages, I'm being bombarded almost daily with junk mail and telemarketers representing my lender, one of the largest in the country and the subject of many recent articles.
\
While I'm lucky enough to have good credit and solid equity in my home, I'm appalled by the sleazy tactics my company is using to convince me to pay in the neighborhood of $5,000 in refinancing costs. They mention that my loan is coming up for a re-fi shortly (it doesn't re-fi for nearly three years) and that a payment increase will occur. My rate is tied to a government index and they couldn't possibly know what that index will be in three years.
\
I encourage others to beware of this scam from a supposedly respectable financial organization who is driving this good payer away when or if I ultimately choose to re-finance.

Bureau of Land Management ""ecologist"" Richard Hardt, with his hard hat and cold calculations, wants to triple logging on Oregon's public lands.

He assures us that this is not sub-prime mortgaging the future, because they've ""modeled it out for 400 years."" Sure they have, but I prefer my own model.

I think that once every millennium there is either a cultural high point or a social breakdown. Four hundred years from now will be one millennium since the beginning of the European Renaissance, and two millennia since the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

I think 2400 AD may bring a massive environmental crisis or an ""invasion"" by foreigners buying up huge parts of this country. Naturally, we can't be sure of anything that far in advance, but if the sky really does start falling on the heads of our descendents, it will take a lot more to save them than a yellow plastic hat.

Loudest game? Oregon/Cal 2005
\
I work as an audio engineer at the Hult Center for the Performing Arts, and in the same capacity for ABC/ESPN Sports whenever they come to the Willamette Valley for telecasts.
\
I have worked on the field holding a parabolic microphone (the ""big dish"" that is hand held on the sidelines to capture the sound of tackles being made) for the past eight seasons, and I have some observations regarding Mark Baker's Oct. 27 article on the decibel levels during football games.
\
I have made it a habit to carry a decibel meter during games I have worked, as well as at Hult Center events. For comparison, most classical music concerts come in around 80 decibels (dba) constantly at my mix position, which is more than 90 feet from the stage.
\
The single loudest football audio I have ever measured was during the 2005 Cal/Oregon game when Oregon stopped Cal on fourth down in overtime to win the game. I measured 117 dba from the Cal sideline (30 feet from the nearest sound source) when the pass fell incomplete.
\
Another loud peak came during the blocked kick on the final play of the Oklahoma game - 112 dba - despite the absence of a large segment of the crowd. The Michigan game was constantly over 108 dba.

Specter joins a better party
\
I am delighted with Sen. Arlen Specter's decision to join the Democratic Party (Register-Guard, April 29). While I am not a Democrat, between the two major parties, Democrats better exemplify concern for the environment and the welfare of the majority of the people, not just the wealthy.
\
For those reasons I am, as always, delighted by Specter's forthrightness. Even when I've disagreed with him, I've had great respect for his opinions. He seems to be his own man while watching out for the rest of us.
\
It's not so much that Specter switched sides; it's that the Republican Party has moved to the far right and joined hands with the most extreme of its ilk.
\
It must be increasingly difficult for the most reasonable men and women of the GOP to justify staying with a party that increasingly is the party of the wealthy, the gullible and the hard-hearted.

Nuclear power has problems
\
Christopher Calder (letters, April 25) takes me to task for not supporting nuclear power as the solution to climate change. He blithely ignores the huge issues of costs, safety and waste disposal.
\
He must have missed the Washington Public Power Supply System debacle here in the Northwest. Four massive nuclear plants were abandoned mid-construction due to the huge cost overruns. WPPSS is gone, but not forgotten; every month about 15 percent of our local electric bill goes to pay for that disaster.
\
He missed the premature closing of Trojan because of serious safety issues that added costs to utility bills.
\
He must be unaware that there is no long-term, safe storage plan for high-level nuclear wastes. Trojan waste still sits on the banks of the Columbia River.
\
And he ignores the huge taxpayer subsidy of nuclear power. The industry says it is perfectly safe but can't afford to operate unless the government caps its liability and assumes all costs above that cap in the case of a disaster.
\
Yes, despite his disdain, I believe that conservation and renewables, including advanced biomass, are a big part of the solution. New technologies and fuels at a competitive price are on the horizon, and we should invest in the research to bring them to fruition.
\
I do agree with Calder on the potential disaster of a market-based cap-and-trade scheme. I support an alternative approach based on regulation with a cap and scheduled reduction, as we did with the successful Clean Water Act.

Future may ice Obama's cake
\
Christopher Calder's letter of April 25 states that Democrats have been misled on energy and that they risk losing control of the White House and Congress. Well folks, we've all been misled on energy for decades or more, so let's try expanding our horizons beyond the Middle East for a while.
\
The Democrats' longevity does not depend on nuclear energy. In four years, the economy and unemployment will determine the fate of the president and other Democrats. Since no one can guarantee their re-election, including President Obama, my guess is that he will pass everything on the agenda he promised during his campaign.
\
With more control in both houses, a filibuster-proof Senate and the Republicans in disarray, this new president now can pass practically anything he wants to and deliver on those campaign promises in his vision of the country's future. If his programs work and the economy improves along with the job growth he predicts, he will be re-elected - and then we'll get to see the best part yet, folks! A very popular lame duck president putting the ""icing on the cake.""

Staircase needs protection
\
The Coast Range in Oregon had, at one point in its history, some of the most wild and rugged wilderness in the country. However, there is precious little left as it once was. The biggest remaining area is the Devil's Staircase, north of the Umpqua River near Elkton.
\
Recently, I had the amazing experience of bushwhacking my way through 10 miles of rough terrain to get to the Devil's Staircase waterfall, through some of the most rough and beautiful forest that I have ever seen. My group made its way through the forest, without the benefit of a trail, by using trails of elk that wander the ridges and valleys in the area.
\
This area needs permanent protection as wilderness, and Rep. Peter DeFazio has become its champion. With his help, we can save the Devil's Staircase permanently and keep at least a piece of Oregon as it used to be.

He knows the territory well.
\
Sorenson grew up in our district and knows this entire area better than anyone else. He's been our state senator and a Lane County commissioner who's been re-elected three times in a row without opposition.

Forest practices affect proposal
\
Missing from the discussion about Seneca Sawmill Co.'s proposal to build a cogeneration biomass plant in northwest Eugene (Register-Guard, April 29) is the company's forest practices on its private lands - which may well rival the slash-and-burn policies of lawless Third World countries.
\
Clear-cut the forest, burn the slash, spray with chemicals, repeat. Seneca and other giants in the timber industry have transformed the storybook rain forests of Oregon's Coast Range into homogenous tree farms, which has greatly contributed to the compromise of the region's renowned biological diversity.
\
Seneca also buys the rights to log older forests nearby on our public land, such as the highly controversial Trapper timber sale above our treasured McKenzie River on the Willamette National Forest, and the towering rain forests of the little-known Elliott State Forest near Reedsport.
\
Creating locally produced energy with a waste product is arguably a good concept, but the cheerleaders for the project haven't told you the whole story. If this project is going to be billed as sustainable, drastic reform of the company's forest practices must be a priority.

95,"After more than a decade of the supposedly eco-friendly Pacific Northwest and British Columbia falling short on pledges to fight climate change, a new blueprint emerged last month for how to eliminate all but a sliver of fossil-fuel emissions.\The 428-page plan by Washington state outlines how to make a wholesale shift to renewable energy and meet some of the most ambitious climate-protection goals on the planet. It calls for building a regional network of solar and wind energy stations and transmission lines allowing sharing of power across the western U.S. and Canada.\Much of that renewable energy would be used to produce hydrogen, replacing fossil fuels used by trucks, ferries and industrial facilities, among others.\""We are really primed to move,"" said Eileen V. Quigley, director of the Clean Energy Transition Institute, which was hired by the Washington Department of Commerce to sketch out how to most cost-effectively transform the economy from fossil fuels to clean energy.\Quigley's institute commissioned sophisticated modeling from San Francisco-based consultancy Evolved Energy Research, and also sought advice from more than 150 technical experts and community advocates and a 27-member state advisory committee.\Washington's plan calls for doubling the state's electricity supply through regional action.\""We can really do a lot in terms of keeping rates affordable and service reliable if we can operate the electricity system on more of a west-wide basis,"" said Glenn Blackmon, head of Washington's Energy Policy Office.\Strategies crucial to Washington's plans include universal broadband access, smarter land-use planning, and expanded public transit, all of which reduce energy demand by cutting down on travel in personal vehicles. And, for those fossil fuel uses that can't be easily plugged in, the strategy requires an entirely new industry: so-called ""green hydrogen"" produced by zapping water with renewable electricity.\Green hydrogen is a renewable fuel that can be stored and concentrated, providing a reliable stream of clean energy to replace coal and gas burned in concrete plants and other heavy industries, and to replace diesel in big vehicles such as long-haul trucks and ferries.\Energy experts worldwide see green hydrogen as a crucial building block for ""decarbonization,"" eliminating carbon-dioxide emissions that are a primary cause of climate disruption. For Washington, it also offers an economic engine for rural counties, according to Blackmon, who noted that utilities in eastern Washington with surplus hydropower already have ""aggressive"" plans to make green hydrogen.\Finally, the plan pledges state intervention to ensure that low-income and historically disadvantaged communities have access to capital to upgrade homes and businesses, for example, or to cover the up-front price premium on an electric car.\It's all economically affordable. According to the modeling behind the plan, spending on energy in a decarbonizing Washington would remain within its historic range, about 5% to 7% of the state's economy through 2050.\Cheaper renewable energy is already here\Accelerating development and use of renewable energy is also core to decarbonization plans in Washington's neighbors to the north and south, Oregon and British Columbia — a region that, taken together, is frequently dubbed Cascadia. Changing energy economics boosts the chances for success across the Cascadia region. Cleaner technologies keep getting cheaper.\These days equipment such as electric vehicles and heat pumps cost less than their fossil-fueled forerunners over the life of the products. Solar power's cost has plummeted more than fivefold since 2010.\And fossil fuels' purveyors have less grip on markets — and politicians — as demand for coal, oil and gas weakens and global protests erode their social standing.\""In 2007 we used to talk about Big Oil and King Coal. No one says King Coal anymore, and oil is faltering,"" said KC Golden, one of the founders of Seattle-based nonprofit Climate Solutions and a board member with international activist group 350.org.\The question is: Will Cascadia's governments actually follow through?\The challenge for Govs. Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington is finding dollars in COVID-tightened state budgets to accelerate carbon-cutting. Clean technologies often cost more up front, and it will take state money to speed up their deployment and ensure that all citizens benefit. But in both states, legislators who have long held up cost-effective climate policies remain in their seats.\British Columbia faces a very different challenge. Premier John Horgan's New Democratic Party secured a commanding majority in fall 2020 elections. But British Columbia has a growing oil and gas production industry that Horgan has personally championed as a source of jobs and revenues.\King Coal may be dethroned, and Big Oil weakened, but in British Columbia the oil and gas producers and their employees still carry clout, noted Karen Tam Wu, British Columbia director for the Pembina Institute, a Calgary-based climate and energy think tank. As Wu put it: ""The lure of royalties and the lobbying power of Big Oil is very strong.""\Decarbonization road map\Among the three government's plans, Washington's marks the most dramatic shift. The state that set Cascadia's weakest emissions goals over a decade ago raised its sights to world-class performance early last year.\The Washington Legislature scrapped the state's 2008 mandate, which called for halving emissions by 2050, from 1990 levels, which is barely half of the scale of reductions targeted under the Paris Climate Agreement. In its place, legislators approved an aggressive net-zero goal: only 5% of 1990-level greenhouse-gas emissions would be tolerated in 2050. (And even that 5% would need to be recaptured via reforestation projects or machines sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.)\Washington's new goals come with interim targets, too, starting with a 45% cut by 2030. That will require a lot of push, because recent modeling suggests that Washington could still be pumping out the equivalent of 84 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2030. The state's goal requires cutting emissions to 50 metric tons.\The new targets came without new authorities to actually drive carbon cuts, leading critics to declare the 2020 legislative session a ""comprehensive failure.""\And all signs point to rough politics ahead in the Washington Legislature this year. For the session that started earlier last month, Inslee is again seeking to pass new pollution-cutting programs with well-established opposition. One is a fuel standard — akin to those in place in Oregon and British Columbia — to ratchet down the carbon-intensity of Washington's gasoline and diesel fuels. Industry lobbyists in Olympia have repeatedly fended off such a low-carbon fuel standard. The governor also proposes a ban on natural gas heating in new buildings whose 2030 cutoff date is too late for some activists.\And the governor proposed some controversial means of raising revenues, including yet another push for ""cap and trade"" — a system of pollution controls and charges that has repeatedly failed in both Washington and Oregon's legislatures. That has split the Washington Legislature's climate-protection advocates, with some backing a rival revenue package combining a tax on greenhouse gas emissions and economic recovery bonds.\B.C.'s Gassy Carbon Bulge\Oregon Gov. Brown faces many of the same budget and authority gaps that have bedeviled Inslee. Not so across the international border, where Premier Horgan's parliamentary majority in the British Columbia Legislature gives him leeway to enact laws and raise Canadian dollars. However, his government faces a growing gap between emissions and its 2030 goals — a gap that is exacerbated by fossil fuel development.\For nearly a decade, activists across California and Cascadia defeated proposed megaprojects to export Western coal, oil and gas through Pacific ports. That so-called ""Thin Green Line"" of activism broke in British Columbia in 2018, partly due to Horgan, when the Trans Mountain petroleum pipeline expansion and a pair of natural gas megaprojects got green lights.\Trans Mountain moved forward when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nationalized the project. Horgan took credit for the gas developments: a C$17 billion liquefied natural gas terminal up the British Columbia coast in Kitimat, and a $6.6 billion pipeline linking it to northeastern British Columbia's gas fracking fields.\Oil and gas production contributed half of the provinces' industrial emissions in 2018, and have risen 8% since 2007. That's a significant challenge to British Columbia's goal to cut emissions 40% by 2030, compared to 2007.\In December, a government report said rising emissions from industry and transportation meant British Columbia could miss its 2030 target by nearly half.\Wu, of the Pembina Institute, called the recent report ""sobering"" — not least because it failed to spell out steps to close British Columbia's emissions gap, as the government had promised.\Calculations by the Pembina Institute confirm the long-term scale of the challenge. It found that a planned liquefied natural gas terminal in Kitimat would release the equivalent of 3 to 4 million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide per year. Emissions from producing and delivering its gas would add another 5 million tons. Translation: That one project could produce two-thirds of the greenhouse gases allowable in 2050 under British Columbia law.\George Heyman, British Columbia Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, offered no apologies during an interview last month with InvestigateWest. He said the province's gas industry, including LNG development, provides revenue for public programs and jobs. ""We thought there was some room within a credible climate plan for some development and we approved (LNG Canada) on that basis,"" said Heyman.\Heyman predicted that emissions-cutting programs legislated in 2018 would soon reverse British Columbia's rising emissions trend. Those include:\Tightening of the ""low carbon fuel standard"" that is trimming the carbon content of British Columbia's fuel supply.\Rebates for zero-emissions vehicles and a ban on new gasoline and diesel cars after 2040.\A mandated 45% cut in emissions of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas, by oil and gas producers by 2025 (compared to 2014).\British Columbia may also get a hand from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who recently vowed to ratchet up Canada's nationwide carbon tax requirements.\Starting in 2023, when releasing a ton of carbon dioxide should already cost polluters C$50, Trudeau promises to begin adding $15 a year to reach C$170 per ton in 2030. Heyman estimated that Trudeau's carbon tax boost could close roughly half of British Columbia's emissions gap.\Getting beyond business as usual\Activists are calling for more public pressure to keep Cascadia's leaders focused on climate action, citing signs of continued half-measures.\For example, take the new Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River between Vancouver, Washington, and Portland. Patrick Mazza, a longtime Seattle-based climate policy analyst and activist, noted that the states' plan for a larger bridge will accelerate sprawl from nearby Portland into Washington's Clark County.\""That is really a poster for the inertia of the past continuing into the present,"" says Mazza. ""We're not living in a climate emergency world. That has not been absorbed into the day-to-day operations of bureaucracies or most businesses.""\The Seattle-based Sightline Institute think tank recently called out a mismatch between state emissions goals and growth plans from Cascadia's gas utilities. Washington and Oregon's largest gas utilities, Puget Sound Energy and NW Natural, anticipate rising gas use through 2040. Burning gas currently causes nearly one-quarter of Washington's carbon emissions, and more than one-third of Oregon's.\Mazza played his part in the Thin Green Line movement, getting arrested blocking an oil train in Everett, Washington, in 2014. He landed himself in prison once again in 2019 protest disrupting a Chase Bank branch in Seattle. That campaign is viewed as having helped inspire Chase's recently announced plan to restrict financing for fossil fuel developments.\Mazza calls getting hauled off to jail ""the most valuable thing I can do today."" This year, however, he said Cascadia's politicians need to hear a more positive message amidst the ongoing pandemic and budget crises that threaten to stall climate action.\""'Kill fossil fuels' is a negative. We need a positive. Look at how many people are unemployed right now,"" said Mazza. ""Whatever we do has to have a huge jobs message.""\About the project\Getting to Zero: Decarbonizing Cascadia is a year-long project by nonprofit news organizations in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. Led by Seattle-based InvestigateWest, the project also will include contributions from The Tyee in Vancouver, B.C.; national news site Grist.org; Crosscut.com in Washington; and Jefferson Public Radio in Oregon."
96,"When Gov. John Kitzhaber signed a regional climate change agreement in October, he promised that Oregon would join California and British Columbia in putting a price on carbon emissions.\Now, lawmakers need to figure out how to make that happen.\The Legislature has allocated $200,000 from the general fund to study what a carbon tax or fee might look like here.\State officials have hired the Northwest Economic Research Center, led by former state economist Tom Potiowsky, to model the impacts of such a tax on various economic and geographic segments of the state.\One goal is to achieve the drastic greenhouse gas emission reductions necessary to meet the state's stringent targets. Oregon aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, and by at least 75 percent by 2050.\But more importantly, the tax or fee would create new state revenue that could augment or replace portions of existing revenues, backers told a legislative committee last month.\British Columbia imposed a carbon tax in 2008, starting at $10 per ton and increasing each year to its current price of $30, or about 25 cents per gallon of gas.\California recently adopted a cap-and-trade system. It sets an overall emissions cap, then auctions off emission credits, which can be bought and sold.\Oregon's scheme would be modeled on British Columbia's, said Jeff Renfro, senior economist at the Northwest Economic Research Center.\Oregon would ""repatriate,"" or give part of the revenue back in the form of corporate tax cuts, low-income tax relief, and targeted investments in certain industries.\""We're going to model the effect of taking that revenue and distributing it back to the economy in different ways, to figure out what the tradeoffs are between different repatriation scenarios,"" Renfro said. ""The centerpiece of the study is modeling what's going to happen to different industries in different areas when we increase their energy price.""\Business Oregon, the state's economic development arm, has been charged with identifying industries that would be favored under the plan.\The plan may be a tough sell.\""I'm pretty skeptical about this,"" Rep. Vicki Berger, R-Salem, said at the committee meeting.\""If we want to put a tax on carbon, we want to be sure not to hurt our existing industries or the poor,"" Berger said.\The Northwest Economic Research Center will present a final analysis to the Legislature in November 2014.\Washington's Legislature also has commissioned a report on options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\tloew@StatesmanJournal.com or (503) 399-6779\Online\See this story at StatesmanJournal.com/news to read a copy of the Northwest Economic Research Center's early study on a possible carbon tax or fee in Oregon.\ID_Code: J0-312150014"

Obama no longer has any credibility
\
President Obama has explained that he's going to help us again. Some of us are going to get a one-year reprieve on enrolling in Obamacare.
\
Lucky us.
\
The proverbial ""kick the can down the road"" is evident in the president's declaration. We're supposed to believe and be grateful.
\
Wasn't it Rep. Nancy Pelosi who said Congress should first pass the Affordable Care Act and then read it? Are we surprised?
\
We got exactly what they thought we needed. It wasn't important enough for them to read the act before passing it, let alone comprehend the contents.
\
Obama press secretary Jay Carney repeated the president's promise to fix things, confirming we can continue to purchase our existing health care insurance for another year. How did that change the ACA's failings?
\
Obama's using his executive powers to fix problems he was unaware of before Obamacare tried to go online.
\
Now we hear the warnings were known by the White House as early as March but we're supposed to believe the administration's feeble attempts are going to resolve the fiasco. That doesn't change any policy requirements - up until now my husband hasn't needed mammograms or birth control.
\
Wake up, America.
\
Obama has also touted the success of the Oregon Health Plan. Has anyone paid attention to that failure? Why should we believe anything he says? Backpedaling is the best he can do.
\
Our congressional representatives are the culprits who voted to impose the ACA's nonsense on our country, then were conveniently exempted from it.

ACA also helps the already insured
\
Thanks to Bruce Tufts for a rational perspective on the health care insurance controversy (letters, Nov. 19).
\
I'm fortunate to have coverage that doesn't change under the Affordable Care Act, but for decades I've been subsidizing the health care bills of others - both covered and uncovered - via the insurance plans my husband and I have carried throughout our lives.
\
We've paid family premiums to one insurance company or another to keep a family of four covered, and we have used it relatively rarely.
\
Such ""family"" coverage protects families of any size and also includes many services we've never used and, if asked, would prefer not to pay for.
\
We watch as premiums and co-pays go up year after year and realize it's part of a social contract. What the ACA is asking the rest of the people to do is to join the social contract.

More pollution will harm children
\
I talk to many people in Eugene about air quality and their health. This fall, Beyond Toxics completed its second large door-to-door survey in west Eugene. Among the trends we found, this one is troubling: 37 percent of the parents we interviewed said they judge the quality of the air before they allow their children to go outside and play.
\
Many parents are concerned about poor air quality triggering asthma attacks. What does that say about kids having opportunities to be active and enjoy all those outdoor experiences unique to childhood?
\
While parents worry about whether it's healthy enough for their kids to go outside to play, the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency is poised to allow the Seneca biomass plant to emit more tons of fine particulate particles into Eugene's air.
\
Why? Seneca discovered, belatedly, that its air pollution controls aren't as effective as first promised.
\
The company wants a new permit with more ""wiggle room."" Seneca wants to redesign the regulations to avoid violating its existing permit.
\
Exposure to fine particles exacerbates medical conditions such as asthma and causes chronic bronchitis and long-term lung damage. West Eugene children already have a very high incidence of asthma.
\
LRAPA staff admitted during a public hearing that it could deny Seneca a new permit but said the agency would give the company the higher pollution allowance anyway.
\
The people at LRAPA can't see beyond the banality of their bureaucratic approach. For them and Seneca, technicalities devised by corporate lawyers have priority over children's health.

Don't sacrifice the environment
\
Robert Samuelson's Nov. 18 carbon tax column was disturbing (""Carbon tax could ease climate, budget woes""). He enlisted economist Robert Pindyck to determine the effects of climate change; would he enlist a climate scientist to sort out a financial crisis?
\
Pindyck says climate feedback loops ""aren't easy to measure."" Thus, computer models may wildly overstate or understate the climate's economic ""damage function,"" he said, with Samuleson adding, ""We simply don't know. Ignorance reigns.""
\
Next, Samuelson cited Pindyck's proposal for a moderate carbon tax ""because there are certainly some ill effects"" (from ignorance to certainty in two sentences).
\
Later Samuelson mentioned ""alarmists,"" people who exaggerate danger and cause undue worry. I assume he meant the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
\
IPCC computer models generally don't include feedback loop formulas. The panel has identified only positive feedback loops that worsen the effects, it has found no negative loops that ease the effects, so its predictions generally underestimate the negative effects of climate change. Rather than being alarmists, the IPCC simply delivers truly alarming news.
\
Samuelson said inflicting economic pain on today's citizens to thwart climate change for future generations is an obstacle.
\
Who makes up future generations? Given a study suggesting that by 2047 the world will likely have a new climate compared to the past 150 years, those future generations include our children and grandchildren.
\
When economic push comes to environmental shove, Samuelson would rather support a doomsday economy than give his children and grandchildren a fighting chance for a habitable Earth.

Put limits on leaf blower noise
\
On Nov. 5, columnist Bob Welch wrote about an important issue too long ignored - excessive noise caused by leaf blowers in Eugene's neighborhoods.
\
I've complained to neighbors who hire them, but the responsibility lies with those who own the leaf blower companies and market their consistent destruction of our sound environment.
\
That's also where the solution lies, one that doesn't mean they have to go out of business.
\
There should be an ordinance that requires blower noise to be below a certain number of decibels.
\
That would limit their use unless they have mufflers similar to what we have on our cars.
\
We face varied challenges to our environment, but there are ways to cope with them.

Fair pay will benefit deaf students
\
Alisha Roemeling's May 26 article headlined ""Interpreters push for 'fair' wages"" shared our struggle for fair pay. What was missing was how low pay affects the students we serve.
\
Fair compensation ensures that deaf and hard-of-hearing students receive high-quality education.
\
When a school district has high turnover, struggles to maintain interpreter staffing and brings in an abundance of newly educated staff annually, the bottom line is that students suffer.
\
Since 2010, 22 interpreters have left the Eugene School District program that averages 18 interpreters. When understaffed, we can't provide services for every child using an interpreter.
\
There is little supplemental work for interpreters locally, which has driven qualified interpreters out of our community and away from the deaf students who expect and deserve to have a voice.
\
In addition to being interpreters, we are language models, tutors, advocates, in-service trainers, sign language teachers and cultural mediators. Students deserve that access.
\
Educational interpreters haven't chosen their career based on income, but rather on a passion for learning, language and hope for the future. We're underpaid nationwide.
\
Eugene has an opportunity to pioneer change and become a coveted place to work instead of a district that struggles to fill spots. With fair compensation, our community will see deaf children not just ""get through"" school, but flourish.
\
Fair compensation means high-quality education. Our union, the Oregon School Employees Association, supports fair compensation.

Canada, Mexico might outdo Trump
\
People everywhere are threatening to flee the country if, indeed, Donald Trump is successful in his presidential campaign. So you know our neighbors to the north are probably frantically planning for such an event.
\
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who's way too pretty and diplomatic to start ranting on Canadian television, is probably visiting each and every province. He's probably saying, ""If Trump prevails, we could see thousands and thousands of illegal Americans trying to cross our borders! Even if most of them are probably honest, hardworking folks, you know some of them are drug dealers, rapists and other undesirables! We must build a wall! And we must make America pay for it!""
\
Meanwhile, in Mexico, President Enrique Nieto, who is also way too pretty and diplomatic to start ranting, is most likely frantically doing his own homework. He's thinking, ""If Trump wins and builds a wall -- oh well, we have tunnels and we will build more! And you know who's going to pay for those tunnels? The United States! One way or the other, they'll pay!""
\
Uh oh, Mr. Trudeau. Plan B may be in order. After all, America has some of the best engineers and tunnel-making equipment on the planet.

Oregon should impose a carbon tax
\
Climate change is a driving force behind the so-called sixth mass extinction in which species are declining at rates 100 to 1,000 times faster than background extinction rates. The changes are human-caused and result in disruption of many of the ecosystem services we depend on.
\
Our increased dependence on fossil fuel resources to power our lives is clearly a problem that needs to be addressed. World leaders acknowledged that reality in December when they agreed to sign the Paris Climate Agreement, which stipulates that countries must meet emissions targets to hold global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.
\
The United States signed the agreement, stating a goal of emissions reductions from 26 to 28 percent of 2005 levels by 2025. To meet that target, we need to realize individual action alone won't produce the changes we need. States need to step up and implement financial incentives that will make polluters pay. One option is a carbon tax.
\
In 2010, British Columbia implemented a carbon tax of $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. It has subsequently raised that tax, reaching $30 per tonne in 2012.
\
Studies have shown a 16 percent decrease in fossil fuel use since the tax was implemented, and British Columbia's emissions have decreased 3.5 times faster than in Canadian provinces that don't have a carbon tax.
\
Oregon can and should help reduce U.S. emissions by adopting a statewide carbon tax in which polluters pay proportionately.

Change is natural and inevitable
\
Brian Thompson's May 25 column offered a stunning example of self-pity and denial of ever-changing social norms (""Trump's a fighter against those who insult our ideals"").
\
There's ample evidence in nature indicating that change, evolution and transformation are present and active in our world. That evidence is no less present in our ideas, perceptions and actions.
\
The security one feels from a stubborn adherence to beliefs that must now share an equal place in our society's conversation is a foolish exercise.
\
What we believe makes us no less human, just as what we say makes us no less human. But a ship still tied to the dock goes nowhere.
\
And, to continue the analogy, its passengers see only what they're familiar with, learn only what they've already experienced and -- in our current political climate -- hear only the voices that assure them that they'll never leave their home port.
\
Thompson is not hated, but today he is doubted.

The GOP has undermined education
\
Self-described ""old-style moderate Republican"" Preston Wills wrote on May 25 that he ""totally disagrees"" with University of Oregon professor Alexander Murphy's May 24 column about Donald Trump (""Trump's triumph echoes outrage fed by talk radio, blogs"").
\
The rich, shrewd TV reality show performer's political ascendancy, Murphy maintains, can be attributed in large part to a right-wing media environment that ""fosters -- even celebrates -- fact-challenged outrage"" that's ""delivered in a tone that conveys the idea that if you don't agree, you're stupid or a loser.""
\
Spearheaded by Rush Limbaugh and his name-calling, spleen-venting copycats, by Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and others at Fox ""News,"" and buttressed by babbling bloggers, such right-wing purveyors of divisive misinformation disseminate context- and nuance-free propaganda about far-fetched conspiracy theories, mega-corporation deification, unconstitutional state-religion, foolishly dangerous climate change denial and warmongering jingoism.
\
I commend Wills for his common sense vote for John Kasich in the primary election, and for his determination not to vote for Trump. The tone of his letter, however, was much the same as that of right-wing media -- the influence of which he denies.
\
Since Ronald Reagan, the GOP has, through draconian underfunding, weakened public education, initiated expensive, pointless national testing and corporatized educational institutions with business-oriented career training instead of humanities/science-based education that recognizes the character and complexity of the world, ignites creativity, encourages empathetic understanding, values the arts, emphasizes critical thinking and propaganda-analysis skills, and broadens knowledge.
\
Transformative change is needed. ""The stakes,"" Murphy cautioned, ""are nothing less than the preservation of democratic ideals.""

Still, she had enough time to give a detailed explanation in layman's terms of a health care question. But primarily her speech spotlighted a handful of county focal points for 2013.\""The county does lots and lots and lots of stuff ... people have no clue,"" Carlson said, stressing that most know what the city government does; most think they know what the state does; most don't care what the federal government does.\Carlson underscored some of the county's roles: health care transformation; early learning; prisoner reentry; county budget; Courthouse Square.\Concerning the latter, the county hopes to shed the $900,000 it pays out in leases for departments in scattered officers around town.\""May of 2014 is the date that we've been given,"" for completion of the Courthouse Square rebuild, giving the county back a more central base.\Concerning prisoners, the commissioner described recidivism as a corrections yardstick, illustrated a drop in the county's recidivism rates from 26 percent in 2009 to 17 percent in 2012, then capped the discussion by highlighting further strides; a Chemeketa Community College program focused on prisoner reentry and boasting an 8.5 percent recidivism rate among its participants.\Concerning health care and early learning: the county touted strides made in partnership with Healthy Start agencies -- Family Building Blocks, Easter Seals and Catholic Community Services -- along with a pilot project of joint, supportive follow ups to families of infants to generate more engagement and reinforce preliminary efforts to align those families with healthy practices.\Brentano used his speaking window to deliver a self-described ""rant"" about greenhouse gas and global warming, breaching the topic with a playful semi disclaimer:\""You don't want everybody to think you are a nut, and even more so to realize it,"" he joked.\But he was serious about how sanctions and strides -- mileage tax, carbon tax, insurance tax, multi-car tax -- couched within the broader ambition of attacking global warming could exact economic woes on local communities.

Single-payer plan would cut costs
\
In regard to Reginald Jensen's Nov. 21 letter, the following information is from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Statistics and University of Massachusetts economist Gerald Friedman:
\
From 2000 to 2015, Oregonians' income rose 62 percent while health care spending rose 200 percent. From 2000 to 2015, health care spending grew to 16.25 percent from 12.75 percent of Oregon's gross domestic product. Under the Affordable Care Act, it's projected that by 2020, 17 percent of Oregon GDP will be spent on health care compared with 13 percent under a single-payer plan.
\
While Jensen cited waiting times for non-essential services in the United Kingdom under its National Health Insurance system, which is favored by most Brits, he made no reference to waiting times and unavailability of primary care physicians and specialists under the present U.S. system, which is worse than all but two industrialized nations.
\
Thirty-three percent of the U.S. population experience financially restricted access to health care compared with 14 percent in nine other countries. Also, medical costs are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States but ""medical bankruptcy"" is unheard of in other developed economies.
\
While Jensen attacked a single-payer system without offering any viable alternative, in Oregon the projected overall savings in 2019 from a single-payer plan would be about $8 billion, or $2,000 per person, much of which would be from insurance company profits, overhead and excess CEO compensation.

How to get the parties' attention
\
Political parties engage in continuous power struggles with one another. That doesn't create cooperation, compromise and effectiveness in government, it simply perpetuates what we have now.
\
We can change that by registering as nonpartisans instead of as members of a political party. If a majority of the people did so, it could help remind the parties that ours is indeed a pluralistic society comprised of decent, common-sense people who, despite our differences, all want practical solutions to domestic and international problems.
\
It could stop the parties from fighting one another by drawing their attention back to us and finally getting them to begin working for us.
\
It's the nature of political parties to seek power, and increasing their memberships is part of how they strive to do that. Registering as nonpartisans would get them to stop taking us for granted or placing us in rigid ideological categories.
\
Candidates should talk to us as individuals, not as members of a homogeneous herd. As a rallying cry, I paraphrase that master of paradox, Groucho Marx: I refuse to belong to any political party that would have me as a member.

A carbon tax might be necessary
\
Climate change is already causing disasters. The genocide in Darfur was partially the result of global warming, as is the civil war in Syria. President Obama's regulations don't do enough. The other possibilities are some form of a cap-and-trade system, or a carbon tax such as the Citizens' Climate Lobby is proposing. The CCL is betting the farm on grass-roots activism and prefers a solution people can easily understand.
\
Its revenue-neutral carbon tax would cover the entire U.S. economy and goods coming into the United States (people sensitive to higher prices would change how they spend their money). If the United States were willing to do more to fight global warming, other countries such as China would follow suit.
\
On Sept. 17, Rep. Chris Gibson, R-N.Y., and 10 other Republicans in Congress introduced a non-binding resolution urging the House of Representatives to work on solutions to the problem. They plan to introduce legislation, perhaps early next year.
\
In another sign that we may be moving beyond the partisan impasse on global warming in Congress, four Republican senators - Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mark Kirk of Illinois - announced on Oct. 29 the formation of the Energy and Environment Working Group.
\
Given that time is short, people wondering what the U.S. government should do about global warming might consider supporting a carbon tax, because inaction would also be risky.

Don't fret about Syrian immigrants
\
In response to the reactions of the Republican presidential candidates and members of Congress (Democrats included) to the extreme measures for vetting and disallowing Syrian refugees to immigrate to the United States, maybe they need to realize that unless they're 100 percent Native American, their ancestors were allowed to immigrate.
\
Take Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for example: His father immigrated from Cuba in 1957 at the height of the Cold War. What if he hadn't been allowed to immigrate because he ""may"" have been an undercover communist collaborator?
\
Labels can be put on anyone. Who gets to decide that because someone may not be of a religious faith you approve of, that person shouldn't get a chance to start a new life? There may be some zealots in the bunch, but we know some are already here and our security system has worked fairly well since Sept. 11.

I worry more about the nuts with guns on our college campuses and at our elementary and high schools, movie theaters and shopping malls. They're the ones who go undetected - until they explode.

Oregon's homeless also need help
\
Last April, Gov. Kate Brown gave her first State of the State address. After pointing out that she'd signed a bill to ""sustain the well-being of the sage grouse,"" she moved on to the topic of homelessness; like most politicians, she was against it, saying the needs of the homeless were ""immediate and urgent.""
\
In October, Mayor Kitty Piercy sent a resolution to Brown asking her to declare a ""homeless emergency"" (all those ""travelers"" were getting on the mayor's nerves).
\
What's happened since then? On Nov. 17, Brown acted. She took a firm stand on helping the homeless, tweeting: ""Clearly, Oregon will continue to accept refugees."" Meanwhile, over at WhiteHouse.gov, President Obama touted his $4.5 billion Syrian refugee aid program.
\
But what about Oregon's homeless population? With the country more than $18 trillion in debt, when will they get the help they need?

Rename Dunn Hall for Al Smith
\
The Nov. 21 report on the University of Oregon's pledge to confront racism left me thinking it's past time to change the name of the UO's Dunn Hall. Its namesake, as the report noted, served as an exalted cyclops in the Ku Klux Klan.
\
A name change would send a welcome message to victims of Klan violence in Oregon, their descendants and generations of African-Americans who've survived Klan terror campaigns.
\
Few people deserve the honor of having a hall named after them more than the late Al Smith. A Klamath Tribe spiritual leader, he has long been hailed nationally as a hero for religious freedom in the United States.
\
Naming a building after Smith, who hasn't received adequate recognition in the community he called home for many decades, would allow the UO to turn away from the exclusions of the past and move toward greater inclusiveness.

Good schools, strong economy
\
Reading Larry Lewin's March 28 letter, ""Kid's can't wait,"" I had three insights:
\
1. Every place I've ever lived, the better the educational system, the more diverse the local economy and the better the quality of life and standard of living; conversely, the worse the educational system and educational level of the community, the lower the standard of living, economic diversity and higher the jobless rate. So if we want to increase wealth and employment, particularly in today's world economy, we must make improving public education priority No. 1!
\
2. Although I no longer live in Eugene, 50 some years ago I was a student in Eugene's public schools. All and all, I thought I got a very good education that prepared me well for my postsecondary educational pursuits.
\
3. My other memory of my school days is that every summer prior to the start of the new school year, the school district would submit its budget to the voters, who'd invariably vote it down once or twice before approving a slimmer version just prior to Labor Day. Back in the day, I don't believe these opponents of the budget called themselves anything special like ""Citizens for Schools & Jobs"" or tea party members; they were just ""greedy"" - the $100 or so that they'd save on taxes would buy them an extra pack of cigs or an extra beer a week, and they were assumed to care very little about their community, education or kids.

U.S. needs a carbon tax
\
Right now the United States has the lowest tax rate in 50 years, and one wonders why government doesn't have enough money to operate. Across the country there are legislators who use the excuse of having no funds to drastically cut programs for the poor and reduce salaries of teachers and state employees.
\
We are now a corporate welfare state where the taxpayers are subsidizing corporations that are getting enormous tax breaks and incentives while their influence is increased through unfettered campaign contributions.
\
Elections are only 18 months away, but there is an immediate need to bring changes that address current problems and issues. One such proposal that addresses current issues and helps provide long-term solutions is a carbon tax.
\
The fossil fuel industry gets huge subsidies from the oil depletion allowance and has permits to pollute our air. If we taxed carbon dioxide emissions at a rate equal to the direct subsidies and the costs of living in the pollution that they emit, then we could use the funds to promote sustainable energy solutions, reduce the amount of pollution produced by burning fossil fuels, address the health care needs caused by the pollution and create jobs cleaning up the environment.
\
A carbon tax is a fixed charge for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. It is relatively easy to administer because we know the amount of fossil fuel used.
\
If you think this is a good idea, ask you legislator to pursue a carbon tax.

Wyden should get off the fence
\
I appeal to Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden's professed reverence for democracy. In doing so, I am compelled to point out that holding town meetings is an insufficient commitment to democracy.
\
What is essential is that he get off the centrist, Third Way fence and pick a side. It is perhaps unfortunate but true that the U.S. Senate is polarized to the point that occupants of that high office are either corporate-statists - or in his case, and putting it more indirectly, corporate Democrats - or they are social democrats, with a small ""d,"" including the one democratic socialist.
\
Trade policy as presently configured is a key mechanism of corporate-statism, and it is a direct threat to household and community stability and security. Regardless of the supposed inevitability of a flat world, there are clear alternatives to trade policies that are heedless of their Main Street impacts - see www.citizen.org/trade/tradeact/.
\
At his recent South Eugene High School town hall, Senator Wyden, chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee, asked me for facts supporting non-ratification of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. More important, however, is this opportunity to try again to bring his awareness to the fundamentally anti-democratic motivations, underpinnings and effects of current trade policy, which benefits a few at the expense of many.
\
Above and beyond the senator's electoral track record will be his legacy, either pro-democracy or anti-democracy. Until he makes a strong move on trade policy, he is only casting the Chamber of Commerce's shadow.

Figure-it-out-later is dangerous
\
There are now 104 nuclear plants in the United States, and 24 are similar in design to the Fukushima plant. Radiation is now coming from Fukushima because the diesel generators that were supposed to power cooling pumps after an earthquake were knocked out immediately by flooding from a tsunami, and the emergency battery power was exhausted in just eight hours.
\
Spent fuel from nuclear plants needs to sit in cooling pools for years after removal from a reactor. The amount of spent fuel being crammed into these pools keeps increasing. After it leaves the pools, the waste typically gets encased in concrete containment vessels that sit above ground somewhere, such as on the bank of a river.
\
No permanent storage facility for nuclear waste has yet been found in the United States. Nowhere has underground storage been found to be safe. The only ""safe"" storage system we currently know requires monitoring containment structures for leaks, then fixing the leaks. The radioactive life of nuclear waste ranges from thousands to millions of years.
\
If we are to include nuclear in our energy strategy for the future, we must first figure out a better way to dispose of the waste. Our current figure-it-out-later approach is both unwise and dangerous. We also must have plants that can be kept safe in the event of earthquakes or other catastrophes. If we can't do these two things, then nuclear should not be part of our energy future. A combination of conservation and renewable energy seems like a wiser approach.

Y the best for the community
\
The Eugene School Board has a difficult decision to make. Mike Weber wrote (letters, March 23) that the Fred Meyer proposal for Civic Stadium ""would create jobs during construction for local workers."" Well, the Y proposal, too, would create jobs for local workers.
\
Weber also wrote, ""The stadium's wooden grandstand would... be reused in the building."" The Y also proposes to reuse materials from the old stadium. He states, ""We have to make hard choices and sacrifices to bring about positive change."" Which is a more ""positive change"": another shopping center, or a new Y?
\
The Y provides facilities for basketball, weight training, cardiovascular workouts, tennis, balance, strengthening, tai chi and yoga classes; day care for students and working parents; swimming lessons for 3- to 5-year-olds; water aerobics; day camps; and senior trips. The staff is well-trained and sets great role models for the youth of our community. The Y does all of this now, but in a small building in need of remodeling and no room to do so - not to mention the parking problems.
\
Can Fred Meyer provide this for the community? Our priorities should be based on the benefits to our community, not to an out-of-state corporation (Kroeger). Eugene would be the biggest loser if the Eugene School Board didn't choose the Y's proposal.

108,"U.S. carbon tax needed to avoid mega-droughts\On Feb. 12 the American Association for the Advancement of Science published an article by Cook, Ault and Smerdon that shows mega-droughts in the western U.S. this century if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced.\With a revenue-neutral federal carbon tax, the U.S. could lead the world to a stable climate.\All of the revenue would be refunded to households.\The fee on fossil fuels would start at $15 per ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent of 15 cents per gallon of gasoline.\It would rise steadily each year by $10 per ton.\The proposal by the Citizens' Climate Lobby would impose fees on products imported from countries without a carbon fee, along with rebates to U.S. businesses exporting to those countries.\This feature will create a fair competitive environment and motivate other countries to adopt similar carbon pricing policies.\It is a market-oriented solution that would not grow the federal government.\Farms will be among the businesses most harmed by climate change.\Oregon farmers and the Oregon Farm Bureau should take the lead and challenge Congress to pass this kind of carbon tax.\Phil Carver\Salem\Governor's resignation very disappointing\I am sorely disappointed that the governor resigned. It was the press and publicity that kept driving the wedge and kept repeating the innuendos.\He hasn't yet been found guilty of any of the charges but the press didn't even wait to see what the outcomes were.

109,"The Oregon Legislature is again considering regulating carbon emissions, possibly in the form of a cap-and-trade system that would link to those already in place in California and Quebec.\The House and Senate environment committees kicked off the first of several joint hearings on the topic Feb. 20 with an overview of climate change and of carbon pricing options.\""Climate change is here. It's going to impact us no matter what happens,"" Kathie Dello, associate director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute, told lawmakers.\Oregon has been working to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions for a decade. A new report shows the state won't meet its 2020 goal.\Earlier this month, the state Department of Environmental Quality completed a report on the impacts of a cap-and-trade program in Oregon.\The program would put a collective cap on greenhouse gas emissions statewide, then auction off allowances to emit those gases.\Businesses could sell or trade allowances, but eventually might find it cheaper to invest in carbon reduction technology.\Unlike a carbon tax or fee, a cap-and-trade program would allow Oregon to control how emissions are reduced, Palmer Mason, DEQ senior legislative advisor, told the committees.\That's because the state would set the ""cap,"" while the price of allowances would be market-based. The state would gradually decrease the cap, resulting in allowances becoming more expensive.\About 100 businesses around the state would be regulated if the program covered fossil fuel and natural gas suppliers, electricity providers, and industrial emitters responsible for at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases per year.\Among those on the list: Chevron, Shell, NW Natural, PGE, Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Georgia-Pacific Toledo, Oregon State University, Intel Corp. and Coffin Butte Landfill.\None of the businesses are in Marion or Polk counties.\The system would have little impact on Oregon's overall economy, DEQ found, although some industries, such as those competing with businesses in other states, could suffer.\That could be addressed by freely giving allowances to those industries, Mason said.\Residents of rural areas with few transportation choices also could be more severely impacted by higher fuel costs. That could be mitigated by offering rebates.\Sale of the allowances could raise hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the state.\Oregon's Constitution likely would require revenue associated with transportation fuels to be used for transportation infrastructure, DEQ said. The remainder would be unrestricted.\The committees did not take public testimony on Feb. 20.\Previous attempts to put a price on carbon have been opposed by Associated Oregon Industries and some of its member businesses. They have argued that climate change is a global problem and Oregon's emissions account for just a small fraction of those worldwide.\tloew@statesmanjournal.com, 503-399-6779 or follow at Twitter.com/Tracy_Loew"
110,"""The constraining factor has always been\political feasibility, not economic feasibility.""\Mark Jaccard\Professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC,\and a political economist and energy modeling expert\To the rest of the world, the United States' Pacific Northwest and Canada's British Columbia represent one of the supposedly most eco-friendly regions in North America, if not the globe.\And yet on climate change, the biggest environmental challenge of this generation, the governments of Washington, Oregon and British Columbia not only over-promised what they would do to stem the tide. They actually underperformed compared to all the other states and provinces in the two countries, according to a new analysis by InvestigateWest.\More than a decade ago, the three governments set some of North America's first mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And if any place on earth can show the world how to confront the climate crisis, it should be this region, also known as ""Cascadia"" after the mountain chain shared by the two countries. Cascadia's abundant hydropower provides a head start toward living without fossil fuels, and the majority of voters in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon say they want to make that transition.\Yet Washington, BC and Oregon were not on track to meet their 2020 targets. In fact, until COVID hit last year, emissions were rising. Between 2013 and 2018, the most recent five-year period for which Cascadia's governments have completed counts, emissions rose by about 5, 6 and 7 percent in Washington, Oregon and BC, respectively, according to InvestigateWest's analysis, which enabled apples-to-apples comparisons primarily by counting emissions associated with power imports in BC.\""Emissions don't lie and the emissions keep rising,"" said Andrea Rodgers, an environmental attorney involved in litigation brought by youths in the states and BC charging Oregon, Washington, and Canada with a dereliction of duty in failing to live up to their promises to reduce climate-warming emissions.\Cascadia's broken promise\Technologically speaking, climate change is neither insurmountable nor unaffordable. It's the politics that have fallen short, according to experts and activists interviewed by InvestigateWest.\""I wouldn't say we've done nothing. But there's been an awful lot of dithering. We were supposed to do a whole hell of a lot better,"" says KC Golden, who spent over a decade at Seattle-based think tank Climate Solutions and now serves on the board of international activist group 350.org.\The region's fight to head off climate change has been beset by partisan wrangling, fear of job losses, disagreements over how to ensure equity for already polluted and marginalized communities, and misinformation obscuring the full potential of well-documented solutions.\""The constraining factor has always been political feasibility, not economic feasibility,"" says political economist and energy modeling expert Mark Jaccard, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC, and a former chair of the British Columbia Utilities Commission.\The story of Cascadia's decade of policy delay and emissions backsliding is a story of ambitious goals eroded by inertia. It's a story of overestimating faith in economic logic and underestimating the enduring allure of economic growth. And, south of the 49th Parallel, it's a tale of a bipartisan consensus split asunder, such that fighting for a cleaner future is seen, in some quarters, as an attack on freedom. Or worse.\Powering down coal\After 2005's Hurricane Katrina and 2007's record-breaking loss of Arctic sea ice, Cascadia lawmakers acted, mandating emissions reductions by 2020 and steeper cuts by 2050. As of 2008, Washington, BC and Oregon were among only four provinces and eight states to legally commit to decarbonization.\Oregon and BC set ambitious long-term goals of 75-77% reductions from their 1990 emissions, reflecting the global carbon cuts scientists believed were needed by mid-century to avert the worst of the impending climate disaster. Washington state came in with a relatively modest 50%-by-2050 goal.\All three governments chalked up quick wins in their power sectors.\BC immediately scrapped plans for a new gas-fired power plant and two coal generators. Washington voters and Oregon's legislature passed some of North America's first requirements mandating privately owned utilities to add a rising share of wind, solar and other types of renewable power to their hydropower-rich energy portfolios.\This quick action unleashed a boom in wind power development, especially along the Columbia River Gorge, the natural wind tunnel that separates Oregon and Washington.\And guess what? It actually saved consumers money. Falling prices for wind and solar driven by innovation and scale made the mandates more economical.\Cascadia's problem was the rest of its economy. Buildings, industry and especially transportation generate more than two-thirds of Cascadia's emissions. Carbon-cutting options for those — such as electric heat pumps to replace gas furnaces and urban redesigns to reduce vehicle travel — were more complex and costly than swapping out coal smokestacks for wind turbines. And none of Cascadia's governments had policies strong enough to forcefully drive those options into use.\Greenhouse gas emissions fell for several years thanks to cleaner electricity, as well as the global financial crisis of 2008. People traveled less, consumed less and produced less. Fossil fuel use dropped. Cascadia's emissions fell by 8%. Then the economy rebounded. People moved more. Production and consumption rose. And climate-warming emissions came roaring back.\By 2018 robust economic growth across Cascadia had restored over four-fifths of the 19.5-megatons of annual emissions that the region shed during the downturn.\Surging emissions from cars, trucks, trains and planes led the way. Transportation accounted for nearly two-fifths of Cascadia's emissions by the time its economies rebounded from the global economic meltdown in 2012. Six years later vehicle emissions had ballooned by over 10% in Washington and Oregon and 29% in BC.\While some say increasing emissions are a price of economic growth, InvestigateWest's analysis puts the blame squarely on Cascadia's weak decarbonization policies. Political backlash and game-playing blocked measures to guide economic growth toward green technologies and strategies, and Cascadia's economies kept growing along the path of least resistance. In a world awash in cheap fossil fuels, that meant more carbon emissions.\Not so in California, where climate policy moved forward, and emissions from transportation grew at less than half the rate in Cascadia.\Between full economic recovery in 2012 and 2018, the most recent reporting year, California and Cascadia both booked a robust 26% increase in GDP (see 'A tale of two economies' chart). Over that period California drove its annual emissions down by more than 5%. Washington's emissions —and Cascadia's as a whole — ballooned by over 7%.\Tracking Arnold\California ""decoupled"" economic growth from rising carbon via a raft of laws and policies that encouraged or mandated use of efficient products and cleaner energy. Many were legislated in 2006 under then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, including the centerpiece: a system known as cap and trade. It set a cap on carbon emissions that declined annually, and enforced that cap by requiring polluters to buy credits — sold at auction — for every ton of carbon they released. By putting a price on carbon, cap and trade created a financial incentive to reduce pollution.\Cascadia's governments all sought to match the breadth of California's carbon-cutting policies. They failed.\Early efforts in Washington and Oregon to enact cap-and-trade schemes fizzled. Washington approved a bill in 2008 that was later deemed unenforceable. Oregon ran out of time when the global economic meltdown struck that year.\BC, in contrast, raced ahead. Like Schwarzenegger, then-Premier Gordon Campbell was a center-right politician who embraced climate action. BC's parliamentary government, with its fewer checks on power than the U.S. system, enabled him to move fast.\By the end of 2007, Campbell had a climate package in place. And in May 2008 his Liberal Party government formally approved North America's first carbon tax. It took effect that July — five years before California's system went into effect.\The tax was set to increase annually. Within a few years economists were reporting small benefits and a reassuring lack of harms. The tax had trimmed fuel consumption in BC compared to other provinces in Canada while stimulating BC's economy. BC used its tax take to lower income and business taxes, and sent rebate checks to protect lower-income residents from rising energy costs. Other measures protected energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries such as cement producers.\But in 2011 — after the rival New Democratic Party ran an ""Axe the Tax"" platform alleging that the carbon tax hurt working families — Campbell's party dumped him for a more populist leader. Premier Christy Clark took her lead from BC's business lobbies. She froze the carbon tax, rolled back funding for other climate measures and rolled out a sales pitch for LNG investment.\So despite its early policy lead, BC's decarbonization results proved worse than underwhelming. Instead of declining versus 2007, emissions rose through 2018.\The price of partisanship\To the south, high hopes similarly tanked because of politics. Washington and Oregon governors returned to carbon pricing with their eyes on California's cap-and-trade program rather than the political bloodbath up north. Alas, the same political crossfire leveled at BC's tax — along with some novel attacks — would doom their carbon trading schemes in the state legislatures.\Washington Gov. Jay Inslee pushed carbon pricing after he became governor in 2013, in spite of Republican control of the state senate, where Sen. Doug Ericksen, an opponent of climate action whose district includes two refineries, chaired the environment committee.\Inslee tried several times, and voters rejected two ballot measures, before Washington took a year off from carbon pricing battles in 2019.\Oregon Gov. Kate Brown led repeated charges over the same ground after she took office in 2015. Republican pushback there led to the strange events of June 2019, when Oregon state senators exited the capitol in Salem, denying Democrats the quorum they needed to outvote the Republicans.\The senators' run from lawmaking — a ruse they reprised last year — capped years of political dissolution that transformed an earlier consensus on climate action into open political warfare. In 2007 Oregon's package of climate bills passed on bipartisan votes. In 2020 not one Republican would even cast a vote on a cap-and-trade measure backed by the state's utilities.\Lower-income voters in Oregon and Washington understandably worry about new taxes and higher energy costs. Regressive tax systems in both states mean the lowest 20 percent of earners already pay the highest proportion of their income in taxes. Some unions paint carbon pricing as a job killer, in spite of contrary evidence from BC and California. Climate justice groups attack industries' ability to buy rights to continue polluting the often minority, low-income communities nearby.\And then there's the influence of corporations that sell fossil fuels or profit most when they are cheap.\Former Oregon legislator Jackie Dingfelder, who led passage of the 2007 climate bills, sees Oregon's vulnerability to ideology and misinformation as a legacy of decline in Cascadia's long-standing forestry and mining industries. As well-paid resource jobs evaporated, some states such as California and Washington pivoted faster, investing in universities that then spun off new job creators such as Microsoft and Amazon.\""We were the poor stepchild,"" she said. ""A lot of people got left behind.""\""The constraining factor has always been\political feasibility, not economic feasibility.""\Mark Jaccard\Professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC,\and a political economist and energy modeling expert\About the project\Getting to Zero: Decarbonizing Cascadia is a yearlong project by nonprofit news organizations in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. Led by Seattle-based InvestigateWest, the project also will include contributions from The Tyee in Vancouver, BC; national news site Grist.org; Crosscut.com in Washington; and Jefferson Public Radio in Oregon."
111,"The Oregon Legislature is again considering regulating carbon emissions, possibly in the form of a cap-and-trade system that would link to those already in place in California and Quebec.\The House and Senate environment committees kicked off the first of several joint hearings on the topic Monday with an overview of climate change and of carbon pricing options.\""Climate change is here. It's going to impact us no matter what happens,"" Kathie Dello, associate director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute, told lawmakers.\Oregon has been working to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions for a decade. A new report shows the state won't meet its 2020 goal.\Earlier this month, the state Department of Environmental Quality completed a report on the impacts of a cap-and-trade program in Oregon.\The program would put a collective cap on greenhouse gas emissions statewide, then auction off allowances to emit those gases.\Businesses could sell or trade allowances, but eventually might find it cheaper to invest in carbon reduction technology.\Unlike a carbon tax or fee, a cap-and-trade program would allow Oregon to control how emissions are reduced, Palmer Mason, DEQ senior legislative advisor, told the committees.\That's because the state would set the ""cap,"" while the price of allowances would be market-based. The state would gradually decrease the cap, resulting in allowances becoming more expensive.\About 100 businesses around the state would be regulated if the program covered fossil fuel and natural gas suppliers, electricity providers, and industrial emitters responsible for at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases per year.\Among those on the list: Chevron, Shell, NW Natural, PGE, Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Georgia-Pacific Toledo, Oregon State University, Intel Corp. and Coffin Butte Landfill.\None of the businesses are in Marion or Polk counties.\The system would have little impact on Oregon's overall economy, DEQ found, although some industries, such as those competing with businesses in other states, could suffer.\That could be addressed by freely giving allowances to those industries, Mason said.\Residents of rural areas with few transportation choices also could be more severely impacted by higher fuel costs. That could be mitigated by offering rebates.\Sale of the allowances could raise hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the state.\Oregon's Constitution likely would require revenue associated with transportation fuels to be used for transportation infrastructure, DEQ said. The remainder would be unrestricted.\The committees did not take public testimony on Monday.\Previous attempts to put a price on carbon have been opposed by Associated Oregon Industries and some of its member businesses. They have argued that climate change is a global problem and Oregon's emissions account for just a small fraction of those worldwide.\tloew@statesmanjournal.com, 503-399-6779 or follow at Twitter.com/Tracy_Loew"

Biking in the snow is dangerous
\
I bike to work almost every day, and I go biking for exercise and for fun. I wish more people biked because of the exercise, reduced traffic congestion and benefits to the environment.
\
But I'm also Canadian, and I know the risks of biking in the snow. In my hometown in northern Ontario it was illegal to bicycle from December to March.
\
Bicycles have narrow wheels and rely on road grip to balance. When bicycle wheels lose their grip, not only can you slide like a car, you can also fall - often sideways into traffic. Meanwhile, nearby cars have less ability to stop on ice or snow. Not a combination to be risked.
\
So enjoy biking; Eugene's one of the best places for it. But when there's snow and ice on the road, please don't bicycle.

Don't buy bee-killing pesticides
\
Supporting the Saving America's Pollinators Act, House Resolution 2692, is one way to help our pollinators, but there are many more ways to help bees survive.
\
One is to shop at stores such as Down to Earth that offer healthy organic alternatives for managing pests in yards and gardens.
\
Most people are unaware that there are bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides in 50 percent of all the plant soils sold at big-box stores. When in doubt, buy organic and look for warning labels and information pamphlets on those killers. Bayer and Ortho are the brand names that contain neonicotinoids.
\
This is an issue of food security for our bio-region and we need to educate our friends and neighbors. As climate change makes growing food more difficult, it's critical that we secure a healthy valley for growing food.
\
China's had to resort to hand-pollinating many of its fruit trees due to mass bee die-offs. Let's be smarter than that.

Add a carbon tax to forest bills
\
Bob Doppelt has challenged us to look ahead when it comes to protecting our forests, and not to resort to clear-cutting as in past years (""Forest planning needs to look ahead, not behind,"" Feb. 5).
\
Because the climate is changing, we need new thinking. We must depend on forest sequestering of carbon dioxide, and Rep. Peter DeFazio and Sen. Ron Wyden need to amend their forest management bills if we're to reduce climate disruptions that are already altering our lives.
\
A carbon tax should be included in the bills; it's been proven that when taxes are added, carbon emissions go down. New thinking is needed - now.

Why hire a law firm to negotiate?
\
Why would the Eugene School District want to pay a law firm in Salem to negotiate a contract with its teachers? I find it hard to believe it's because the district is too short-staffed to take time to negotiate.
\
Having 35 students in a class is difficult but it's something many Eugene teachers face every day, and they do their best to meet individual student needs.
\
It would be helpful to know how much the Medford School District has paid the law firm to negotiate with its teachers.
\
Is that something taxpayers should pay for, or should district officials take the time to show teachers and taxpayers they're also willing to work hard for the students?

There are options to deadly force
\
Regarding the recent shooting on Bob Straub Parkway in Springfield, it seems to me an ex-Marine and martial arts pro would have had choices other than fatally shooting a man on the street.
\
What is it with our Wild West mentality? Is it OK to kill someone in a dispute about a traffic accident?
\
Not knowing the details, I can't know the threat the shooter perceived from an unarmed man, but surely there were other options.

Do we really need to drive around carrying deadly weapons in our vehicles, ready to kill whomever gets in the way? Let's leave the guns at home and not use them to take away from someone something that can't be given back.

Bird protectors are hypocritical
\
The liberals have succeeded in their quest to practically shut down the timber industry to ""save"" two elusive bird species, the spotted owl and the marbled murrelet. Many family-wage jobs are gone and some of those families must now rely on government handouts to get by.
\
Now liberals have succeeded in their quest for permission to build giant wind turbines off our coastal shores. Wind ""farms"" are directly responsible for devastating some of our bird populations.
\
Eagles, hawks, owls, bats and now seabirds. Why can some birds, such as our national icon, the bald eagle, be killed or suffer catastrophic injuries and other birds that hardly anyone ever sees get an insane amount of protection?
\
There's no rational answer, because I believe liberalism is a mental disorder.

113,"In April, three dozen Oregon economists published an open letter to Gov. Kate Brown and members of the Oregon Legislature in support of carbon pricing.\The letter was drafted by us, six Oregon environmental economists, during a year that saw record winter temperatures, diminished snow pack (with its consequent water shortages) and significant drought in the southern part of the state. Science tells us that this is just the beginning of increasingly severe effects that Oregonians - and our economy - will experience.\By the end of the century, the region could see more 95 degree Fahrenheit days and could experience significant impacts due to increased wildfire risks. Rising sea levels could inundate and extensively damage valuable coastline.\We have obligations - to future generations, the environment and long-term economic stability - to tackle climate change. Scientists have unambiguously shown that to slow climate change, we need to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, which is released from the burning of fossil fuels.\Arguments that Oregon is just a small state, responsible for a tiny slice of U.S. emissions miss the point that pricing carbon is necessary to reflect its true cost to Oregon's economy, our environment and future generations. This action, supported by Nobel laureate economics and progressive business leaders, will not only reward innovative firms that reduce pollution and clean the air for Oregonians, but also could create important first-mover competitive economic advantages for everyone who lives here now and in the future.\The economists who signed the letter see revenue-neutral carbon pricing as a critical market-based step to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The logic for this claim is simple: If something like emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is free, people will continue to over-consume fossil fuels as if the damaging effects to the atmosphere don't exist. Only by reflecting the true price of pollution can the market start making rational decisions about better energy resources to use.\Recent studies show that pricing carbon without increasing the tax burden will have little or no short-term adverse effects on economic outcomes like jobs and output. Why not? Because it offers Oregonians flexibility.\Oregon households and businesses can react to carbon prices by seeking creative solutions for their particular situations. Oregon businesses will have incentives - but not be forced - to find and use less carbon emissions-intensive methods, stimulating our market-based economy to innovate and develop new clean-energy technologies.\Some 40 countries and more than 20 sub-national jurisdictions have adopted carbon pricing, including 13 carbon taxes. There are many options out there. The critical point, though, is to do something. Our climate is in crisis. Carbon pricing can help address that in an efficient, fair and transparent way.\What professional economists in Oregon - and many economists nationwide - are saying is that a carbon pricing policy done right is a sound and creative way for Oregon to help reduce potentially catastrophic effects of climate change. Oregon has the opportunity to lead the nation with this commonsense approach.\Randall Bluffstone of Portland is director of the Portland State University Institute for Economics and the Environment. He can be reached at bluffsto@pdx.edu. He wrote this guest opinion in consultation with the drafting committee of the Oregon Economists' Letter in Support of a Carbon Tax in Oregon, which included Trudy Ann Cameron, University of Oregon; David Ervin, Portland State University; Gretchen Greene, Ramboll Environ; William Jaeger, Oregon State University; and Donald Negri, Willamette University.\Randall Bluffstone\Guest Opinion"

Stadium memories will guide us
\
Sadly, a piece of history has been lost - historic Civic Stadium. What remains, however, are memories that, for some of us, go back as far as our high school days.
\
Many hard-fought rivalries were played out on that field. Then came baseball, where we were fortunate to have the opportunity to watch the Eugene Emeralds develop young talent. We even got to enjoy a short-lived AAA team. What a great experience that was.
\
I can still hear the crack of the bat and the voice of the stadium announcer along with cheers from the crowd, and smell the popcorn and hot dogs.
\
Even those who weren't baseball fans before stepping into that magical venue can't deny that what they witnessed on the field while sitting in the grandstands was participating in the making of history.
\
And so it was, because memories are all that remain. Now we must look to building a new facility, guided by the history and memories of our historic Civic Stadium.
\
I'm left with the feeling from the movie ""Field of Dreams"" - ""If you build it, they will come.""

Competitors are proper pool users
\
While I appreciate that Robert Larson voted for the city parks bond measure that rebuilt Amazon Pool, I completely disagree with his understanding of why the pool was built (letters, June 28).
\
During the campaign for the parks bond measure, I was the spokesperson for the political action committee that lobbied to get the measure on the ballot and ran the campaign to pass the measure. In all our campaign statements we emphasized the pool would be a multi-use facility that would provide time and space for recreation, swimming lessons, disability programs, family swimming and competitive swimming.
\
Since the pool was built, it has typically been used for competitive events two weekends a year - all prior to the hottest months of July and August. The meets serve hundreds of Eugene-area swimmers, and bring in additional hundreds of out-of-town swimmers who spend money in Eugene.
\
During the bond campaign, the only user groups that actively helped us campaign were competitive swimmers and water polo players, without whose efforts we might not have a great facility for all of us to enjoy.

Time to move on from stadium fire
\
Civic Stadium has been a roller coaster topic the last several years: We've seen the windshield-wiper on-and-off indecision by the Eugene City Council, possible lawsuits, the Eugene School District this, private buyers that, historians crying, the Eugene Family YMCA salivating, and Market of Choice wanting to throw a fastball of big money at it.
\
Civic Stadium, RIP. Personally, I'm tired of hearing about all the beautiful wood that was used to build it and about how the Eugene Emeralds - who haven't amounted to much as far as sports success goes - played baseball there.
\
It's time for us to stop the whining and crying, buckle our belts, get back on the bull and move on. Whatever's built on the site now will hopefully fit in with the surrounding neighborhood.
\
Maybe the council can now focus on more important things, such as homelessness, mental illness, crime and funding the police.

Bowerman, Jaqua had private sides
\
In the recent and present thrilling halcyon days of Oregon athletes' great successes in the NCAA and the USA Outdoor Track & Field championships, it seems appropriate to take time to maybe learn, certainly remember and celebrate the not-so-public sides of two people who were critical to forming the backbone of the track and field program - John Jaqua, for whom the John E. Jaqua Center for Student Athletes on the University of Oregon campus is named, and of course Bill Bowerman, who represents just about everything else that's track and field in Oregon. Publicly, they were neighbors who were among the original founders of Nike. Privately, they were heroes of World War II.
\
Bowerman was one of the early volunteers and trainers of the famed 10th Mountain Division. Jaqua was a Marine fighter pilot in the Pacific who, in the course of surviving being shot down three times, was awarded the Navy Cross, a military recognition second only to the Medal of Honor.
\
In their modesty, one would likely not hear about their war experiences from either of them. As individuals, they were private benefactors way beyond their public faces, with almost endless lists of private givings, but they preferred - as the very generous tend to do - to keep their light under a bushel.
\
The maxim that they ""gave without remembering and received without forgetting"" applies to both.

UO athletics should share its bounty
\
I don't often agree with Bill Harbaugh, but I must admit he and Dennis Howard made a very good point in their June 26 talk to the City Club of Eugene. The University of Oregon Department of Athletics should be contributing more directly to the UO general fund for academic support.
\
When I was UO provost and senior vice president (1994-2006), I reached an agreement in 2000 with then-Athletic Director Bill Moos that athletics would not be subsidized from the general fund and would become fully self-supporting.
\
Before that, the general fund subsidized athletics to the tune of more than $1 million per year.
\
I assume that agreement is still being followed. If it is, the UO program is one of the few among public universities that's self-supporting, a laudable situation. Since then, UO athletics has flourished and is now in a position to give back to the university that gave it life and has supported it through many lean years, from the 1960s through the 1990s.
\
I believe the suggestion that 10 percent of the Athletic Department budget be returned to the general fund is reasonable, and certainly affordable for athletics. That shouldn't be construed as a ""gift"" to the UO. All athletic facilities stand on land owned by the university. (Matt Knight Arena was paid for at least in part with Athletic Department funds and is technically owned by the university.)
\
A 10 percent fee for the use of the land, and the UO name, seems eminently reasonable to me.

Pope has duty to address climate
\
Raymond Moreno, in his June 27 letter, said that ""Climate change isn't in the pope's purview."" He is wrong.
\
Pope Francis is trained and educated as a chemist, and as a scientist understands that the climate crisis is the most important problem we have in the world today that is already costing 400,000 lives a year. It is a moral issue to do all we can to save those lives and also serve as good stewards of the environment.
\
The pope, in his encyclical, tied care for the environment to care of our fellow beings, noting that the poor would suffer the most from the climate crisis. It is his duty as spiritual head of the majority of Christians to ask his flock to ""Heed the cry of the Earth and the cry of the poor.""
\
It should be the moral duty of every Christian and ethical person in the nation to vote for the politician who is dedicated to saving the environment, helping the poor, and placing a cost on carbon. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is the best at all three. Sanders has said ""Global warming is the greatest environmental threat facing the planet and averting a planetary disaster will require a major reduction in the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels.""
\
A carbon tax would be the best way to do that, and the revenue could generate tens of thousands of jobs.

115,"After more than a decade of the supposedly eco-friendly Pacific Northwest and British Columbia falling short on pledges to fight climate change, a new blueprint emerged last month for how to eliminate all but a sliver of fossil-fuel emissions.\The 428-page plan by Washington state outlines how to make a wholesale shift to renewable energy and meet some of the most ambitious climate-protection goals on the planet. It calls for building a regional network of solar and wind energy stations and transmission lines allowing sharing of power across the western U.S. and Canada.\Much of that renewable energy would be used to produce hydrogen, replacing fossil fuels used by trucks, ferries and industrial facilities, among others.\""We are really primed to move,"" said Eileen V. Quigley, director of the Clean Energy Transition Institute, which was hired by the Washington Department of Commerce to sketch out how to most cost-effectively transform the economy from fossil fuels to clean energy.\Quigley's institute commissioned sophisticated modeling from San Francisco-based consultancy Evolved Energy Research, and also sought advice from more than 150 technical experts and community advocates and a 27-member state advisory committee.\Washington's plan calls for doubling the state's electricity supply through regional action.\""We can really do a lot in terms of keeping rates affordable and service reliable if we can operate the electricity system on more of a west-wide basis,"" said Glenn Blackmon, head of Washington's Energy Policy Office.\Strategies crucial to Washington's plans include universal broadband access, smarter land-use planning, and expanded public transit, all of which reduce energy demand by cutting down on travel in personal vehicles. And, for those fossil fuel uses that can't be easily plugged in, the strategy requires an entirely new industry: so-called ""green hydrogen"" produced by zapping water with renewable electricity.\Green hydrogen is a renewable fuel that can be stored and concentrated, providing a reliable stream of clean energy to replace coal and gas burned in concrete plants and other heavy industries, and to replace diesel in big vehicles such as long-haul trucks and ferries.\Energy experts worldwide see green hydrogen as a crucial building block for ""decarbonization,"" eliminating carbon-dioxide emissions that are a primary cause of climate disruption. For Washington, it also offers an economic engine for rural counties, according to Blackmon, who noted that utilities in eastern Washington with surplus hydropower already have ""aggressive"" plans to make green hydrogen.\Finally, the plan pledges state intervention to ensure that low-income and historically disadvantaged communities have access to capital to upgrade homes and businesses, for example, or to cover the up-front price premium on an electric car.\It's all economically affordable. According to the modeling behind the plan, spending on energy in a decarbonizing Washington would remain within its historic range, about 5% to 7% of the state's economy through 2050.\Cheaper renewable energy is already here\Accelerating development and use of renewable energy is also core to decarbonization plans in Washington's neighbors to the north and south, Oregon and British Columbia — a region that, taken together, is frequently dubbed Cascadia. Changing energy economics boosts the chances for success across the Cascadia region. Cleaner technologies keep getting cheaper.\These days equipment such as electric vehicles and heat pumps cost less than their fossil-fueled forerunners over the life of the products. Solar power's cost has plummeted more than fivefold since 2010.\And fossil fuels' purveyors have less grip on markets — and politicians — as demand for coal, oil and gas weakens and global protests erode their social standing.\""In 2007 we used to talk about Big Oil and King Coal. No one says King Coal anymore, and oil is faltering,"" said KC Golden, one of the founders of Seattle-based nonprofit Climate Solutions and a board member with international activist group 350.org.\The question is: Will Cascadia's governments actually follow through?\The challenge for Govs. Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington is finding dollars in COVID-tightened state budgets to accelerate carbon-cutting. Clean technologies often cost more up front, and it will take state money to speed up their deployment and ensure that all citizens benefit. But in both states, legislators who have long held up cost-effective climate policies remain in their seats.\British Columbia faces a very different challenge. Premier John Horgan's New Democratic Party secured a commanding majority in fall 2020 elections. But British Columbia has a growing oil and gas production industry that Horgan has personally championed as a source of jobs and revenues.\King Coal may be dethroned, and Big Oil weakened, but in British Columbia the oil and gas producers and their employees still carry clout, noted Karen Tam Wu, British Columbia director for the Pembina Institute, a Calgary-based climate and energy think tank. As Wu put it: ""The lure of royalties and the lobbying power of Big Oil is very strong.""\Decarbonization road map\Among the three government's plans, Washington's marks the most dramatic shift. The state that set Cascadia's weakest emissions goals over a decade ago raised its sights to world-class performance early last year.\The Washington Legislature scrapped the state's 2008 mandate, which called for halving emissions by 2050, from 1990 levels, which is barely half of the scale of reductions targeted under the Paris Climate Agreement. In its place, legislators approved an aggressive net-zero goal: only 5% of 1990-level greenhouse-gas emissions would be tolerated in 2050. (And even that 5% would need to be recaptured via reforestation projects or machines sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.)\Washington's new goals come with interim targets, too, starting with a 45% cut by 2030. That will require a lot of push, because recent modeling suggests that Washington could still be pumping out the equivalent of 84 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2030. The state's goal requires cutting emissions to 50 metric tons.\The new targets came without new authorities to actually drive carbon cuts, leading critics to declare the 2020 legislative session a ""comprehensive failure.""\And all signs point to rough politics ahead in the Washington Legislature this year. For the session that started earlier last month, Inslee is again seeking to pass new pollution-cutting programs with well-established opposition. One is a fuel standard — akin to those in place in Oregon and British Columbia — to ratchet down the carbon-intensity of Washington's gasoline and diesel fuels. Industry lobbyists in Olympia have repeatedly fended off such a low-carbon fuel standard. The governor also proposes a ban on natural gas heating in new buildings whose 2030 cutoff date is too late for some activists.\And the governor proposed some controversial means of raising revenues, including yet another push for ""cap and trade"" — a system of pollution controls and charges that has repeatedly failed in both Washington and Oregon's legislatures. That has split the Washington Legislature's climate-protection advocates, with some backing a rival revenue package combining a tax on greenhouse gas emissions and economic recovery bonds.\B.C.'s Gassy Carbon Bulge\Oregon Gov. Brown faces many of the same budget and authority gaps that have bedeviled Inslee. Not so across the international border, where Premier Horgan's parliamentary majority in the British Columbia Legislature gives him leeway to enact laws and raise Canadian dollars. However, his government faces a growing gap between emissions and its 2030 goals — a gap that is exacerbated by fossil fuel development.\For nearly a decade, activists across California and Cascadia defeated proposed megaprojects to export Western coal, oil and gas through Pacific ports. That so-called ""Thin Green Line"" of activism broke in British Columbia in 2018, partly due to Horgan, when the Trans Mountain petroleum pipeline expansion and a pair of natural gas megaprojects got green lights.\Trans Mountain moved forward when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nationalized the project. Horgan took credit for the gas developments: a C$17 billion liquefied natural gas terminal up the British Columbia coast in Kitimat, and a $6.6 billion pipeline linking it to northeastern British Columbia's gas fracking fields.\Oil and gas production contributed half of the provinces' industrial emissions in 2018, and have risen 8% since 2007. That's a significant challenge to British Columbia's goal to cut emissions 40% by 2030, compared to 2007.\In December, a government report said rising emissions from industry and transportation meant British Columbia could miss its 2030 target by nearly half.\Wu, of the Pembina Institute, called the recent report ""sobering"" — not least because it failed to spell out steps to close British Columbia's emissions gap, as the government had promised.\Calculations by the Pembina Institute confirm the long-term scale of the challenge. It found that a planned liquefied natural gas terminal in Kitimat would release the equivalent of 3 to 4 million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide per year. Emissions from producing and delivering its gas would add another 5 million tons. Translation: That one project could produce two-thirds of the greenhouse gases allowable in 2050 under British Columbia law.\George Heyman, British Columbia Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, offered no apologies during an interview last month with InvestigateWest. He said the province's gas industry, including LNG development, provides revenue for public programs and jobs. ""We thought there was some room within a credible climate plan for some development and we approved (LNG Canada) on that basis,"" said Heyman.\Heyman predicted that emissions-cutting programs legislated in 2018 would soon reverse British Columbia's rising emissions trend. Those include:\Tightening of the ""low carbon fuel standard"" that is trimming the carbon content of British Columbia's fuel supply.\Rebates for zero-emissions vehicles and a ban on new gasoline and diesel cars after 2040.\A mandated 45% cut in emissions of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas, by oil and gas producers by 2025 (compared to 2014).\British Columbia may also get a hand from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who recently vowed to ratchet up Canada's nationwide carbon tax requirements.\Starting in 2023, when releasing a ton of carbon dioxide should already cost polluters C$50, Trudeau promises to begin adding $15 a year to reach C$170 per ton in 2030. Heyman estimated that Trudeau's carbon tax boost could close roughly half of British Columbia's emissions gap.\Getting beyond business as usual\Activists are calling for more public pressure to keep Cascadia's leaders focused on climate action, citing signs of continued half-measures.\For example, take the new Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River between Vancouver, Washington, and Portland. Patrick Mazza, a longtime Seattle-based climate policy analyst and activist, noted that the states' plan for a larger bridge will accelerate sprawl from nearby Portland into Washington's Clark County.\""That is really a poster for the inertia of the past continuing into the present,"" says Mazza. ""We're not living in a climate emergency world. That has not been absorbed into the day-to-day operations of bureaucracies or most businesses.""\The Seattle-based Sightline Institute think tank recently called out a mismatch between state emissions goals and growth plans from Cascadia's gas utilities. Washington and Oregon's largest gas utilities, Puget Sound Energy and NW Natural, anticipate rising gas use through 2040. Burning gas currently causes nearly one-quarter of Washington's carbon emissions, and more than one-third of Oregon's.\Mazza played his part in the Thin Green Line movement, getting arrested blocking an oil train in Everett, Washington, in 2014. He landed himself in prison once again in 2019 protest disrupting a Chase Bank branch in Seattle. That campaign is viewed as having helped inspire Chase's recently announced plan to restrict financing for fossil fuel developments.\Mazza calls getting hauled off to jail ""the most valuable thing I can do today."" This year, however, he said Cascadia's politicians need to hear a more positive message amidst the ongoing pandemic and budget crises that threaten to stall climate action.\""'Kill fossil fuels' is a negative. We need a positive. Look at how many people are unemployed right now,"" said Mazza. ""Whatever we do has to have a huge jobs message.""\About the project\Getting to Zero: Decarbonizing Cascadia is a year-long project by nonprofit news organizations in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. Led by Seattle-based InvestigateWest, the project also will include contributions from The Tyee in Vancouver, B.C.; national news site Grist.org; Crosscut.com in Washington; and Jefferson Public Radio in Oregon."
116,"Oregonians are rightly proud of our national reputation for being ""green."" Citizens of this state have shown time and again that we will insist on striking a balance between keeping the wheels of the economy turning and doing the right thing for the environment.\Perhaps at no other time in its history will Oregon face a greater test of that commitment than in the next few years. No matter where you live in this great state, you will be impacted by decisions regarding what forms of energy Oregon will use and how that energy gets to where it is needed.\The state and federal governments stand poised to legislate curbs on greenhouse-gas emissions as a response to climate change. Whether that takes the form of a carbon tax or a trading system in which emissions allowances are traded like commodities, some things are clear:\-A premium will be placed on renewables and conservation.\-Emissions caps will increase the use of low-emission fuels.\-Energy will cost more.\I am the project director for Palomar Gas Transmission, a proposed natural-gas pipeline that is a joint venture of TransCanada's Gas Transmission Northwest and NW Natural. Palomar provides a second path for natural gas to serve NW Natural's 655,000 customers and is a prudent investment in the health of both Oregon's economy and its environment.\The companies that formed Palomar agree that society should invest heavily in both renewables and conservation. But even if Oregon achieves its renewables goals (25 percent renewable energy by 2025), 75 percent of our energy will come from traditional sources. The options are limited:\-Nuclear energy, emission-free though it is, probably won't happen in Oregon.\-Hydro, abundant and clean, is not without environmental consequences, and there is pressure to remove existing facilities (and no plans to build new ones).\-Use of coal, which provides almost as much electricity to Oregonians as hydro and which generates twice as much carbon-dioxide emissions as natural gas, will be significantly reduced in years to come.\To meet Oregon's growing need for energy - and to provide a backstop to intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar power - natural gas is increasingly the consensus choice, not just here but nationwide.\Oregonians - accustomed as we are to abundant, low-cost energy - will have to compete for energy like never before. And that means we need to think about access.\There is currently a single interstate pipeline serving Oregon's major population centers west of the Cascades, and that pipeline gets its supply from Canada and the Rocky Mountain basin. Palomar would provide a second path for natural gas to enter the Willamette Valley. If an LNG terminal is built on the Columbia River, Palomar would be the primary way for a new source of natural gas to reach markets in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.\In short, Palomar offers reliability and supply diversity at a time Oregon needs it most. To ignore the consequences of restricting Oregon's access to the fuel that will clearly be a major component in solutions to the climate-change problem is folly.\Henry Morse Jr. is the project manager for the proposed Palomar Gas Transmission pipeline.

117,"Close down rat-turkey-bird buffet\Urban chickens are certainly contributing to the city of Eugene’s rat infestation, just as compost piles are. Scattered feed and open compost provide a tasty buffet attractive to a wide range of rodents.\Chicken coops and composting are not new to Eugene, but their density and size are. This is troubling because they have become a handy food source for a growing and prolific population of rats.\But there’s more: Wild turkeys have invaded our neighborhoods in search of food, which some residents happily serve. And we delight in hanging suet cages and corncob holders to feed migrating birds.\Rodents have figured out our feeding habits and they are now establishing long-term residential options around these food sources.\It’s time to tackle this new development and close down the buffet. A website and educational programs, proposed by the city to combat the problem will, unfortunately, be too little, too late.\We need more than a theoretical approach to assure a healthy and safe environment for city-dwelling humans.\Christine L. Sundt\Eugene\Take rat problem into own hands\Rats pose a wholly unacceptable public health risk. And, yes, we’ve had open compost bins for decades without giving rise to an infestation of rats (“Chickens clearly behind the rats,” Dec. 28). So the city’s decision to allow a household to raise six chickens instead of two should be promptly reversed. But people can also take matters into their own hands by means I haven’t as yet seen much discussed.\Some years ago, a rat chewed through a wooden shingle on the side of our house and got inside. I later found one or more making themselves at home in a backyard shed that was not adequately secured.\I had read that rats are smart, they won’t go for peanut butter, or they will avoid the trap.\But over a period of three months I trapped seven rats with old-fashioned traps baited with peanut butter. I put each rat, trap and all, into a plastic bag and that into the garbage. I talked with neighbors to alert them, but no one else seems to have had a problem, and after those seven, our infestation was gone. Just do it.\The city could, at the same time, obtain and distribute rat traps in quantity.\Robert Roth\Eugene\Spread housing tax to community\Regarding funding affordable housing projects, it’s been proposed there be a tax on new construction projects. Bazil Freedman suggested, instead, a tax be imposed on sales of real property to be paid by buyers and sellers (“Construction tax needs modifying,” Dec. 23).\In 2012, Oregon voters amended the Oregon Constitution to prohibit real estate transfer taxes, other than those in place prior to Dec. 31, 2009.\There is no question that more affordable housing is needed in our communities. But the funding for that housing somehow needs to be spread over a larger constituency with the entire community participating.\Gail Newton\Eugene\Democrats must regain majority\Peter DeFazio’s Dec. 28 guest viewpoint, “Repairing roads best route to providing jobs,” rightly points out that if Republicans had not thrown away trillions on the rich and the corporations, they could have created 10 times as many jobs investing in infrastructure.\President Trump is killing thousands by destroying health care and removing any regulations that protect consumers or the environment.\It is imperative that Democrats regain Congress to control this madman. How could an unstable, self-serving billionaire who has always ripped off the middle class steal the mantle of populism that has always been the Democrats’ greatest strength?\It’s time for Democrats to energize their fragmented party with an exciting platform that unifies the environmentalists and social activists by advocating a Medicare for All program paid for by a carbon tax.\We need to attract the youth and the disaffected older white voters who have been left behind in the economic recovery, by advocating free college for STEM and medical students, and jobs and substance-abuse programs paid for by a financial transaction tax.\We need to invest in the nation with more research and development, and an infrastructure program that will create millions of clean green jobs of the future.\Jerry Brule\Eugene\Disability system is ‘denial-minded’\The Register-Guard recently published a letter that was likely published nationwide as part of a Republican campaign to reduce entitlements (“Social Security being abused,” Dec. 28).\Having cut taxes on the wealthy by a trillion dollars, Republicans now say there is no money to pay for Social Security, Medicare, and programs to help our poorest citizens.\The letter reflects a lack of knowledge about Social Security disability. If the writer had spoken to doctors and others who deal with it, she would have found out that nearly everyone who applies is turned down, regardless of condition.\The applicant can appeal, but the process takes more than two years - years in which many applicants have no income at all and are reduced to extreme poverty. A number die from the conditions from which they were denied.\This is an earned benefit, which requires years of work. If you haven’t worked, you can’t collect. An average benefit is a little over $1,000 per month, which does little more than pay rent and food, let alone utilities.\The system is denial-minded and has minders who make sure that judges turn down every possible person regardless of merit.\The statements in the letter are baseless.\Mike Larkin\Florence\Hold commissioners accountable\On Dec. 19, more than 50 Lane County voters turned out at the Board of Commissioners’ meeting to demand accountability and transparency in the initiative process in Lane County.\Voters demanded an explanation from the county government about why the Freedom from Aerial Spraying of Herbicides Bill of Rights charter amendment was being kept from the ballot based on the county election clerk’s decision that the initiative did not comply with the separate-vote rule. Despite repeated requests, no explanation has been forthcoming.\Alarmingly, rather than answering to the voters for the county’s actions, Lane County, through County Counsel Stephen Dingle, is leaving it to the timber industry to provide that explanation.\On Dec. 21, in the legal action filed by the initiative’s chief petitioners challenging the clerk’s determination, the county blew off the deadline to explain its position and instead relied on the filing of intervenor Stanton Long - advocating the timber industry’s interests - to answer for our local government’s own actions to stop this initiative.\Lane County commissioners must be held accountable for this gross failing of our local government’s stewardship of the people’s initiative process.\Richard Gross\Deadwood\Egan Center offers spiritual lesson\Having celebrated Christmas, I now understand why it is so difficult to serve at the Egan Warming Center.\It requires me to intentionally walk into spaces of human exhaustion and brokenness, and dark and bitter loneliness, the way the Son of God did. And flanked by sisters and brothers of goodwill and light and promise and peace, I can say in my heart what Jesus says to every one of us: I love you.\Mary Sharon Moore\Eugene"
118,"In response to Milon Whittier's Jan. 26 letter (""Clean Energy Jobs bill a misnomer,"" page 6C) asking that if Oregon's share of global warming carbon emissions is small, why should we do anything to curb it, I would quote Gandhi who said, ""What you do may seem insignificant, but it is most important that you do it.""\Ask if everyone behaved as you, would the world be a better place or a worse place? If an individual acts contrary to the good of all just because they believe their actions are insignificant, that is an action of the morally bankrupt.\Oregon must do its small part, even if it is a small part of the whole, because it is the right thing for all of us to do.\Joseph Harchanko\Salem\As almost everyone now knows, the climate crisis is an imminent threat to our planet's ability to support life. Oregon's contribution to the global carbon pollution problem is small, like that of other states, or even most nations.\To solve this global problem, each person, community, state and nation must do its part to reduce carbon emissions. Cap-and-trade approaches, like the Clean Energy Jobs bill, use a system of free market-driven incentives to reduce emissions. They provide options to invest in technology to reduce emissions or purchase credits from other polluters.\This is the approach used in the successful 1990 plan that has reduced the emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides that cause acid rain. The plan was embraced by industry because of its flexibility under our economic market system.\The other approach is a carbon tax where polluters pay for each ton of carbon emitted with the revenues returned to taxpayers. This system can work as well, but it seems like industry and Republican legislators would prefer the market-based approach of a cap-and-trade policy.\The crisis demands action, massive in scope and immediate in time. Rather than picking nits, I urge the Oregon Legislature to take action now.\Michael Cairns\Independence\I am very concerned about the cap-and-trade bill that's coming back to life.\My utility company projects an increase of double digits in the first year for natural gas. Natural gas is a big part of our business. Any increase threatens our bottom line and would force us to raise prices, lay off employees and decrease any kind of business investments.\This is nothing more than a way for the state to tax business even more. Businesses are facing uncertainty with the money grab called gross receipts tax (which the voters rejected but the Legislature jammed down our throats anyway).\Cap-and-trade has zero effect on emissions. This is just another redistribution of wealth by the fools that are ""in charge"" of the state.\Tina Musshorn\Salem\The Opinion Page of Jan. 26 was the same as most opinion pages — all against our President, accusing him of being a liar, a cheater, etc.\Unfortunately for the writers, they can't believe the truth that over the last three years, the Democrats have spent $40 million of our money to try and undo their embarrassment of losing. Nothing has been proven, so they keep coming up with more lies.\You are upset because President Trump did not tell Pelosi that a terrorist leader who is behind thousands of deaths of Christians and Jews would be taken out. If he had, she would have told the terrorist and sent him another billion dollars because he already spent the billions Obama sent him.\You all think it was a horrible crime to kill a terrorist, yet you are all in the same bunch who believe it is good to kill millions of babies through abortion.\Yes, supporters are behind President Trump because he is doing what we elected him for. Unemployment is way down, the Dow is way up, the military is rebuilt, illegal entries are down — and it goes on.\What have the Democrats done during this time for America? Nothing but tell lies.\Larry Crompton\Salem\The Friday, Jan. 24, Statesman Journal had several stories that remind me how awful Donald Trump is.\On page 8A is an article saying the world is closer to destruction than we have been since the Doomsday Clock was created in 1947, yet Mr. Trump has ended yet another environmental protection (page 9A, same date). Now waterways can be polluted again. Good for business, bad for humans and creatures.\On page 4A, it said nine children who had been separated by ICE were returned to their parents. I think that leaves about 3,991 in limbo?\Mr. Trump attended the March for Life rally, showing he cares more about unborn children than living ones. While the Republican senators were playing with toys, I listened to the Democratic senators.\Mr. Trump cares more about himself than he does about us. Holding money from Ukraine was illegal and only helped Russia.\Mr. Trump does not understand the damage he is doing to the environment, children or to the constitution. Maybe he needs to retire and relocate to Florida on a permanent basis.\Kay Myklebust\Salem\As a college freshman, I didn't truly realize the exorbitant cost of textbooks until I was standing in line, waiting to purchase ""Principles of Microeconomics"" and its online access code for $159.\And while I spent $159 on my book, paying over $200 on a single book is common. Big publishers control the textbook market, having raised prices over three times the rate of inflation during the last decade. Professors, lacking resources to explore alternative options, continue to assign these cost-prohibitive books.\I know students who work instead of study, give up food and increase their loans to obtain reading materials and online access codes. Others scour for online alternatives, hope to pass without these expensive books, or just drop the class entirely.\There is a solution to this crisis: open-source textbooks. They're proven just as effective, and they're free. Grants and programs can help professors develop and access open resources, reducing the market power of publishers and helping students.\Books shouldn't come at the cost of food security, so I believe it's important that schools like Oregon State University, the University of Oregon and Chemeketa prioritize supporting student learning, engagement and success by investing in accessible and affordable open resources.\Eden McCall, University of Oregon student\Salem\My heart soared when I saw the Jan. 24 article about gardening with Oregon native plants (""Native nirvana,"" page 1C). Oregonians are justifiably proud of the northwest, and growing local plants is a celebration of the place we call home.\Displaying Oregon native plants in your yard is like putting out an ""I heart Oregon"" sign, whereas when I see exotic plants in yards, I feel like the homeowner is saying ""I'd rather be elsewhere.""\When I discovered native-plant gardening some years ago, I found it to be nothing less than spiritually transformative. Though I was always an outdoors person, getting acquainted with native plants in my own yard fostered a sense of place and a connection with nature deeper than I'd thought possible.\Once I learned to recognize plants, the experience of hiking became like a joyous visit to dear friends. All of this is in addition to the facts the article points out: that native plants help native wildlife and pollinating insects like no others, require no fertilizer and pesticide and need little or no irrigation once established.\Native plants are win-win-win. They're good for the environment, animals and our spirits.\Jessica L. Kolman\Salem"
119,"When California passed its landmark cap-and-trade law in 2006, supporters were hopeful that the program would provide the template for other states — and eventually the federal government — to solve the climate crisis.\Now, many environmental groups are increasingly saying the program has done little to curb climate change. Worse, they say, it is harming the lower-income areas and communities of color most affected by pollution.\Those environmental justice concerns stopped President-elect Joe Biden from picking Mary Nichols, who leads the California Air Resources Board — the agency that oversees the program — to head the Environmental Protection Agency. And other states, from Pennsylvania to Washington, are now rethinking how they might create similar programs.\""Ten years ago, cap-and-trade was the centerpiece of federal climate legislation and much of the environmental community was really backing it,"" said Michelle Chan, vice president of programs at Friends of the Earth, a national environmental nonprofit.\""Fast forward to today,"" she said, and ""the environmental community has learned a couple of big lessons, and cap-and-trade has become less of an attractive policy tool in the last decade.""\In Oregon, the attempts by Democrats to pass a statewide gas emissions cap-and-trade bill in the past two Legislative session has been contentious. Oregon Republicans staged a week-long walkout protest at the end of the session earlier this year, largely because of Senate Bill 1530.\The plan would make Oregon the second state in the nation with such a program.\After failing to increase their margins in the 2020 election, Oregon leaders say they're unlikely to revisit the issue next year.\Division among environmentalists\While environmental justice groups have led the outcry over cap-and-trade, other well-known organizations in the environmental movement are divided over the issue. The Sierra Club opposed the 2017 extension of California's cap-and-trade program, saying it would not do enough to limit pollution. A Sierra Club spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\Other groups, including the California League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund, called the bill a ""hard-fought compromise"" in a news release and said, ""the benefits in the package outweigh the concessions to industry.""\Cap-and-trade programs work by setting a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted each year. Over time, that limit is reduced. Businesses must then purchase credits allowing them to produce certain amounts of carbon. Companies that exceed those amounts may trade for credits with those that have extra. The state uses the money generated from those credit auctions to fund projects to further reduce emissions. Polluters also may purchase offsets, such as funding to protect forests, that can substitute for some emissions reductions.\Many California leaders still call the program a national model and an example of bold climate leadership. But earlier this month, more than 70 environmental groups wrote to Biden saying Nichols had ignored environmental injustices created by the program. That letter put cap-and-trade in the crosshairs.\""Under cap-and-trade, large polluters buy credits instead of reducing emissions,"" said Jim Walsh, an analyst with advocacy group Food and Water Watch, which was among the groups that signed the letter.\""Those large polluters tend to be located near low-income communities and communities of color,"" he said. ""We've seen emissions increase in (those) communities because of cap-and-trade programs.""\Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, considered those issues when he recently proposed a cap-and-trade program for the state's largest polluters, including fuel and natural gas suppliers, electricity generators and importers. While the structure of the program is similar to California's, some Washington leaders think it's more tailored to address environmental justice concerns.\One of the tweaks would allow regulators to halt the sale of carbon credits if the price falls too low, preventing companies from cheaply hoarding pollution allowances, said Lauren McCloy, Inslee's senior energy policy adviser. Another mechanism would allow the state to intervene if carbon pricing alone is not driving down pollution in certain communities.\""If [the Washington State Department of Ecology] sees an entity is not reducing emissions or is increasing emissions, particularly in a community that's been highly impacted by health disparities, they would be able to impose an entity-specific emissions cap,"" McCloy said.\While details have not yet been finalized, McCloy said the bill would likely allow companies to purchase carbon offsets in place of some emissions reductions. Every investment made from the program's revenue would need to go through an analysis of its impact on low-income communities and people of color.\But many remain unconvinced that even a well-structured cap-and-trade program can be equitable.\""At the end of the day, we just want to see the (emissions) reductions, we want our people to see the difference on the ground in their neighborhoods,"" said Jill Mangaliman, executive director of Got Green, a Seattle-based environmental justice group.\""[The state] has the power with regulatory action to go right to the heart of it instead of creating these loopholes,"" she said. ""Credits and offsets are not real reductions. They're a way for polluters to buy out of their responsibility.""\Focus on emission limits, some say\Many opponents of cap-and-trade would instead like to see strict emissions limits and strong enforcement, regulating carbon like other pollutants instead of creating elaborate markets to incentivize gradual reductions. They also call for cutting off fossil fuel development, which is contributing to global carbon emissions that the U.S. can't regulate.\""We've always been in favor of direct reductions and regulation,"" said Ingrid Brostrom, assistant director at the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment, a California-based environmental justice nonprofit. ""That is going to be the best solution for environmental justice communities.""\While California has been successful at reducing its emissions, critics say the state has been too friendly to polluters and that the bulk of the progress has come from a recession, strict auto pollution standards and a requirement that power providers produce more clean energy.\""California's cap-and-trade program is a cautionary tale,"" Brostrom said. ""The concept of trading pollution is always going to have a tendency to entrench pollution sources where they're at, and that's going to be in low-income communities and communities of color.""\'Pay to pollute' mentality\Even with a more aggressive cap-and-trade program, many critics think the credit-trading and offsets built into the policy create a ""pay-to-pollute"" incentive. A large oil company can buy extra carbon credits from others and invest in a forest conservation project in New York, rather than reducing toxic pollution at a refinery in a marginalized California community. While cap-and-trade has helped reduce emissions to some degree, the benefits have not been equally shared, and some who live near the state's worst polluters have seen their air quality worsen.\""We warned policymakers that the way cap-and-trade was being packaged is racist,"" said Chan, who signed the letter opposing Nichols' appointment.\""Policymakers at the time said climate change is too important for us to let the disproportionate impacts that will occur in black and brown communities hold us back.""\Three years ago, California lawmakers passed a 10-year extension to the cap-and-trade program. Assembly member Cristina Garcia, then the chair of the Natural Resources Committee, helped move the bill through her chamber, while state Sen. Bob Wieckowski, who led the Environmental Quality Committee, did the same in the Senate.\Both Democrats had proposed revisions to the program, but when those failed, they felt pressure to pass the bill, a major priority of then-Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat.\""If I had the courage, I wish I would have put the brakes on that bill,"" Wieckowski said. ""It hasn't done anything (to reduce emissions). If we're supposed to reduce our emissions 40% (by 2030) with the cap-and-trade program, we're not gonna get there. It's not magic.""\Wieckowski said regulators have set the price of carbon too low and allowed emitters to hoard credits, essentially ""banking"" future pollution. He also criticized the offset program, which includes forests that have since burned down in wildfires. While Wieckowski thinks a carbon tax may be a better approach, he would like to see stronger ""guardrails"" on cap-and-trade such as higher minimum prices at credit auctions and an elimination of offsets.\Garcia offered similar criticisms, saying it's far too easy for the worst polluters to pay their way out of meaningful change.\""We sold this to people with the co-benefit of clean air, but we haven't seen that co-benefit,"" said Garcia, who lives in Bell Gardens, southeast of Los Angeles.\""We're still polluting in communities like mine,"" she said. ""It lets people keep polluting and offset it somewhere else. That's just trickle-down environmentalism. We've given cap-and-trade a chance for a while now, and maybe we can't fix it. Maybe it's time to walk away and try something different.""\In a letter to Wieckowski earlier this year, California Secretary for Environmental Protection Jared Blumenfeld said he was working to reevaluate the extent to which the state's climate strategy should rely on cap-and-trade, as well as considering changes to the program to address emissions projections.\Program leader: Criticisms unfair\Rajinder Sahota, who oversees California's cap-and-trade program as an assistant division chief with the Air Resources Board, said many of the criticisms of the program are unfair.\She said cap-and-trade has played a key role in driving down power sector emissions.\When California utilities need to purchase out-of-state power, the price on carbon makes it cheaper to buy renewable electricity, she said.\The program also has ""constrained emissions"" from growing further and will reduce allowances and offsets over the coming years, according to Sahota.\""The program is doubling in stringency over the next decade,"" she said. ""It looks nothing like it will look like over the next decade.""\Meanwhile, Sahota said, toxic pollutants, unlike greenhouse gases, have until recently been under the jurisdiction of local air districts. The state agency gained authority to regulate those pollutants in 2017, and it's still evaluating where the worst impacts are being felt.\The greenhouse gas regulations in cap-and-trade should not be tied in with air quality issues, Sahota said.\""There is no definitive correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and (hazardous pollutants) in a facility,"" she said. ""To say that reducing one automatically reduces the other is not reality.""\California has also sought to invest much of the revenue brought in from cap-and-trade into communities most affected by environmental issues, Sahota said.\Other programs\Other leaders also still see a role for cap-and-trade. A coalition of Northeast states is using a cap-and-trade plan to regulate power plant emissions, a program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI. Proponents say RGGI states have nearly halved their power sector emissions in a decade while generating billions in economic activity from the carbon payments.\But it's unclear if RGGI played a significant role in reducing emissions, as the replacement of coal plants with natural gas—a transition that has happened nationwide—seems to have driven much of the shift. Many of the states in the coalition are looking at a separate cap-and-trade program for transportation emissions, which would target fuel suppliers. Earlier this week, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia were the first to commit to the transportation sector cap-and-trade plan.\Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is seeking to join the RGGI coalition and has directed the state to participate in the transportation program as well. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) noted that cap-and-trade will not solve the climate crisis on its own, touting its enforcement of other air pollution regulations.\""Cap-and-trade programs have shown that they do play a useful and cost-effective role in reducing carbon and other types of pollution,"" said Jamar Thrasher, an agency spokesperson, in an email to Stateline. ""DEP is keenly conscious of the need to prioritize communities near those pollution sources.""\New Mexico's Climate Change Task Force, a group appointed by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, is currently evaluating market-based climate programs, such as cap-and-trade.\Maddy Hayden, a public information officer with the New Mexico Environment Department, said cap-and-trade can be effective at reducing pollution and boosting health outcomes. New Mexico is interested in working with other states or existing programs, she added."

Face Thin sale will restore the forest
\
I'm writing in response to Dick Shearer's June 21 letter regarding the Face Thin timber sale near Westfir. I'm a retired U.S. Forest Service forester who helped plan the project.
\
The only correct statement in Shearer's letter was that the project was planned under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. He stated that ""All the 60- to 100-year-old second-growth Douglas fir along the byway will be gone.""
\
First of all, the byway stretches 60-plus miles and the project encompasses only the first three miles. Secondly, as stated in its name, it's a thinning operation and will leave 70 of the largest, healthiest trees per acre. The thinning is now 80 percent complete, so drive the byway to see the errors in Shearer's statements.
\
He also stated that two casualties of the timber sale will be cool shade and clean water. He must not realize there's a 170-foot no-cut protection buffer along the North Fork of the Willamette River, along with buffers on smaller streams.
\
In addition, a large portion of the sale is being yarded by helicopter, which reduces soil erosion and the need for temporary road construction that other yarding methods incur.
\
The thinning and fuel treatments underway will put the area on a path to restoration to conditions that existed prior to the era of intensive logging practices - a more fire-resilient forest with larger, wider-spaced trees. That's the intended outcome of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act.

Imbalance prevents collaboration
\
The 40-hour work week, the eight-hour work day, protection from unfair firing and receiving retirement benefits were all unthinkable before unions bargained for them.
\
Once union workers had those advantages, non-union workers acquired them as well. Those are benefits workers want.
\
The author of the June 26 column headlined ""Eugene sick leave law veers in wrong direction"" sold a disingenuous position of ""collaboration"" in the relationship between employer and employee.
\
Perhaps if the writer spent some time cleaning motel rooms for minimum wage he might have a better understanding of the power differential at work.

We should create an economic atmosphere in which we can bring one another up to higher standards in healthy work environments, not buy into fear that keeps people down.

Fourth of July isn't about fireworks
\
James Kaplan (letters, June 18) believes Eugene mustn't further restrict the use of fireworks. His justification? The national anthem's ""rocket's red glare"" and ""bombs bursting in air"" are symbolic of independence and patriotism.
\
Kaplan needs to read Francis Scott Key's 1814 poem and/or listen to the words of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" at the next football game. Independence Day is about the banner, it's not about hawking fireworks.
\
Pat Gariepy's book ""Gardens of Hell - Battles of the Gallipoli Campaign"" recounts (in the words of those who were there) the carnage inflicted on both sides by rifles, mortars, bombs and machine guns during World War I.
\
Our national anthem doesn't praise those instruments of war, nor should it be used to resist common-sense restrictions on fireworks. Kaplan's willingness to equate sparklers, fountains and other innocuous (legal) fireworks with patriotism cheapens victories won at great cost in countless battles during the War of 1812, World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.
\
Waldport resident Ron Betts, a Vietnam War veteran, ended his June 14 letter with, ""Please excuse us if we take a pass on the fireworks."" What will millions of other combat veterans feel when the fun-seekers insist on lighting fuses well before and after the Fourth of July?
\
Flying an American flag on July 4 would be consistent with our national anthem - and more respectful of each other and our veterans - than insisting that the noise, intrusions and disruptions of fireworks must be accepted.

Have some sympathy for the rich
\
People who live in houses the size of a walk-in closet pay fees twice as high as people who actually have walk-in closets (and as the corporations that make the houses for the people with walk-in closets).
\
Now, that's just not right. I say we should double the fees on the poor so the wealthy and their corporations can be free of the onus of taxation, thereby freeing up the tides to rise all boats.
\
Invisible hand of the market, people, invisible hand of the market. That means the working poor should be not only powerless, but also silent and invisible.
\
Do you have any idea how hard it is on the rich to have to inhabit the same town as the unrich, or how much they suffer to have to use the same streets and shops the non-rich use?
\
Won't somebody please for once do something that helps the truly needy, i.e., the fabulously wealthy?

Climate change action is needed
\
In Oregon, and especially in Lane County, we have one of the best forests in the world for carbon sequestration. With a carbon tax or carbon offsets, we could get paid for not cutting our forests, especially the mature or virgin forests that are found mostly on public lands.
\
Gov. John Kitzhaber, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden and U.S. Rep. Peter Defazio all agree global warming is a major crisis that needs immediate action. But in their next breaths they promote destroying 1.6 million acres of former Oregon & California Railroad forests.
\
Time is running out before we won't be able to mitigate climate change and runaway global warming. The sixth mass extinction, which is human-caused, is already underway, and climate change is playing a big part.
\
Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson calls the next age ""The Age of Loneliness."" How crazy is it when money and power are more important than basic survival?

Why the blackout on IRS scandal?
\
It's disgraceful how The Register-Guard editors have ignored the Internal Revenue Service tea party-targeting scandal. Two weeks after learning some of Lois Lerner's emails vanished and her hard drive crashed with emails to those outside the IRS, we've heard nothing from the Obama lovers or the newspaper's editorial writers.
\
The emails obviously would implicate the White House, and the IRS has lied to Congress.
\
But the editors are so worked up about the hoax of anthropogenic global warming that they've deliberately avoided commenting on a sitting president using the federal government to intimidate and threaten citizens exercising their constitutional rights.
\
That's something that happens in North Korea or China, and Barack Hussein Obama should be impeached for it. Imagine the screeching from The Register-Guard had a Republican presidency used the IRS to silence its political opponents.

"
121,"As a local resident, businessman and parent, I share the concerns of many who are alarmed about the unprecedented threat posed by global warming to our environment, economy and our children's future.\The impact in Oregon is real. A glance at old photographs of glaciers on Mount Hood is shocking - some have completely melted away!\Scientists estimate a 50 percent reduction in the average Oregon snowpack by the 2050s, meaning less water for farms, fish, recreation and drinking. In some streams, salmon and steelhead are already experiencing stressful and even lethal water temperatures above 70 degrees.\Many in Congress support reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But what's the best method? A carbon tax, new government spending on clean energy sources, or voluntary reductions?\I believe that a cap-and-trade system is best because it puts a clear limit on carbon emissions and gives us targets. This approach caps the total amount of global warming pollutants generated.\That cap will be gradually reduced, and polluters who reduce emissions below their cap can sell their unused allowances to others, creating incentives to reduce emissions without government spending and new taxes.\Such a solution was on the table last week in the U.S. Senate. The Climate Security Act (CSA) - co-sponsored by Sens. Lieberman, Warner and Boxer - would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 70 percent by 2050, beginning in 2012. We would cut emissions gradually by about 2 percent every year to reach the goal.\But because of a filibuster, the Senate didn't act on the legislation. And if Congress delays even two years, we'll need to cut pollution at twice that rate.\Economic analyses of the CSA conclude that we can afford to fund new investments in clean energy technologies while growing our overall economy. In fact, President Bush's Department of Energy predicts the CSA would not impact economic growth. Further, the CSA would decrease oil imports by more than 8 million barrels a day by 2025, saving more oil than we currently import every day from OPEC countries.\The CSA would also help create opportunities for Oregonians to continue to drive innovation by adding to the ""green collar"" jobs already created in wind, solar and biofuels. Salem is already home to Oregon's only commercial biodiesel production facility that truly produces energy by using locally collected, used cooking oil as its primary feedstock.\The Willamette Valley is a magical place for growing things, and Oregon universities are on the cutting edge of energy research. Our local farmers and foresters can provide cellulosic feed stock for ethanol instead of the wasteful shipping of corn around the country chasing subsidies.\Our congressional delegation has a wonderful opportunity to push this legislation.\John Miller of Salem is president of Wildwood/Mahonia, a group of Salem-based companies involved in agriculture, urban design and development and biofuel production.

Note: Obama administration taking a regulatory route
\
In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming - and that it had shirked its duty by not doing so.
\
The Bush administration just kept fiddling: Yes, climate change is a serious problem, but more study is needed. Capping greenhouse gas emissions would wreak havoc on the economy. The Clean Air Act is the wrong tool for the job. The Supreme Court didn't really mean what it said. Besides, what's wrong with arctic shipping lanes and longer growing seasons for vegetables?
\
The Bush administration succeeded in running out the clock on its second term without taking a single meaningful action to arrest or reverse global warming. Meanwhile, it did everything in its power to prevent other countries, Congress and individual states, including Oregon, from acting to address climate change on their own.
\
Now, the Obama administration is about to change the tune.
\
Last month, President Obama ordered the EPA to reconsider a request by California, Oregon and a dozen other states to put in place tough new limits on emissions from cars and trucks. On Feb. 17, Lisa Jackson, the EPA's new administrator, said she will review the Bush administration's decision not to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. One day later, she said she will consider acting on the Supreme Court's decision that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act.
\
The Obama administration's shift comes as scientists are warning that the pace of global warming is exceeding earlier predictions. That's because industrial greenhouse emissions have surged more quickly than expected as a result of increased burning of coal in developing countries. Meanwhile, surprisingly large amounts of carbon dioxide are being released into the atmosphere as the result of self-reinforcing ""feedback loops"" that are speeding up natural processes, such as the melting of arctic permafrost.
\
President Bush's response to such warnings would have been a categorical refusal to do anything that might further stress an already overstressed economy. But Obama refuses to buy the spurious argument that what's good for the environment must be bad for the economy. The economic stimulus package recently approved by Congress includes tens of billions of dollars to create green jobs, many of them in Western states such as Oregon that have positioned themselves to become the nation's renewable resource basins.
\
Obama understands that an economic downturn is no excuse for standing down on climate change - and that it provides an opportunity to create new clean-tech industries and jobs that cannot be outsourced.
\
But regulatory changes should be just the beginning for the Obama administration. Eventually, Congress must take its rightful ownership of this complex issue and put a price on carbon-based fuels through either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.
\
But smart, effective regulation is a necessary first step. It will induce automakers and the energy industry to start making the technological changes that are both achievable and necessary to reduce emissions. Eventually it will prod Congress into action, as industry lobbyists push for a comprehensive federal climate policy that spreads the burden of reducing emissions more evenly among all polluters.
\
Then there's the matter of the law and a landmark Supreme Court ruling that the Obama administration, unlike its predecessor, appears unwilling to ignore.

Making the transition to a clean energy economy requires vision and action. Action will be required to fulfill the promise of the worldwide Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Oregon is leading the way. Hope is growing that, working together, we can shift to clean energy before climate change has irreparably damaged the ecosystems that sustain our economy and quality of life.
\
It's no longer a question of ""if"" we should act, but ""how."" This month, top energy officials from 23 of the world's largest economies joined business leaders and elected officials for the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial in San Francisco to share solutions.
\
With the world's attention on the West Coast, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and the leaders of Washington, California and British Columbia gathered to sign an agreement to move forward with ambitious ideas to build on our climate successes, supercharge our clean economies and slash the pollution from our region.
\
Known as the Pacific Coast Collaborative, these three states and one province make up the fifth-largest economy in the world, serving as a powerful example of leadership.
\
A top priority: account for the true cost of pollution, and hold polluters accountable. While California (with a cap-and-trade system) and British Columbia (through a carbon tax) have begun this work, Oregon and Washington must also design and pass plans to achieve this major goal.
\
In Oregon we're showcasing the fact that environmental protections and a thriving economy are linked, not at odds. Since 2010, we've created more than 4,800 clean economy jobs -- a growth rate of 11 percent, higher than overall job growth. Our clean economy GDP was $7 billion in 2014 alone, and we're not done yet.
\
Oregon is leading with smart, forward-looking policies. The Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Act makes us the first state in the nation to remove coal from our electricity mix and replace it with renewable power. Our Clean Fuels Standard holds oil companies responsible for reducing their pollution and uses business innovation to give consumers more choices. These policies orient Oregon's economy toward the future, create the climate for job growth and innovation, and blaze a trail for other states to follow.
\
The Pacific Coast Collaborative leaders, and mayors from six large West Coast cities, pledged to transform vehicles, buildings, energy and waste to cut global warming pollution by 80 percent by 2050.
\
The agreement sets ambitious goals to build clean energy in communities and get more electric vehicles into families' driveways. It's a call to design more energy efficient buildings and homes that will eventually produce as much power as they consume. Just as cars are assigned miles-per-gallon ratings, we should rate buildings by how much power they use. We must do these things and more to achieve a clean energy economy.
\
The agreement also requires that we work to protect those most affected by climate change. Both urban and rural low-income communities need more access to clean energy, cost-saving technology and investment. The Pacific Coast Collaborative agreement brings new focus to guarding against forest fires, protecting our ocean resources, helping our family farms adapt to prolonged drought and limiting ""super pollutants"" such as black carbon, smog and methane to protect our health and our climate.
\
The message of the Pacific Coast Collaborative agreement is that city and state action matters. Local action will drive changes throughout the world. For example, Eugene Mayor Kitty Piercy represented us at a summit of world mayors in China this month, holding Eugene up as a global example with its pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2020 and to cut fossil fuel use by half, across the community, by 2030.
\
Hope is a starting point, not a solution. We need a strong sense of resolve as we find ourselves on the brink of another wildfire season -- after many years in a row where megafires broke records in the West for destruction and money spent to fight them. Firefighters lost their lives. Homes burned. Smoke choked our air.
\
Our snowpack is disappearing early despite the wet winter. Arid conditions and high temperatures will once again deprive our farms and forests of life-sustaining water. Extreme allergies and asthma -- triggered by high temperatures and air pollution -- create unnecessary suffering. Climate change affects our health, our economy and our communities.
\
The Paris agreement demonstrates a worldwide understanding of the problem and a commitment to fixing it together. Seeing diplomats, mayors, industrialists, farmers, doctors, nurses, workers and families come together to find solutions that will protect our environment and grow our economy inspires the hope and conviction that this problem is not beyond repair and that our local actions matter.

The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are pressing governments to impose a price tag on planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, using economic leverage and technical assistance that institutions like the United Nations cannot muster.
\
The campaign by two of the largest international lenders comes as world leaders have begun to sign the Paris agreement on climate change, the U.N. accord that is supposed to commit nearly every country to take action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
\
But the leaders of the World Bank, the IMF and other major global institutions say cutting emissions enough to stave off the worst effects of climate change will not be possible unless all fossil fuel polluters are forced to pay for the carbon dioxide they emit.
\
""There is now an overwhelmingly obvious scientific consensus that the more carbon pollution we put into the air the more impact it has on warming the massive melting of the Arctic, the cycles of droughts and flooding, the die-offs of coral reefs,"" the World Bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, said in an interview. ""And to our economists, who have been studying this for quite some time, there is an equally obvious consensus that putting a price on carbon pollution is by far the most powerful and efficient way to reduce emissions.""
\
He added, ""We strongly urge people to prepare for the carbon pricing that is to come.""
\
The World Bank's central mission is to alleviate global poverty, and in a twist on that mission, bank leaders have identified climate change as a key driver of poverty. A World Bank report last year concluded that climate change could beggar 100 million more people by 2030.
\
""We cannot poison the planet and thrive,"" Kim said at the adoption of the Paris agreement in December.
\
To press that case, the bank has created a Carbon Finance Unit to give financial and technical assistance to countries that are creating a system to put a price on carbon. This is usually set up as a tax on fossil fuels like coal and oil or as a ""cap-and-trade"" system that sets limits on overall carbon emissions then allows companies to buy and sell emission allotments sold by the government.
\
The bank is already working with 18 countries with emerging economies, including China, which has received an $8 million grant to develop what is expected to be the world's largest cap-and-trade program. South Africa and Chile have received similar grants, and World Bank officials are meeting with the governments of Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Panama to help them create carbon pricing systems.
\
Under the Paris agreement, all countries submitted plans to reduce their carbon emissions, and they are required to update and strengthen those plans over the coming years. Already, about 90 countries have included some form of carbon pricing in their plans. The World Bank has reviewed those U.N. plans, hoping eventually to link the systems into a global carbon trading market.
\
""We've now got carbon pricing on the radar screen in a way it hasn't been before,"" said John Roome, the senior director for climate change programs at the World Bank Group. ""We're moving from why to how.""
\
The IMF, often seen as the world's lender of last resort, is also consulting and advising countries on how best to introduce carbon pricing, in part as a way for struggling nations to raise more revenue.
\
""We can't make a loan conditional on carbon pricing, but for a country facing a large deficit, we could recommend that they use carbon pricing as a way to simultaneously meet their pledges in Paris and close their deficit,"" said Ian Parry, principal environmental fiscal policy expert at the IMF.
\
Any policy that drives up the cost of fossil fuels can be expected to generate intense opposition. In the United States political groups funded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and others stand in the way.
\
""It's frustrating to watch unelected bureaucrats like the World Bank and other institutions try to leverage their power to force elected leaders to take actions that harm their citizens,"" said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed advocacy group.
\
About 40 countries, including the 28 members of the European Union, along with 23 cities, states and regions around the world, have introduced carbon pricing policies. They cover about 12 percent of the world's carbon pollution.
\
Last week, the World Bank, the IMF, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the heads of state of Canada, Chile, Ethiopia, France, Germany and Mexico released a statement calling for more carbon pricing. Their goal is to reach enough countries to cover 25 percent of the world's carbon emissions by 2020 and 50 percent of emissions by 2030.
\
""Our government has heard loud and clear that Canadians care about standing up for our environment and our livelihoods,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said.
\
Four of Canada's 13 provinces and territories already have some form of carbon pricing, and Trudeau hopes to enact a national plan.
\
The Oregon Legislature is considering its own trading regime, and a ballot initiative to create a carbon tax is expected to be on the Washington state ballot in November.

126,"In 2015, Oregon environmental issues in the news included everything from contaminated clams to a carbon tax; pesticides to earthquake planning; and weed-eating goats to GMOs.\But the biggest story by far was the continuing drought, which impacted recreation, agriculture, wildlife, water supplies and more.\Oregon - and the West - marked its fourth consecutive year of drought, and the toll is growing.\The state's snowpack was the lowest on record, and it began to melt earlier than ever, draining the natural reservoirs that serve much of the state.\Wildfire season began three weeks early, firefighting costs ended up the second-highest in state history. For the first time ever, campfires were banned in all state parks.\In July fish began dying from low stream flows and high temperatures, leading the state to curtail fishing hours. Low-water boat ramps were pulled out of local reservoirs early, affecting recreation. And cities across the state asked residents to curtail water use.\A few other topics also grabbed big headlines:\Radiation\We knew it was coming, and in April it became official: Seaborne radiation from Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster was documented on North American shores.\No federal or state agency is tracking the plume's progress across the Pacific, so in 2014, chemical oceanographer Ken Buesseler launched a crowdfunded, citizen-science project to collect sea and surf samples. They're tested at his lab at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.\Cesium 134, the ""fingerprint"" of Fukushima, first was detected off a dock on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.\Earlier this month, Buesseler reported that more samples were testing positive, and at higher levels. Still, he emphasized, the levels are far below those that might pose a risk to human health or marine life.\Levels from the initial release are expected to peak next year. However, the crippled plant continues to produce contaminated water, some of which has been released to the sea.\The Legislature\Environmental groups got an early win in the 2015 session, with passage of the clean fuels bill, which intends to cut carbon emissions from transportation fuel by 10 percent over 10 years.\But its passage cast a shadow over the rest of the session.\Republicans refused to budge on a transportation funding bill that all acknowledged was necessary unless Democrats agreed to repeal the legislation.\Gov. Kate Brown has said the Legislature should now wait until 2017, after voters decide on a likely ballot measure to repeal the bill, to try again.\Environmental groups also saw wins with passage of the Toxic Free Kids Act, which requires disclosure and possible phase-out of certain chemicals in children's products; and with slightly watered-down bills funding bee health programs and setting new rules on aerial pesticide spraying.\But they weren't successful with a bill that would require energy companies to transition off coal and to cleaner energy sources - legislation that some groups had identified as the most important of the session.\Backers of that bill now are aiming to put the issue to voters next year.\Selling off state resources\Two issues centered around state-owned resources drew multiple protests over the course of the year:\First, the state began selling off pieces off the Elliott State Forest, saying it's losing money as timber harvests have declined.\The 84,000-acre forest near Coos Bay was created to provide money to the State School Fund.\In August, the State Land Board adopted a plan to sell the remaining property as one piece, at full market value, to a buyer that would be willing to maintain public benefits such as recreational access and preservation of old-growth forest. But, if such a buyer can't be found, they'll sell it to someone else.\Earlier this month, four dozen entities formally expressed interest in working toward purchasing the property.\Second, a complicated plan to allow Nestle Waters North America to bottle state-owned spring water took a twist, drawing outrage from opponents and even a group of legislators.\The deal to build a bottling plant in economically depressed Cascade Locks has been in the works for more than six years.\The city wants to trade its well water for the nearby spring water, then sell the spring water to Nestle.\The deal faced an extensive review to determine whether it served the public interest. But in April, the state and city came to a new agreement to permanently trade water rights, instead of just water, eliminating that review.\In November, Gov. Brown intervened, ordering the parties to return to the original water exchange process.\Meanwhile, opponents have gathered enough signatures to qualify a local ballot measure blocking the deal. They believe it may the first of its kind in the country.\Fossil fuel transport\Environmental groups celebrated the defeat of the Keystone XL pipeline in November.\But they're still protesting a number of fossil fuel infrastructure projects - coal, crude-by-rail and liquefied natural gas export terminals - proposed for Oregon and the Pacific Northwest.\Opponents say that in addition to health and environmental dangers, the projects could help keep global fossil fuel consumption high at the same time that Oregon and the nation are working to cut carbon emissions.\Most recently, activists and oyster growers protested outside the State Land Board meeting, asking the board to deny key permits for the Jordan Cove Energy Project near Coos Bay, which would receive natural gas through a new, 232-mile pipeline.\tloew@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6779 or follow at Twitter.com/Tracy_Loew\More Inside\A banner year for the Ducks and Beavers, Page 1C\AP's male athlete of the year, Page 8C\Statesman Journal photographers' year in photos, Page 5D\A look back at Mid-Valley arts and culture, Page 1E\Year in Review\Joins us as we look back on the remarkable people, animals and memorable moments of 2015.\Today: Environment, photos, sports and arts\Monday: Animals and memorable front pages\Tuesday: Weather and crime\Wednesday: People\Thursday: Big moments and openings/closings\Friday: Inspiration\Saturday: Most viewed online and on social media"

Clark has municipal experience
\
In looking at Eugene's two leading mayoral candidates, we have one, Mike Clark, who has spent 10 years on the City Council dealing with the major issues that come with running a city.
\
The other candidate, Lucy Vinis, has considerable experience in nonprofit social services. Those endeavors are valued and necessary but our town has many organizations performing that work, which is outside the city's responsibility and purview.
\
Experience in the nonprofit arena doesn't compare with making the hundreds of decisions needed to run a city that involve land use; the use and future of the Multi-Unit Property Tax Exemption program; supervision of police, fire and public works, and planning and development issues that impact all of Eugene.
\
Other decisions must be made on a process for building a new City Hall, spending and taxation, street repairs and a host of nuts-and-bolts issues.
\
That's why I'm voting for Clark, who has gained substantial experience in all those matters, rather than for someone whose responsibilities as a development director for a social service organization are different and much more limited than those required of a mayor.

Brown is a Democrat in name only
\
Historically, state Democrats have elected governors who have worked hard for Oregon to protect its wild beauty and abundant wildlife while serving the needs of a population that cares -- a lot -- about living in a healthy environment.
\
So it's shocking that our current Democratic candidate for governor is a woman who remains essentially unchallenged, her only claim to the office being that she was in the right position to finish former Gov. John Kitzhaber's final term.
\
Have we gotten smug? Do we just assume that any Democratic candidate will be faithful to Democratic voters' priorities?
\
Gov. Kate Brown's recent decisions -- to remove protections for wolves, open big game hunting of cougars and let lumber companies spray chemicals that endanger our thriving organic industries and the insect life essential to environmental health -- make it clear her priorities don't align with those established in the past.
\
It's unclear whether she made those decisions because she believes them to be justified, or was simply hoping to elicit votes from ranching, hunting and timber interests who wouldn't normally support a Democrat.
\
What is clear is that, taking her cues from ruthless politicians such as the governors of Michigan and Wisconsin, she's ready and willing to sacrifice our state's treasures, and our well-being, to her political ambitions.
\
Let's keep Brown from slithering into the governorship while we're distracted by the continuing national political circus.

Manning is a tireless advocate
\
I first met James Manning in a public setting where he was fundraising for minority youth, requesting donations for basketball shoes so a youth group could join a basketball league.

He made donating easy by explaining how things worked, and he had the youth involved in the process.

I've been privileged to join Manning on the Eugene Water & Electric Board, and he's true to his word.

He reflects the values and needs of his constituency, he responds personally to those who contact him about issues, and he's demonstrated his allegiance to public service by his career military service and subsequent service as a public safety officer. He's continued to serve the community by actively involving himself on numerous boards and commissions.

Manning is the type of person we need in Salem -- someone who knows what he doesn't know, and who will help ensure that the people's voice is louder than the lobbyists' voice.
\
He won't cave to special interest groups and while his actions will be in the best interests of the people he represents, they will be fair to all concerned.

We can do better than Hoyle, Brown
\
The other day someone mentioned ""Snake Oil (Val) Hoyle"" to me and it reminded me just how little she has done on environmental issues as a state legislator. With Hoyle, it always seems to be about big business and institutional jobs.
\
Now she's busy running for secretary of state, which we all know is the jumping-off point for election as governor. Because of that, I advocate that we elect someone else secretary of state.
\
The next governor, unlike Kate Brown so far, needs to strongly advocate for mitigating climate change damage with strong carbon taxes; preserving our carbon dioxide-absorbing forests; making corporations pay their fair share of taxes for needed services and education; saving what wildlife diversity remains; stopping aerial spraying of herbicides on people and animals; developing clean, green family wage jobs that will help keep Oregon economically healthy, and implementing much-needed affordable housing projects across the state.
\
Neither Brown nor Hoyle is that person. For governor, take a hard look at Dr. Julian Bell of Ashland, a well-spoken and smart carbon tax proponent. For secretary of state, consider the capable Brad Avakian, who's done a good job as a legislator and as state labor commissioner.

The two offices are too important to our future for just anybody to use them as a stepping stone to greater power.

Sanders supporters are deluded
\
So, Bernie Sanders was in town. That's good, I guess. It's amazing to me that so many people were able to attend his April 28 rally in Springfield -- I'm guessing because they don't have jobs and are looking to him for the next free government handout.
\
Sanders talks a good game, but the only reason he's popular is because people are willing to listen to anything that sounds good. And yet, behind those wonderful ideas is a false myth about how to pay for them.
\
Taxing the rich more is a way of penalizing people for being successful, rewarding people who have failed and making those who have failed believe their failures are caused by other people's success. That's wildly absurd, but Sanders and Hillary Clinton supporters eat that stuff up. Only uneducated, uninformed people believe such idiocy. Stealing from the rich to give to the poor is exactly what it sounds like: stealing.

Clinton stands for politics as usual
\
The Register-Guard has printed so many negative things about Hillary Clinton that it surprised me the editors chose to endorse her for the Democratic nomination for president (April 10).

\
Personally, I'm tired of the same old, same old politics Clinton represents, in which money is God, the rich are the rulers and the people are their minions.
\
Elections have a hidden agenda: Do we want to continue to police the world, supporting dubious values, or take care of our domestic problems?

Budget priorities need to be shifted
\
Recent letters have mentioned the need for increased funding for Eugene's public schools. In a March 6 letter, Mayor Kitty Piercy wrote of the need to end ""the decades-long trend of constantly eroding school funding."" In a March 29 letter, Ann Cole wrote the Eugene School District ""has suffered from repeated and drastic funding cuts since 1990.""
\
There was a reduction in district revenue from $149 million in the 2008-09 school year to $131 million this school year, due to the recession. But in earlier years, the revenue and expenditures were increased, not eroded.
\
In the 2000-01 school year operating revenue was $134 million and grew to $149 million in 2008-09, an 11.1 percent increase. During that period, student enrollment actually declined.
\
To educate a projected enrollment of 16,027 students in the current school year, district expenditures are projected to be $139 million, the same expenditure in the 2004-05 school year to educate 17,570 students. That was sufficient to educate 17,570 students a few years ago but now isn't enough to educate 16,027 students?
\
There has not been a decades-long erosion in school funding, but there has been an erosion in priorities. Employee compensation has become more important than the classroom.
\
Maybe more money should be given to teachers in the classroom, to libraries and to science labs, and less money spent on workers' Public Employees Retirement System and insurance benefits.

MacArthur was right about Korea
\
North Korea has been a thorn in the United States' side for 60 years, from arriving at those early Korean War peace talks in bloody, shot-up American Jeeps to shortening the legs of the chairs the Americans sat in.
\
President Harry Truman performed a great disservice to America and its combat troops by firing the one general who knew what we were up against with North Korea and ensuring that China never would be able to march south against U.S. and South Korean forces.
\
That insurance would have been delivering at least one nuclear strike along the south side of the Yalu River. That would have bottled up Chinese forces and also taught them a lesson regarding American military might.
\
Now, North Korea has a new 30-year-old leader who is completely untested in anything and wishes to rattle his toy saber. Stopping the noise would take one high-explosives air strike on his residence, palace and military command centers and an air strike along his military line north of the demilitarized zone. If he survived that, we should follow up with a nuclear strike that would turn North Korea's capital into ashes.
\
Gen. Douglas MacArthur was correct in what he was doing and Washington should have stayed out of his way.

I'm alarmed about the efforts to sell off our federal, publicly owned former Oregon & California Railroad Co. forest lands to private industry. Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio's plan is to let private logging companies clear-cut more than 1 million acres, including old growth, without the protections of the Northwest Forest Plan.
\
That's absolutely the exact opposite of the direction we ought to go. Anyone who hasn't been out in the foothills around Lane County recently should go take a look. The amount of clear-cut logging on private forests is disturbing.
\
The forests managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management are some of the healthiest, mixed with the clear-cut private forest lands. Older forests store huge amounts of carbon, among many other ecosystem services.
\
The most-respected climate scientists predict a 50 percent reduction in our snowpack in the next few years and larger forest fires in the Pacific Northwest. When fires occur in native forests, which have trees of varying age and species, the tree mortality rate is about 40 percent. On single-age, single-species tree farms - which is what we have on private forest lands - the tree mortality rate is 100 percent.
\
Only selective, truly sustainable logging should be allowed. Let's increase the timber harvest tax to bring in more revenue. To mitigate climate change, let's urge our legislators to implement a carbon tax. There are many reasons to increase protections for our forests - and that should be our goal, for the health of our children and their children.

Bicycling produces economic gains
\
The April 2 editorial opposing a tax or fee on bicycling was appreciated.
\
Copenhagen, a city where approximately 50 percent of the population cycles to work or school, publishes an annual report on cycling in the city. The city's studies have found that each mile a cyclist rides on a bicycle produces a 42-cent economic gain to society. By comparison, a mile driven in a car is a 20-cent loss.
\
The factors included transport costs, security, comfort, branding and tourism, transport times and health. To quote the Danish interior minister, Margrethe Vestager, ""Cycling leads to better public health, a cleaner urban environment, and helps us reach our climatic goals. So I will rather invest in cycle tracks than freeways!""
\
I hope Eugene and Oregon will continue to follow that (cycle) path.

Extreme reaction is unwarranted
\
Regarding the March 30 report about a professor at a Florida university who was put on leave because of an uproar over a student assignment to write the name of Jesus on a piece of paper, put it on the floor and stomp on it (""College puts 'stomp Jesus' instructor on leave""), he was using the assignment to illustrate cultural differences, not as a testimony on his beliefs.
\
His life has been threatened and some people want him fired. As a Christian person who participates actively in a church, I'm offended by that kind of public reaction. It fails to recognize that we live in a country where freedom from religion, as well as of religion, is a basic right.
\
Even if the professor meant it as an anti-Christian act, which he did not, we shouldn't react like those cultures where religious blasphemy is considered a criminal act punishable by imprisonment or death.

Dropping program is short-sighted
\
In suspending its energy conservation incentive program, the Eugene Water & Electric Board is missing a big chance to win the hearts of its customers (""EWEB suspends incentive program,"" March 30). Instead, it's raising questions about the shortsightedness of its leaders.
\
In the long run, no one will benefit by making it more difficult to reduce our use of electricity. The most we can lose is Mother Earth and those of us who live on it.
\
It's good to know that we, with the help of EWEB, have reached an important goal in using less electricity (energy). Using less energy is a way to lower our carbon footprint.
\
Instead of quitting the incentive program, why not celebrate gaining that goal and then, to give us a double-win, be a true public utility and for the global good stop buying excess electricity?
\
I joined the program that allows the purchase of more wind energy - but if I had known that would help hasten the end of the incentive program, I might have thought twice about joining.
\
EWEB has been a leader in purchasing electricity from renewable energy sources and in helping its customers conserve energy.
\
Let's not stop now.

Socialist references outdated
\
I was struck by Norm Fox's reference in the Nov. 23 Mailbag to the media's ""dumbing down of the definition of socialism so it would not be applied to Obama.""
\
Media references to socialism during the campaign followed John McCain's and Sarah Palin's attacks on Barack Obama as a socialist, Marxist and communist. Both are, as Bill Maher says, so last millennium.
\
What is dumb is that people still talk this way any more. I know it worked for Richard Nixon of ""We're all Keynesians now"" fame, but isn't this the point? Nixon founded a political career by going after Commies while he instituted wage and price controls.
\
Wall Street and Detroit beg for bailouts with no strings attached while trembling about the leftists descending upon Washington. The utter confusion extends to Rep. Paul Braun of Georgia who fretted publicly about an impending Obama-instigated Marxist dictatorship.
\
Braun's comments border on what Michael Shermer, in the same Commentary section, calls the cultic delusions of those who talk too much to people like themselves. Shermer advises that we listen to the other side once in awhile.
\
As someone who voted for Obama, I have been listening to Kathleen Parker, who seems to have followed the late William Buckley back into the wilderness. Parker is one conservative who refuses to yield her reason to those who purport to think like her and, from the sound of things, the same crowd is making her pay the price.

Don't outsource computer help
\
I have a question that to some may not seem important but I think it might be to others who own computers.
\
What I would like to know is why, when we have problems with our computers, do we have to talk to some one in India? The last time that I was faced with a computer problem, I had to, you might say, ""go to India"" and talk to someone who cannot even speak our language. This experience made me feel like tossing my computer out the window.
\
Between the price we pay for the computer and what we go through getting and understanding the person who is supposed to be helping us, it is a miracle any help can be gotten from this excruciating experience.

Please get us someone who can speak English before we lose our minds entirely.

U.S. has demonized Muslims
\
Jaymes May (letters, Nov. 20) asks the right question - ""What has become of America?"" - but provides the wrong answer.
\
May perfectly reflects decades of U.S. media propaganda dehumanizing and demonizing Arabs and Muslims, including more than 300 Hollywood films that have unrelentingly cast Arabs as fools or villains, culminating most recently in a hysterical, racist, Islamophobic DVD distributed in Sunday advertising supplements to 28 million households (thankfully not in The Register-Guard) to influence voters toward warmongering candidates.
\
Only the most gullible and historically naive buy the fiction that Islamic anger is about our way of life or different belief systems.
\
More realistically, perhaps it's because we have twice attacked Iraq which never did us harm, causing several hundred thousand Muslim deaths and over 4 million displaced Muslims, bookending 12 years of sanctions imposed upon their helpless population which, it is believed, caused about a million deaths, half of them children.
\
Perhaps it's because we used 9/11 as an excuse to unjustifiably attack two Muslim nations.
\
Perhaps it's because we deposed the democratically elected leader of Iran in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator there for 25 years, then supported Saddam Hussein in attacking Iran while covertly arming both sides in a genocidal war killing over a million Muslims.
\
Or perhaps it's our uncritical support of Israel's 60-year theft of Palestinian lands, destruction of Palestinian properties, brutal oppression and asymmetrical violence against Palestinians using American weaponry and our 41 United Nations vetoes blocking sanctions against Israel for violating international law.

Teens' kindness misunderstood
\
I am a senior at Sheldon High School and am involved in a group called the ""Random Acts of Kindness Club.""
\
Our goal is to make the world a better place and to spread happiness into people's hearts through random acts of kindness. One of our club's trademarks is we give a little business card to the receiver of our kind act, encouraging them to do something nice to someone else, and to pass it on.
\
We have given out free hugs at football games, raked the lawns of random people in neighborhoods and on Black Friday, we handed out cards at Valley River Center with a mint attached that said things like ""Have a great day."" The reactions for the most part have been positive.
\
However, we are trying not to be discouraged by some of the obstacles we are facing. While we were raking lawns, someone called the police because they thought we were breaking in. When we were giving out the cards and candy, security was called on us repeatedly saying that there had been complaints. We were asked to leave.
\
It's sad that people today do not believe that other people would do something nice for another person just out of the goodness of their heart, with no strings attached. When teenagers try to do something positive, we still get complaints.
\
We will continue our random acts of kindness and encourage everyone to be a little kinder to each other as well.

Well, Democrats, wobbly-kneed Republicans and gutless moderates, you have elected Sen. Barack Obama as our next president.

Remember high gas price habits
\
It's amazing how $4 gas has been able to change our driving habits in just a few months (Register-Guard, Nov. 22).
\
Suddenly, we became responsible adults, driving less, conserving energy, reducing greenhouse gases and reducing our reliance on foreign despots.
\
High prices encouraged conservation, which lowered fuel prices again. Will we return to our wasteful ways if gas prices stay low? To save the environment and cut our dependence on fossil fuels, we need to discourage their use by supporting Barack Obama's cap-and-trade system, or better still, a carbon tax.
\
The dark side of high fuel prices is that shipping and processing costs, and therefore the cost of food and everything else, increases, which is not helpful in a recession. We could keep costs down by subsidizing and encouraging the good forms of energy and transportation like trains, which are already hybrids, and by developing compressed air hybrid trucks using clean-burning natural gas.
\
We should subsidize biofuels from non-food materials like algae, which is hundreds of times more efficient than corn.
\
Why stop with carbon caps? Why don't we impose green taxes to discourage the use of toxic chemicals, poisons, and everything else that damages the earth? This would provide jobs, encourage the use of organic and sustainable products, and protect our disappearing wildlife and damaged oceans.
\
The extra revenue could be used to subsidize renewable energy, reduce income taxes on the middle class, or to reduce the national debt.

Let's keep seven digits
\
A couple of weeks ago, I received a notice in my bill from Qwest that the Oregon Public Utility Commission had decided to create an overlay of a new area code in Oregon. A new area code for the state will float over the existing area codes and new numbers will be assigned the new code as the need arises.
\
All fine and good, as we undoubtedly need more numbers for those of us, discouraged by the marginal service offered by Qwest, who are flocking to an alternative means of communication.
\
But the downside is that we all will now have to dial 10 digits for every single number we call, so no more 485-1234 to get The Register-Guard, we now have to include the whole shooting match. For those who use automatic dialing, no big deal, but the rest of us, who use a phone book, scratch-pad or our memory to reference various numbers, this is going to be a hassle.
\
I would rather see the state split into another distinct area code, with Roseburg and south and maybe much of Eastern Oregon put into a unique code, which would allow us (and them) to continue to use the seven-digit phone numbers. Many states have done this. I would certainly rather learn a new area code for my home phone than have to start dialing dozens of extra digits every day.
\
If you are as outraged about this arbitrary action as I am, call the PUC in Salem and fuss at them.

No RV license is needed
\
The June 26 letter from Phyllis Atwood makes absolutely no sense.
\
There is no special license requirement for a private RV driver because none is needed. Statistically, RV operators have a better driving safety record than the general driving populace. Requiring a special license is solving a problem that doesn't exist. An irresponsible driver is dangerous regardless of the vehicle type, and an RV license requirement won't change that.
\
People of all ages drive all kinds of vehicles while using prescription medications, most of which don't cause driving impairment. What do medications have to do with RVs or their safe operation, as compared to other vehicles?
\
How does where a motorhome is built relate to driving safety? The new RV delivery people are professionals and probably safer drivers than the general public. Both Monaco and Country Coach are still in business, albeit under stress (a bit more attention to local facts would help) so you'd be even safer with their hired drivers on the road. Smaller-vehicle operators need to be aware of the size and mass of an RV just as they should be around commercial truck traffic. The only ""death trap"" is a poorly driven vehicle of any kind. The death of Kailee Coontz is a major tragedy, but it could have happened with any type of motor vehicle. It's not the RV's fault.
\
As an automotive journalist working with and driving RVs for 24 years, I speak from reasonable experience in the field.

Serial robbers show up in stats
\
The June 27 front page article about bank robberies in Eugene showed the annual up and down trend for that crime - 13 in 2004, 11 in 2005, 23 in 2006, 12 in 2007, 27 in 2008, and 8 in 2009. The presumptive sentence under state law for a defendant who has already been convicted of unlimited prior crimes and then commits a typical bank robbery is 15 to 16 months incarceration with eligibility for early release after about a year.
\
Well, no kidding. The statistic bounces up and down from year to year. Bank robbers have been serial offenders since before Jesse James. They commit a robbery, get locked up for a year, and then they get out and do it again. Recall the definition of insanity about trying the same thing over and over in expectation of a different result.
\
Which segues naturally to the article on the same front page about the Legislature. Salem is suspending Measure 57, which increases sentences and rehabilitation resources for repeat property offenders, and passed with 61 percent of the popular vote. Doubtless the Democratic leadership cabal reversed some initial naysayers by creating a politicians' dilemma of voting either against Measure 57 or against heightened sentences for drunk drivers and child molesters. That's fine, nobody likes those criminals either. But the next time someone breaks your car window to steal the change from your ashtray, just consider it a tax and be satisfied that at least somebody is seeking change.

Lots of dual purpose taxes
\
I like the sugar tax proposed in the June 28 Register-Guard. This ""lifestyle tax"" would serve the dual purpose of raising health care revenue and discourage unhealthy behavior. This excellent philosophy has proven to be successful with tobacco and alcohol taxes.
\
Why stop there? This system should be expanded to all aspects of society. On the next page a column suggests a dialogue on our counterproductive prison system. Instead of paying $24,000 a year to house and feed five times as many prisoners as other nations, why don't we use monetary fines to punish minor nonviolent offenses?
\
Of course violators would need drug rehabilitation, training and education, so they could get jobs and make wages we could garnish, but restitution and rehabilitation are vastly superior to and cheaper than the existing system of retribution, which results in more crime. We could pay for incarceration of violent offenders with taxes on guns, ammo, pornography, strip joints and drug use. Why don't we tax all of the companies that pollute, create toxic waste, or harm the environment in some way, both to discourage environmental damage and pay to for reversing climate change? A carbon tax would be much simpler and more effective than a cap-and-trade system, and the revenue could be given back to consumers to offset higher fuel costs. Why don't we have a small transaction tax to discourage leveraging, currency speculation, and the type of risky economic behavior that caused the financial meltdown? Reduce deficits by taxing fairly.

All should share Waldo
\
Waldo Lake needs protection. Including protection from the selfish exclusive wants of the elitist crowd. Waldo Lake is a beautiful place; wilderness it is not. Campgrounds and improved access were developed in the 1960s with timber money, the same money this county now so sorely misses. The three campgrounds on Waldo Lake are the largest in the entire Willamette National Forest; they have amenities for ""everyone,"" including handicapped accessible restrooms, trails and boat docks. You can even ride a bike around the entire lake; bikes are not permitted in a wilderness.
\
I have considered the Waldo area as one of my favorite places, having camped, hiked, biked, fished, hunted, paddled my canoe, motor-boated and snowmobiled over the entire basin. I have no problem whatsoever sharing this area with everyone who respects and enjoys this Oregon treasure. Why can't others share these experiences? Should the elderly, handicapped or those unable to row a boat or canoe be excluded from enjoying boating on this lake? Excluding someone from this pleasure is discriminatory. As I've said for years, if the issue is noise, then restrict motors to clean and extremely quiet four-stroke gas and electric motors. Due to the lake's size and tendency of sudden wind, electric motors will not guarantee a safe, timely return. Solution: Respect the area and everyone's rights. Otherwise, tear out the campgrounds and roads and give in to the elite.

Taylor bucks scientific opinion
\
I was surprised to learn it hasn't snowed in Eugene the past 10 years. It's unfortunate that we're using instruments that can't get the data right to make sound decisions. Much like the man who professes to be the state climatologist, George Taylor.
\
""Got snow? No!"" (Register-Guard, Jan. 13) says that, ""Like any good scientist, Taylor has a natural dislike of bad data ... garbage in, garbage out."" That statement is incredulous coming from someone who is the laughing stock of the scientific community for his views on global warming.
\
An Aug. 24, 2005, story in Willamette Week, ""Hot or not,"" exposes the wacky views of Taylor. WW notes ""The facts of global warming have been confirmed by hundreds of climate scientists around the world, ...' yet Taylor doesn't agree.
\
He believes, ""It's not clear that we are seeing unprecedented warming, and it's definitely untrue that any warming trend can be assigned to human activities. Natural variations in climate are much more significant than any human activities.""
\
One doesn't need a scientific degree to prove Taylor wrong. As WW noted, ""It is hard to find a single peer-reviewed journal article that agrees with Taylor's views.""
\
Unfortunately, the Bush administration wants us to believe people like Taylor so they can continue burning fossil fuels, polluting our air and water and melting glaciers and polar ice caps all for a fast buck.
\
Thankfully, Taylor speaks neither for the governor nor the Legislature. He should stick to predicting rain and snow, where he will do less harm.

Nine wishes for the new year

Here are some of my 2007 wishes for our community:
\
1) The options the city of Eugene holds on properties on the west side of downtown are permitted as a ""health care use."" With PeaceHealth disposing of the Eugene Clinic site, it's now possible for McKenzie-Triad to locate its hospital downtown.
\
2) The new Legislature bans field burning in the Willamette Valley.
\
3) Wildish follows the lead of John Hammer, Middlefield Golf Course and the city of Cottage Grove, deeding lands adjacent to Mount Pisgah to Lane County with a price reflecting the resource extraction profits already garnered.
\
4) Lane County returns to the voters with a public safety measure significantly weighted toward crime prevention.
\
5) Residents withhold judgment on the new federal courthouse until they tour the inside and consider the sightlines from the fourth floor.
\
6) With declining federal dollars to augment Lane County's general fund, a carbon tax that fairly derives revenues from polluters, while rewarding sustainable businesses, is enacted.
\
7) The Eugene city manager and staff will work with the City Council to update annexation policy toward River Road, enacting a special area land use plan that respects the heritage of this historic community.
\
8) New Eugene Assistant City Manager Angel Jones and County Commissioner Bill Fleenor signal a shift toward a broader inclusion of the public interest.
\
9) The Eugene Water & Electric Board endorses a new policy to protect salmon and build fish ladders based on their model for funding wind power.

Motor ban too drastic a step
\
Waldo Lake surveys indicate that gas boats are a small percentage of boats used. Speed limits keep Waldo quiet already. Why not follow the Lake Tahoe plan, phasing out noisy, polluting, two-stroke motors? These lakes are quite similar in beauty and clarity. The difference is usage.
\
Waldo is accessible four or five months per year. Yellowstone Park, after much controversy, now limits snowmobiles to quiet, cleaner four-stroke motors. As someone who camps, canoes, hikes, hunts, fishes, snowmobiles and motorboats all over Waldo Lake and the surrounding basin, banning is a drastic step.
\
Recently, the U.S. Forest Service built handicapped campsites and restrooms in all three Waldo campgrounds. Why, then, should Waldo users be restricted to rowing or paddling a boat? Not everyone can.
\
The primary problem is people, more each year. Look next summer around the swimming area at Shadow Bay about late July. You will see algae on shoreline underwater rocks not found in other areas of the lake.
\
Waldo has the three largest campgrounds in the Willamette National Forest. Access roads, campgrounds and boat ramps were built for the enjoyment of all.
\
Build it and they will come. And they have. Consider options other than a ban that would protect the lake and ensure access and quiet to all.
\
I do not believe electric motors would give everyone this access to the whole lake. Four-stroke or even fuel injected two-stoke motors would.
\
I believe the ban is not the right move. Examine the Tahoe plan.

Prison costs are outrageous
\
Nathan Tublitz and James Earl (Commentary, Jan. 14) have reason to scream. They and their 90 University of Oregon faculty friends recognize the outrage of spending $4 million for the athletes' learning center and $2 million for Bill Moos' buyout.
\
However, they didn't mention a worse outrage - 600 million tax dollars for a new prison! The money for the prison is our money, our tax dollars, not money generated by 50,000 rabid sports fans who cheerfully ante up $20 or $30 or $200 for a single game ticket. Sports facilities and staffing the various sports cost money, so let the fans foot the bill. Prisons cost money, too, and guess who foots that bill?
\
The professors note the cost to teach one student for one year in the biology department is $705. They might flip backwards to realize the cost to incarcerate one person for one year approaches $25,000!
\
If these professors, keen and observant on fiscal matters, had any notion how many inmates are in Oregon prisons and how many years each one stays there, they might conclude that the Oregon budget easily could accommodate financing all the undergraduate biology majors!

Idaho mismanaging its wolves
\
If you are not shocked by the most recent news from Idaho concerning wolf management and the words of the Idaho governor, if you register not the slightest gut reaction that something is wrong, you may be living in the wrong century.
\
It is not even the killing of an egregious number of wolves that reeks of insensitivity, but the stunning lack of understanding, appreciation and mere humanity being expressed by the governor and some Idaho citizens.
\
Equating the well-being of communities with economic well-being alone is terribly last-century. This is not to say that people must necessarily surrender their own well-being for another organism, but simply that wolf management as Idaho is currently treating it will never fix the problem at hand.
\
Unless individuals, and thus communities as a whole, start being a bit more creative and replacing two-dimensional beliefs based on either/or choices - as in my ranch or the wolf, hunting and tourism dollars or the wolf, public fear of going into the woods or the wolf - human beings are nothing more than one more competitive species with a strong upper hand.
\
As a resident of Oregon, I know Idaho's treatment of wolves will be watched by neighbors. What happens now will go beyond borders, beyond Idaho's own citizens, economy and environment. Please do not let the attitudes and actions of those who do not yet see the big picture prevail.

UO athletics self-supporting
\
I would like to comment on the piece in the Jan. 14 Commentary section of The Register-Guard by Nathan Tublitz and James Earl.
\
I would like to remind these two gentlemen that they can't blame the Athletic Department for any falling standards at the University of Oregon because the Athletic Department at the UO is entirely self- supporting and takes not a dime from university coffers.
\
It seems to me that any area that is self-supporting has the right to spend as it pleases. Lots of people wish to donate to athletics, and if that is what they want to do, nobody can stop it.
\
Yes, I understand that some professors feel underpaid, but that should be the responsibility of the state of Oregon - which does a lousy job of supporting higher education.
\
Meanwhile, as a supporter of the Ducks, I am rather proud of the fact that the UO is one of very few universities in the country that has a totally self-supporting Athletic Department.

Do what needs to be done

What is it exactly the Lane County commissioners are planning to do?

The city of Eugene has a police oversight committee. I recommend that we vote in a county commissioner oversight committee, pay them all $20,000 a year and take away any perks they currently get. They seem to not be able to make decisions at their current pay rate. Why waste the money that could be better used by opening beds back up at the jail and putting deputies back to work?
\
It is childish and stupid that they are wanting to add assistants at a time like this. Will the assistants help the county? No! We don't need them.

Just like the big banks, the county commissioners are squirreling the money away. They can't bring themselves to spend even 10 percent of this money to beef up our jail capacity to keep felons off the street. And, to make matters even worse, they are expanding their personal staffs.
\
Shame on them.

Could concerts save California?
\
I'm wondering if this would work.
\
Since California is in need of being bailed out by U.S. taxpayers, why couldn't there be a benefit concert for that debt-plagued state?
\
There are many talented stars who live in the Hollywood Hills. Perhaps Bruce Springsteen and other performers could each hold a concert around this nation, with the proceeds going to get California out of debt.
\
Maybe performers who live elsewhere, such Willie Nelson and all the country-western stars who perform in Tennessee or the regulars who have shows in Las Vegas could join in this project.
\
That way, those who want to attend a star-studded show would be happy to purchase tickets and wouldn't consider themselves being taxed.
\
People going to Las Vegas would not be guilt-ridden if they went there to bail out a needy state.
\
Sounds like a ""win-win"" solution to me.

Sports argument doesn't wash
\
I was once a rabid sports fan. Not so much over collegiate competitions did I enthuse as the science and psychology of professional athletes. Therein, it seemed to me, the grand drama of the human condition could be inspected in all its mazy complexity.
\
Football, in its season, was the adrenaline drip to my imagination. The fantasy of the fantastic interception, reversing offense and defense, the roar of the crowd - this was my precious, personal daydream.
\
The years have modified my sports mania considerably. This past decade, I haven't given a whit for the outcome of the Super Bowls. The ridiculous uniforms and preposterous posings of the players all now seem like the little toy soldiers of a childish morality.
\
For the realization has come that sports, like war and crime, occupy a shadow world of morality. The rules of ordinary civilized behavior are set aside, or considerably distorted, for these sorts of activities.
\
Sports advocates will argue that far from impeding civilization, sports augment civil behavior by providing an escape valve for the often-extreme pressure humans experience to gang together and go rumble with rival gangs.
\
Such an outlet, they point out, sublimates our fascination with amorality in a controlled environment where it can provide harmless entertainment for millions who might otherwise turn to crime or war. That is to say: ""The amorality of sports makes it easier for sports fans to behave morally in their everyday activities.""
\
I, for one, don't buy this argument for a second.

Deputies can work at the counter
\
There are more than 400 beds vacant in our penal system of Lane County. Commissioner Pete Sorenson said there were only two or three persons who requested opening the 84 jail beds.
\
I was one of more than 90 people who gave testimony that public safety is No. 1. I don't know which meeting he was at. I appreciate that the budget committee and commissioners added five more deputy sheriffs, but what will they do? They can not put criminals in jail! We have a revolving door as it is. I guess they could work at the counter to process concealed weapon permits.
\
They also voted in additional assistants for the commissioners. Even Rep. Peter DeFazio is outraged!
\
Thanks to Commissioners Bill Dwyer and Faye Stewart for declining the additional help.
\
I am glad they are able to go get their own coffee and steno pad!

Help homeless young people
\
On May 18, youth and adults from Looking Glass New Roads traveled to Salem for a Runaway and Homeless Youth rally on the steps of the Capitol. New Roads is a drop-in center for at-risk youth where youth can connect with adult mentors who will help them find a stable housing situation, a new job, counseling or whatever they need to better their lives. New Roads also has a school for those seeking their high school equivalency degrees and a clinic for immediate and free health care. Our mission is to help these teens get back on their feet and to realize their dreams that at times seem so unattainable.
\
While it is a fact that during these hard times some programs need to be cut, we must remember that there are 24,000 homeless youth in Oregon. Contrary to the stereotype that youth are homeless because they want to be, most are fleeing abusive situations. They leave their homes to survive.
\
Many realize that homelessness needs to be solved now, including Eugene Mayor Kitty Piercy, who spoke at the rally. However, in order to solve youth homelessness, we need the support of the whole community.

Don't cut trees for EmX
\
International Way is a small loop just outside of the Gateway complex. It's a low traffic area well served by Lane Transit District bus and shaded by rows of beautiful trees - for just a little bit longer. Destruction teams have begun chopping down dozens of trees, whole swaths of them in fact, to install EmX bus lanes! EmX lanes exist to allow these buses to avoid being delayed by traffic, but International Way has no traffic!
\
Considering the number of trees to be destroyed and the millions that will be spent on this boondoggle, I believe we have an example of the government efficiently engaging in larceny and vandalism simultaneously.
\
Stop this criminal destruction of this beautiful area, and stop wasting our money!

Prayer example not persuasive
\
Regarding the May 20 letter by Tony McElfresh: This was interesting reading, until the part where his prayer saved his life. So what happened to the more than 50 people who were killed in the eruptions of Mount St. Helens? Did they not pray? Did they pray to the wrong god? Were they of the wrong religion, sect, denomination or other factors? Were they unworthy of being saved?
\
We can claim that God called them to heaven, which is often used when people die in such incidents. Maybe McElfresh should be disappointed that God did not claim him.
\
These stories of being saved read well for the believers, but to nonbelievers they are a farce. One has to wonder if The Register-Guard prints such letters just to see what response they may generate.
\
Ironically, an insurance company would say that such death and destruction was ""an act of God.""

Better mileage, but more miles
\
Environmental groups and the media are treating President Obama's bill to raise fuel efficiency standards from 27.5 mpg to 35.5 mpg as a solution to climate change.
\
A Register-Guard editorial even says this will lower consumption by the equivalent of ""taking 177 million cars off the road"" (we have 200 million cars in this country).
\
What people fail to recognize is that since the dawn of the industrial age, when James Watt patented his first steam engine in 1769, efficiency hasn't lowered energy consumption; it has raised it.
\
In 1865, English economist Stanley Jevons noticed that since Watt's steam engine was five times as efficient as previous models, it led to robust economic growth, thereby increasing overall consumption. This observation led to what is now known as the Jevon's Paradox.
\
We have doubled both vehicle efficiency and oil consumption in this country since the 1970s.
\
Wind, solar, nuclear and a carbon tax to encourage conservation are the way to go, not efficiency alone.

The big 'O' is appropriate
\
I find the big gold ""O"" an appropriate and dignified identification of the university stadium. It is in proper scale for that huge building; it clarifies that this is a distinct part of the University of Oregon; and its design is in good taste. I don't care for the commercial signs within the stadium, but the outside symbol is not an advertising gimmick.

The big ""O"" tells a visitor that this sprawling gray mass of a building has some character and belongs to a university family.

133,"Oregon's two largest utilities oppose a plan to wean the state off coal and onto cleaner sources of energy.\""This legislation's simply not ready for prime time,"" Scott Bolton, of Pacific Power, told the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources on Wednesday.\Varner Seaman, of Portland General Electric, told the committee that the company already is doing a lot to reduce carbon emissions.\""We're concerned about the complexity of the legislation,"" he said.\Oregon's electricity mix currently includes about 35 percent coal, mostly from out-of-state, and less than 9 percent renewable energy.\Senate Bill 477 would require Pacific Power and Portland General Electric to stop using coal as a power source by Jan. 1, 2025.\The bill is the top legislative priority for the environmental community.\Proponents argue that ratepayers should be investing in clean power, such as wind and solar, rather than upgrades to aging coal plants.\""Coal has a target on its back,"" said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board of Oregon.\The bill would require the utilities to replace coal with an energy mix that is at least 90 percent cleaner than coal, including renewable sources such as wind and solar.\And if it could be done at no extra cost, they would need to use local clean energy sources, creating jobs.\Under an amendment introduced this week, the clean energy standard would not apply to plants that close before 2025 or those committed to closing by 2030.\That would give power companies more flexibility, Jenks said.\But Seaman said the amendment just throws more uncertainty into the proposal.\""This is fairly complicated work,"" he said. ""We have concerns about taking up this piece of legislation during the 2015 session.""\There is no further action currently scheduled for the bill.\tloew@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6779"
134,"Associated Oregon Industries backs the Student Bill of Rights, which gives kids options. \Statesman Journal \Richard Butrick, executive director of Associated Oregon Industries, spoke this week about legislative issues of interest to his 19,000-member business lobbying group. He was a guest of the Statesman Journal/Oregon Public Broadcasting Newsmaker Breakfast. Excerpts follow: \Question: One of the things that was going to be different this legislative session was that AOI was coming forward with a transportation funding proposal. Already that has run into some opposition. Could you tell us what is happening with that? \Answer: My own personal view is that the bill on transportation funding will be passed. Our bill's very straightforward. It deals basically with a carrot and a stick. We recognize the fact that Oregon Department of Transportation has some problems. Our bill, as you know, asks for a 3-cent gas tax increase, and a $$@$!10 registration fee increase, followed by meeting certain criteria - accountability criteria, efficiency criteria - before a second 3 cents is authorized. We think that's a sensible way to go. We think it meets the needs of the public. \We also believe that there is a drastic need for improvement in our infrastructure. And this is a consistent theme on the part of business people throughout the state as represented by our members. So I'm optimistic. Having a separate bill for accountability before ours is brought forward in the House of Representatives, we don't object to. Because, in fact, it was part of our bill anyway to have those benchmarks before the second 3 cents. \Q: Could you tell us a little bit about the Student Bill of Rights that AOI is backing.? What is it, and what interest does the business community have in the schools? \A: The fact is that 25 percent of the kids between the ninth and 12th grades are dropping out of school. And with the new Certificate of Initial Mastery, it's estimated that half the kids in school are going to fail. Not every kid's the same. And so we've borrowed an idea from Minnesota. \What it does is take 11th- and 12th-graders and give them an option: They can go to community college or university, if they're accepted, or to a trade school, if they're accepted, and take the money with them. Minus a certain amount for administration at the typical local school level. They can go part time to a community college and part time to the regular high school and the money, again, is divided. We believe this is going to address about 6 percent of the kids. The other 94 percent are going to stay pretty much in a traditional role. But we hope it will give options for kids who eitherdon't fit or are not served in a typical one-size-fits-all environment. \Q: Term limits have reshaped the tone of the Legislature, as 25 of the 60-member House are new this year. There's been this theory that that would increase the clout of lobbies such as AOI. Do you think that's happened? \A: No. I don't really think it's happened. And I think our members generally were not in favor of term limits. We miss and will continue to miss some highly experienced legislators who have been dealing with very, very complex issues for a long time. And so we have to do the best we can with it. We do have some outstanding people that are serving, and I believe that this session in particular might be one that comes along every 10 years or so when a lot gets done. \The relationship and communication between the House and the Senate appears to be closer and improved. I believe that the governor is making an effort, as are the legislative leaders, to see each other more often. Not that they necessarily agree all the time. But at least it's not personal attacks. \Q: Does your association have a position on the kicker law? Should it be repealed or modified, and when refunds are appropriate should they be mailed out? Should the state incur that cost or should there be credits against tax bills? \A: We support the kicker law strongly. Keep in mind that it's only the excess money that the state didn't budget that comes back. So in good times the money comes back to people who paid it. It's their money. The public, I think, enjoys the fact that they get a check. But businesses, of course, get a credit already. For businesses we have not objected to the credit concept, which of course is delayed. \This year there will be apparently no kicker for corporations and maybe none for individuals. I'm hopeful, as I'm sure we all are, that maybe those numbers are wrong. \Q: A number of studies, including one by a gubernatorial task force, showed that the kicker law and what has happened in Oregon's tax system the past 10 or so years have resulted in a shift, with businesses paying less tax and individuals paying a greater share. Some have said that this shows an inequity in the system. What is AOI's position on that? \A: I guess we would disagree with the general premise. Businesses, for example, do not have the deductions that an individual has. I'm able to deduct more as an individual than a business is. Therefore the rate that is constantly profiled on income tax is very marginal. \There are all kinds of ideas on equity, and these are raised often by public employee unions. There was a sword-rattling not long ago: ""Let's take the 6.6 percent of taxes paid by businesses and have that equal the 9 percent that people pay."" Except that they'd forgotten about the deductions. And as I said it's really quite marginal between business and individuals. \I don't think that it serves anyone very well to create a rift between the economic community, the business community, and individuals. We all work together. And to create these divisive, often uninformed number games is not to our mutual advantage in this state. \Q: In the past two or three years we've seen the loss of some corporate titans that were Oregon-based companies - Fred Meyer, PayLess, PGE, US Bank, maybe PacifiCorp. What are the implications of having Oregon be on the short end of some of the corporate buyouts and the looming world economy? \A: Well, I guess one could say the founders of those companies and the managers of those companies have done a really good job because they're very attractive companies to be purchased. I guess, psychologically, I'd rather have us buy something than be bought by somebody else. Now, what could we do about it? One of the things is taking a look at Oregon as sort of the jewel on the Pacific Rim. What is it that we could do collectively to make this the most attractive place to do business? What are the barriers to us being a headquarters state? \Part of it might be a high personal income tax. Part of it might be roads, infrastructure. Part of it might be the infrastructure in our rural areas that is not equipped to handle big operations at the moment. Part of it might be technological improvements that need to be expanded, particularly telecommunications. I would like to start, or be part of, an analysis of that question. \But in the short term, the men and women who have made the decisions to be purchased need to pay attention to what's good for their shareholders. So they made the right decision. Psychologically it's disappointing, but I think it's a wake-up call, too. It's something that I think we need to look at collectively. And we've got tremendous advantages here. We need to create an environment where we're a headquarters state. Salem Oregon West\LEGISLATURE; Pg. 3C"
135,"Oregon, along with other states and the federal government, is facing a new era when it comes to funding the maintenance and modernization of the infrastructure that serves as the circulatory system to our economy: the transportation system.\Oregon's transportation system receives virtually no general fund dollars and is dependent on the taxes and fees paid by the users of the system. As we move toward more fuel-efficient vehicles, alternative-fuel vehicles and expanded access to public transit, we must also begin to identify an alternative funding source for these critical public services. The gas tax is no longer a reliable, stable or predictable source.\I am pleased that Oregon's groundbreaking work in researching alternatives to the gas tax is reaching new, broader audiences. This idea to replace the gas tax with another method has been under public discussion in Oregon for nearly a decade, and we must continue this work so we are prepared in another decade to transition to a new funding source for the infrastructure that keeps people, commerce and goods moving efficiently and safely throughout our state.\Our work on the vehicles mileage travel fee concept is allowing us to look further into innovative ways to replace the tax on fossil fuels so that we can still provide safe roads and a reliable transportation system while also reducing our dependence on foreign oil. There is widespread recognition across the nation that we must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, and Oregon is leading the path toward a new generation of vehicles on our roads that use little or no gasoline, and thus don't contribute to the maintenance and preservation of the system.\This is a necessary trend for our environment and our future - it's one of my highest priorities. But regardless of how our vehicles are fueled, our cars and trucks will still need roads and bridges that are maintained in safe condition with lighting, signage, striping and guardrails. If we continue to base our funding system on gas taxes, we will not be able to address the fundamental needs of our transportation system that keep the people on our roads safe.\My Jobs and Transportation Act of 2009 will help us take the next step in finding the right solution for Oregon as we look to the future. It begins a continued investment in our transportation system, moving away from the ad-hoc approach of the past, and continues the work of the legislatively created Road User Fee Task Force - which is working on the vehicles miles traveled fee to potentially replace the gas tax. In 2006, the Oregon Department of Transportation conducted a pilot project that proved the concept. The project published its report in 2007.\Recently, this project has received significant attention across the state and nationally, along with some confusion about how this would work and when it would go into effect. Let me assure Oregonians, we will only move in this direction when the technology is ready, we can ensure privacy is protected and when we can make sure it is implemented fairly so as not to discriminate against those who live in more rural parts of the state that may require them to drive more to meet their basic daily needs than someone in more urban areas.\We are still many years away from a transition from the gas tax, but we must continue the research necessary to make sure that when we hit the wall, and the gas tax no longer generates the revenue we need for our roads and bridges, that we are ready.\I firmly believe as elected leaders today, we have a responsibility to make sure Oregon is ready for the future, to maintain a safe and efficient transportation system when vehicles are powered by something other than gasoline, so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy the same or better transportation system and quality environment we enjoy today.\As we move forward, I encourage you to learn the facts yourselves. Read what Oregon has learned about this concept, and come to your own conclusions. More important, bring your thoughtful ideas forward for consideration and discussion.\Information about the concept is available at www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/OIPP.\Ted Kulongoski is the governor of Oregon.

136,"
Note: The legislation would also replace Oregon's ""clean fuels"" program
\
SALEM - Gov. Kate Brown and Senate Democrats are ramping up pressure on House Democrats to acquiesce to a multilayered transportation construction and carbon emissions reduction plan that would completely replace the state's controversial ""clean fuels"" program.
\
After weeks of behind-closed-doors negotiations, details of which began to emerge publicly in recent days, the Senate president's office formally released the proposal agreed to by Senate Democrats and Republicans Tuesday evening.
\
The package includes a string of tax and fee increases: a 4-cents-per-gallon gas tax increase, a $10 vehicle registration fee increase, a $10 driver license fee, and a new payroll tax on workers in some mass transit districts, including Lane Transit District. The LTD tax would total about $63 a year for someone making $34,000 a year in Lane County. It would be paid by the employee, in contrast to LTD's current payroll tax, which is paid by the employer.
\
Backers say their plan would take more carbon out of the environment than the ""clean fuels"" initiative would over the next decade, while pulling in almost $300 million through the new taxes and fees annually to pay for work on Oregon's roads, bridges and mass transportation, according to the latest iteration dated Monday show.
\
Rolling back the ""clean fuels"" law - a 10-year mandate to reduce car and truck carbon emissions by 10 percent - is the only way Democrats can get support from minority Republicans for the tax and fee increases needed to pay for the transportation work, supporters say.
\
Lawmakers from both parties have said they want to pass a statewide transportation spending package this session.
\
But environmental groups are skeptical about whether the new proposal would achieve its promised carbon reduction. They say the proposed replacement biofuels-blending program - which by supporters' estimates accounts for around a third of their hoped-for emission reductions - has a huge loophole for oil distributors: they would only have to reduce the amount of carbon in their fuels if cleaner replacement fuels are ""commercially available, technologically feasible, and cost effective."" If they aren't, distributors would not be required to do anything.
\
Environmental groups also say other emission-reduction elements of the package are overstated or ""double counted."" For example, one key package element involves redirecting about 20 percent of the public-purpose surcharge that certain utilities now charge ratepayers. Instead of being spent on renewable energy projects and school energy-efficiency projects, as they are now, the funds would be used to pay for new electric vehicle chargers. Another change would require natural-gas utilities to provide up to $10 million a year, likely through rate increases, to help build chargers for vehicles powered by compressed natural gas.
\
""The burden of responsibility both in terms of paying for the program and reducing pollution is moved from the oil industry to the taxpayer and the alternative fuels industry,"" the Oregon Environmental Council wrote in an analysis of the proposal this week.
\
The proposed package does differ sharply from the ""clean fuels"" law.
\
Under ""clean fuels,"" oil distributors can reach their carbon reduction goals by blending cleaner biofuels into their product, or by making payments to - buying ""credits"" from - any public or private body that produces or uses biofuels or alternative energy for their transportation needs. The payments are supposed to be an incentive for entrepreneurs and others pursuing new low-carbon energy forms. Oil distributors are expected to pass the expense on to the consumer through higher gas prices: the state has predicted a 4-cent to 19-cent per gallon gas price increase once the full carbon reduction is in place in 2025.
\
Late Tuesday, lawmakers in the Senate created a new committee to move the proposal, dubbed the ""Oregon Sustainable Transportation Act,"" as an amendment to House Bill 2281. The committee will be led by Sen. Chris Edwards, a Eugene Democrat. The first public hearing is expected to be today, and the package could potentially be voted by the full chamber as early as Friday.
\
Without changes that draw the support of the environmental lobby, the package may pass the Senate but flounder in the House, observers said. Last week, 19 Democrats signed a letter saying they wouldn't back any deal that involved a full repeal of the ""clean fuels"" law.

\
Details of the new transportation/clean fuels proposal:
\
The list of proposed state-funded transportation projects includes several big-ticket items in Lane County: $20 million for safety work on Territorial Highway; $15 million for safety work on Highway 126 between Eugene and Florence; $15 million for work on Main Street in Springfield. Local governments across the state would split another $103 million in new revenue.
\
Workers in Lane County who are in Lane Transit District's territory would pay a new payroll tax to provide more money to LTD, primarily to increase service. The ""transit tax,"" which would apply to five transit districts across the state, would equal $63 a year for an employee making $34,000 a year. The tax would come out of employees' pay.
\
Vehicle tax and fee increases: 2-cent gas tax increase in 2016 and further 2-cent increase in 2017; a new temporary $10 drivers' license fee; a $10 increase in the state's vehicle registration fee and a $145 increase in the registration fee for electric vehicles; a $48 increase in vehicle title fee.
\
Projected carbon emissions steps: A 5 percent reduction in the carbon content of fuels - achieved through biofuels blending only - over next decade. Oil distributors must blend only if supply of biofuels is available in commercial quantities and if it's ""cost effective"" for them.
\
Diverts 17 percent of certain utilities' public purpose charges, around $15 million a year, to installing electric vehicle chargers.
\
Requires natural gas utilities to provide $10 million a year towards building chargers for natural gas-powered vehicles.
\
Converts 3,000 of state's school buses, approximately half, from diesel to natural gas.
\
Uses dollars raised by transportation tax and fee increases for projects designed to improve highway traffic flow.
\
The new employee ""transit tax"" reduces carbon emissions by providing more funds to mass transit services.
"
137,"Senate Republicans are suspending their participation in the negotiation of a transportation package that would include new or improved roads and bridges, as well as a likely gas tax increase.\The senators are tying the transportation package to a bill on carbon content in fuels. Because both efforts are likely to cause an increase in gas prices, Republicans said, only one should be pushed forward.\Senate Bill 324 would create a standard for how much carbon can be contained in gas and diesel sold in Oregon over the next decade.\However, Republicans from both chambers have been actively participating in the creation of the transportation package, even as the carbon fuels bill has passed in the Senate and is moving forward in the House.\The package would be the first opportunity in six years for the Legislature to provide dedicated funding for new roads, bridges and infrastructure improvements across Oregon. The last time lawmakers did something similar was in 2009, and that package provided money for the Newberg-Dundee Bypass, the Sunset Corridor and the Woodburn interchange on Interstate 5, among many other projects.\Both parties have said they want to do something similar this year, although the details haven't been worked out yet.\Senate President Peter Courtney said Wednesday that he thought the Republicans were negotiating in good faith on the package. He told reporters that ""everyone is working hard"" in spite of some of the public statements being made.\Sen. Doug Whitsett, R-Klamath Falls, and Sen. Jeff Kruse, R-Roseburg, have both been working on that project on behalf of their caucus.\Almost as soon as the bill passed out of the House Committee on Energy and Environment on Thursday evening on a 5-4 party-line vote, the Republican senators announced they would no longer negotiate on the transportation package.\In a news release, Whitsett and Kruse blamed Democrats for the situation.\""(We) made it clear early this session that we would not allow the Democrat super majority to ram through policies that raise gas prices and hurt working Oregon families,"" Whitsett said. ""Oregon needs a comprehensive, bipartisan transportation package, but once again Democrats showed today that they are more concerned about partisan pandering than passing bills that help both rural and urban Oregonians.""\""We need a transportation package,"" Kruse said. ""By fast-tracking SB 324 with the knowledge that it would compromise the ability of the Legislature to pass a bipartisan transportation package, Democrats proved their loyalties lie with special out-of-state interests, and any pledge to help low-income and rural Oregonians is just lip service.""\In a newsletter to constituents Friday, Kruse blamed the media, as well.\""Because there had been comments made in the media tying the Republicans in the work group to both bills, we were given no choice but to leave, which we did at 6 o'clock last night,"" he wrote, apparently referencing a Wednesday story in the Statesman Journal.\Republican leaders have long threatened that they won't vote for the transportation package if the carbon bill passes.\In a KATU interview with Courtney on Feb. 2, Kruse said the bill shouldn't be connected to the carbon standard at all.\""The other thing I would say is the attempt to tie the low carbon fuel standard to transportation is a disservice to both issues,"" he said. ""They should stand on merit. I think if we focus on the transportation package as an individual unit not tied to anything else, we'll have a better chance of getting something that's fair that we could possibly get the support for.""\hhoffman@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6719 or follow at twitter.com/HannahKHoffman"
138,"
In the June 15 Register-Guard Mailbag, a reader questioned the validity of Oregon's tests of a mileage-based tax. I want to address this reader's concerns, as well as those of other Register-Guard readers, knowing Oregonians want to rely on facts when making decisions.
\
First, the writer said heavy sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks do more damage to roads than regular passenger vehicles. In fact, studies have shown that all passenger-type vehicles, including SUVs and pickups, do about the same damage to roads.
\
Roads are built for 50-ton trucks, the owners of which already pay by weight. Therefore, the differences between a 3,000-pound car and an 8,000-pound SUV are slight at best.
\
However, if the Legislature wanted to create different rates for different vehicles, that would be an option. The ultimate structure of the rate for the mileage is not yet determined; it remains to be decided by lawmakers.
\
Second, the writer questions how fees would be collected on out- of-state vehicles. The answer is simple: Those motorists would continue to pay the gas tax at the pump instead of the new road- user fee. The rate-per-mile is calculated to be the same on average as the gas tax.
\
Finally, the writer says our current gas tax is working fine. In fact, financial modeling shows a significant future decline in revenues based on the gas tax. In the near future, it will no longer provide adequate funding for roads - at a time when our population is booming and road usage is at an all-time high.
\
The original purpose of the gas tax (Oregon was the first state in 1919 to establish one) was to raise money for roads. Everyone relies on goods moving safely and quickly. To repair, maintain and build new roads, we must have adequate revenues, and most people agree that those who use the roads should pay for them.
\
A few more important facts: Oregon will be conducting a pilot program next spring in order to see how a mileage charge might work in reality. We are not assuming things will or will not work - we are merely testing this as an option. Why? It's simple.
\
More cars than ever are using our highways. And because of the increased fuel efficiencies of vehicles, most people are paying less to do so than they did 20 years ago.
\
Oregon is not against increased fuel efficiency - not by a long shot. One only need look at how our population votes on issues to see that environmental concerns are at the top of this state's priorities. Indeed, the Oregon Department of Transportation has a goal of designing any mileage-charge system with the aim of encouraging fuel efficiency.
\
Our pilot program will be the result of a 40-month effort to review alternatives to the state's current gas tax revenue system. The state is seeking an acceptable and viable revenue source, funded through 'user-pay' methods, to maintain, preserve and improve Oregon's state, county and city highway and road systems.
\
Here are some other key factors:
\
The road user fee is a road tax, not an environmental tax, but it could be designed for both. Since all passenger vehicles have about the same impact on roads, all these vehicles should pay the same for road usage.
\
However, because Oregon values its environment, the road user fee program could encourage use of environmentally friendly vehicles by charging a higher per-mile fee for vehicles that get less than a specified number of miles per gallon. This added charge could be considered an 'environmental tax' and used for other purposes.
\
The road user fee program does not track, store or collect private information. The switching device that counts miles in a vehicle is not capable of recording where a vehicle is located except when it passes in and out of a designated 'rush hour zone.' Even then, it merely counts miles traveled in each zone, not the location in the zone or even the date or time. It is incapable of 'tracking' motorists.
\
The road user fee would replace the gas tax (not be an addition to it), and funds would be used for the same highway projects as the current gas tax. Oregon's road user fees would not go into the state's general fund; in fact, they cannot, because of constraints in the Oregon Constitution.
\
The road user fee is a pilot program. We're testing a program that has many options and can change. If someone has a better idea, we're open to hearing it.
\
Both a safe environment and an efficient transportation system are crucial to our daily lives. These two goals must be integrated so that our society holds together. To exclude the needs of one goal in favor of the other is narrow thinking and leads to disaster. Policy makers should design public policies with both goals in mind.
\
We look forward to the results of Oregon's Road User Fee Pilot Project so we can determine if this - or some other method - is the best way to achieve our mutual goals. In the meantime, we encourage anyone to contact our office for accurate information on our pilot project, at www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/OIPP.

To achieve goals in energy conservation, climate change and the economy, the state is pushing for a reduction in the 1.5 billion gallons of gasoline that Oregonians burn each year.
\
At the same time, each of those gallons yields 30 cents in state gasoline taxes, and that revenue is the primary means of paying for Oregon's road network. The state is looking for ways to bring into alignment these conflicting interests, but in many respects, the old-fashioned gas tax still looks like the best way to finance the transportation system.
\
Alternatives to the gas tax have gained greater attention with the introduction of high-mileage vehicles, including gas-electric hybrids. All-electric vehicles have yet to find a large market, but improvements in battery technology soon could make them more common - and a car that burns no gas pays no gas tax.
\
The Legislature and the Oregon Department of Transportation are looking for ways to keep a growing fleet of super-efficient or all-electric vehicles from becoming free riders on the state's road system. The leading idea is to tax the miles a vehicle travels rather than the fuel it uses.
\
Revenue from a vehicle-miles-traveled tax, or VMT, would not erode with improvements in the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks. The amount paid per mile could vary with the weight of the vehicle, so that low emissions and conservation are rewarded. The concept is similar to the weight-mile tax already in place for commercial trucks: Each vehicle is taxed at a level intended to be commensurate to the distance traveled and damage done to the state's roads.
\
Gov. John Kitzhaber's new 10-year energy plan calls for a VMT tax demonstration project, with a per-mile fee based on vehicle weight and emissions. The project would build upon experience gained in a 2006 Portland area pilot project, in which 285 volunteers agreed to pay per-mile taxes for a year. The experiment was deemed a success, with the state Road User Fee Task Force concluding that a VMT fee could be a viable substitute for per-gallon fuel taxes.
\
There are obstacles. The first arises from the need to keep track of each vehicle's mileage. A variety of technologies could be adapted for that purpose, including some that already are built into many new vehicles. But privacy concerns may prove difficult to overcome - tracking devices could record not only how far a vehicle traveled, but also where and when.
\
Also, older vehicles would need to be retrofitted with some sort of mileage counter. Collecting a VMT tax from out-of-state vehicles, or finding a way to suspend the tax for out-of-state trips, also could prove complicated.
\
Moreover, most VMT tax proposals seek to account for the fact that lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles cause less damage to the roads and to the environment, so it taxes them at a lower rate. The gas tax does this already. If the state's aim is to ensure that revenues to support the transportation system do not decline, it could tie the gas tax to the rate of inflation, or index it to the cost of road repairs. The result would be the same as a VMT tax, without the need for a new mileage tracking system.
\
All-electric cars are free riders in a gas-tax-funded system. But even with tax-free fuel, they are a minor part of the fleet; Oregon should think twice about doing anything that discourages people from reducing their dependence on petroleum, all of which comes from out of state.
\
Oregon and the nation will need to adapt their transportation funding systems as vehicles become more efficient and as alternatives to gas-powered engines gain favor. But the gas tax is familiar, easy to collect and fair. Improving on it won't be easy.

140,"BY STEVE LAW \Statesman Journal \Democracy, Senate President Brady Adams is fond of saying, was not meant to be a pretty process. \In the 1999 session of the Oregon Legislature, it often wasn't. But to the relief of lawmakers, lobbyists and other Capitol insiders, the session finally ended at 3:15 p.m. Saturday after 6 1/2 grueling months. \Ninety lawmakers from all corners of Oregon descended on Salem in January for 195 working days, making it the third-longest session in state history. They passed more than 1,200 laws, shattering the previous mark. \Some say they broke new ground as well for partisan bickering. \This year's session was the first true test of Oregon's 1992 term-limits initiative, which led to a near-record crop of rookie House members replacing ""termed-out"" veterans. \The high turnover limited the time members had to form personal relationships across the aisle, said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown, D-Portland. ""Politics is about relationships. When you don't have those relationships, all you have is political differences,"" she said. \""I think it's been harder to come to compromise this time,"" Adams observed. \The session followed record-breaking spending on the fall campaign trail, and a bitter primary in which conservative Republicans tried to oust their own moderate incumbents. \Conservative GOP leadership, combined with term limits, set the tone for a session in which majority Republicans wielded tight control over both chambers. GOP lawmakers rarely crossed over in significant numbers to vote with Democrats. \In one important case when they did, the effort was snuffed out quickly by Republican leaders. Moderates tried to raise the hard-fought $$@$!4.81 billion schools budget by dipping into the tobacco settlement windfall, but they were put in their place within 24 hours. \That atmosphere left the minority party weak and deprived of influence. \""All we did was stay around too long, act in a very partisan way and really didn't do anything that significant,"" sniped Sen. Peter Courtney, the veteran Salem Democrat. \Even Adams, the Grants Pass Republican who controlled the Senate's levers, counted GOP victories more by what he prevented than what he accomplished. \Republicans slowed the growth of state government, Adams said, and they fended off Democratic pressure to raise taxes, except for a nickel-a-gallon gas tax hike. GOP lawmakers also assured that surplus income tax ""kicker"" checks will be sent to voters, presuming there is a surplus. \Bill may be visionary \Oregon's citizen Legislature is known for producing visionary policies. If anything qualifies this session, it might be the electricity deregulation bill. \Prodded by Senate Majority Leader Gene Derfler, R-Salem, and a dedicated corps of lobbyists, the Legislature passed a bill that should reshape Oregon's electricity industry. It will allow businesses, and ultimately residents, to shop around for cheaper or ""greener"" power. And it provides ongoing money to support earth-friendly electricity sources, energy conservation and assistance to low-income folks in danger of shivering in their homes. \A hotly debated telephone deregulation bill could bring dramatic changes to local telephone service, at least in US West's territory. Backers say it will spur better customer service by US West and new competitors, which could bring lower prices. It also will help schools and rural communities left out of the cyberspace era by paying for new or improved Internet access. \Republicans tout the state's first charter school law as a major achievement. That bill should encourage a new crop of alternative public schools freed from bureaucratic control. \Republicans also cherished a whopping increase in the state higher education budget, pegged to a more competitive budgeting system for Oregon University System. \Democrats point to new bills promoting inspections of loosely regulated home day-care centers. And they're proud of Gov. John Kitzhaber's $$@$!20 million initiative to prevent crime by at-risk juveniles as well as an expansion of alcohol and drug treatment programs. Counties lobbied hard for that package. \For three sessions in a row, they also had joined cities and state transportation officials in pleading for an increase in the gas tax to keep pace with road maintenance and construction needs. The fourth session proved a charm, but it wasn't clear until the second-to-last day. \A shaky coalition managed to pass a gas tax hike along with a move away from Oregon's weight-mile tax on truckers. The deal means $$@$!600 million in road projects. The only catch: the increase may be overturned at the polls if the American Automobile Association gets its way. \Fireworks mostly are duds \Some of the biggest fireworks from the session were about social issues. Conservative Republicans sought to bar Oregon Health Plan payments for abortions and assisted suicide. They passed a parent notification requirement before teen-agers can get an abortion. And they sought to bar legal marriage by gays. \None of those will make it into law. \Ellen Lowe, a veteran human services lobbyist, decried the Republicans for neglecting the needs of low-income people. Affordable housing advocates went into the session thinking the state needs $$@$!25 million a year to address a looming crisis. They came away empty-handed. \Republicans spent much of the session trying to whittle down costs of the Oregon Health Plan, saying the low-income health service is growing out of control. But in the end nearly every one of the GOP cuts was restored at Kitzhaber's insistence. \One disappointment cited by several lawmakers was the failure to pass a background-check requirement for people buying weapons at gun shows. In the end, a consensus bill failed by one vote when Sen. John Lim, R-Gresham, bailed from a carefully built coalition. \As usual, Oregon's rural-urban split about land use and environment provoked an endless amount of bills and debate. But there was little in the way of new policy. One exception: a compromise reached between environmentalists and farmers to track pesticide use and get a better handle on how the pest-killers are being used in Oregon. \With Mahonia Hall occupied by a liberal Democrat and both chambers controlled by conservative Republicans, it was hard to get controversial legislation signed into law. Kitzhaber is on target to veto a record number of bills. To avoid vetoes, Republicans used an end-run around the governor's desk by referring a record number of measures directly to the ballot. \GOP lawmakers proposed dozens of tax breaks and tax cuts for various interest groups, which, taken together, would have lopped hundreds of millions of dollars from state revenues. But in the end, it appeared many of the tax cuts were for show. The only ones to stick: Adams' $$@$!15 million expansion of the child care credit for lower-middle income families, and an increased federal income tax deduction slated for the ballot. \Education issues dominate \As in 1997, the public schools budget dominated the session, along with other educational policy changes. \House Speaker Lynn Snodgrass, R-Boring, valiantly tried to wrap up the school budget by schools' spring break, so the other half of the budget could be worked out early. But from the beginning of the session a dedicated corps of parents and school activists badgered lawmakers to increase the school budget. \""The K-12 education advocates have become better organized every time,"" said Rep. Kevin Mannix, R-Salem. ""So the debate is no longer whether we need it but how much."" \The debate sharply divided the two parties. Then Kitzhaber sided with the school activists, threatening to veto budgets unless he got a $$@$!4.95 billion funding package. \Republicans agreed to $$@$!4.81 billion, noting it was a 10 percent increase above the prior two-year spending level. But Democrats complained that will lead to widespread school cutbacks. \""With the exception of the K-12 budget, we got virtually everything we came in to get,"" Kitzhaber said when the session ended. \Lawmakers busied themselves with dozens of other changes in school policies aside from charter schools. By session's end, some school superintendents fretted that Oregon's notion of local control of schools is dead, given the Legislature's propensity to function as a ""super school board"" for Oregon's 198 school districts. \The Senate got a head start on budget preparations by working up a proposal prior to the session. Yet deliberations dragged the session to a near-record length. Term limits meant many House Republicans were brand new to budgeting and the people and services behind the budgets. \Snodgrass was wary of repeating the 1997 scenario, when a slim House GOP majority conceded significant budget authority to minority Democrats. So House Republicans tried to assure they could form a pure majority of 31 within their caucus of 34 Republicans. That took tedious internal discussions. \Meanwhile, Democrats were mostly shut out of the budget-writing process, until Republicans realized they needed to negotiate to get the governor's signature. \Adams helped move the parties together by offering to split the remaining differences between Democrats and Republicans. Though it initially failed, the move proved to be the one allowing both sides to come away thinking they got what they needed. \The legislative process in 1999 was ""a little messy,"" Kitzhaber said. ""The product that this Legislature turned out is a good one."" \Legislative report card \Here is what happened with a dozen of the major bills considered by the 1999 Oregon Legislature. The governor now has 30 days to sign or veto bills after they reach his desk. Ballot referrals, like the two listed below, bypass the governor and go to the voters instead. \PASSED BY $=W003PASSED BY $=W005SIGNED BY \BILL $=W018HOUSE $=W009SENATE $=W007GOVERNOR \Women's prison siting ? $=W007? \on Day Road near Wilsonville \Background checks $=W006? \at gun shows \Charter schools $=W012? $=W006? $=W013? \New incentives and $=W011? $=W006? \penalties for US West \Extend workers'$=W016? $=W009? $=W007? \comp. reforms \Parental notification for teen-age abortion ? $=W003? \Electricity deregulation $=W014? $=W007? $=W006? \K-12 school funding $=W007? $=W007? \Income tax cut referral $=W008? $=W006? \Gas tax increase $=W023? $=W007? \Tobacco settlement referral $=W006? $=W005? \Juvenile crime prevention $=W009? $=W005?

141,"A bill that would require companies to reduce by 10 percent the carbon in fuels sold in Oregon over the next decade passed in the House of Representatives on Wednesday by a 31-29 margin after five and a half hours of debate.\Its passage appears to have sealed the fate of a proposed transportation package the Oregon Legislature has been working to create, as Republicans have said they refuse to allow both to pass during the 2015 session.\House Republicans said Wednesday evening they would no longer participate in talks to create a bill that would raise the state gas tax and provide dedicated funding for roads, bridges and other infrastructure.\The bill that spurred such a heated debate was Senate Bill 324, which continues a program begun in 2009, as well as altering some aspects of how it works. It creates a market for carbon credits in Oregon's transportation fuel industry, regulated by the state Department of Environmental Quality.\The state has estimated it could raise the cost of gas between 4 cents and 19 cents per gallon over the next 10 years, but the bill contains a provision that allows the DEQ to shut down the carbon market if prices increase too much.\It has already passed in the Oregon Senate and will now head to Gov. Kate Brown for her signature. She supports it, spokeswoman Melissa Navas said, but she will review it when it comes to her desk.\The debate over SB 324 has been one of the most heated during the month the legislature has met so far.\Democrats support the bill because they say it moves Oregon in the right direction in addressing climate change, and they claim it will create jobs and a new clean-fuels industry for the state.\Rep. Jessica Vega Pederson, D-Portland, said there is no way for lawmakers to control gas prices, which fluctuate wildly based on what the oil industry does. They can, however, create policies that address pollution, she said.\SB 324 is ""a critical step in the right direction"" and will ""nurture an important and emerging industry,"" Pederson said. Even if prices do increase as a result, at least profits will be kept in the Oregon economy, she said.\Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, agreed.\This bill can't solve climate change, he said, but at least it moves Oregon in the right direction.\Not all Democrats felt the same.\Four Democrats, including Rep. Caddy McKeown, D-Coos Bay, opposed the bill. McKeown said she supports the goal behind SB 324, but she did not think it was the most efficient way to do it and did not think the benefits outweighed the cost of gas price increases for rural Oregonians.\That echoed much of what Republicans said.\Rep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn, said she believed it would result in higher food prices and less access to organic or nongenetically modified products. Families already struggle to make ends meet, she said, and this bill could make it worse.\Many Republicans made similar points, arguing that it would be particularly harmful to rural Oregon, which tends to be poorer and rely more heavily on cars for transportation.\Others speculated about the planning behind the bill.\Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Ontario, said the clean fuels market it would create would not function the way supporters of the program believe. Other Republicans said Oregon's government is inept at running large projects, such as Cover Oregon or the business energy tax credit program.\The GOP tried multiple times to derail the bill, which prolonged the debate well into the afternoon and forced the cancellation of several House committee hearings.\Republicans introduced a minority report, which is an alternative version of the bill that can be substituted with a majority vote in favor. The House debated that report for an hour, but ultimately the vote failed.\Two GOP motions also failed: One to send SB 324 back to the House Committee on Energy and Environment, and one to postpone the vote until the completion of the federal investigation into former Gov. John Kitzhaber and his fiancee, Cylvia Hayes.\It turned into an emotional debate as the hours wore on. Republican Leader Mike McLane ended up shouting, ""Not one dime for a road! Not one dime for a bridge!"" as he concluded one round of testimony.\Ultimately, the bill passed, apparently killing a potential transportation package, at least according to the GOP.\A bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers has been meeting regularly to discuss putting together a bill that would raise the state gas tax and provide dedicated funding for roads, bridges and other infrastructure.\Republicans strongly support that package, but they have said they won't vote for it if SB 324 passes because both policies would likely increase the price of gas, and that is too much for constituents' checkbooks to absorb.\Senate Republicans withdrew from that informal work group after SB 324 moved out of its committee. House Republicans said Wednesday that they had decided to do the same.\Bentz and Rep. John Davis, R-Wilsonville, were working on the group and decided to end their participation after SB 324 passed. However, McLane said that if Brown vetoes the clean fuels bill, Republicans will be willing to resume negotiations.\This leaves only Democrats working on the transportation package. Because it contains a tax increase, it will need a three-fifths vote in both the House and the Senate, 36 and 18 votes, respectively.\There are 18 Democrats in the Senate, but only 35 Democrats in the House. At least one Republican in the House would have to support a transportation package if it is to pass, making it the one bill proposed so far in 2015 that Democrats cannot pass on their own.\hhoffman@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6719 or follow at twitter.com/HannahKHoffman"
142,"Oh gosh, we’ve got another Trump.\This has been very difficult, people. Every day concerned citizens put together their critique of the president’s policies, and before nighttime he’s a completely different dude.\You remember the Somewhat Normal Republican Trump, who answers to both SNORE and SNORT, depending on his energy level at the moment. He mainly likes to repeal federal regulations - free mentally ill people to buy guns; don’t let a little clean water stand between coal owners and their yen to dump trash. Last week SNORT issued a tax reform plan that was classic GOP in its extreme vagueness on how to pay for its multitude of cuts. (“Eliminate tax breaks for special interests.”)\Then suddenly, out of nowhere, came Weirdly Liberal Trump (WELT). He mused about breaking up the big banks; special aide Ivanka plugged helping Syrian refugees. Liberal Trump even expressed interest in a gas tax hike to pay for infrastructure repairs.\“It’s something that I would certainly consider,” he told Bloomberg News. The idea of a Republican administration, bound at the hip to the energy industry, championing a gas tax hike is a little stunning. It would, of course, pay for a ton of construction jobs, repair crumbling roads and bridges and be great for the environment. But I guarantee you Mike Pence would never bring it up.\Perhaps we should rethink all that impeachment talk.\When Congress resumed its uproar over health care, WELT wanted to be the progressive hero. “Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be,’” Trump told CBS’ John Dickerson.\That was shortly before Trump went off the handle when Dickerson asked about his claims of being wiretapped by Barack Obama. “I don’t stand by anything,” Trump said, unnecessarily, before he tossed Dickerson out of the Oval Office for pressing him on the matter.\Viewers got to witness a transformation from the new liberal presidential version to the very familiar Nearly Unhinged Trump (NUT). Actually, this one often seems more along the line of Totally Unhinged, but then we’d have to call him TUT.\It’s generally pretty easy to tell which president is talking. NUT was the one who thought Andrew Jackson could have stopped the Civil War. So, for sure, was the Trump who expressed astonishment that being president was harder work than his previous jobs. (“I thought it would be easier.”)\NUT tends to reside in the world of Twitter. And sometimes he fights with his other versions. Weirdly Liberal Trump was very happy when Congress came up with a spending deal that guarantees the government will continue operating through the summer. (“This is what winning looks like!”)\Nearly Unhinged hated hated hated it. “Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!” twittered NUT. He had promised us he’d make history, but even his critics didn’t expect he’d do it by becoming the first American president to express a yearning for the government to come to a screeching halt.\The quick shift between Trumps is always a challenge to the minions in charge of interpreting him to the world. Budget director Mick Mulvaney, who is getting to be one of our very favorite explainers, said that the president was calling for a shutdown because he became “frustrated” when Democrats expressed pleasure at the resolution of the spending standoff. (“They went out to try and spike the football and make him look bad.”) In reality, Mulvaney insisted, the Democrats were hoping for a collapse in negotiations because they wanted “to make this president look like he did not know what he was doing.”\And the whole world mused: not a hard lift.\Neither the liberal nor the normal-Republican Trump is very good at interesting new ideas that might actually, in the real world, happen. Unhinged Trump is obviously the attention-getter, and a lot of the excitement comes from the fact that his proposals are often exactly the opposite of whatever he was championing last week.\He’s also unfettered by the restrictions in imagination that would come from previous knowledge of how government operates. It appears, for instance, that NUT was surprised by the discovery that it took 60 votes to pass most legislation in the Senate. This came out in a tweet expressing shock, shock, shock that 41 senators could force the majority into compromise. “Either elect more Republican senators in 2018 or change the rule now to 51 percent,” he recommended.\Senate Republicans dismissed the idea instantly. “We are not going to do that,” said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Most of them had spent much of the Obama administration happily thwarting a Democratic president’s agenda with that very rule. Perhaps some of them were already anticipating that by 2021, it would come in handy again.\Gail Collins is a columnist for The New York Times."

SALEM - An environmental group is threatening to refer the Legislature's gas tax to the ballot unless lawmakers do more to combat greenhouse gas emissions in the Eugene-Springfield area specifically, and elsewhere in Oregon.
\
1000 Friends of Oregon is pushing to revive at least one of the original bill's provisions on transportation and planning in the Legislature's final days. If that doesn't happen, group spokesman Eric Stachon said, 1000 Friends could mount a signature drive to force the package onto the ballot.
\
""The polling results show that should we take the gas tax to the voters, suffice it to say, it would be an easy task to defeat the gas tax,"" said Stachon, who added that 1000 Friends is in discussion with firms about a potential signature-gathering contract and is starting to plan for raising money to mount a campaign. Stachon noted that among 1000 Friends' board of directors is Eric Lemelson, a wealthy Yamhill County vineyard owner who contributed $1.68 million to campaigns and political action committees in 2007-08.
\
Conservative groups say they will refer to the ballot a bill that raises taxes on wealthy households and that they may do the same with a legislative proposal that raises corporate taxes. Both bills passed last week. But conservative groups have backed away from their earlier threats to also refer House Bill 2001, the transportation bill that adds 6 cents to the per-gallon gas tax and increases vehicle and trucking fees, all to pay for an array of road construction and other transportation projects.
\
1000 Friends is pushing for a slimmed down version the original trans- portation package's re-quirement that Oregon's six biggest urban areas revise their long-range growth plans to include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as part of their criteria for land use and transportation planning.
\
In the version of House Bill 2001 that cleared the Legislature last month, only the Portland area is required to take this step, and its regional government, Metro, already planned to do so.
\
1000 Friends is trying to persuade legislative leaders to use a separate bill to require greenhouse gas reductions as part of transportation and land use planning in the Eugene-Springfield metro area specifically, as well as one more metro area - either Salem-Keizer, Corvallis, Bend or Medford-Ashland.
\
Stachon said his group was pushing for Eugene-Springfield's inclusion be-cause of its population.
\
""It's the second-largest (metro area in the state), so in terms of getting the state closer to meeting the goals, you're farther along if you've got the larger (metro areas) going along,"" he said.
\
Such a requirement could prod a metro area to more vigorously pursue such elements as compact, high-density growth, and pedestrian, bicycle and mass-transit transportation; and to discourage suburban sprawl and its accompanying motor vehicle use.
\
Geoff Sugerman, a spokesman for House Speaker Dave Hunt, responded that the Legislature is making progress on reducing global warming emissions. The transportation bill makes more money available for transit and cycling than is currently spent, and lawmakers are working on a separate bill that would set low-carbon standards for fuel consumed in Oregon.
\
""It would be really unfortunate if they pulled us back on the progress we made with job creation, transportation and the environment because they didn't get everything they wanted,"" Sugerman said.
\
House Transportation Chairwoman Terry Beyer, D-Springfield, said city and county leaders oppose such mandatory changes to their areas' comprehensive planning because they shift decision making away from locally elected leaders to the Legislature and to appointed commissions in Salem.
\
Tying carbon reduction to regional transportation and land use planning in the Eugene-Springfield area also could allow one city to exert more influence over future road and community development than the other city wants, Beyer said. Such objections will be harder to overcome now that the main transportation bill already has passed and adjournment is drawing near.
\
""It's late in the session,"" Beyer said. ""It was challenging early on, and we gave what we could"" to the environmental lobby.

It's starting to dawn on Gov. Kate Brown and the Legislature's Democratic leadership that when Republican lawmakers said they would allow only one gasoline tax increase this year, they meant it. And when Republicans said they would count the clean fuels program as a gas tax increase, they meant that, too. Accepting Republicans' sincerity puts a top priority for Brown and the state - a gas-tax funded transportation improvement plan - out of reach. It's time to make a deal.
\
The clean fuels program was created in 2009, but has not been implemented and was due to expire at the end of this year. Democrats in the House and Senate, acting without Republican support, passed a bill extending the sunset date and triggering its implementation. Under the program, Oregon will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels by 10 percent by 2025. The reduction will be achieved by switching to lower-carbon fuels such as biogas, compressed natural gas and electricity. Oregon producers of these alternative fuels will receive credits that can be sold to companies that import fossil fuels into the state.
\
It's easy to see why Democrats are enthusiastic about the program: It promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while encouraging the continued emergence of a home-grown alternative fuels industry. But the cause of Republicans' apprehensions is equally clear: No one really knows how much gasoline distributors will end up paying for clean-fuels credits - estimates range from a fraction of a cent to 19 cents per gallon or even higher. Whatever the amount, it will be passed along to Oregonians at the gas pump.
\
The 2015 Legislature convened with a bipartisan consensus in favor of raising state gas taxes to pay for state and local transportation projects. That consensus splintered when Brown signed the clean-fuels bill.
\
Democrats can't pass a gas tax increase over Republicans' objections, as they did with the clean-fuels legislation. Legislation that directly increases taxes needs a three-fifths vote in both chambers, and Democrats are one vote short of that threshold in the House. Brown said in her State of the State speech last month that a transportation bill is one of her main goals - but with Republicans solidly opposed to what they regard as a second gas tax increase, the governor is in danger of being left empty-handed.
\
Brown has called together legislative leaders of both parties this week to discuss what might be done. A good beginning would be to acknowledge the legitimacy of Republicans' concerns about the clean-fuels program. Until its cost is known, people will have reason to fear the worst - and the 19-cent-per-gallon figure comes from a credible source, the Department of Environmental Quality. Republicans, for their part, should concede that the clean-fuels program might be an inexpensive boon to the state's environment and economy.
\
A mutual recognition of the merits of each others' arguments could bring both parties' leaders to an understanding that the real problem is uncertainty: If the actual cost of the clean-fuels program were known, the state's best course of action would be more clear. A delay - not repeal, as Republicans demand, and not implementation, as enacted by Democrats - would allow greater certainty to emerge. And it could restore the bipartisan consensus that will be needed to rescue a gas-tax funded transportation plan from oblivion.

Big money tarnishes local elections
\
When it comes to big money tarnishing elections, it's as dominant locally as nationally. That fact is seen below the surface of the announcement by Andy Stahl, who wants to take out of office one of Lane County's best commissioners ever, Pete Sorenson.
\
Stahl has an impressive environmental vita, which makes his support from moneyed conservatives illogical. He shouldn't accept it if he wants to serve the people instead of the powerful.
\
Stahl can't sustain a positive identity if he welcomes the support, as reported in the newspaper, of lumber mogul Aaron Jones.
\
Such help is intended more to put in jeopardy Sorenson's position than to recognize the challenger's abilities. Sorenson has the wisdom and courage to go against big business, symbolized by lumber, when it goes counter to the best interests of the public.
\
Stahl has to know of Jones' history of opposing what's good for the environment. Jones gave a compliant and needy University of Oregon a major gift to get it to drop the school's Environmental Law Center, a former law dean told me. Stahl himself was affected when the environmental program he managed at the UO was discontinued at Jones' insistence.
\
As the public wises up, power brokers choose to back occasional liberals to give them a facade of progressiveness. Stahl's personal motivation to serve can't be challenged, but he allows himself to be a pawn for those who fear the continuing challenge to their agenda by an admirable servant of the people, Peter Sorenson.

Viewing the recent video on the four U.S. Marines urinating on the dead bodies of alleged Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, I found myself in an urgent race against the erasure of memory. It recalled another video taken by Muslim terrorists who shot and beheaded American journalist Daniel Pearl. If you want to see horror, watch the video of Pearl's death.
\
The ruthlessness with which he was murdered is an expression of the extent to which our enemies will express their brutality. As a society, we shouldn't seek moral equivalency because we are then doomed to descend to their level. But what was done to Pearl is an indication of the kind of war we're in.
\
The legacy of the degradation of bodies in that region is historical. When the Taliban laid siege to Kabul in 1996, they dragged a former Afghan leader, Mohammad Najibullah, from the United Nations' compound, mutilated him in ways that can't be described in polite company, and hung him from a lamppost.
\
Equally disturbing is to observe national American Muslim organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Muslim Public Affairs Council and the Islamic Society of North America fire off press releases of condemnation of the Marines' video.
\
We're in a war with Muslim values that include beheadings and cutting off noses and ears of girls and women in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's not too difficult to understand our Marines' attitudes there today.

Don't remove park's bike path trees
\
The city of Eugene public works department has posted that it is going to remove several flowering trees and ""improve"" the north bike path in Alton Baker Park between the boat ramp and the Autzen footbridge.
\
That would be a mistake. The mature and exceptional flowering trees produce fruit that birds, squirrels and other wildlife love. The flowering cherries are nonnative, but they are beautiful. The unusual and lovely natural area also has native flowering larkspur every spring, very close to the path, that will be lost forever. There is a great patch of wonderful cyclamen flowers that will be destroyed when the heavy equipment moves in.
\
The bike path does not need to be improved. It's is in good condition and much loved. It is a quiet, winding path, shaded in summer, that is used mostly by walkers, runners and slow bicycles. Faster bicycles can use the southside path.
\
The public works department proposes to start the project at the beginning of February, before the flowers bloom, and some people may be unaware of the destruction to the natural area next to the path that the project will cause.
\
Public works has more pressing needs and potholes to attend to on Eugene's streets. If the department can't find other work to do, let's cut the Eugene gas tax - and leave the Alton Baker section of the bike path alone.

Oil would make a difference here
\
I felt vague discomfort as I read Linda McClellan's Jan. 21 column (""Oregon is driving prosperity, and this family, away""). She and her whole family have moved to Texas, presumably because it is governed better by conservatives.
\
In her last paragraph she mentions, ""enough is enough."" I wondered, enough of what is enough? She cites political leadership. How about oil?
\
If Oregon had oil, it might not matter a lot who runs the government. I get tired of this kind of sneaky Republican tactic - refer to some shortcoming in the land and imply that if only we could shoot all the liberals, the problem would ameliorate itself overnight.
\
Once again, I'm struck by how important geography - and in this case, its subset geology - is for what happens on our planet.

Accessible health care is needed
\
In Bill Northrup's Jan. 20 letter he said, referring to Lane County nurses' opposition to cuts to their health insurance, ""I value the nurses. I honor them. But what they ask requires average citizens to be valued less than they are in a time of great economic struggle for so many.""
\
What if the citizens of this country were to choose a system in which everyone is valued equally, and whether they get the health care they need or whether they live or die is not determined by what job they have or how much money they make?
\
What if we choose a health system that makes health care accessible to everyone, and that we can afford. A system that is truly for the people by the people?
\
Anyone who would like to find how that can happen is invited to attend a Health Care for All Oregon and Single Payer Coalition meeting at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Eugene Water & Electric Board's offices in downtown Eugene.

Hanna's agenda deserves support
\
State Rep. Bruce Hanna represents my district. I am extremely proud of his vision for Oregon's future. He has a proven track record of setting realistic goals and producing results in a state where Borrow T. Spend had become the signature with which we signed our promissory notes.
\
The 2012 Legislature has the potential to put us back on the fast track to recovery by adopting legislation that promotes private sector job creation, limits government spending and puts reforms in place to reduce red tape and bureaucracy.
\
I used to dread the Legislature going into session, but with Co-speaker Hanna at the helm, I have faith-filled confidence that bills will be produced to get Oregon working again.
\
Please support him and his legislative agenda. It's our state's true ""green"" solution.

146,"
I am a registered Democrat. I vote independently. I have two children in the Eugene School District. I contribute 0.5 percent of my income to the Eugene Education Fund to support school-directed needs. I have worked for public education and have experience in school budgets and operations. And I have grave reservations about the proposed city income tax for schools.
\
The income tax has significant problems that cannot be dismissed as the rants of political extremists. Major issues include:
\
Administration: The city can spend up to 30 percent ($7.2 million) of the $24 million in projected revenue for any purpose without violating the resolution. (This $24 million projection comes from the city.) The resolution does not contain language as to how that 30 percent will be spent.
\
Disproportionate allocations: The city actually receives more money than the Bethel School District. The Eugene School District, the city of Eugene and the Bethel School District receive, respectively, 50 percent, 30 percent and 20 percent of the $24 million.
\
Lack of diverse support: The Eugene Area Chamber of Commerce does not support the measure. To have diversity and make Eugene more attractive for business investment, the city must look beyond health care organizations for representative business input. The average business does not have the high wage earners that medical organizations have. Broader business input is essential for a vibrant local economy.
\
Effect on the local economy: Claims have been made that the income tax may help the local economy. No one really knows how the income tax will affect the local economy; no one ever will. (There are too many variables to know with certainty.)
\
If we look at the current economic environment, however - vacant commercial space downtown, the Chamber's opposition, Measure 66's revenue shortfalls, and Oregon's position among the 10 worst states for making a living due in large part to high income taxes (MoneyRates) - it's reasonable to conclude this tax measure will do more harm than good for the local economy.
\
The Eugene City Council's whim: The city likely will change the tax's duration, purpose and rate schedule without a citywide vote. The City Council routinely changes its collective mind despite past commitments and decisions.
\
Examples include extending the city's ""temporary"" gas tax indefinitely, interfering with a legal process for Civic Stadium, and changing the proposed income tax rate structure in one week's time. (This is not a criticism of past council decisions per se; it's simply an observation of its collective behavior.) This pattern of behavior suggests that the City Council may change the tax during its four-year duration - despite claims to the contrary.
\
An ongoing tax: The tax will last at least eight years. Based on local district finances and state revenue trends, the state will need to provide the Eugene School District with an additional 8 percent to 12 percent of funding after four years to make up funds from the income tax. That's unrealistic in this economy. A four-year income tax doesn't work. If the tax passes, expect to pay for the next decade.
\
Inequity abounds: The city receives more funding than Bethel. Parents of some Eugene and Bethel school district students pay, others do not. Public Employees Retirement System retirees are exempt; others are not. A single mother with four children who makes $45,000 to $60,000 a year pays the same flat rate as a doctor who makes $200,000. Single parents are especially hard hit. The tax is unfair in many different ways.
\
Extraordinary impact on young families: Regardless of income level, young families spend a higher percentage of income on consumables and basic services (e.g., food, transportation, day care, diapers, etc.) than their older counterparts. Young families will have a much more difficult time paying this tax.
\
These issues are neither minor nor fake, as tax proponents have claimed. These problems collectively represent significant drawbacks all over the socioeconomic spectrum.
\
A saner, more cost-effective route is a year-round fundraising campaign through local educational foundations, where residents give according to their ability. This voluntary alternative would provide the same positive impact as the tax without the negative consequences and opposition and with a much lower administrative charge. (Eugene Education Fund administration charges are much lower - 4.75 percent through its automatic deduction program, for example.)
\
Similar bailout campaigns have worked in other communities. At a minimum, such a campaign would give the community time to put together a more reasonable, less flawed game plan - instead of just throwing another Hail Mary pass and hoping everything works out in the end.
\
It's not too late to work toward a better solution for the children, the schools and the community than what the city income tax tries to offer.

Note: The apparent reaction to highergasprices could be bad news for the road work and other projects paid for with fuel taxes
\
SALEM - Oregon's top transportation economist doesn't yet have the spreadsheets to prove it, but he sees more evidence daily that motorists are curbing their fuel consumption.
\
""When I pull into the parking structure, one out of every four or five parking stalls is empty,"" said David Kavanaugh, chief transportation economist for the Oregon Department of Transportation.
\
Thinning parking lots, growing ranks of transit and bike commuters, and the flight from gas-guzzling SUVs to high-efficiency hybrids all underscore consumer reaction to $4-a-gallon-plus gas prices.
\
But if the fuel savings is good for the environment, it's hardly the best of news for state and local agencies that rely on gas tax revenue.
\
For every gallon of gas that Oregon drivers avoid buying, state and local transportation agencies forgo 24 cents in state fuel taxes for road and bridge work, and the federal government forgoes its 18.4-cents-per-gallon fuel tax. Also, many cities have their own gas taxes. Eugene's is 5 cents a gallon. Springfield's is 3 cents.
\
Next month, Kavanaugh expects to finalize his first update to state gas-tax revenue projections this year. He'll be reviewing a period in which gas prices jumped $1 a gallon since March. That forecast could indicate that gas-tax revenues aren't keeping up with projections - which would mean there's not enough money coming in to pay for all the bridge and road work in the pipeline.
\
The Oregon Department of Transportation's current fuel-tax revenue outlook, which dates to January, calls for annual growth of about 1.5 percent to 2 percent.
\
But in April, the state recorded a seasonally adjusted 141.5 million gallons of motor fuel sold, down 2.4 percent from April 2007. And in May, the latest month for which numbers are available, the state recorded a seasonally adjusted 143.5 million gallons of motor fuel sold, down 1.3 percent from May 2007.
\
Whether or not that downturn has continued into the summer is not yet clear. But transportation and public-works professionals are bracing for fuel consumption to drop enough that gax-tax revenues take a noticeable tumble.
\
""We haven't seen revenues change yet, but as every month goes by, it's likely that we will see it,"" said Eric Jones, spokesman for the city of Eugene's public works department. The city relies on state and city gas taxes for about $10 million for road maintenance and improvements annually.
\
Statewide, the gas tax produces about $400 million a year for state and local road, highway and bridge projects.
\
Last year saw a reduction in driving in the state. In 2005 and 2006, Oregon's ""vehicle miles traveled"" grew by 1.6 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, according to ODOT. Then in 2007 - as gas prices were creeping up but before they exploded in 2008 - vehicle miles traveled declined by 0.5 percent.
\
Lower-than-expected revenue would be a double-whammy for road projects in Oregon, which are being squeezed by high petroleum costs in another way, ODOT spokesman Dave Thompson said.
\
""The reason is not because the gas tax doesn't bring in enough, but because our costs are going up,"" Thompson said.
\
Specifically, he points to the cost of fuel for construction companies' heavy equipment that provides the muscle behind Oregon's road-work operations. In addition, the rising price of petroleum-based asphalt is causing projects' costs to outpace projections.
\
Along with inflation for other materials, such as steel, these costs are being passed along by private construction companies to ODOT, as is permitted by ""escalator clauses"" built into their contracts.
\
These rising costs are causing state transportation projects to escalate by an estimated $170 million, so far, in excess of the dollars that state planners expected to have available for 2007-09. To make ends meet, ODOT probably will have to identify a handful of big projects - which typically range from $40 million to $100 million apiece - to delay until the next two-year spending cycle, Thompson said.
\
He and other transportation experts say the rise in petroleum costs plus restraint in gas consumption underscorea problem that for years has loomed over the state's transportation infrastructure:
\
Gas tax revenues don't provide enough cash to keep up with maintenance and improvement costs.
\
""Many people would say the transportation funding system is in crisis even before these recent price increases,"" said Robert Bertini, director of the Portland-based Oregon Transportation Research and Education Consortium.
\
Since 1993, Oregon's gas tax has stood at 24 cents a gallon. Between then and 2006, gas tax revenues increased 3 percent - even though the number of vehicle miles traveled is up by 19 percent, according to ODOT.
\
In the same 13-year span, ODOT costs have risen more dramatically in several categories, including for excavation work (134 percent), gasoline (99 percent), structural concrete (97 percent) and reinforcing steel (65 percent).
\
These long-term trends have prompted state leaders since the mid-1990s to explore such alternatives to the gas tax as toll ways and onboard technology to measure taxable vehicle miles traveled. Political resistance, costs and technology challenges have kept such ideas from moving.
\
State Rep. Terry Beyer, a Springfield Democrat and chairwoman of the House Transportation Committee, said the latest gas consumption and costs trends are likely to force policymakers to pursue alternatives to the gas tax.
\
""It's happening faster than anyone anticipated,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to start looking for an alternate way to fund our highways because this is not going to be a reliable source for too far out.""
\
State's drivers let up on the gas purchases
\
Here are seasonally adjusted motor fuel sales figures along with the change from the same month a year ago, according to the Oregon Department of Transportation:
\
May: 143.5 million gallons; down 1.3 percent
\
April: 141.5 million gallons; down 2.4 percent
\
March: 145 million gallons; up 1.7 percent
\
February: 141.8 million gallons; down 1.4 percent

148,"Gas tax provides essential funds for Oregon's economy\Aaron J. Hill (letters, April 30) seems to think roads, highways and bridges were the providence of the Creator. That they just sprang into being and will go on forever, without need of maintenance or upgrade. It appears he believes all those billions paid in gas taxes don't do anything but disappear into a black hole.\Oregon's forward-thinking gas tax of 1919 at one time provided the highway department with the means to build and maintain a well-designed system to meet the needs of the motoring public. This system is now under strain and in need of major repairs. Even though costs continue to increase, the gas tax has not been allowed to keep up with this reality. The result: deferred maintenance and fewer improvements being built.\To do away with the gas tax would mean the end of the Oregon economy. Simple as that!\- Stephen B. Wilson, Salem\Tesler would protect environment\Ward 2 City Council candidate Laura Tesler will work to balance development so that Salem's natural resources are protected. The current City Council has demonstrated a severe lack of commitment to preserving Salem's environment.\Of the nine environmental votes cast in 2004-05, the incumbent Ward 2 councilor, Jim Randall, voted only once in favor of environmental protection. He cast his other votes against the environment by reducing protection for streams, trees and wetlands, disbanding the environmental commission and stopping Salem from joining more than 200 U.S. cities in voluntarily reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.\Laura Tesler is the only candidate for Salem's City Council who qualified for endorsement by the Oregon League of Conservation Voters. As a member of the endorsement committee, it became clear to me that Laura has the knowledge, skills and commitment to make decisions for the sake of our salmon, songbirds, historic trees, clean streams and climate protection. She also understands the complexity of issues a growing city faces and will work hard for balanced solutions that demonstrate respect for people and natural resources.\For any voter who cares about Salem's environment, Laura Tesler is the only choice.\- Tina Schweickert, Salem\Randall can handle complex issues\I have had the privilege of sitting next to Jim Randall for the past 15 months as a Salem City councilor. I would encourage the voters to look closely at his breadth and depth of knowledge and experience.\Ward 2 is one of the most difficult wards in the city because it contains most of downtown and two historic districts. This is not a ward where you can afford to have a steep learning curve. There are many complex issues including downtown parking, urban-renewal projects and several neighborhood associations.\Jim has a solid record of accomplishment in balancing the needs of the business community with the livability of the neighborhoods that surround downtown. Jim has also led the effort to reform downtown parking and extend a pedestrian/bike trail from the riverfront to Minto-Brown Island.\What I respect most about Jim Randall is his extreme respect for all constituents regardless of where they stand on issues. The rest of the City Council selected Jim Randall to act as mayor pro tem because of the confidence we have in him.\Please consider how important your vote will be in sustaining the momentum Jim has helped create to ""Keep Salem working.""\- Frank Walker, Salem"

Councilor Ortiz knows she angered her voters
\
Whether they agree or disagree with her vote, Eugene citizens ought to give City Councilor Andrea Ortiz a call (688-5588) or send her an e-mail (Andrea .F.Ortiz@ci.eugene.or.us) thanking her for having the courage to take a position she knew would anger many of her constituents.
\
Ortiz had no doubt that her Wednesday vote in favor of bringing a Whole Foods Market and an associated parking garage to downtown Eugene would upset her supporters. A lot of them had already let her know, in no uncertain terms, how they would respond to a ""yes"" vote.
\
""I have talked to folks who have been nice, not so nice, rude and yelling at me,"" she said in a statement explaining her position. ""If this is political suicide, then (so) be it. I can't base my decisions on what may happen in the future or what my next career move is. ... I can't find anything that makes me believe this is a bad thing for Eugene.""
\
With a handful of significant exceptions - a city gas tax increase, the West Eugene Enterprise Zone and the city's cooperation with Triad Hospitals Inc. on the Delta Ridge site - Ortiz has been a reliable liberal-bloc vote on the City Council. A lot of her progressive, pro-environment, sustainable-growth constituency vigorously opposed the Whole Foods project.
\
Expectations ran high that Ortiz would listen to the liberal portion of her political base and cast a ""no"" vote. Time will tell whether her vote was right or wrong for Eugene, but the fact that she conscientiously studied the issue and had the courage - after agonizing over the feedback she had received - to take an unpopular position is the best reward she could have given to the citizens who elected her.
\
George W. Bush's success in two hard-fought presidential races proved that maintaining the allegiance of a politician's voter base is crucial to winning close elections. As a result, taking positions that play to the base has become dogma for elected officials at all levels of government.
\
Such robotic predictability robs the political process of vitality and reinforces a growing apathy in the electorate. If party or special interest affiliation automatically determines how people vote, there's no need to debate the issues or examine the arguments. In short, there's no need to pay attention.
\
Ortiz proved that weighing the arguments can be an arduous undertaking. Combined with courage, it also can produce unpredictable results. She had the backbone to buck the prevailing wisdom about how she ""should"" have voted, even if it jeopardizes her prospects for re-election. It's hard not to respect the example she sets for elected officials everywhere.
\
It's also worth noting that Councilor David Kelly, a stalwart of the council's progressive bloc, voted in favor of the Whole Foods project. He has ruled out running for a third term, so it's safe to assume the notoriously analytical Kelly cast his vote without concern for the reaction of his political base. Not to mention that the eight-year City Council veteran has more practice than first- termer Ortiz at surviving the slings and arrows of outraged constituents.
\
Ortiz and Kelly have sent a welcome message to voters that politicians aren't necessarily on autopilot in the political process.
\
And citizens shouldn't assume that open-minded officials, regardless of their affiliation, have made up their minds before doing their homework.

Religious beliefs aren't provable
\
Researchers in early civilizations could imagine no explanation for the existence of the stars and Earth's creatures unless a God who could do anything had created them. All life forms will do everything possible to escape dying, and since everything dies, they included an afterlife in a paradise - all provided for by that same God.
\
These explanations cannot be proven, nor can they be disproved, because they go beyond the observable laws of the universe. Because they are not provable, all are equally valid, including similar claims from all religions.
\
We are involved in a war with a religion the God of which demands that the faithful kill those who don't believe. Some adherents volunteer for suicide missions for the reward that their faith guarantees.
\
Those who aren't interested in the religious differences as much as they are in making money in any way possible are doing everything possible to prolong the conflict because it is providing profits for them. Altogether, it is costing thousands of lives and still counting, and it is causing millions more to suffer the horrors that war brings. But those involved consider their interests to be more important.
\
We need to become involved in whatever is required to change the world's thinking away from ancient claims of supernatural things that are not provable and into realistic expectations for this life we are living. Otherwise, the devices that are available for warfare now may end life as we have known it.

I think the owner came out immediately and was kneeling by the cat and I drove off. When I returned to Vermont, I totalled my car and almost killed myself and my friends because I was driving too fast.

\
Today, I helped take a cat who was hurt to the veterinarian and to get a new home, and I thought of this incident in Springfield and had to write. I hope the cat's companion reads this, and if anyone knows who it was please tell them.
\
And please, slow down. I now am a good driver, and I can't believe the way I used to drive. If you want to race, do it at a racetrack. If you drive fast in public you are endangering everyone.
\
I was not the only person driving fast, but I was the only person who hit that cat. I can apologize, but I can't make that cat be alive in its body again in this life with its friends.

Bush playing shell game in Iraq
\
""Bush orders limited withdrawal from Iraq"" was the front-page headline on Sept. 14, based on the president's speech to the country the prior evening. This headline is at best misleading, and it is very telling about the mind-set of the newspaper's editors.
\
President Bush in February asked the nation to accept a temporary ""surge"" in troop level, instead of troop redeployment, in order to allow more time for Iraqis to take over their own security. Bush said this would allow him to later reduce troop levels from the then- existing 137,000 level.
\
He demanded additional billions with no strings attached. Eight months later, he changes the topic, effectively extends the surge for at least a year, and reveals his plan for an ""enduring relationship"" that will keep troops in Iraq for generations.
\
No one would doubt that if infinite resources and infinite time are allowed, the United States would win this war. The president, and his speech writers, have been playing a shell game with the public, and The Register-Guard's editors, to maintain the occupation of Iraq and to establish a strong presence in the Middle East and beyond, so we can completely colonize it.
\
The only thing the president announced in his speech is that he is phasing out the surge in a year - maybe - and that he wants to maintain the occupation and pass it on to his successor. Withdrawal was never considered. The headline should have been: ""Bush orders limited phase-out of the surge.""

What's origin of liberal labels?
\
The origin of characterizations might be a good weekly article for Register-Guard readers. You know, ""Where did that come from?""
\
When someone calls you a ""crackpot,"" what does it mean, and where did it come from? I am curious because when I asked the Eugene City Council and Mayor Kitty Piercy, ""How come we need a 5-cent-a-gallon gas tax for road repair when we already have millions of dollars in the bank to buy residential property in southwest Eugene so some developer does not buy it and build some more tax-generating properties,"" they called me a crackpot.
\
When my friends and I ask several people in our local government why we, the registered voters in the area, are not asked our opinions prior to law-changing decisions, we are considered ""conservative elitists.""
\
The one that really burns our cheeks is when we pledge allegiance to the flag in honor of soldiers in uniform and are called ""warmongers.""
\
It is a silly thing to ask, I realize, but evidently we are not as wise as some. We would just like to know the origin of these characterizations so we can find out what the Eugene liberals really think of us. Never can tell, we might change our ways.

Loaded words aren't helpful
\
I found myself in basic agreement with Chris Culhane's opinions on what the fate should be of the mother of the poor child who died in the heat of her car (letters, Sept. 16).
\
But I am disappointed, although not completely surprised, at his remarks about our ""secular progressive environment."" I fail to understand why the words ""secular"" and ""progressive"" are used, unless it's for the purpose of bringing religion and what he surely knows is a politically loaded word into this tragedy.
\
Is he saying there would be even more legal consequences if this were a religious and conservative environment? I think not, unless those legal consequences were even more of an erosion of our individual liberties than we have now under our current religion- oriented and conservative administration.
\
To throw those words into this sad situation is self-serving and gratuitous, in my opinion.

Frohnmayer selectively tolerant
\
The selected quotes in Jeff Wright's report on University of Oregon President Dave Frohnmayer's address to an interfaith community breakfast (Register-Guard, Sept. 12) smell of hypocrisy.
\
Recent history reminds us that Frohnmayer did not just ""get over it"" when confronted with his own misunderstanding and intolerance against the Native American Church throughout the 1980s. Despite numerous decisions in Oregon that claimed a Indian Oregon citizen was protected by the First Amendment in an unemployment case, Frohnmayer, as Oregon's attorney general, appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court - not once, but twice. In 1990, the decision in Smith vs. Oregon eroded freedom of religion in this country, sending shock waves through the interfaith communities and legal scholars alike.
\
His seven-year legal onslaught was not because the Native American Church group was a bunch of fanatics engaged in reckless endangerment as was the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh group he referenced. This was a quiet, peaceful, faith community that required cultural respect and religious tolerance, neither of which he could muster.
\
Take a better look underneath this faade of liberal tolerance. Be accountable for history. It was Frohnmayer's aggressive legal tactics as attorney general that, as an AFL-CIO spokesman put it, ""drove a spike in the heart of the Bill of Rights,"" stripping many in this nation of religious exemptions and the very tolerance his Huguenot ancestors came here to enjoy. The pen may have replaced the sword, but the colonial game's the same.

Support Iraq war? Then enlist
\
My partner is in the Navy reserve and is on a 15-month deployment in Afghanistan. He is expected to return home next month. What should be a time of celebration and joy of his return has been tainted this week.
\
Reports from Gen. David Petraeus and President Bush reinforced that we will continue to stay the course in the war on terror. My partner's eight-year commitment of service ends in December 2009. If our current dictator is allowed to continue, we will still be at war at that time.
\
It is likely he will be redeployed and forced to involuntarily serve past his original eight-year contract. The all ""volunteer"" U.S. military cannot meet its recruiting goals and will not be able to maintain proposed troop deployment levels without calling up progressively more Individual Ready Reserve forces.
\
This pool of Individual Ready Reserve forces has been used previously on a very rare basis for national emergencies. However, both President Bush and his father decided to use this pool to sustain wars in the Middle East.
\
To those who support the war, I say enlist in the military and put yourselves or your children in front of the bullets for this ""just"" cause. Enlist in the military with a contract whose length may change at any time without your control.

If you are unwilling to do that, then don't support a war that forces good, decent, patriotic Americans and their loved ones to this fate.

John Kitzhaber on Wednesday warned Salem residents of dire consequences from Sizemore's proposal to let citizens and corporations write off all their federal income taxes. \The initiative would slash @$!10.6 billion 1999-2001 state budget. But by the time Oregonians vote in November, most of that money will be gone. \""We'll have about $$@$!3 billion that has not been spent when this measure is voted on,"" Kitzhaber said, ""and about a billion of that we'll lose."" \Kitzhaber ventured into the friendly surroundings of a Salem Rotary Club luncheon to trumpet warnings about the initiative as well as other measures barring video poker and reversing a nickel-a-gallon gas tax increase. \The governor also urged support for his own initiatives to stabilize school spending and force lawmakers to fund Oregon school reforms. \Oregonians are getting complacent about the environment and public services because the economy has been so hot, Kitzhaber said. \He predicted some of the measures on the November 2000 ballot could set the state in a downward course for the next decade. \He reserved his harshest comments for Sizemore, the leader of Oregon Taxpayers United association who lost to Kitzhaber in the 1998 gubernatorial race. \Reached later, Sizemore dismissed the governor's remarks as predictable scare tactics. \""Every politician in the state will take their turn at slamming that measure over and over, doing what politicians always do - predict the end of the world and that the sky will fall if taxpayers dare limit the amount of money that government takes from them,"" Sizemore said. \Individual Oregonians already can deduct as much as $$@$!3,000 in federal taxes paid from their taxable state income. Sizemore's proposal, expected to qualify soon for the November 2000 ballot, would allow all federal taxes to be deducted from state taxable income. And it would extend the tax break to corporations. \By the 2001-2003 budget cycle, the measure would cut $$@$!1.74 billion from state coffers, roughly 15 percent of the state general fund and lottery money. \Past cries from state leaders about the impact of tax reductions have proved exaggerated. But Kitzhaber insisted this measure is ""fundamentally different"" from the Measure 5 property tax reduction of 1990 and Sizemore's cut-and-cap property tax limitation of 1996. \Those measures were phased in gradually, giving the state time to adjust, Kitzhaber said. \Kitzhaber said his only choice would be to call a special session of the Legislature if Sizemore's measure passes. However, that could prove fruitless. Any effort to raise taxes and offset losses from the initiative requires a 60 percent majority vote from both chambers. Oregon West\LOCAL; Pg. 1C"
152,"To hear the full conversation with Patrick McCormick, tune in to KOPB Radio (91.5 FM) at 1 p.m. Monday. \Coming Saturday \Patrick Balducci, representing the Oregonians Against the Unfair Gas Tax Increase, discusses his opposition to Measure 82. \SUPPORTER ADMITS HE'S FIGHTING LOSING BATTLE \Roads need fixing now, Measure 82 backer says \Patrick McCormick argues that road use is growing twice as fast as the population. \Statesman Journal \Patrick McCormick concedes he is fighting a losing battle to persuade Oregonians to pass Measure 82 in the May 16 primary election. \Measure 82 would increase the state gasoline tax from 24 to 29 cents, raise state vehicle registration fees from @$!20 annually, allow counties to add a maximum of $$@$!10 annually to registration fees, and change the method used to tax trucks in Oregon. The weight-mile tax would be replaced by higher truck registration fees and a diesel-fuel tax of 29 cents per gallon. \Measure 82 would raise about @$!600 million bond issue for 57 state highway projects. \McCormick says Measure 82 is worthwhile but concedes it probably will be defeated because of high gas prices and the strong opposition of the American Automobile Association of Oregon/Idaho. \McCormick discussed Measure 82 this week with reporters and editors. Excerpts follow: \Question: Why should voters approve Measure 82? \Answer: We're seeing road use, vehicle use rising at twice the rate of population growth in this state. Many of our roads are congested under the Oregon Benchmarks. The grade that the state's given itself for attention to urban highway congestion is an ""F."" The road information program, a national program out of Washington, D.C., says that 69 percent of the Portland area's roads are in mediocre or poor condition. And the average motorist is paying a premium of $$@$!135 per year in added vehicle operating costs to drive on these poorly maintained roads in the Portland area. \Throughout the state there are problems with highways. And as people drive on those roads they know something needs to be done. When voters understand that the only way that that improvement is going to ever occur is through an increase in user fees, we hope they'll understand that this kind of a measure, which is a modest increase, is a reasonable way to pay for those road improvements. \Q: Opponents have criticized Measure 82 as an inadequate response to Oregon's transportation needs. Is this the best the Legislature could do? \A: Well, it took them eight years to get to this, so under the circumstances, I think this was a pretty substantial achievement. As those of you who followed the legislative process know, it was the second to the last day of the legislative session on the third try through the House before the package finally received the super-majority required to pass it. So it wasn't easy to get to a yes on this. \For those of us who have been in the effort to try to get transportation funding throughout the '90s, the getting to yes has been the biggest challenge along the way. The fact that we were able to get that majority in the Legislature was encouraging, but obviously it requires more than that in Oregon because the final say is with voters. And ultimately we need to do a good job of explaining to voters how it is our roads are paid for, so that they'll understand what it's going to take for them to get better roads. \Q: Gas prices have dramatically increased since the Legislature passed the transportation funding package. How has that affected your campaign? \A: In the month of March we, as we had told our coalition in the campaign plan, used all available resources - paid television, radio, direct mail advertising - and tried to communicate our messages and then test to see what we could see from voter responses to it. What we learned in the course of that was that the obstacle that had become insurmountable was the increased gas prices. \We were seeing, during March, week-to-week increases that were greater at the pump than what the cost to motorists would be from the passage of Measure 82. So it just became impossible in that environment for us to talk productively with people about passage of Measure 82. And that's when we recognized not only that reality, but decided that it was in our long-term interest to at least make sure we used the final weeks of this campaign to help voters understand better how Oregon roads are funded and the responsibility that Oregon road users have to pay for those roads. \Prior to 1900, every male 20-50 years old had to spend two weeks each year working on county roads or pay a fine. And if they didn't pay the fine they'd go to jail. There were times, now that I'm past 50, when that system sounds appealing to me. \But I think the reality is that we have to recognize prices made a difference in this campaign and this has become a referendum on high gas prices rather than on the gas tax. We want to make certain people do understand what the gas tax is for and what the real impact of an increase in the gas tax is. \Q: If Measure 82 fails, is there any alternative to higher gas taxes and vehicle registration fees to pay for transportation needs? \A: My concern is that I don't think there is another alternative. The governor had a commission that looked at alternatives and made a set of recommendations that came to many people kind of out of the blue in 1997, and were quickly dispatched. \Unfortunately, I think everybody wants to find somebody else who will pay this tax. But the reality is those of us who use the roadsultimately will pay for the improvements in roads. And we're going to pay for it one way or another. \Q: AAA is suggesting a 2- or 3-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase. Would that be enough to pay for the state's transportation needs? \A: In my opinion, that's too little. And there are two problems with it. One is that it doesn't do enough to make any significant difference to the problems that we're experiencing. The erosion of value of gas tax dollars because of increased efficiency of automobiles - we're losing ground faster than that would make it up. And to go through the political exercise and ask lawmakers to do the very difficult act of increasing constituents' taxes, it better be for a purpose that will make a significant difference in that those voters will understand when they see the difference on the roads they drive. \I also think it's risky whenever you do such small steps and then try to sell them as having some significance to voters. They'll think that they've done something and then, in fact, not see the benefits and question whether they're getting their money's worth. \Q: Have you ever been involved in a campaign with less chance of success? What have you learned from this? \A: I don't know that I've been on the losing side of one where the margin will be as great as this. We've yet to see what that margin will be. But some of the campaigns we've lost, including Measure 5 in 1990 were painful even though the margins may have been smaller. And the pain of any loss, especially when it has significant ramifications is always a concern. \As to lessons learned, I think we have learned quite a bit. And one of the things we're trying to do with all those who have been not only participants in the coalition on this but also with lawmakers, other policy makers, we're trying to make certain we go out and spend time letting them see what we learned from our research and from focus groups, and from feedback we've gotten in the course of this campaign.

Draft might have prevented war
\
If a military draft were in effect and everyone 18 years and older would be called into service, we don't believe we would be in Iraq.
\
President Bush and company knew there would be a backlash of the American people, so they have relied on National Guard personnel and money enticements to lure our young people into the military. What is it now, $20,000 each?
\
National Public Radio recently reported that many hoped to use that money for an education later, so they enlisted in the National Guard or Navy. The deception was in being led to believe they would be in less serious danger.
\
But they soon found themselves being transferred into Army infantry camps and basic training. Is this a backdoor draft?
\
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney should be impeached, then immediately arrested and jailed along with the Cabinet and those who helped them decide to invade Iraq. They should be brought before an international war crimes tribunal and charged with invading a sovereign nation, crimes against humanity, the killing and crippling of Americans and Iraqis and the destruction of a nation.
\
Please write your senators and representatives to stop funding the war and bring our troops home. Last thought - if there were carrots instead of oil in the ground, would we be in Iraq?

Rove article filled with opinions
\
The Aug. 14 front-page article titled ""President's 'architect' engineers departure"" by Wayne Slater of the Dallas Morning News shares interesting insights into Karl Rove's exit from the White House.
\
Unfortunately, the story was run on the wrong page. From the article's fourth paragraph, which states that Rove's departure is a ""signal that there are no more big legislative or political battles for Rove to fight - and little chance Bush could win them anyway,"" to a paragraph reading, ""But for now, Bush's low approval rating and the resistance of a Democratic Congress will stymie many of the major initiatives he (Bush) and Rove long dreamed of,"" Slater offers opinions unsubstantiated by fact.
\
A story such as this about Rove's departure, written by the renowned author of ""Bush's Brain,"" would be a welcome addition to any newspaper's opinion page. But opinions do not belong on the front page.

Was a mistake made? What gives?

Single-payer isn't socialism
\
Martin Luther King Jr. once cited injustice in health care as the greatest social injustice. Indeed, it is, when you consider that caring for illness and suffering often comes with an unaffordable price tag.
\
The popular figure given for the uninsured is 45 million. But consider the millions more whose insurance has so many exclusions and high deductibles they can only get coverage in the event of medical catastrophe. Many insurance policies do not even cover recommended routine exams for common ailments.
\
Many of us are experienced with the things Michael Moore dramatizes in his film ""Sicko,"" such as insurance coverage denials and medical bills that stun us upon opening the envelopes. But perhaps the worst indictment, to which Moore has given voice, is the misled loyalty people assume for the status quo, believing that a universal single-payer health care system, such as found in other advanced nations, would be some kind of socialism!
\
Americans need to take a little time to understand what a single- payer system means, and they need to look past the propaganda and myths that defend our market-driven health care system. Moore asks who we are as a people if we can sit back and allow such injustice to continue.
\
Taken as a whole, the health care/insurance industry is more lucrative than oil, and its great lobbying power buys protected continuity from our elected officials who should be representing our interests and our health.
\
Isn't it time for us to stop putting up with this injustice?

Fed should be lowering rates
\
Why is it that those in Washington, D.C., are so ""book smart"" but have no common sense at all?
\
Average people saw this coming for miles - the overall economy was falling. Everybody knows that the engine for the economy is housing and auto sales, and when they falter so does the economy. Why did our new head of the Federal Reserve leave interest rates the same until it's too late, as Alan Greenspan did and then had to keep dropping rates so far they had to reach up to touch the bottom a few years ago?
\
Look at the billions of dollars they have infused into the stock market, and it does nothing as it keeps going down. They should do the following: Be aggressive and call a special meeting now and drop the rate half a point, with a quarter-point follow-up in September, which would have a domino effect on home buying rates and auto loans.
\
Some borrowers could qualify for an FHA loan to get out from their subprime loan so they could keep their homes and help get the overall economy back on solid ground. The Fed will have to do this at some point anyway, so why not do it now rather then later?

Headwaters project isn't selfish
\
All of the negative hype around preserving the Amazon headwaters is focused on taking the owners'e_SSSqland, taking parks from other areas of town and that the only people who want this to happen are a few gentrified, white NIMBY-types - none of which is true.
\
First of all, a City Council majority and Mayor Kitty Piercy have directed staff to seek three different appraisals for high-, medium- and low-density development on both the Green and Beverly parcels, come back to a work session to review the appraisals, then begin negotiations with the owners.
\
Second, the mayor is looking into other funding sources than the parks bond. Finally, it is true that most of the people who live around the two parcels support the preservation of the watershed (as well as many people from other areas of town); however, a large percentage of us are not rich and do struggle to get by.
\
The Amazon headwaters preservation project was a long and arduous process that cost those of us involved a great deal of time from our paying jobs, our families and personal lives - a sacrifice necessary to keeping dangerous development out of dwindling, precious and sensitive areas.
\
It is critical to remember both Green and the Beverlys have been denied approval to develop these parcels. They have hazardous, unstable soils and are steeply sloped. Development will increase the arsenic in Amazon Creek, which is water quality-limited for arsenic already.

Community will miss preschool
\
It was with great sadness that this grandma and grandpa read of the closing of Educational Environments School (Register-Guard, Aug. 12).
\
This wonderful preschool provided our granddaughter with a magical learning environment (no pun intended) for her to explore and the opportunity to fully participate in a preschool family. What makes this extraordinary is that our granddaughter was in a wheelchair because of spina bifida.
\
This wonderful school made it possible for her to have swim lessons, participate in the yearly performance program at South Eugene High School, go on field trips, meet loads of friends who invited her to many parties and exposed her to a great learning environment that was patterned on national certification standards.
\
The expectation that she would behave and learn as all the other students was ever-present. And she thrived! The wonderful staff learned to provide her with necessary medical procedures, worked out strategies that allowed her full access, and developed behavioral supports to help her learn to adjust to issues she had to deal with because of her disability.
\
Our thanks to this wonderful group of people with vision. The community will miss this true inclusive center of learning.

All gas taxes should be voted on
\
I'm not surprised that the city government is bypassing the will of the voters on the gas tax.
\
The local governments in our area have a history of implementing their ownseparateagenda, which is often against the majority of Eugene residents.
\
Our family gas station business has paid thousands in taxes to Eugene and Lane County since 1958. Whenever we go to the city government for help, the answer is always no. But they do say yes on bike lanes, yes on ""traffic calming"" devices, yes on the Peter DeFazio bike bridge, yes on perhaps the silliest thing of all, the EmX, and most definitely yes on taxes.
\
How much road repair could have been accomplished with the money spent on EmX? The problem with the city's street repair is not on the revenue side but on the spending side.
\
What portion of the current 5-cent gas tax actually ends up on the road as repairs? One cent? Two? And where does the rest go?
\
How many other cities in Oregon have a 5-cent gas tax? Zero. In fact, no city in Oregon currently has a gas tax higher than 3 cents. And yet our city government wanted to raise ours to 8 cents without putting it to a vote.
\
The voters of Eugene should get together and demand that a law be created where no proposed increase of any tax or fee can be enacted without going to a vote of the Eugene residents.

155,"This story needs to be clarified. The number of miles Oregonians drive on highways per year is almost 20 billion.\It's a chain reaction with consequences good and bad.\Because of rising gas prices, Oregonians are cutting back on how much they drive. With less driving comes lower gas consumption on a statewide scale. Lower gas consumption, although good environmental news, equates to fewer dollars for the Oregon Department of Transportation -- ultimately resulting in less funding for highway maintenance and construction.\According to a report from the Sightline Institute released in August, people throughout the Northwest are consuming less gasoline than they have at any time since 16 years ago. That also means they're paying less money to state government by way of a gas tax.\Oregon previously has announced that a reduction in gas tax revenue, increased debt payments and other economic factors ""will force the state's transportation department to slash its road construction budget in half by 2015,"" according to the report.\""Declining tax revenues will exacerbate a full-blown crisis in highway finance,"" the report reads.\Dave Thompson, a spokesman for ODOT, said the state is preparing for a potential loss in revenue by considering other sources. One alternative is to collect a vehicle miles-traveled tax instead of a gas tax.\""Smarter cars that are using less fuel, and hybrid cars that use maybe a third or half as much, they're still putting wear and tear on the roads,"" he said. ""When you have literally on the order of a billion miles every year, that wear and tear from individual cars adds up. Those kinds of cars are no longer paying any user fee that's tied to use of the resources.\""If we wanted to be fair in terms of user fee, we'd want to do something that boils down to you paying some small pittance per mile driven, regardless of the source of fuel,"" he said.\The state is considering several methods of calculating the miles driven, including a small GPS device that tracks the number of miles driven while in the state. But Thompson said some people have expressed concern with the state tracking their location.\""Another option is you pay a flat fee, $500 or so, with no GPS system,"" he said.\The reasons why Oregonians are consuming less fuel may seem obvious -- people are cutting back on how much they drive and newer vehicles are more fuel efficient. But it isn't quite that simple.\The report looks primarily at 2011, but numbers incidate the trend also is continuing into 2012. According to data from the Office of Highway Policy Information through July 2012, fuel consumption has continued to decrease at a steady rate. Oregonians have consumed, on average, 10.7 million gallons less gasoline this year than they did at the same time in 2011.\It may seem that gas prices largely are to blame. And it is true that as gas prices on average have increased between 2011 and 2012 by 18 cents per gallon, gas consumption has dropped.\However, the trend doesn't line up as neatly on a month-by-month basis. From January to August 2012, gas prices rose steadily and peaked in May -- but then fell slowly again. Meanwhile, gas consumption has been steadily increasing as the summer wore on.\The reason is because people respond differently to short-term versus long-term changes, according to transportation economists.\Short-term increases, such as the price of gas from one month to the next, lead drivers to make small changes to cut back on spending.\""But sustained price increases lead some consumers to make more fundamental, long-term changes,"" the report reads. ""Such as purchasing more efficient vehicles, changing jobs, or moving closer to work or shopping destinations.""\And it's the long-term changes that make the more dramatic difference. According to the report, long-term changes have as much as three times the impact on trends than short-term changes do.\The institute's report also cites fuel efficiency as a reason for a reduction in gas consumption, but the impact isn't nearly as significant.\Online\Read the full report at StatesmanJournal.com/sjwatch\ID_Code: J0-309300019"

Just over 4 million motor vehicles are registered in Oregon, and it would be interesting to know how many of their owners live in other states. A recent survey by Bankrate.com found that it costs less to drive a car in Oregon than in any other state, and low registration fees are the main reason. It's also notable that low costs haven't had the unwanted effect of inducing Oregonians to drive more.
\
The survey attempted to come up with a state-by-state figure for the total yearly cost of owning a car, apart from the price of the vehicle itself. Bankrate.com took into account the cost of repairs, gasoline, insurance and taxes and fees. The figure was highest in Georgia, at $4,233. The cost of owning a car in Oregon was just over half that, $2,404. That's almost $800 less than the national average of $3,201.
\
Oregonians pay a bit more than average on repairs - $380 a year, compared to $353 nationwide. They pay a bit less for gasoline, $942 a year compared to an average of $1,028. And they get a slight break on their insurance, with yearly premiums averaging $724 in Oregon and $762 in all states.
\
It was the category of taxes and fees that won Oregon its lowest-cost distinction. These totaled $157 in Oregon, compared to a national average of $1,058. Only two other states, Alaska and South Dakota, have taxes and fees of less than $500 a year. In Georgia they come to $1,952, which accounts for that state's No. 1 ranking.
\
One reason Oregon's fees are so low is that whenever higher fees are proposed they're referred to the ballot and are voted down. Instead Oregon relies on the state gasoline tax, currently the 17th highest in the country at 30 cents per gallon, to finance road construction and maintenance.
\
Despite a relatively high gas tax, and despite gas prices that tend to be higher than in many parts of the country, Oregonians spend less than the national average on gasoline. That's because Oregonians drive 16 percent less than the national average. Oregon is not a densely populated state, but it has attempted to limit urban sprawl and provide public transportation options. One factor in Georgia's high cost of driving is that Atlanta's population is spread out, resulting in long commuting distances - Georgians spend nearly $200 a year more on gasoline than Oregonians.
\
Ordinarily, when something is cheap people will use more of it - but a low cost of driving hasn't led Oregonians to spend more time in their cars. The result is a substantial savings, both financially and in terms of the environment. Bankrate.com's list is one where the bottom is a good place to be.

157,"Registration for a gas-electric car costs twice that of a regular vehicle.\BY LAURENCE M. CRUZ\Statesman Journal\The growing popularity of fuel-efficient hybrid cars such as the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius presents state lawmakers and transportation officials with a dilemma:\How can Oregon encourage a technology that benefits the environment and reduces U.S. dependence on foreign oil, yet still keep gas-tax dollars flowing into state coffers for the construction and maintenance of roads?\In an attempt to meet those apparently conflicting goals, the state has taken apparently conflicting steps: It offers hybrid buyers a $1,500 tax break but charges them double the registration fee of regular passenger vehicles, including gas-guzzling SUVs.\Some hybrid owners and lawmakers are angry at what they see as a mixed and un-Oregonian message.\""It's just one of those idiocies inflicted on people by government,"" Sen. Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, told a legislative panel last week. ""We should stop penalizing the early adopters of new technology.""\Ferrioli is sponsoring a bill that would reduce the registration fee for hybrid and electric vehicles from $60 per two years to $30 - the same as for comparable nonelectric vehicles.\Another bill, sponsored by Sen. Ryan Deckert, D-Beaverton, would eliminate the registration fee for hybrid vehicles altogether.\The law that raised hybrid registration fees took effect Jan. 1, 2002. It applies to the whole family of hybrid-powered vehicles, from motorcycles to motor homes.\Supporters of the proposed legislation say it's not the extra $15 per year to which they object, but the symbolic poke in the eye it represents.\Russ Beaton, an economics professor at Willamette University, told the panel that he bought his Honda Insight ""to make a statement,"" one that seems increasingly relevant in the current economic and political climate.\OREGONIANS spend more than $10 million per day on foreign oil, Beaton said.\""Do the math, and it's something like $4 billion a year that I can call nothing more than a hemorrhage of the Oregon economy,"" he said.\Some see the hybrid issue as an opportunity for Oregon to take the lead nationally, as it did with its land-use laws, Bottle Bill and other legislation.\""It's Oregon's chance to make a relatively bold statement,"" Deckert said. ""Oregon would like to be well ahead of the nation in saying that we would like to eliminate registration fees"" for hybrids.\Of the approximately 3 million registered vehicles in Oregon, only about 1,300 are hybrids, legislative analysts said.\The vehicles run on a combination of electricity and gas and average about 48 miles per gallon. In addition to the Insight and the Prius, customers also can choose a hybrid version of Honda's popular Civic model, introduced in 2002.\Both the state and city of Salem have added hybrids to their fleets.\""This is kind of the bridge technology between traditional gasoline and fuel cell,"" said Don Thomson, the city's fleet services superintendent.\Chris Hagerbaumer, air and transportation program director with the Oregon Environmental Council, said her group did not oppose the fee increase last year because it did not seem significant. But in conversations since then, many car shoppers have said that they stopped considering hybrids because of the fee increase, she said.\Furthermore, singling out hybrids because they pay less than average for the use of roads seems arbitrary because many other cars easily exceed the state fuel-efficiency average of 19.2 miles per gallon, among them the Honda Civic, and the Volkswagen Beetle, Golf and Jetta, Hagerbaumer said.\Instead, she suggested charging a fee for vehicles equipped with studded tires. Not doing so costs the state about $50 million per year - about 400 times more than the gas-tax revenue lost from fuel-efficient vehicles and hybrids.\After the hearing, in which no action was taken, Hagerbaumer predicted that states will have no choice but to wean themselves off the gas tax model as cars become more fuel efficient. According to a road-user fee task force, formed last year to explore the issue, a fee based on road miles traveled may be a more relevant alternative.\""It will be the system of the future,"" Hagerbaumer said. ""It could be 10 to 20 years off.""\Sen. David Nelson, R-Pendleton, said he would find it hard to support either a studded-tire fee or a mileage-based road user tax because his constituents would end up subsidizing Willamette Valley urbanites. Eastern Oregon residents with studded tires do less damage to roads because there's less traffic and many have to drive greater distances.\""How do you take care of my people?"" he said.\Hagerbaumer responded that some regions could be exempted from the studded-tire fee and have lower mileage-based taxes.\Beaton pointed to the importance of finding solutions that improve the economy and the environment.\""That's the Holy Grail of sustainable development,"" he said. ""My hybrid is just a step.""\Laurence M. Cruz can be reached at (503) 399-6716 or lcruz@StatesmanJournal.com"

Homophobic words are hurtful
\
I am a high school senior. Every day since sixth grade I have heard the words ""gay,"" ""homo,"" ""queer"" and ""faggot"" countless times. If someone doesn't like something, they will call it gay, and if someone is acting stupid, they will say ""Stop being such a faggot.""
\
I am sick of it. What's worse is that no one seems to care, at least not enough to speak up and say something about it. I have witnessed teachers overhear the use of homophobic words and say nothing.
\
People need to realize that these words are not OK to use. The only difference between racism and homophobia is that in the current political and social climate, homophobia is accepted. I have had discussions with people about their use of these words. Their justification was that it's OK because the slang uses of the words don't mean anything negative toward homosexuals. What they don't realize is that it creates a hostile environment for gay teens in schools.
\
Studies show that gay teens are six times as likely to attempt suicide when compared to straight teens. Gay teens also account for approximately 30 percent of all suicides in America. When presented with those numbers, it's impossible to argue that the use of homophobic words has no impact.
\
What can we do about this? We need to educate teens about homophobia just as we do racism, and make it a school policy to not accept the use of those words. Homophobia needs to be stopped.

We're obsessed with our image
\
Personal appearance in America seems to pop up often. People worry about how they look every single day. Americans have become obsessed with their image and go to great lengths of cosmetic surgery to try to make themselves look ""perfect.""
\
Every year, about 1.8 million women confess to having cosmetic surgery because they cracked under the pressure to look perfect. Liposuction is the most common procedure, and many people who get it do not know the risks. People should be aware of the dangers that come along with cosmetic surgery.
\
Hollywood adds to America's obsession with perfection. The media also preach the perfect look. It doesn't help when you see perfect people all the time and think you are just a regular-looking person.
\
The pressure isn't only on women; 11 percent of all plastic surgery in America is performed on men. Natural beauty is never wrong. It is how you are supposed to look. Don't crack under the pressure of others. Look at your real beauty and realize it is perfect.

It can take a crisis to get help
\
Having just read another letter concerning the shooting of the 19- year-old suffering from mental illness, let me say this: I will volunteer to be on site at any time day or night when the police are involved with this type of situation.
\
Of course, the police will not and should not allow it.
\
Having said that, not everything that could have been done for the young man who was shot was done by the mental health system. Their hands are tied.
\
How do I know? Our family has been through this, and it is the law that the individual has to prove they are a danger to themselves or others before they can be immobilized or hospitalized for protection. In many cases this means they end up committing a crime and are institutionalized, commit suicide or are injured or killed.
\
It was nice that law enforcement went to the victim's house to comfort the family. In our case they put the affected individual in the back of a squad car during a full-blown manic episode and told him to be quiet. When he kicked the window out of the car, he was charged with criminal mischief. His illness was denied by the system.
\
The point is we have a long way to go in figuring out how to help the mentally ill in a safe and humane manner to keep them from committing crimes or losing their life to prove their illness.

Tax gasoline to pay for Iraq war
\
Now that Congressman Peter DeFazio is about to gain chairmanship of a transportation subcommittee, he can take the lead in proposing a tax on gasoline to pay for the Iraq war.
\
All Americans should share a small part of the pain now borne by our soldiers and the people of Iraq. The tax should be in force until the war is fully paid for. The war's costs should not be a part of the horrendous debt we are leaving to our children.
\
It would be fair if only those who voted for George W. Bush paid the tax, but alas, that is impossible. I hope DeFazio will take up the issue.

U.N.'s corruption will continue
\
John Bolton's resignation signals United Nations business-as- usual will not be confronted. Endemic ineptitude and corruption such as displayed in the ""Oil for Food"" program becomes complementary background for U.N. member initiatives to perpetuate power for current ruling elites.
\
Ending colonialism and producing over 100 independent nations should never be mistaken for producing human freedom. Colonialism distracted attention from perpetual, lethal clashes since pre- history.
\
A few countries used rapidly developing industrial and governmental infrastructure to secure worldwide authority. However, colonialists were still outnumbered 1,000 or more to one, so tribal elites became allies for civil administration and internal security. At independence they did not relinquish privileged positions, but established new working relationships with former colonial powers and took seats in the General Assembly. Few nations produced a Nehru or Mandela who would lead differently.
\
The recent acclamation for speeches by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hugo Chavez and displeasure for President Bush's speech before the U.N. illustrate the status quo. In a single sentence Ahmadinejad merged a pure statement of Muslim faith with the religious lawyer's backwards-engineered heresy of the Twelfth Imam to spiritualize populist submission to his despotic aims.
\
Chavez, whose Bolivarian movement combines popular demonstration and legal process to obtain and solidify power, said Satan occupied the chamber when our president emphasized the Universal Doctrine of Human Rights.

As the president's representative, John Bolton provided a continually irritating presence.

More facts needed for road tax
\
The Register-Guard recently editorialized that ""A number of Oregon cities have gas taxes, a few have street fees - but none have both and most have neither."" It was also noted that Eugene has the highest gas tax at 5 cents per gallon of any municipality in Oregon!
\
These facts really got my attention, and generated a few questions:
\
With the highest gas tax for road repair in the state, why is Eugene so short of funds for this purpose? Does Eugene get fewer road repair funds from other sources than Oregon's other cities?
\
Are Eugene's streets notably worse off than other cities?
\
Over all, does Eugene generate lower or higher total tax revenues from local residents as compared to other Oregon cities?
\
As the City Council and Eugene residents consider adding a new tax for street repair, it would be helpful to see an in-depth article in The Register-Guard comparing Eugene's total tax revenues to other comparable cities in Oregon - are we relatively taxed less or more overall - and reviewing Eugene's total budget for road repairs and the sources of those funds.
\
When deciding whether a new road tax is justified, which it may be, this type of information would be appreciated by readers.

National service is a good idea
\
In Larry Turner's excellent guest viewpoint (Register-Guard, Nov. 30), he stated that ""to be fair, we should have a draft to which the rich, the poor and the middle class are all vulnerable.""
\
As a person who hopes that sometime soon humans will have evolved to the point that there will no longer be any wars, it may sound strange to say that I agree with Turner's statement. It is very important that a country have sufficient armies with which to protect itself. A draft that all young adults are subject to might cause the leaders of our country to be less inclined to send our sons and daughters to fight.
\
Another bonus for this is that the training our young people would receive would bring about maturity and a better understanding of what is important in their lives. It could also help prepare them in their chosen careers.
\
Recently, a letter was published from Bruce H. Anderson advocating national service (Register-Guard, Dec. 2). I agree wholeheartedly with his suggestions of alternative service to the country for those who do not want to serve in a war zone.
\
He did omit one very important branch of the military in which people serve with a commitment to save lives instead of destroying them. That is the United States Coast Guard.

The federal Highway Trust Fund could go broke as early as August, with potentially devastating effects on the nation's roads, bridges, mass transit systems and the economy as a whole.
\
Oregonians have reason for particular concern. A recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts ranked Oregon among the states most dependent on the Highway Trust Fund, with federal funding comprising between 35 and 40 percent of the state's overall highway and transit spending. State transportation officials have warned that they will soon have to delay or cancel projects if Congress doesn't replenish the fund, a decades-old source of revenue fed by a federal fuels tax that has been stuck at 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline for more than a decade.
\
So far, congressional efforts to solve the transportation funding problem have been underwhelming.
\
House Republican leaders have proposed a one-year trust fund fix, which would put off the need to come up with a more lasting solution until after the November election. The kick-the-can-down-the-road strategy is bad enough, but the proposed funding source is worse. GOP lawmakers want to pay for the $15-billion plan by ending U.S. Postal Service Saturday delivery, and it would take a full decade of savings to pay for just the one year of proposed highway spending.
\
In the Senate, the Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a bill that would provide $265 billion for transportation spending over the next six years. That's a more realistic time frame, but the bill's sponsors have to figure out how to pay for the measure.
\
And last month the Obama administration proposed a four-year, $302-billion transportation bill that would bolster highway funding by, among other things, allowing states to collect tolls on interstate highways. The White House proposal, which has gained no traction on Capitol Hill, also relies on funding from a series of corporate tax reforms, most of them one-time revenue streams that are unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled House.
\
Earlier this week, Rep. Peter DeFazio proposed an intriguing alternative - the kind of out-of-the-box proposal that has become the Oregon Democrat's signature - that he says could end the deadlock: Repeal the federal gas tax, and enact a per-barrel levy on oil companies in its place. In essence, DeFazio wants to replace the highly visible sales tax on gas with a more hidden consumption tax - most of which, but perhaps not all, would be passed on to consumers.
\
Under DeFazio's proposal, the federal per-barrel oil tax would be initially set at $6.75 and would be indexed to increase every year to account for inflation and improvements in vehicle mileage. (The diesel fee, paid primarily by truckers, would be increased by a similar amount.)
\
DeFazio, the senior Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, says the move to a barrel tax would produce a steady increase in transportation funding, although he says it would be less visible to consumers than the current broad swings in gas prices caused by seasonable variations, supply issues and other factors. He says the fee would not apply to oil used for non-highway uses, such as for home heating, manufacturing, agriculture and aviation.
\
Meanwhile, another House Democrat from Oregon, Earl Blumenauer, has proposed nearly doubling the gas taxover three years and indexing it to inflation, a move that would raise roughly $170 billion over the next 10 years. While an increase of that magnitude is a political non-starter in the Republican-controlled House, lawmakers should reflect that if Congress had indexed the tax in 1993, the current crisis would have been averted.
\
Time is running out for the Highway Trust Fund, and no funding idea should be off the table. The nation needs a smart transportation policy that puts the trust fund on sound long-term financial footing.
"
160,"KITZHABER SHARES HIS PRIORITIES FOR HIS FINAL THREE YEARS IN OFFICE. \Gov. John Kitzhaber is animated, talking rapidly. Sitting in his second-floor Capitol suite, he's discussing his true love - public policy - and his vision for the upcoming year. \There are three years to go in his final term, yet Kitzhaber knows he has just this year to lay the groundwork for his 11th and final legislative session. It will be his last big chance to shape his legacy and Oregon's future. \The father of the Oregon Health Plan wants to take one more stab at extending health coverage to the uninsured. He wants to end squabbles over unstable school funding and protect students from an economic downturn. \He wants to expand roads and fiber-optic Internet lines to revitalize rural Oregon. He wants to change what he sees as Oregonians' complacency about the deteriorating environment and public life. \The governor appears unenthusiastic about the idea of running for U.S. Senate against Gordon Smith after leaving Mahonia Hall. He grows defensive when talk turns to his failure to achieve tax reform. \Better to discuss defending the Oregon Health Plan, saving an increase in the gas tax, helping injured workers. Then he grows eloquent and passionate. \Kitzhaber probably knows the workings of the Legislature better than any governor this century, says Chet Orloff, executive director of the Oregon Historical Society. \As Senate president in tandem with ex-House Speaker Vera Katz, Kitzhaber provided the best legislative leadership of the last half-century, says Floyd McKay, former Salem newsman, governor's aide, historian and now Western Washington University journalism professor. \Yet Kitzhaber has battled with a Republican-controlled House and Senate his entire tenure as governor. He's deftly pushed through a short list of priorities each session as governor. Still, he's not matched his crowning achievement during four sessions as Senate president: the Oregon Health Plan. \He probably wishes he worked more aggressively to aid Democratic candidates, McKay says. ""It's sort of not John's nature to do that, and he lived with the result."" \But Kitzhaber says he'll spend far more time on the campaign trail this year, both for Democrats and for his two education initiatives. At the least, he hopes to help Democrats win back control of the Senate. \""I'm going to put in whatever it takes,"" Kitzhaber promises. \He and his wife, Sharon, recently appeared alongside Rep. Ryan Deckert, D-Beaverton, when he announced he'll take on incumbent Sen. Eileen Qutub, R-Beaverton. \The governor also promises to be ""very involved"" in helping former state manager George Bell win back a Salem House seat for the Democrats. Kitzhaber also will aid Rep. Terry Thompson, D-Newport, who is mounting a Senate bid. \How strong his legacy? \Republicans say Kitzhaber needs to become more of a team player with them. \All too often Republicans thought they were working out agreements with Kitzhaber when he turned around and vetoed their bills, says House Majority Leader Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. \Senate Majority Leader Gene Derfler, R-Salem, complains it was too hard to find common ground with the governor, even when there were shared goals. He cites failed efforts to lower government pension expenses and provide school boards more teeth to rein in teacher salary demands. \Orloff thinks Kitzhaber will rank alongside governors Mark Hatfield and Neil Goldschmidt as effective governors. But he won't be up there with giants Tom McCall and Oswald West unless he can pull off something as significant as tax reform for schools. \Kitzhaber bristles at criticism that he failed to restructure Oregon's maligned tax structure or win enough money for schools. \""There's absolutely no indication on my part that people, that this state, with such a great economy and such a low unemployment rate, is interested in raising additional resources,"" he says. Plus, he questions whether it's been clearly demonstrated how much money schools need. \Kitzhaber's school initiatives are underwhelming to many critics and allies alike. Yet he assures they are what is needed and what can be achieved now. \His measures would create a rainy-day fund for schools in the event of a recession, to avert cuts. Property-poor school districts could get matching aid from the state if they voted for new local-option property taxes. And the Legislature would be required to address the cost of funding Oregon's school reform when framing the school budget. \Kitzhaber places great stock in refining the work of a task force led by Rep. Lynn Lundquist, R-Powell Butte, which charted what it costs to provide quality schools. \That will help lay the groundwork for the Legislature to have a meaningful debate on the true cost of schools, Kitzhaber says, rather than a political debate around a dollar figure picked to avert teacher layoffs. \Aside from his own school initiatives, Kitzhaber will stump this year against a tax-cutting measure by Bill Sizemore, and a proposal to end video poker. \Short list for Legislature \If Kitzhaber failed to forge a partnership with GOP leaders, it may be because he was adept enough to push through pet projects that didn't need heavy lifting from Republicans. \Kitzhaber makes it his habit to enter legislative sessions with a short list of top priorities. Last year's list contained what he terms his top achievements for 1999: a juvenile crime prevention package, a ""livability initiative"" for aiding hard-hit timber towns, a spending hike and new budgeting model for universities, and a nickel gas-tax hike for transportation. \In each case, he worked on policy changes with affected interest groups and other stakeholders. But he did not bring Republican leaders on board until the policy die was cast. \So what's on his list for 2001? First he cites a renewed push for universal health coverage. ""It's doable. It's out there. And we need to pursue that,"" says the former emergency room doctor. \If voters overturn the nickel gas tax hike this May, he'll try again. ""If the transportation package fails, I will bring another one back myself,"" Kitzhaber says. \Roads and Internet access are vital for the Eastern Oregon economy to catch up with the booming west side, he stresses. \He wants to extend reforms of the Oregon University System launched in 1999. Those forced each campus to compete for students and their tuition dollars. Now Kitzhaber wants to reform the system more, so each campus can become more nimble and respond to changing needs of students and employers. \Kitzhaber wants to keep pushing his Oregon Salmon Plan to help clean up the Willamette River. That relies on setting up watershed councils to bring river users together to clean them up and restore fish habitat. Oregon's pollution is growing faster than its population, Kitzhaber warns, and that simply can't be sustained. But he thinks a new generation of citizens must become activated around the environment for change to occur. \Kitzhaber appears unexcited about taking on Gordon Smith in three years. ""I just haven't ruled it out,"" he says, ""but it's not anything at this point that I have a burning desire to do."" \He talks of volunteering as a primary-care doctor in a clinic one or two days a week to keep his medical skills fresh, and to inform his work in health care policy. \""No matter what I do, no matter what venue, I want to stay involved in two areas, in the development of public policy and in communicating or teaching in some fashion.""

Have voters forgotten GOP's past?
\
Are Americans suffering from amnesia? Have voters forgotten that in just the past decade, Republicans lied to get us into two unwinnable wars, inflicted torture on our adversaries, tried to bully the rest of the world, enacted unfair tax cuts that turned President Clinton's budget surplus into record deficits, enabled an unconscionable transfer of wealth from the middle class to the already rich, turned regulatory agencies over to corporate lobbyists, neglected or refused to enforce environmental laws, presided over the worst financial crash since the Depression, and left the economy in the most dismal shape in 80 years?
\
During the past year and a half, Republicans have confirmed that they are interested only in winning, not in governing. They have voted as a bloc to thwart attempts to rein in reckless financial speculation, provide help to the unemployed, protect the environment and the consumer, and get the economy moving again.
\
They call for austerity only when benefits might go to the middle class or the unemployed, but they fight for more tax breaks for the rich. They propose more of the same failed policies that got us into this mess - only those policies are more extreme this time around.

As a former Republican, I ask please, remember what the GOP has become. For the good of our beloved country, be a patriot and don't vote for Republicans.

Pension times are a'changin'
\
To those who complain about their community-paid pensions, I ask them to remember that the majority of people who pay for them never receive pensions themselves.

More than 80 percent of the privately employed work force in America receives either no pension or a skimpy 401(k)-type plan that, in many cases, is entirely funded by the employee's own contributions.
\
The times they are indeed a'changin'. If past is prologue, public employees increasingly will be the only Americans who can depend on anonymous others to fund their old ages.

Don't be fooled by Robinson
\
Art Robinson is a radical conservative who believes we should dispose of radioactive waste in the foundations of our homes. He supports eliminating government regulation of the oil and gas industry.
\
The facts are clear: Inadequate regulation of deep sea oil rigs led to the devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Robinson wants to let oil companies such as British Petroleum drill for oil wherever they want (including the Oregon Coast) with no regulation.
\
Look at the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and decide if you trust companies to drill for oil off the Oregon Coast without regulations or safety standards. The mining accident in Chile and the toxic chemical spill in Eastern Europe were both the result of inadequate government regulation.
\
Robinson believes public schools are a form of socialism. He says putting children in public schools is ""child abuse."" Some parents are capable of providing excellent home-schooling to their children or paying for expensive private schools; most are not. Our society will not be able to compete without a vibrant public school system.
\
Don't be fooled by Robinson and his out-of-state, special-interest money. Incumbent Congressman Peter DeFazio should not be the target of your anger. The Republicans got us into this mess by starting two expensive wars and deregulating the banks and financial industry, while cutting taxes for the ultra-rich.

I am writing in support of Sean VanGordon, candidate for state House District 12, mostly Springfield. I have talked to VanGordon about his Plan for Oregon (www.plan4oregon.com). He has studied the issues and believes as I do that if we want to change the way things are done in Oregon and the way things are going in Oregon, we have to change the people who are responsible for change.
\
He believes in accountability through establishing a legislative audits division, campaign finance reform and providing caps on state fee increases to prevent them from becoming hidden taxes. He believes in the autonomy of local school boards to set the local curriculum and in requiring teachers' continuing education to be more relevant to teacher evaluation, increased access to tax-free health savings accounts and partnering with state employees to reform the Public Employees Retirement System, health care benefits and salaries.
\
According to Project Vote Smart, our current representative sponsored only one bill in the last legislative session (House Bill 2001, transit and gas tax increase) and did not even vote when the time came. Also, Vote Smart says Terry Beyer refused to tell citizens where she stands on issues addressed in the organization's 2010 Political Courage Test, ""despite repeated requests from Vote Smart, national media and prominent political leaders.""

Ruiz played key role in conversation
\
With interest, I read Paul Conte's Oct. 10 Commentary essay, ""City taking gamble on growth."" I, too, am one of the participants in the Envision Eugene process, and I have a somewhat different view of the value of the process.
\
Conte said that ""this kind of work undoubtedly has some value."" I believe that the Chadwick-style work not only has ""some value"" but is critical to ensuring that the conversation our community has about growth is intelligent, informed, civilized and based on respect for each other's opinions - and yes, based on the ability to ""find common goals and paths to achieve those goals.""
\
Strong credit goes to City Manager Jon Ruiz for understanding that the past 20 years in Eugene have not exactly been a lovefest. Polarized factions have staked out territory, dug in heels, stuck hard to positions, all with no apparent skills or road map for getting beyond that to a healthy discussion and reasonable decisions.
\
The Envision Eugene process has many components - administrative and jurisdictional requirements, elected official responsibilities, staff responsibilities and citizen involvement. This piece - the Chadwick sessions - provides a structure for the citizen involvement process to be productive and meaningful rather than divisive and antagonistic.
\
Through this process, we are building skills that not only enhance the current discussion about accommodating growth, but that build a foundation for tackling future community discussions with civility and respect. The leadership provided by Jon Ruiz in making this possible is a breath of fresh air.

We depend on our highways for commerce and transportation, and we can't fund them.
\
Although Congress passed a Band-aid measure to keep the Highway Trust Fund from failing before the August recess, the measure only delays the crisis until next May. Then we may face, once again, the threat that the federal spigot may be turned off. This has significant implications for our local economy and infrastructure - including the reconstruction of Franklin Boulevard, which is critical to Glenwood's development.
\
We urge Congress to focus on creative and sustainable solutions to highway funding. Cities in Lane County have been working closely with the Oregon legislative delegation on the issue of federal highway funding. The delegation includes representatives from both sides of the political aisle who work collaboratively to ensure that those in Washington, D.C., are well aware of Oregon's needs and priorities. We are grateful for our delegation's tenacity. They understand the importance of highway funding, and that it has implications beyond a smooth ride. The loss of this federal funding would be a loss to our infrastructure, economic health and livability.
\
We know too well how this story plays out - Lane County has been grappling with the loss of federal road funding for years. The Lane County road fund has a structural shortfall of more than $9 million per year because of reductions in Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act payments, which supported county roads. The county's road fund now relies almost solely on a share of money distributed to counties and cities from the State Highway Fund.
\
The only source of funding for our highways - federal, state and local - is a consumption-based tax on fuel. The fuel tax is an idea that originated in Oregon in 1919. While Oregon has regularly, but somewhat infrequently, increased the fuel tax (the last increase was approved by the 2009 Legislature), Congress has not acted since 1993. The 24-cents-per-gallon federal tax imposed then has an inflation-adjusted value of 15 cents today. The gas tax is not cutting it anymore.
\
In addition to not keeping pace with inflation, federal action has made the fuel tax much less effective as a revenue stream for our transportation needs. For very sound reasons, Congress mandated improved fuel efficiency standards. Excessive reliance on imported oil and concern for the polluting effects of gasoline engines justify that we increase the efficiency of our cars and trucks. However, that increase in efficiency does not translate into reduced cost of maintaining the roads, or to more money to build roads to serve a growing population.
\
For example, since Springfield imposed its 3-cents-per-gallon local gas tax in 2003, the annual revenue has declined by more than 2.5 percent, but the city's population and economy continues to grow - and so does the need to preserve existing streets and construct new ones.
\
The failure to adequately support the entire transportation system presents a serious challenge to rebuilding our economy as it struggles to recover from the 2008-09 recession. Adequate transportation is essential to restoring a vibrant and vital economy.
\
We need to recognize the importance of alternative transportation in this conversation. The health benefits of walking and biking, and the efficiency of rail and mass transit, help us better accommodate our population and economy while reducing the need for land for more highways. At the same time, state revenues cannot be used for alternative transportation outside of street rights of way, and federal dollars are limited.
\
Adding to the list of funding needs are expensive and complicated processes that have to be done to fulfill environmental programs. These environmental processes serve the important purpose of assuring that what and how we build meet requirements designed to offset the effects of development on our environment. But these federal mandates come without federal resources, and thus fall on the shoulders of our shrinking local revenues.
\
Rep. Peter DeFazio has offered his Repeal and Replace Act, which would substitute a tax on oil producers for a fuel tax.
\
Though a growing number of users will have vehicles that do not rely on gasoline for fuel, this idea deserves exploration. At the very least, it retains the current connection to road usage and can serve as a bridge to solutions that are even more creative.
\
We recognize that coming up with an alternative that is equitable to all, and can respond to long term needs is a daunting challenge. We're asking our congressional leaders to stay focused on this critical issue. Oregon is ready for creative solutions.

Be skeptical about warming
\
Regarding the climate change debacle, I would just like to remind people of the following:
\
1. Those scientists who supposedly all agree on global warming were convinced 30 years ago that we were heading for another ice age, that three-quarters of the world's population would be dead from starvation and that the Earth could not sustain a human population of more than 4 billion or so. Our water resources were supposed to be tapped out by 1990. Why does anyone listen to these people?
\
2. Anyone - whether scientist, sage or sorcerer - who announces what may happen in the future is engaging in speculation, not science. Any time you see the word ""may"" or ""could,"" remind yourself that you could just as easily replace them with ""may not"" or ""could not."" Ask yourself why those in the environmental movement engage in such fear-mongering. Clearly, one reason is because this is a political battleground between the balance of capitalism, socialism and Marxism that is to be exercised in this country and the rest of the world.
\
3. Anyone who seriously thinks humans can control or regulate global climate systems is severely overestimating our abilities, if not simply insane. Given that 36 percent of Americans think Sept. 11 was an inside job, maybe insanity is the answer.
\
4. Who are the true fascists? The ones who want a vigorous debate, or those who claim ""the debate is over"" and label skeptics as deniers?
\
It is sad to see so many educated men and women engaged in the suppression of knowledge and honest intellectual debate.

Ortiz has vision, leadership
\
The residents of Ward 7 in Eugene have a golden opportunity to ensure effective representation over the next four years by re-electing Councilor Andrea Ortiz.
\
When it comes to the qualities that matter most to me - vision, leadership, independence and timely and effective response to constituent concerns - Ortiz is unsurpassed in her service to those in Ward 7, as well as in the rest of the community. She takes the time to be well-informed on the vast number of issues that come before the council, despite the fact that she holds down a full-time job and volunteers her time elsewhere as well.
\
In addition to her service on the City Council, Ortiz is a former member of the Bethel School Board and has represented the council on the Eugene Police Commission and Eugene Human Rights Commission.
\
Ortiz brings her incredible work ethic and commitment to community to the council. If you add her experience to her hard work and dedicated service, it is apparent that she has earned the privilege of representing Ward 7. Please join me in financially supporting her campaign and in voting for Andrea Ortiz for Ward 7 city councilor.

Jail beds are city problem, too
\
I live in Eugene, and I don't like dodging potholes. I also didn't like it when someone stole my wife's car and tried to break into my house. I would like it even less if they weren't held accountable for their crimes and never spent a day in jail, but that is what this community is faced with.
\
Why are we worried about potholes? The Lane County jail released 84 inmates last month. This month the county will release over 200 more inmates from the corrections system as it closes more beds: drug dealers, thieves, burglars, robbers, assailants, sex offenders and spousal abusers. No holding them to ensure they show up for court. No accountability. No incarceration to deter them from continuing to degrade the quality of life in our neighborhoods. Just more ""fun"" for them, as a burglar who was finally sentenced to 100 months for only a portion of the crimes he committed recently told The Register-Guard.
\
With issues such as these, should our focus be on potholes or quality of life? Is it really a tough decision? We can't afford to bury our heads in the potholes, and we can't allow our elected officials to either.
\
Jail beds aren't just a county problem. It's a city problem too.

Get real on gas-tax holiday
\
Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and John McCain suggest waiving federal taxes on gasoline. At first glance, this sounds like a good idea - a break for the middle class.
\
But the gas-tax holiday would, over the course of the summer, put less than $30 in our pockets. The way things are going, the oil companies' greed will put the price of gas much higher than that.
\
Just the other day, OPEC President Chakib Khelil predicted that crude oil prices soon will rise another 75 percent, to $200 a barrel. This is not peak oil or a lack of refining capacity; according to OPEC, it's a direct result of the current crisis in the American economy. Whatever the reason, you can bet this price increase will be carried all the way to the gas pump.
\
Clinton and McCain suggest that we need a gas tax holiday while our nation is at war in Iraq, at least in part to secure access to oil. That war seems to get more expensive on a daily basis. Who do you think will be paying for that?
\
The old-style politicians don't get it: for national security (military, economic, environmental) we should be putting some of the billions of dollars we're burning in Iraq toward developing clean, renewable energy. Such an effort would spur American innovation, drive economic growth and reduce the need for a massive military presence overseas.
\
Instead, we have Clinton and McCain suggesting a gas tax holiday. It's downright insulting to our intelligence as citizens.

Ads reveal Piercy's arrogance
\
As I was listening to a Kitty Piercy ad on the radio this morning, I was again reminded of how disingenuous and truly insulting those ads are.
\
I was born in Eugene and always have enjoyed our community's egalitarian attitude. Imagine my surprise to hear that Piercy took government away from the ""elite."" Everyone in this community should wonder who she is talking about. The only person I know to ever refer to the elite was Jim Forbes, past executive director of Looking Glass, who said people who work to curtail our growth have become the elite because they make it prohibitively expensive for many to live in our city.
\
She also says that she gave the government back to the people and exposed the West Eugene Parkway for the boondoggle that it was. Excuse me! A majority of voters asked the city to build the parkway - two times! Piercy was the one who scuttled what the people said they wanted. How is that returning the government to them or showing respect to people who live and vote in Eugene?
\
I hope others are able to see the arrogance and condescension evident in these ads. A person who says she gets many viewpoints together wouldn't categorize some people as elite or refer to projects desired by the majority of her citizens as boondoggles.
\
By her own admission, this mayor is not a mayor for all of Eugene!

Immigration remains unresolved
\
I've notice lately that The Register-Guard and other media have avoided the term ""illegal alien"" and now use the term immigrant when referring to individuals entering or in this country without legal authority.
\
I've also noticed that none of the candidates for president speaks about their stand on illegal immigration and the effect it might have on their proposed national health and education programs. That would make one assume it is not politically correct to call breaking the law illegal, and that the illegal immigration situation in this country has been resolved.
\
However, I am not going to assume either one. Until the law is changed regarding legal entry into this country, entering it otherwise is illegal.And the immigration situation has not been resolved and will continue to affect this country until it has been.
\
Furthermore, this country has failed its citizens by not addressing immigration in a timely manner, and the countries that have their citizens risking everything to come here have failed them by not providing an environment of hope and prosperity in their own country.

Does creator crave anonymity?
\
I liked the May 4 guest viewpoint by Norm Fox, ""Case against intelligent design fails."" I would like to offer another point that I have never heard discussed: the possibility that the creator wants to remain anonymous.
\
Try to imagine yourself as the creator of this vast universe and all of the people in it. If you made it obvious that you existed, then the people would spend most of their energies trying to appease you or be afraid to do what they really want to do for fear of you and your power.
\
They would be praying and asking and begging for special treatment, help or wealth.
\
It would be a lot more fitting to remain anonymous and create the universe in such a manner (evolution) as to allow scientists to think that they have all of the answers. So life can go on with the human mind completely unrestricted.

Piercy doesn't sell Eugene short
\
I sit here on the Knickerbocker Bike Bridge that spans the sometimes-mighty Willamette River. It's an early spring evening. The sun isn't quite setting, but everything is aglow. The river takes a slow, meandering path west. A big grassy meadow sways in the breeze, and even Autzen Stadium seems appropriate here.
\
Eugene is a special place. That's what makes the mayoral race so important. Jim Torrey and the development interests that are throwing record breaking amounts into his campaign don't value this - not as much as they should. Their vision for Eugene is Anywhere, U.S.A., where what's valued most is the ability to turn a quick buck.
\
Kitty Piercy isn't perfect. But she understands that some things shouldn't be put on the open market, and Eugene's one of them.
\
Don't sell Eugene short. Vote for Kitty Piercy.

164,"The state House is the key legislative battleground in Oregon this November.\Democrats, who now hold a 35-25 edge in seats in the House, are hoping to pick up at least one more seat to get the three-fifths majority needed to potentially raise taxes without Republican support. Democrats already hold a three-fifths edge in the state Senate.\House Republicans, meanwhile, are hoping to capitalize on the departure of several Democratic incumbents to reverse their significant losses in 2012 and 2014, when they lost a combined five seats to the Democrats. That would allow them to be a more effective check in 2017 on the Democrats’ hegemony in Salem.\Most of the hotly contested House seats are in the Portland suburbs, but several races in Lane County may be competitive as well.\The Register-Guard asked Lane County candidates about: their top priorities; their positions on Measure 97, the massive corporate tax increase on the November ballot; whether further reforms are needed for the financially struggling Public Employees Retirement System; and how they might plug a projected $1.2 billion budget gap in the Oregon Health Authority’s budget, due largely to the Affordable Care Act.\House District 14\Republican Kathy Lamberg takes on Democrat Julie Fahey in House District 14, the only open seat in Lane County this year.\House District 14 includes portions of west Eugene as well as Junction City. Democrats hold a 13 percent voter registration advantage over Republicans in the district, up from 11 percent in 2012.\Fahey, a human resources consultant, has held leadership positions in the local and state Democratic Party in recent years. Her top priority, if elected, would be to increase funding for the state’s employment-related day care program, which subsidizes child care for low-income families.\She also supports creating a statewide family and emergency leave insurance program, typically funded by a payroll tax on all employees and sometimes employers.\Lamberg, a private teacher of ancient Greek, ran unsuccessfully for the seat in 2014. After losing, she spent time in Salem observing the legislative process. She says that the Legislature has spent years “needlessly punishing our businesses” with new regulations. Her top priority, therefore, is establishing expiration dates on certain regulations, so as to require the Legislature to reauthorize them every few years.\Fahey has raised $159,000 in campaign contributions this year, including $6,000 from a retirement homes’ political action committee, $5,000 from Oregon trial lawyers, and $4,700 from the state’s largest teachers union. Lamberg has pulled in $117,500, including $44,000 from a new political action committee called Restoregon, which is funded by Lane County timber companies Seneca and Murphy and the founders of Entek, an Oregon plastics manufacturing company. She’s also received $7,300 from the House Republican caucus’ PAC.\Fahey and Lamberg disagree on Measure 97 and on future PERS reforms. Fahey said she backs Measure 97 because Oregon “must act now to increase funding for our schools.”\“Our school year is one of the shortest in the country, our high school graduation rate is one of the lowest, and class sizes are too large in too many classrooms,” she said.\Lamberg said she opposes Measure 97 because of its impacts on low-income and fixed-income residents. “Measure 97 will touch everyone and everything, and the people who suffer most are those who can afford to pay the least,” she said.\On PERS, Lamberg said she’s open to reforms to prevent public employees artificially “spiking” their pension benefits by inflating their final salary.\Fahey said she’s only willing to consider PERS reforms that could survive a court challenge or that would significantly reduce the system’s $22 billion unfunded liability. “Many of the proposals being discussed right now either rest on shaky legal ground or will not affect our unfunded liability,” she said.\House District 11\Rep. Phil Barnhart, the Democratic incumbent, faces a well-funded challenger in Republican Joe Potwora in House District 11.\Barnhart has held the House District 11 seat since 2001, although he won re-election narrowly in 2014. Democrats hold a 12-point registration edge in the district, which includes a large part of southeast Eugene, as well as Glenwood, Creswell, Marcola and Brownsville.\Barnhart said his main focus will be a review of existing tax credits and property tax exemptions, with a focus on eliminating or reducing those breaks to provide more money for schools. He said he would also work on more worker-friendly laws, after the successful passage of a minimum wage increase earlier this year, and on policies that assist Oregon-based renewable energy companies.\“Because renewable energy has become so much cheaper than fossil fuels, the transition will support massive local job growth and growth of the Oregon economy while we do our part to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce illness caused by toxic air pollution,” he said.\Potwora, a branch manager at Eugene’s Guild Mortgage, has little political experience other than three years on the city of Eugene’s budget committee. He said he wants to bring “transparency and accountability” to the state Legislature, proposing a mandatory waiting period before lawmakers can vote on any bill. “The pace in which legislation is passed gives no opportunity (to anyone) besides lobbyists and special interests to weigh in,” he said.\Potwora criticized Barnhart for voting with Democrats “99 percent of the time” in recent years, on policies such as the minimum wage increase and the environmental “clean fuels” policy. “Currently, both sides of the aisle rely too heavily on party leadership to make decisions for them,” he said.\Barnhart and Potwora disagree strongly on Measure 97. Barnhart has been a vocal proponent of the ballot measure to fund state services. “The opposition to M97 is almost entirely funded by the big corporations that will pay it,” he said. “If they really thought they could pass along the tax to consumers they would not be opposing it.”\Potwora said he believes Oregon needs “a more stable funding source,” but Measure 97 is poorly designed. “No one really knows the true impact of taxing businesses on their gross (revenues),” as opposed to their profits, he said. “Measure 97 represents ... a 25 percent increase in tax revenue that is not allocated for school, health, senior services or infrastructure.”\Asked about the health authority’s budget hole, Barnhart said that gap emphasizes the need for voters to pass Measure 97.\“If M97 fails, I see no viable options that do not include massive budget cuts in the places we already spend most of our general fund budget: education, health care and senior services,” he said.\Potwora, meanwhile, criticized the health authority for not seeking to cut its costs in anticipation of the reduction in federal funding.\One solution would be “eliminating Oregon (Health Plan) services that aren’t required by federal law,” he said. “We need to realize (that) without the temporary subsidies from D.C., we need to live within a sustainable budget.”\Potwora leads Barnhart in fundraising, having brought in $100,000 to Barnhart’s $60,000. Potwora has received $30,000 from the largely timber-funded Restoregon PAC, $23,000 from the House Republican PAC, and $5,000 from Eugene firm University Printing. Barnhart has received $6,250 from the Service Employees International Union, $3,000 from Oregon trial lawyers and $1,000 from Nike.\House District 9\Democrat Rep. Caddy McKeown and Republican newcomer Teri Grier are facing off in what, by voter registration, is the most competitive legislative district in Lane County.\House District 9 stretches from Coos Bay to Yachats and includes Mapleton, Blachly and Swisshome. Democrats only have a 3 percent edge in registration over Republicans.\Grier, who only made it on to the ballot thanks to a write-in campaign, is a former longtime Arizona political staffer and consultant who now works as a community college career adviser.\She said her top priority would be to stop property taxes being used in urban renewal districts and to restrict the use of the enterprise zone tax breaks.\“Local governments are supporting private businesses with money that could go back to Oregon’s schools and infrastructure, and neither party is talking about turning off this public spigot,” she said.\McKeown, first elected to the Legislature in 2012, said her focus in 2017 would be on passing increases in the gas tax and vehicle fees to pay for transportation projects around the state. McKeown is set to lead a special committee tasked with crafting a funding package.\“The movement of people and goods is essential to the health of our state’s economy,” she said.\Both women oppose Measure 97. Grier said the measure would be like “a sales tax.”\“These economic burdens put on industry diminish the amount of jobs and production industry will provide for the consumer,” she said. “Government needs to cut waste not increase taxes.”\McKeown is more cagey but said she is not “convinced (that) M97, as drafted, is the best vehicle by which we should do comprehensive tax reform.”\On PERS, McKeown said that while she voted for reforms in 2013, the Supreme Court’s ruling “made clear that restricting the benefits that employees have already earned is not the answer.”\“I believe that until the Tier 1 PERS members cycle out of the system, finding new sources of revenue will be imperative,” she said.\Grier supports several changes to PERS that would impact future retirees. She added that she would introduce a bill blocking legislators and judges from being part of PERS because “it is a serious conflict of interest.”\McKeown has raised $227,000 in campaign contributions this election cycle. Those include $10,000 from California-based Motor Vehicle Software, which has a contract with the Oregon DMV, $8,000 from Al Peirce Co., a Coos Bay lumber firm, and $7,000 from Associated General Contractors. Grier has raised $20,000, of which $13,275 has come from the Restoregon PAC.\Guy Rosinbaum is running as the Libertarian candidate for the seat.\House District 12\Democratic incumbent Rep. John Lively faces a quirky Republican challenger in Robert Schwartz in Springfield’s House District 12.\The district has the fewest number of registered voters in Lane County, but Democrats hold a 13 percent edge in registration over Republicans.\Schwartz, a ballroom dance teacher and movement therapist, is a political newcomer and has run an unconventional, “Star Wars”-themed campaign. He made an unpolished campaign video with the help of his young daughter.\Schwartz said his top priority would be bolstering public education funding and broadening schools’ focus beyond standardized testing to include more arts, foreign languages, music and science classes.\He criticized Lively for taking campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer and Eli Lilly, as a member of the House Health Care Committee. Those contributions are inappropriate for a lawmaker potentially charged with trying to regulate the cost of prescription drugs, Schwartz said.\Lively has received $5,500 from pharmaceutical firms this cycle out of the $75,000 he has raised in total. Schwartz has raised $3,000.\Lively is seeking a third term in Salem, after serving as a city councilor and mayor in Springfield. His main focus would be to pass a transportation package that would increase the gas tax and vehicle fees to pay for road and bridge maintenance and to lessen congestion. Lively said he also wants to find a new funding source for mass transit and implement “a road user fee to replace gas tax as the primary source of revenue for transportation infrastructure.”\Lively, who broke with his party to oppose mandatory paid sick leave and a minimum wage increase in recent years, said he opposes Measure 97 because of “the ultimate impact on lower income citizens, many small businesses, health care and other potential consequences.”\But he said that the Legislature needs to look for other ways to increase tax revenue “to invest in our education system,” if Measure 97 fails.\Schwartz also opposes Measure 97. “If there needs to be a ‘sales tax’ it should exclude food, medicine, feminine hygiene products and infant care products,” he said.\House District 7\Rep. Cedric Hayden, Lane County’s only sitting Republican lawmaker, is a heavy favorite to retain his seat in House District 7.\The district, a longtime GOP seat, contains parts of south and east Lane County including Cottage Grove and Oakridge, and much of Douglas County.\Hayden, a dentist and son of a former state lawmaker, said his top priority, if re-elected, is mental health care reform. He wants to stop providing that care in a centralized manner through the Oregon Health Authority, and instead “allow for collaboration of community-based solutions.”\Hayden doesn’t support Measure 97 and said he believes the projected $1.2 billion gap in the Oregon Health Authority’s budget can be filled by finding “areas of inefficiencies and duplication.”\Hayden backs further PERS reforms, but only changes that would impact future retirees. For example, he supports a limit on the final salary amount used to calculate PERS benefits. “I support PERS reform; however, we do have an obligation to our employees that we must uphold,” he said.\Vince Portulano, a former Costco employee, is the Democratic candidate. He wants to create a state bank to help community banks expand their lending practices. He also wants to bolster funding for elective classes in public schools, such as music, arts and metal working classes. Portulano has not mounted a significant campaign, however, and didn’t pay to be included in the official Voters’ Pamphlet.\Fergus Mclean, a market gardener and cedar oil maker, is running as the Independent, Pacific Green, Progressive party candidate. He previously ran for the seat as a Democrat on a primarily pro-environment platform.\Hayden has raised $95,000 in campaign contributions to Portulano’s $2,000. Mclean hasn’t reported any contributions.\House District 8\Rep. Paul Holvey, a Democrat, is seeking re-election to the seat he’s held since 2004 in House District 8, Lane County’s most liberal district by voter registration. Republican Mary Tucker, a political newcomer and a volunteer host at a local marina, is his sole challenger.\House District 8 includes southwest Eugene, Veneta, Noti and Lorane.\Holvey said that his primary focus, if re-elected, would be to pursue additional funding for public education and transportation infrastructure. A leading champion for the recent increase in Oregon’s minimum wage and the implementation of mandatory paid sick leave, Holvey said he again will be working on “challenges families have as a result of workplace and employment policies, and the challenges businesses and consumers have in the regulatory environment.”\Holvey supports Measure 97, saying that while it may not be perfect, “it is a good place to start.”\“The (existing) super-majority requirement for increasing revenues in the Legislature and the no-tax proponents and business organizations have prevented a fair, progressive and meaningful solution for (the) disinvestment” from public schools, law enforcement and human services, he said.\Tucker wants the states to rein in the federal government’s power with a series of constitutional amendments and reclaim federally owned lands. In Oregon, she wants to return to former logging practices in public forests. She is skeptical of environmental laws and doesn’t believe in human-caused global warming.\Tucker opposes Measure 97 because she said, like the minimum wage increase, it will drive businesses out of Oregon.\“Two-thirds of this tax will be passed on to the consumer in higher prices on everything you buy: utilities, groceries, prescriptions, phones, insurance and Medicare,” she said.\Asked about the Health Authority’s budget gap and PERS, Tucker said she doesn’t have enough information to take stances.\Holvey has raised about $70,000 in campaign funds. Tucker has brought in $600. She didn’t pay to be included in the Voters’ Pamphlet.\House District 13\Democratic Rep. Nancy Nathanson is once again being challenged by Republican Laura Cooper in House District 13.\House District 13 covers Eugene’s northwest quadrant. Its voters lean heavily Democratic.\A low-key legislator for much of her decade in the Legislature, Nathanson, if re-elected, is set to assume a more visible role as the co-chairwoman of the state’s powerful budgetary committee.\Her top priority would be to build “a sustainable, balanced budget that addresses critical needs, supports healthy communities, and provides opportunity for education and good jobs,” she said.\Nathanson supports Measure 97, saying the state “needs the revenue that would come” from the measure. But she added that she’s “ready to work with my fellow legislators to listen to concerns of specific business sectors if the measure passes and look toward fine-tuning it to implement a measure that works for Oregon.”\On the health authority’s budget gap, Nathanson said the state needs to work to contain costs, including “aggressive work to contain the rapidly rising cost of prescription drugs.”\“We should avoid taking a step backward from our commitment to transforming health care in Oregon,” she said, referring to the 2014 expansion of eligibility for the Oregon Health Plan, the state’s version of Medicaid.\Cooper declined to answer questions from The Register-Guard, accusing the newspaper of bias.\Christopher Tsekouras is running as the Libertarian Party candidate. (A picture of Tsekouras was not available.)\Nathanson has raised $145,500 in campaign contributions this election cycle. Cooper has raised $1,425.\Follow Saul on Twitter @SaulAHubbard .

""Our generation's challenge is be good stewards ... for the next generation.""\Wyden endorsed Coburn's idea of allowing the park service to team up with private groups to create an endowment solely to generate money to clear the maintenance backlog.\""You just basically had me at hello,"" quipped Wyden, who also suggested that the park service charge international visitors higher entrance fees than U.S. taxpayers.\The park service needs at least $700 million a year just to prevent adding to the to-do maintenance list. Instead, the agency got $444 million in fiscal 2012, Jarvis testified.\Of that, Congress provided $316 million. The remaining $128 million came from entrance and concessionaire fees and other revenue the park service generated on its own, he testified.\Jarvis said he supports alternative funding proposals such as raising the federal gas tax by a penny to maintain park roads and creating an endowment.\But alternate means will go only so far, he said, adding there's no substitute for increasing the budget.\""Congress charged the National Park Service with protecting these special places in perpetuity, and it is the fundamental responsibility of Congress to provide annual appropriations commensurate with the responsibilities it has given us,"" Jarvis said.\Committee members may incorporate some of the alternative funding methods discussed during the hearing into legislation. Some of the ideas also could be debated on the Senate floor in the future.\Contact Raju Chebium at rchebium@gannett.com"
167,"A controversial $343.5 million transportation funding package is dead, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced Thursday morning.\The plan, drafted by a bipartisan, bicameral group of eight lawmakers in secret over the past few weeks, was unveiled Tuesday night and received its first hearing in a Senate committee Wednesday.\It would have raised just over $200 million through an increased gas tax and motor vehicle fees to pay for road and bridge repairs, as well as authorized bonding for new projects and separate tax and fee increases for transit.\At the same time, it would have killed legislation passed earlier in the session that extends Oregon's clean fuels program, replacing it with other carbon-reduction measures.\Republicans had demanded the repeal in exchange for approving the transportation package.\Interest groups criticized both elements of the deal during the contentious, 3.5-hour public hearing.\""As yesterday's hearing demonstrated, both transportation and greenhouse gas emissions reductions are important and complicated policy questions that deserve adequate and focused attention,"" Brown said in a statement. ""We worked hard to find a way to address them as a package, but no solution emerged that accomplished that to the satisfaction of all parties.""\In particular, environment groups questioned the projected carbon emission reductions contained in the new proposal.\A huge blow to the proposal came during the hearing when Matt Garrett, director of the Oregon Department of Transportation, said his staff had overestimated the greenhouse gas reduction potential of the transportation improvements.\That may have strengthened the resolve of House Democrats opposed to the deal, 19 of whom sent a letter to the governor last week stating they wouldn't support a repeal of the clean fuels law.\House Republicans supported the deal, said House Republican Leader Mike McLane, R-Powell Butte.\""Unfortunately, with today's decision to kill the transportation package, Democrats have left Oregonians with a hidden gas tax and no infrastructure improvements,"" McLane said.\In a statement, Sen. President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, said he ended the talks and said he does not expect the legislature to consider a transportation package this session.\""The votes just aren't there,"" Courtney said. ""We're out of time in this session, but the Senate won't give up. Bridges still need to be fixed. Highways still need to be repaved. Culverts still need to be replaced. Buses need to run.""\The Legislature faces a constitutional deadline of July 11 to complete its work this session.\Environment and health groups praised the decision to kill the legislation.\""Oregonians deserve clean air and safe roads. To pit one against the other is a false choice and helps no one,"" said Andrea Durbin, executive director of the Oregon Environmental Council.\""Big oil tried to rewrite the clean fuels program in a 'my way or the highway' gambit,"" said Doug Moore, executive director of the Oregon League of Conservation Voters. ""In so doing, Big oil killed the chance for a transportation package this session.""\The Western States Petroleum Association wrote the framework for the clean fuels replacement proposal. Brown signed the clean fuels bill into law in March, and it stands for now.\But opponents are attacking on another front, filing suit in federal court to block the state from implementing it.\The Western States Petroleum Association filed one lawsuit. The American Trucking Association, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the Consumer Energy Alliance filed another.\Meanwhile, the Association of Oregon Counties said it will keep working with legislators to develop a transportation funding plan.\The 2014 AOC study showed that counties need an additional $505 million in funding each year just to maintain their road systems.\""It's unfortunate that disagreements on carbon reduction got in the way of much-needed transportation infrastructure funding,"" said Mike McArthur, AOC executive director."
168,"Financial information website MoneyRates released two lists this week, ranking the top ten best and worst states in which to make a living in 2013.\This is the third consecutive year MoneyRates has released these lists, based on an analysis of unemployment data, cost-of-living indexes and well-being rates, among other factors.\And for this year, Washington has topped the list as the absolute best place in which to make a living.\What about neighbor Oregon? It comes in closer to the bottom at number 33.\So what's the deal? What does Washington have that Oregon just doesn't?\The Statesman Journal dug a little deeper into MoneyRates's analysis to find out.\Unemployment and average wages\One factor MoneyRates considered was unemployment and wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau releases unemployment data, which is frequently cited as a key economic indicator, on a monthly basis, the latest of which comes from February.\According to the Bureau, Washington's unemployment rate in February 2013 was 7.5 percent of the total labor force.\In Oregon, unemployment is a little more common, with the recent rate being 8.4 percent.\So Washington has more people employed. Do they make more money than Oregonians?\Turns out, they likely do. The average hourly rate in Washington at $24.59 per hour was almost three dollars more than in Oregon.\And for an annual salary, Washington residents average $51,150 per year, while neighbor Oregon only has an average salary of $45,250.\Cost of living\The cost of living index comes from the Council for Community and Economic Research, whose annual index is recognized by a number of federal agencies, including the U.S. Census Bureau.\The index is a figure calculated from a subset of other indexes, including cost of groceries, housing, utilities, transportation and health.\The figures for Washington's index for the fourth quarter of 2012 are as follows:\- Grocery index, 102\- Housing index, 103\- Utilities index, 89.6\- Transportation index, 106.1\- Health index, 112.9\- Total index, 102.5\While a state with lower unemployment and higher wages is more desirable, in this instance, the lower the cost of living, the better.\Oregon's figures are as follows:\- Grocery index, 98.8\- Housing index, 116.9\- Utilities index, 98.2\- Transportation index, 112.8\- Health index, 114.8\- Total index, 107\While Washington's scores appear consistent across categories, in Oregon, improvements in some areas seem to come at the expense of others. Unfortunately, the overall score in Washington is still better than neighbor state Oregon -- and in some categories, such as housing, dramatically so.\Taxes, taxes and more taxes\The Statesman Journal has previously reported on Oregon's tax structure and its particular reliance on income taxes. In overall comparisons, despite having a sales tax that Oregonians don't, Washington residents still get better breaks -- that is, except on ""vice"" taxes such as cigarettes.\The following figures are from Tax-Rates.org.\Washington's tax rates are as follows:\- Sales tax, 6.5 percent\- No income tax\- No corporate income tax\- Average property tax, 0.92 percent\- Gas tax, $0.375 cents per gallon\- Cigarettes, $3.03 per pack\- Liquor, $26.7 per gallon\Meanwhile, in Oregon:\- No sales tax\- Income tax, 8.56 percent\- Corporate income tax, 7.1 percent\- Average property tax, 0.87 percent\- Gas tax, $0.30 cents per gallon\- Cigarettes, $1.18 per pack\- Liquor, $23.3 per gallon\Health, work, and overall well-being\MoneyRates also took into account the results of a poll co-produced by Gallup and Healthways. The annual report examines poll results from citizens in each state based on their answers to questions regarding their emotional and physical health, healthy behavior and personal evaluation of their own quality of life.\Overall, both Washington and Oregon came up with very similar scores among each index in 2012 -- but Washington still scored just a few percentage points higher.\Washington's scores on the well-being index:\- Life evaluation, 49.8\- Emotional health, 79.6\- Physical health, 76.9\- Healthy behavior, 66.5\- Work environment, 49.8\- Basic access, 83.4\- Well-being overall, 67.7\Oregon's scores for comparison:\- Life evaluation, 48.9\- Emotional health, 79.7\- Physical health, 75.8\- Healthy behavior, 66.8\- Work environment, 48.6\- Basic access, 82.7\- Well-being overall, 67.1\Additionally, the index identified the top ten areas for well-being at the state and city level, based on the size of the metropolitan area.\Although neither Oregon nor Washington cracked the top ten states for well-being -- which included such states as Montana, Minnesota and Nebraska -- Seattle was among the top ten large communities.\And among the top ten smaller cities for well-being, Medford, Oregon, came in at number eight.\See the entire list ranking the states where best to make a living online at http://www.money-rates.com/research-center/best-states-to-make-a-living/2013-complete-list.htm\ID_Code: J0-130404046"
169,"SALEM - After weeks of grueling negotiations, Gov. Kate Brown and a handful of key state lawmakers have reached a tentative deal on a new, smaller transportation spending package.\The package would collect an estimated $4 billion in new taxes and fees over the next eight years, as opposed to an earlier plan that would have collected $8.2 billion over 10 years.\Gone from the new package is the earmarked funding and local gas tax increases for $1.1 billion in freeway widening projects to ease congestion in Portland. Instead, those projects are likely to require funding by new nonbridge tolls on Interstates 5 and 205.\The package also includes a smaller increase in the state gas tax, 10 cents over the next eight years, and a reduction in the proposed tax on new car sales to 0.5 percent.\Other elements - such as a statewide employee-paid payroll tax to fund mass transit, a $15 tax on certain bike purchases, and tiered vehicle registration and title fees - remain intact.\Crucially, Brown hammered out a compromise in recent days between key Republican lawmakers and environmental advocates over changes to Oregon’s low-carbon - or “clean” - fuels standard.\That issue torpedoed a proposed transportation package in 2015 and threatened to do so again this year.\But lengthy negotiations between Brown’s staff, GOP Rep. Cliff Bentz of Ontario and environmental advocates resulted in a breakthrough.\Under that agreement, Republicans will get most of the changes they asked for to control the program’s potential impact on consumer gas prices. Environmentalists, meanwhile, secured a new $12 million-a-year rebate program to subsidize Oregonians’ purchase of new electric or hybrid vehicles.\“We have, at this point, agreement on the sticking points,” Brown said Wednesday at a press conference, referring to the fight over clean fuels.\“There is consensus among the stakeholders,” she added.\The full bill is expected to be released later this week, but The Register-Guard obtained a copy of the framework Wednesday.\The high-level deal still faces hurdles, however.\It has been negotiated by a small group of top Democratic and Republican lawmakers and the governor’s staff, with tweaks still being made as late as Wednesday afternoon. The package could face opposition once it is widely released to rank-and-file lawmakers.\Majority Democrats want a significant number of Republican lawmakers to vote “yes” on the transportation funding package, much more than the minimum required of one GOP legislator in each chamber.\That stance is designed to make it more difficult for outside interest groups to refer the package to the ballot. But it could be difficult to achieve in the final days of session.\Several key lawmakers who have been crafting the package declined to comment Wednesday.\Under the tentative framework, the state would increase its gas tax in 2018 by 4 cents, to 34 cents per gallon, followed by further 2-cent increases every two years.\Coupled with vehicle fee and weigh-mile increases, that would initially give the state Department of Transportation and city and county governments roughly an extra $200 million a year for highway and road maintenance work.\The package’s other main feature is the new payroll tax of 0.1 percent on all employees to help support mass transit throughout the state. That would raise $107 million a year, divided among transit agencies.\“I’m very excited about the investment we will be making in public transit,” Brown said Wednesday.\While the exact size of the funding package was in flux Wednesday evening, the compromise on the low-carbon fuel standard appeared to be on solid ground.\The clean fuels program, which began to phase in in 2016, requires companies that bring fuel for sale into Oregon to steadily reduce their product’s carbon emissions by 2025. They can do so either by blending cleaner alternative fuels into their fuel or by giving cash subsidies to other carbon-reduction efforts, such as low-carbon fuels or electric vehicles.\The new negotiated deal would put into state law a dollar cap on the size of the potential subsidy for alternative-fuel producers - equivalent to about $500 million annually.\Republicans have wanted that hard cap written into state law, while environmentalists preferred it be in the state Department of Environmental Quality’s administrative rules only.\The cap, like the one in place in California, would mean the clean fuels program would add 23 cents to the cost of a gallon of gas in Oregon by 2025, according to DEQ estimates.\The compromise also would create a new way for the clean fuels program’s requirements to be frozen if there are shortages of traditional gas or alternative fuels - another Republican demand.\Brad Reed, a spokesman for environmental advocacy group Renew Oregon, said that, while “a legislative fix didn’t seem necessary,” the agreed-to changes “seem like they are clarifying and codifying” the program, rather than undermining it.\“The changes still uphold the core integrity of the program,” he said.\And putting to bed longstanding legislative fights about the program “will give clean fuels businesses the certainty they need so they can start investing here,” Reed added.\As part of the new transportation deal, more than half of the new tax on new car sales would be dedicated to rebates for electric vehicles.\The $12 million-a-year rebate program will provide $2,500 subsidies for people buying new electric vehicles and $1,500 for people buying new hybrid vehicles. That’s enough subsidy for 5,000 to 6,000 vehicle purchases annually.\Ten percent of the rebate funds would have to go to low-income people or Oregonians living in high-pollution areas.\Reed said that, on balance, the new transportation package includes many environment-friendly elements.\“Strong transit funding, new bike and pedestrian facilities, and (electric vehicle) rebates. We need all of those things,” he said."

Home is first of its kind
\
We talked to reporter Andrea Damewood of The Register-Guard by phone on June 4 about the treatment home on Myers Road. Our comments were taken out of context, as a sound bite, giving the reader a much different view than was intended.
\
In attempting to add sensationalism, the newspaper has misled its readers about our side of the issue. The paper has discredited us and made us look bigoted to the community. We have persons who are both mentally and physically handicapped, and persons with mental illness, in our personal lives.
\
We do what we can to support and help them. The issue is a treatment home for the unstable mentally ill with criminal records - too unstable to go to trial - to be allowed to walk about our neighborhood unsupervised. This home is a first of its kind, an experiment. Damewood reported this important point incorrectly.
\
We are greatly disappointed with the slanderous way the newspaper has handled our side of this issue. After talking with Damewood and Senior Editor Christian Wihtol of The Register-Guard on June 8 and June 9, a correction in the June 9 paper on A2 about Phil's misquote was so small that I didn't even notice it.
\
The state, county and Shangri-La Corp. have brought this issue upon us, not vice versa. According to the June 7 Register-Guard story, our city councilor thought that city law should support the residents. We appreciate the Cal Young Neighborhood Association for its support.

Make a market like Pike Place
\
In response to Richard Young's June 7 letter, ""Check out the Pearl District,"" I couldn't agree more.
\
A few years back someone suggested placing a year-round farmers' market in the area across from the library, and I thought it was brilliant - but only if parking were addressed as well. Imagine if we tried to replicate something similar to the Pike Place Market in Seattle. It could be open-aired but covered, climate-controlled (to a point), and would help support local farmers, crafts, eateries, etc. It could be an eclectic representation of Eugene and, if done properly, a tourist attraction like Pike Place.
\
It would help blend in or mask the questionable characters that pander and hang out in front of the library and give people a mid-week destination to pick up fresh produce, meet friends for lunch or just kill some time. And to maximize space, office or retail space could be put above it. And of course on weekends it would probably be successful because the traditional Saturday Market would now be located there as well.
\
And I also suggest taking the indecisive City Council out of the mix and let the citizens of Eugene vote on what goes there.

Phone-heads have no time
\
It is disheartening to me to see a parent walking with a child while chattering on a cell phone. I was born during World War II, so the telephone has been a distraction all my life. But a walk with my mother or father was a time when I had their undivided attention and we could talk at length.
\
The saying used to be: On my deathbed, will I wish I had spent more time at the office? Suggested revision: Will I wish I had spent more time on the phone?

Wyden disappoints on health care
\
Sen. Ron Wyden's efforts during this current health care debate have been disappointing, to say the least.
\
While sitting on the Senate Finance Committee, he and Chairman Max Baucus excluded any advocates for a single payer system from testifying before the committee. Saying that single payer was ""off the table,"" Wyden has gone from talking about universal health care to affordable health care. In this current recession, thousands of Oregonians are losing their jobs, and thus their health care. I wonder how much he thinks an out-of-work family man can afford.
\
So far the Senate Finance Committee hasn't proposed even a government sponsored health care plan to compete with the private insurance companies. The committee's big cost saving idea is to tax the health care benefits of those people lucky enough to get health insurance through their employer. Yet many workers forgo pay raises just to keep their health care coverage.
\
Senator Wyden seems more concerned with preserving the health insurance industry's obscene profits (the average income of a health insurance CEO is $14 million a year) than he is with finding fair and equitable solutions to this health care mess.

Let's help our neighbors first
\
Here in Lane County, unemployment is at an all-time high, criminals don't spend a day in jail and there are thousands of families that don't have any health care.
\
Yet we, as a community, rally to the aid of a man, Alan Jackson, who can't lock his own bike while on a cross country trek with his family and (not surprisingly) gets it stolen (Register-Guard, June 11).
\
Perhaps we don't want him to know what Eugene is all about: criminals running loose and property crimes through the roof. Maybe those who donated should consider putting their money into their community rather than enabling someone who hangs himself out there to become a victim.

Godless nations look pretty good
\
Religious leaders warn us that without faith humankind would plunge into darkness and despair. This assertion is true as long as you disregard everything former Duck Dr. Phil Zuckerman has documented in excruciating detail in his book ""Society Without God."" He claims that the planet's most irreligious democracies ""have been able to create the most civil, just, safe, equitable, humane, and prosperous societies."" That's liberal code for tree-hugging, gay-loving dope-smokers.
\
Zuckerman uses lots of fancy-pants facts and statistics to confuse readers. According to Zuckerman, irreligious democracies score highest in categories such as life expectancy, economic competitiveness and rate of college and university enrollment. In the same categories, nearly all of the top 20 are nations with ""weak religion."" In the categories of lowest infant mortality, gross domestic product per capita, economic equality, environmental protection, aid to poor nations, establishment of social justice and quality of life, it is again the most irreligious nations which make up most of the top 20. Not surprisingly, Zuckerman cherry-picked liberally biased categories and conveniently left out vital categories which America dominates like rich bankers per capita and rate of weekly church attendance.
\
Stand your ground against tofu-eating, progressive evidence-based thinkers like Zuckerman. Let the invisible hand of the free-market work. Other than less violence, less poverty, health care for everyone, better public schools, better wages, better benefits, better government and a cleaner environment, you never know what America would look like without religion and unfettered capitalism.

Sure saved a lot on gasoline
\
After exactly one month, I drove my truck to the gas station to fill the tank. Because I record the cost per gallon whenever I fill it, I noticed that in one month the price per gallon at the station where I always buy my gas had risen 34 cents per gallon. I bought 14 gallons, which means I gave an additional $4.76 to the oil companies.
\
Now, if Springfield (or Eugene, for that matter) had passed the 2 cents per gallon gas tax to fix our aging roads, it would have cost me only 28 cents more.
\
So I figured that a person who drove 20,000 miles per year with a car that gets 20 miles per gallon would use 1,000 gallons of gas, and the 2-cent gas tax would cost a whopping $20 per year to get the roads fixed. That tax would also be paid by visitors to the Eugene-Springfield area who buy gas.
\
I'm sure glad that gas tax was defeated so I can now give that $20 to the oil companies after about four tanks of gas.

COLLEGE COSTS: Paying for college and university tuition will get plenty of attention. The governor wants to raise taxes on corporations to expand the Opportunity Grant financial aid program, which is running out of money because of high demand. Also, lawmakers plan to investigate recent losses in the state college savings plan in funds intended to be safely invested in low-risk bonds and equities. The new treasurer has proposed prepaid tuition as an alternative.
\
EDUCATION: Although the governor's budget would modestly increase appropriations to public schools from $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion for the biennium, boards and administrators say it's not enough to maintain current offerings. Head Start would expand to 700 more eligible 3- and 4-year-olds.
\
GREEN ENERGY: Lawmakers will debate whether to increase a business energy tax credit from 35 percent to half the cost of industrial-scale investment in energy efficiency. The governor also wants to combat global warming by joining a regional effort to establish a ""cap and trade"" system limiting carbon emissions and allowing polluters to buy and sell carbon credits.
\
HEALTH CARE: A legislatively created task force has recommended Oregon take another step toward universal health care coverage by extending medical insurance to 80,000 children and at 75,000 low-income adults. The governor wants health care providers and insurers to pay for much of this expansion through higher taxes.
\
LAND USE: The Legislature-created ""Big Look Task Force"" has recommended that lawmakers change Oregon's statewide planning system by increasing flexibility for local governments to avoid what it calls a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to protecting farm and forest lands.
\
PUBLIC SAFETY: Lawmakers and the governor want to avoid a repeat of the state police layoffs of six years ago and retain the 112 recently added troopers. The governor also has budgeted for half the $120 million cost of the voter-passed Measure 57, which increases sentences for some property crimes and expands drug treatment for those convicted.
\
PUBLIC WORKS: The governor has proposed borrowing $2 billion through bond sales for public works. The money would pay for transportation projects, building construction, and maintenance projects. Local projects include campus improvements at the University of Oregon and beginning construction of a psychiatric hospital and state prison in Junction City.
\
SOCIAL SAFETY NET: The Legislature must decide whether to accept the governor's proposed cuts, which would reduce in-home care for some 6,500 seniors and the disabled, cut child care subsidies for 3,500 families, turn 3,000 people away from community-based mental health and drug treatment programs and eliminate dental and vision benefits for 100,000 poor adults on the Oregon Health Plan.
\
TAXES: Lawmakers will decide what to do about the governor's recommendations before tackling their own ideas. He wants a health care provider tax (4 percent for hospitals and 1.5 percent for insurers), a 2-cent increase on the gas tax, higher vehicle fees, an added 60 cents-per-pack for the cigarette tax and a raise in the corporate minimum tax from $10 to between $25 and $5,000.
\
TRANSPORTATION: The governor's gas tax and vehicle fee increases, if approved by lawmakers, would pump more than $3 billion into roads, bridges and other transportation projects over five years. Lawmakers say they want to go in that direction but haven't settled on the details of the increases.

172,"
Oregon Republicans, hoping to win control of the evenly divided state House of Representatives, smell an opportunity in Springfield, where GOP candidate Joe Pishioneri is battling Democrat John Lively for the District 12 seat held since 1983 by Democrats.
\
It's easy to understand why Republicans have focused their efforts - and money - on Pishioneri. A longtime Lane County sheriff's deputy, Pishioneri is a member of the Springfield City Council and a political moderate whose emphasis on public safety and economic development plays well in a community that puts a high priority on those issues.
\
Election 2012
\
Pishioneri faces a formidable opponent in Lively, who served on the council for four years, and was twice elected mayor. He has been active in two dozen civic and government boards and commissions, ranging from the Springfield Renaissance Development Corp. to the 100% Access Committee of United Way of Lane County. He was named Springfield First Citizen in 1993, and Springfield Distinguished Citizen in 2007.
\
Lively, who works as an account manager for the Cawood advertising and public relations group, has stellar economic development credentials. Since graduating from the University of Oregon in 1974, he has worked as director of facilities and communications for the Hyundai (later Hynix) computer chip plant in west Eugene, senior manager for customer service for the Symantec software company in Springfield, and executive director of the Eugene-Springfield Metro Partnership. He is a founding member and current president of the Lane Regional Workforce Council.
\
Lively's business and economic development experience make him the best choice in this contest to represent District 12.
\
At a time when communities across the state need lawmakers who understand what it takes to create new jobs, Lively brings a lifetime of experience dedicated to precisely that purpose.
\
Lively says one of the state's key responsibilities in hard times is to support local economic-development efforts. One way to do that, he says, is to give local communities greater say over land-use decisions that he says should reflect regional needs.
\
Like Rep. Terry Beyer, who is retiring from the District 12 seat after five terms, Lively understands that maintaining the state's transportation infrastructure is essential to future economic development. That, he says, will require the state to replace its antiquated gas tax with a more reliable means of funding transportation.
\
Lively supports Gov. John Kitzhaber's health care and education overhauls, although he is concerned about how school reforms can move forward without money to pay for them. In the absence of new taxes, which he rules out in a struggling economy, Lively says the state needs to do a better job of collecting taxes, revisiting tax breaks and prioritizing the use of available revenues for schools.
\
Pishioneri's top priority is improving public schools, with an emphasis on providing better options for noncollege-bound students. He says the state needs a more business-friendly regulatory environment that includes an expedited appeals process on land-use decisions. On public safety, Pishioneri cites Springfield's example of reducing property crime, and he wants to find more funding for state police.
\
Pishioneri is an impressive candidate, but Lively is better qualified, and voters should elect him to the District 12 seat in the Nov. 6 election.

Note: The mayoral candidate debate brings up topics of Taser use, city street repair, Civic Stadium and the Hynix plant closure
\
Mayor Kitty Piercy and former Mayor Jim Torrey traded barbs Sunday during a debate that allowed the candidates to ask questions of each other before fielding inquiries from the crowd.
\
About 150 people gathered at Wayne Morse Ranch to hear the Eugene mayoral candidates' take on many of the city's hot-button topics, including the use of Tasers by Eugene police, road repair, business, the future of Civic Stadium and last week's announced closure of the Hynix Semiconductor plant.
\
Torrey went on the offensive during his opening statements, lambasting Piercy for what he said has been 3 years of ""stagnation"" and ""deterioration"" because of a lack of growth in the city, while Piercy chided Torrey for running a ""classic attack campaign"" full of false information.
\
Their hourlong debate went longer than planned after Lane County Commissioner Bobby Green cancelled his appearance to debate challenger Rob Handy, saying his wife had surgery Friday and he was unable to leave her.
\
During the debate, hosted by the Lane County League of Women Voters, the candidates were allowed to ask one question of their opponent - and both Torrey and Piercy posed theirs with loaded words.
\
""Jim, you left a host of problems when you left office,"" including a road repair backlog that rose from a few million dollars to nearly $100 million, Piercy said. ""Why would we want to go back to that?""
\
Torrey elaborated on the good things that he left behind, including a new library downtown and two satellites, an updated park at Skinner Butte and a 3 cent gas tax to help fund road repairs. He then asked Piercy to make public any recommendations made by a volunteer group regarding transportation solutions in West Eugene.
\
""It is important that we understand that endless process is unacceptable,"" he said.
\
The crowd joined in the fray, applauding and even whistling after candidates finished their statements.
\
Some could be heard muttering under their breath when they didn't like what they were hearing.
\
One audience member asked whether Piercy and Torrey felt police policy should be changed regarding the use of Tasers.
\
""There is a place to use Tasers,"" Piercy replied, adding that they should not be used ""to control crowds.""
\
Torrey said people should not give police a weapon and directions to use it and then be angry when the officer then has to use the weapon.
\
""Folks, if we want police protection, we need to stand up with them when they're doing it right, and oppose them when they're doing it wrong,"" Torrey said.
\
The pair sparred over how to handle the future of Civic Stadium, with Torrey calling for the city to use money from the parks and open space budget to negotiate any purchase with the Eugene School District, which owns the historic stadium.
\
Torrey, a member of the school board, said he needed to be ""careful"" about what he says on the topic.
\
Piercy, however, said ""I believe (the Eugene School District) got (Civic) for a dollar - there may be civic responsibility coming back.""
\
Much of the debate centered around various issues regarding the growth of Eugene and sustainability.
\
The entire time she has been mayor, Piercy said, she has worked to make Eugene a place of both environment and business.
\
Eugene has been ranked in a number of national publications for both its green spirit and as a good place to do business, she said, listing the city's recent title as the No. 1 green city in America in the National Geographic's Green Guide, and its spot as the No. 36 best place to do business in Forbes magazine.
\
""It shows we can have a strong economy and a strong environment and we can still be Eugene,"" Piercy said.
\
Torrey, however, said the city could do more to attract businesses and maintain its eco-friendly roots.
\
""We need to look to the east of I-5 and ask ourselves how is it that Springfield can create so many jobs and not ruin their environment?"" Torrey said, saying businesses that are leaving Eugene wind up in Springfield because it's ""easier to do business in Springfield.""
\
Handy, who was unable to talk at the debate because the League of Women Voters does not allow just one candidate to speak, said he was disappointed that Green did not attend.
\
""I'm disappointed, but its the people of my district that are more disappointed,"" Handy said. ""They wanted to hear us speak.""

175,"
Should Gov. Ted Kulongoski have his way, smokers would shell out another 60 cents for a pack of cigarettes, and motorists would pay a bit more for gasoline and a lot more to register their vehicles.
\
Those are the tax hikes Oregonians would surely notice first, and probably gripe about. But the governor's $15.8 billion spending plan calls for other substantial but less direct tax increases - increases that could also trickle down to taxpayers in some form, their critics say.
\
Chief among them are new provider taxes on hospitals and insurance companies, estimated to raise nearly $700 million in the biennium, and a jump in the $10 minimum corporate income tax, based on a sliding scale of between $25 and $5,000, to generate just less than $84 million.
\
""I think at the end of the day, all taxes are eventually paid by taxpayers,"" said Ken Provencher, president and chief executive officer of PacificSource, a Springfield-based insurer.
\
Under Kulongoski's proposal, PacificSource and other insurers would pay a new 1.5 percent tax on premiums - part of a renewal and restructuring of the way the state collects provider taxes.
\
Provencher, who hadn't yet reviewed the details, said he strongly supports the governor's goals. The additional revenue from the provider tax would be earmarked for the Healthy Kids Plan, to provide coverage to more uninsured children, and for an expansion of the Oregon Health Plan.
\
But Provencher said he's concerned about the particulars, including the fact that so-called third-party administrators - organizations that process insurance claims for separate entities, such as employers who self-insure their workers - probably would be exempt.
\
Hospitals, meanwhile, would see their provider tax rise from 0.63 percent to 4 percent. In a statement issued Monday, Andy Davidson, president and CEO of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, warned of unintended consequences.
\
""This financing approach has implications that will ripple through communities across the state at the very time when Oregon's hospitals are facing a severe downturn in their net operating revenue,"" he said, noting that hospital profit margins averaged 3.9 percent in 2007 - ""less than the amount of the proposed hospital tax itself.""
\
He called Kulongoski's assertion that hospitals would recover the tax because fewer patients would come through their doors uninsured ""simply inaccurate,"" in part because Oregon's federal Medicaid reimbursements fall short of the actual treatment costs.
\
Officials at both Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend and McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center referred to the association statement, explaining they hadn't had a chance to assess the potential local impact.
\
The hike in the corporate minimum tax - unchanged since 1931 - would help expand the Oregon Opportunity Grant program, which helps low-income students pay for college.
\
Jay Clemens, president and CEO of Associated Oregon Industries, said his board supports an inflationary adjustment to the tax, but not in the form Kulongoski suggests.
\
""This is probably more than what our board is prepared to accept today,"" he said, noting also that the board stands firmly behind keeping the tax flat, not graduated.
\
""Generally we're sensitive to the needs, and the state obviously is feeling the pinch of the economy right now, and what we've expressed to the governor is an interest in working with him and the Legislature to solve the problems that we need to solve together, and do it in a way that keeps Oregon a competitive business environment that can sustain and create quality jobs.""
\
The proposed tobacco tax would tack on 60 cents to Oregon's $1.12-per-pack tax and increase the wholesale tax on other tobacco products by 25 percent. The estimated $112 million would help fund the Oregon Health Plan, enhance tobacco prevention education and help local communities fund transportation for seniors and disabled people.
\
Michelle Silva, manager of the Cigarettes Cheaper store in Springfield, said she anticipates hearing concerns from customers, many of whom already feel stung by higher costs and increasingly strict regulations on smoking in public places.
\
""People do grumble about it, but smokers are smokers,"" she said. ""They grumble, but they continue to buy cigarettes.""
\
Mark Nelson, a lobbyist for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., said the firm hadn't yet taken a position on the governor's proposal, though he noted Oregon voters just last year roundly defeated a measure to raise the per-pack tax by 84.5 cents. Too much of the existing tax revenue goes toward programs unrelated to tobacco prevention and health issues, he said.
\
In his budget message, Kulongoski also reiterated plans outlined last month calling for a 2-cents-per-gallon gas tax increase and higher vehicle fees: an $81 annual registration fee, up from $27; title fees of $110, up from $55; and a new $100 fee to register vehicles new to Oregon.
\
The proposal would raise more than $1 billion in the next biennium for needed transportation projects, he said.
\
Revenue: $15.98 billion
\
EXPENDITURES: $15.45 billion

\
Stretching Oregon's budget
\
The economic slump is expected to take a big bite out of state revenue. The governor proposes steep cuts in some social services to close the budget gap.
\
Digging deeper for revenue
\
The governor proposes raising funds for health and education programs, and for transportation improvements, through a combination of tax increases.

Note: Some say city leaders first should have lined up funding before investing in design plans
\
The Eugene City Council thought it had hit upon a winning strategy: Involve residents in designing a new City Hall, create plans based on their ideas, then ask themto pay higher property taxes to fund the construction.
\
But after two years and $2 million worth of architectural designs and other planning, the proposal is dead in the water - at least for the near future - a casualty of new city priorities and voter resistance to a bond measure to pay for a new City Hall.
\
In March, the City Council decided not to present voters in November with a City Hall bond measure. Councilors may wait until 2010, 2012 or later before submitting a City Hall money measure to voters.Recently, the council broke into a city piggy bank containingreserves that could be used for a new City Hall. Councilors chose to use some of that money for the more pressing concerns ofpatching potholes and paying for jail beds and other public safety services.
\
The shift has some political observers wonderingwhether, in retrospect, the council was unwise to have spent so much money planning a new City Hall before it secured the money to actually build it.
\
""That's typical of the way our City Council does things,"" said Nick Urhausen, who ran for mayor in the May primary election and placed third behind Jim Torrey and Kitty Piercy.
\
Councilors need to ""convince the citizens that a new City Hallis necessary. Citizens know it's necessary to fill the potholes. They are not convinced that it's necessary to build a new City Hall.""
\
Some wonder if the $2 million in research by architects and consultants will still be usefulin a few years, in the event that voters ultimately approve a City Hall bond measureor city leaders come up with other financing.
\
The delay in seeking money for a new City Hall raises key questions: Should the city renovate or merely maintain the existing City Hall on Eighth Avenue for the foreseeable future? And should the city move forward with building a new, separate home for the police department in order to get it out of the current earthquake-vulnerable City Hall?
\
The planning effort led by Thomas Hacker Architects of Portland drew plenty of public opinion about the existing City Halland what features residents would like to see in a new city government headquarters.
\
But consultants estimatea new City Hall could cost $117 million to $163 million. Finding that money was always the weak spot in the city's plans.And the longer the planning went on, the more that weakness became evident.
\
""Eugene needs a new City Hall,"" said Tim Laue, a construction company executive andformer city councilor. ""But I'm not sure it can afford one the costs over $100 million.""
\
The squat, pillar-supported building houses the police department, municipal court and other offices. Police cars are parked underneath the structure. Officials consider the building too small. Even though it covers an entire city block, it contains 84,000 square feet of offices, which only houses about 20 percent of city employees. The building also leaks energy ""like a sieve"" through its single pane windows and concrete block walls, officials have said, and it has aging heating and cooling systems that are becoming increasingly expensive to replace.
\
But the main worry is that an earthquake could cause the building to collapse, crushing police cars and throttling the department's ability to respond to emergencies.
\
Since 2000, the city has moved employees out of the building to other locations, including moving the downtown fire station to a new building at 13th Avenue and Willamette Street and the police property and forensics unit to a new structure on north Garfield Street.
\
During the same time, the city saved$27 million in a building fund to help pay for a new structure. Yetcouncilors figured they still would need a voter-approved bond measure to pay for a new City Hall. Besides the earthquake concerns, officials have long wanted to consolidate some of the city offices that are scattered in several downtown locations, including some in privately owned buildings.
\
In March, reacting to unfavorable political winds, councilors decided against putting a City Hall bond measure on the November ballot.
\
That decision was influenced by two polls taken for the city last year that showed only four out of 10 voters were likely to support such a measure.
\
Also, last fall voters rejected city ballot measuresto finance downtown improvements and to raise the local gas tax by 3cents a gallon.
\
Some residents were skeptical of the city'splanning, mainly because paying for a new building hinged on the uncertain proposition of a public vote.
\
""They were a little ahead of themselves,"" former City Councilor Scott Meisner said of the current council.
\
But others defend the council's approach, saying that the city had to produce a City Hall plan before asking voters if they would pay for it.
\
Former City Councilor Emily Schue said one could argue that the city overlooked the important question of finding money for City Hall.""But the counterargument to that is that people want to know what you are proposing,"" she said.
\
City officials needed to ask residents, ""?'Do you like this idea? Well, tell me more about what you want,'?"" Schue said. ""If you don't do any planning, then you can't answer those types of questions.""
\
Mike Penwell, Eugene's City Hall project manager,said the polls also showed that residents thought the city should do more to improve downtownand repair streets.
\
He rejects the contention that theplanning effort for a City Hall failedbecause the council delayed submitting a bond measure to voters this fall.
\
The pollingresults, along with the architects' and consultants' space studies, conceptual designs and public opinion on a new City Hall ""all worked hand-in-hand to support the council's decision-making progress,"" he said. ""In the end, we verified what we suspected at the beginning - that a bond measure for a new City Hall will be challenging, but not impossible. We also learned that 2008 is not the right time to try for a bond measure because of the current fiscal environment, and because the community has priorities they want addressed ahead of City Hall, namely street repair and downtown redevelopment.""
\
The money spent on City Hall planning won't be wasted because the research can be used for a new City Hall or for renovating the present building, said Dana Ing Crawford, project manager for Thomas Hacker Architects.
\
""We worked with city divisions to determine what their (space) needs are and will be for 25 years into the future,"" she said. ""That information should be a helpful starting point for future planning.""
\
The public outreach and planning ended in March. It included six well-attended forums, plus focus groups, outreach in parks and other public places, and the two polls.
\
Based on what they heard from residents, consultants produced a conceptual design for a multistory City Hall with a large atrium-style lobby. Architects stopped short of producing blueprints and final cost estimates.
\
Meeting regularly the past two years to discussthe planning, councilors tentatively decided to builda new City Hall on the site of the present building. Councilors also are interested in building a new structure for the patrol division of the police department near West Second Avenue and Garfield Street.
\
The city ""involved a lot of different people in a lot of different areas, and they got a lot of positive ideas out of it,"" said resident Webb Sussman, who participated in most of the forums. ""Regardless of the resource limitations, there are a large number of opportunities for the city to move forward.""
\
Now, city councilors willturn their attention to the possible renovation of City Hall.
\
Recently, the council tapped the building fund to pay for public safety and pothole repairs, lowering the fund's balance from $26.9 million to $22.3 million.
\
Now that the bond measure for a new City Hall has been put on hold, councilors on July 30 are to discuss the fundand what to do about the city's building needs.
\
Council President Chris Pryor said he wants to know how much it would cost to improve City Hall, including making the building more earthquake resistant.
\
But Pryor said he would be reluctant to spend more than $5 million to $10 million on a building that ""may be demolished one day.""
\
Resident Fred Tepfer, who participated in the City Hall forums, said he would not want to see the city put a lot of money into the existing building.
\
The round City Council Chamber is a nice part of the building, but the rest does not work well as functional space and ""it's an energy hog,"" said Tepfer, an architectand project manager for the University of Oregon.
\
Investing a lot of money in City Hall would be like ""putting lipstick on a pig,"" he said. ""And when you put a lot of lipstick on pig, all you have done is thrown away a lot of lipstick.""
"
178,"
SALEM - Environmentalists and like-minded organizations came out Tuesday against the Legislature's transportation funding package, saying it leans too much in favor of building new roads for cars and trucks that emit global-warming pollution.
\
With the proposal set for a House floor vote today, the Oregon Conservation Network issued a statement on behalf of its 48 member groups, calling the proposal ""a blast from the past: a bill full of highway expansions.""
\
The land use watchdog group 1000 Friends of Oregon called for lawmakers to vote down the legislation because it dropped provisions in the original bill that appealed to green-minded groups, including increased money for bike paths, planning criteria to reduce greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, and more spending for transit and train travel.
\
The group's director, Bob Stacey, and supporter Steve Novick held a news conference denouncing the bill. There, Novick used a basketful of props to illustrate his point, removing from the basket a miniature bicycle, a figurine of a polar bear, and a toy train and bus, before holding up the basket to show reporters what remained.
\
""What we have left, my friends, is a basket of asphalt,"" he said.
\
Despite the opposition, the bill's support is expected to meet or exceed the 36-vote supermajority required in the 60-member House. It raises $300 million a year by boosting the gas tax by 6 cents per gallon, and by increasing trucking and vehicle fees.
\
House Speaker Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone, said the bill will be the greenest transportation package ever to come out of the Oregon Legislature. He pointed to increased dollars for transit, bike and pedestrian improvements, carpool projects and a new Urban Trail Fund.
\
""The challenge is, are we measuring against what is true currently, or are we measuring against what might have been,"" he said. ""I measure against what is and we're making huge progress on every front in this package.""
\
About $70 million of the increased revenue would be used to repay $960 million worth of borrowing on the bond market to pay for road projects specified in the bill. Locally, it includes $80 million in improvements on the Belt Line Road interchange with Interstate 5 and $2 million for Belt Line Road and Delta Highway.
\
Novick, a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate last year, said he is concerned as much or more about the bill's ""earmarks"" as its treatment of the environment. By that, he meant that it specified the projects that the borrowed money would pay for. Those projects were chosen from a longer list forwarded by the Oregon Transportation Commission. The same panel last week met to signal its approval of the final list chosen by lawmakers. Novick said that does not alleviate his concern that by deciding itself which projects would get money, the Legislature is politicizing what has always been a policy-driven selection process made by an appointed body.
\
""If this were just a straightforward bill without the earmarks, I would have a much harder time urging people to oppose it because I do think we need some work done on roads,"" he said. ""But the way the package is put together, it stinks to high heavens.""
\
Stacey and Novick underscored their concerns by highlighting the most costly of the 37 projects chosen by the Legislature: $192 million for the first phase of the Newberg Dundee bypass on Highway 99W in Yamhill County.
\
Putting money into the rural highway outside the Portland metro area would contribute to sprawl and global warming emissions, Stacey said, because the expanded traffic capacity would make outlying towns attractive as bedroom communities for commuters who work in the Washington County suburbs of Portland.
\
Environmentalists said that and similar projects weren't likely to have made the cut under the original version of the bill, which directed the state transportation commission to choose projects based in part on their reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
\
While the Oregon Conservation Network is opposed to the bill, many of its individual organizations are taking a more nuanced stance. Among them are the Oregon Environmental Council and Environment Oregon, which do not support the bill, but are not urging lawmakers to vote against it, either.
\
""We are not flat-out opposing it, but we are making legislators aware of the pitfalls,"" said Chris Hagerbaumer, deputy director of the Oregon Environmental Council.

Police advice wasn't helpful
\
In a Jan. 29 letter, Ashley Hughes of Eugene mentioned her ordeal in the Albertson's parking lot where a threatening man was screaming obscenities at her and trying to get her out of her car. She called the Eugene Police Department nonemergency line and was told that the guy had his ""freedom of speech"" even though she felt threatened by his behavior.
\
A week ago, I, too, was harassed by an out-of-control man on the bike path. As soon as I got to a phone I called the EPD nonemergency line and was also told he has his freedom of speech and even though I was harassed, followed, intimidated and in fear of my safety, I was told there was nothing they could do. They actually told me to call back if I got his name. Excuse me? I'll never be back on the path, and if I ever see this guy, the last thing I will do is stop and ask his name.
\
I simply wanted my statement on record, in case there's a pattern of events in that area by the same person.
\
I have always been a supporter of EPD and the efforts they make in the community. They don't always get the credit they deserve. But I have a hard time believing they can be effectively policing our community when there's such a lack of effort on their nonemergency line. I would suggest bypassing the nonemergency line and going directly to 911.

Developers eye smaller towns
\
Lane County is experiencing growing pains, as are many other places in the state. Because of less available land and more restrictions in the Eugene-Springfield area, developers have their sights on the smaller communities of Lane County.
\
They are coming into these communities - especially Cottage Grove, Florence and Veneta - like gangbusters. These smaller cities have more land available for development, inadequate comprehensive plans and overwhelmed planning staffs.
\
Some developers have the attitude that there is no such thing as unbuildable property, but most can do a quality job if held to high standards by the city and its residents. Much of the available land is hillsides, wetlands, forest and farm land. We never miss what we have until it is gone.
\
We can't continue down the same old dead-end road, producing the same old tracts of wall-to-wall houses, more pavement and more motor vehicles. Let's face it, the oil supply is disappearing, fuel costs are rising and so is the cost of goods and services. As these costs rise, we need to plan for a local economy based on mixed-use zoning, small manufacturing businesses, urban farms, community gardens, local transit systems, bike trails and parks.
\
It is vital that the residents of these small communities be involved in the planning process and hold all those involved accountable for the common good and for future generations.
\
A great thinker once said: We can't solve our problems with the same mentality that created them.

Eugene keeps adding new fees
\
Let's look at what our esteemed Eugene City Council has been doing to businesses and local business people in the last couple of years:
\
First, we have the 3-cent-a-gallon gas tax not voted on, then we have the 30-cent-per-month stormwater fee hike that wasn't voted on. Now we find out that the city wants basically a penalty tax on those who sue and win on Measure 37 so they can do what was legal to their own property when they bought it.
\
Come on - if you improve your property, then your property tax rates go up anyway. But that isn't enough for these good liberals. They want to, in essence, fine you on top of it.
\
Finally, we have the $10-per-unit rental tax, also passed without a vote. I found out from some out-of-state landlords who didn't immediately pay the $10 fee because their bill didn't tell them what it was for that they got a $20 finance charge the next month. Isn't that a little steep? At least the payday loan places let you know what they will charge you for interest, and the city can't even do that.
\
Don't forget about adding gas stations to the toxics right-to- know law so the fees could be more equally spread out, again with no vote.
\
Here is a new city slogan: Welcome to Eugene - now open your checkbook!

Eco-saboteurs deserve pardon
\
I am writing to express my opinion concerning the coverage of the 65-count federal indictment against the 11 suspects in the environmental protests.
\
I feel that a pardon by Gov. Ted Kulongoski should be given to the protesters. It may be true that a great deal of damage was caused by the fires, but placing these young people in jail achieves no real purpose except to satisfy some insatiable desire for cruel and unjust revenge. They seem to have been idealistic young people misguided by good intentions.
\
When certain corporations, governmental agencies or privately owned businesses are involved in activities that threaten the environment, citizens should ask themselves who the real terrorists are in this story. Is it the kids who protest these actions, or the CEOs and governmental pencil-pushers who sit behind closed doors in boardrooms and make decisions that cause harm to the global ecosystem?
\
I ask such a question with sincere earnestness. Killing wild mustangs, polluting the environment or profiting from the misuse of responsibilities given by the public trust are far more serious crimes than the acts of nonviolent property destruction participated in by the protesters.
\
Maybe instead of taking the kids to court, the CEOs who have ruined our planet should be wearing those shackles and sitting in those cells.

We're exploiting many animals
\
Our ideas in the Western world about the differences between people and animals are causing great problems. These ideas are hurting millions of animals, people and the Earth, on which we depend for our survival.
\
Animals in the Western world are treated as objects, without feelings, which can be used as humans see fit without regard for their suffering. Chickens live without room to move, their beaks are burnt, their bodies filled with antibiotics and hormones. Then they are butchered or used for egg production until they are too sick to lay eggs anymore. People use these ill-treated animals for food for the other animals.
\
People eat more meats, dairy products and eggs in the United States than any other country. They eat meat containing antibiotics, hormones and other toxins. They eat eggs with little nutrition and lots of hormones, antibiotics and salmonella. This is leading to heart diseases in Americans that are rare in other countries. Lastly, our practices with other animals have hurt the environment. Vast lands have been cleared to grow food for animals. Even rain forest lands are used for cattle grazing, a practice that has harmed areas around rivers and caused massive soil erosion.
\
In short, our treatment of animals has hurt both them and us. We need to re-evaluate our practices and begin a more sustainable way to treat animals. Use substitute sources of protein, such as tofu. By doing these things we are not only saving animals, we are saving ourselves.

Cyclists must be more careful
\
Imagine you're on your way home after a stressful day at work. The traffic is bad; it's raining cats and dogs. You're thinking of what to fix for dinner when suddenly, this Evel Knievel on a bicycle shoots out from a side road right in front of your car.
\
You slam on your brakes, narrowly missing this crazy biker. As you continue your drive home, you wonder what that biker was thinking or whether they were thinking at all.
\
Of course, bikers are not the only ones at fault. We drivers should pay attention while we drive, not just focusing on the other cars around us but also on our surroundings.
\
Every year 40,000 people die in car crashes. Out of that, 1 in 53 were bikers. That's around 754 bikers every year. I find it very frustrating that this is a daily occurrence for many drivers.
\
So I ask bikers to please be mindful of the half-ton car coming toward you at 30 mph and follow the simple rules of the road. The drivers may not see you because of their blind spots until it is too late.
\
The stop signs are not just for the cars. They also apply to pedestrians and bikers. Use common sense and obey the simple rules of the road.
\
So I ask you all, please read this and take it to heart. And please ride and drive safely.

Cost of college a huge problem
\
Higher education is so expensive, some parents are turning to their retirement funds to pay their children's way to college.
\
The cost of college is hindering people's ability to expand their education and learn. For many middle-class Americans, getting enough money for college is a huge problem. Whatever happened to free education?
\
I believe everybody who wants to attend should be able to afford college. Prices of books and fees are outrageous. Statistics show that an average new textbook costs about $52.36, and a used text, $40. Altogether, books and school supplies could cost from $770 to $870 per semester. This still doesn't include the price of tuition and living expenses, which could vary depending on which college you go to.
\
In 1985, the full price of going to an average school was about $32,000. In 2003, the cost was about $100,000. Just over the last 10 years, only 35 percent of high school graduates have gone on to college. If college prices keep increasing, it is going to make going to college much more difficult in the future.
\
I believe that our government should lower the price of college and raise taxes to help pay for it. Maybe if this change takes place, many more people would actually try in high school.
\
We need to prepare for the future and not put our children's dreams on hold.

\
Bettman speaks truth to power
\
Compared to The Register-Guard's fretting over Eugene City Councilor Bonny Bettman, the recent fawning over PR practitioner Jenny Ulum is a good lesson.
\
The Register-Guard editorialized that Bettman is a ""high- maintenance"" councilor - as though her expectation of city staff responsiveness is unrealistic, even somehow bothersome. Yet the newspaper does not fault Ulum's expectation that it will pay attention to any piece of spun public-relations fabric her firm generates. Ulum is uncritically lauded in The Register-Guard for exactly the same kind of intelligence, drive and persistence that Bettman displays in public several times a week, sometimes to the paper's disapproval.
\
Have any recent letter-writers critical of Bettman ever had a conversation with her? She's often stated her policy ""to talk to anyone"" and is listed on government page 66 of our phone directory. Try reaching Ulum to discuss strategy involving Connor-Woolley properties, Whole Foods or Jim Torrey. Would she take your call and care to listen?
\
Beneath the nine men listed atop The Register-Guard editorial page, the paper's mission statement notes that ""A newspaper is a citizen of its community."" The Register-Guard seems to favor those who are highly paid to influence citizens over those who are paid a pittance to serve them.
\
The best thing the newspaper could do for its readers would be to hire Bettman as an investigative reporter or political columnist when her council tenure ends. She speaks truth to power, rather than micromanaging opinions from the powerful.

Where is free speech defense?
\
I've waited for the firestorm regarding The Insurgent to die down for a while now. I've read an opinion by Bill O'Reilly and many from, as it seems, half of Eugene-Springfield.
\
They've been slamming The Insurgent and calling for everything from cessation of funds to the paper to expulsion of the paper's staff. But I've not seen one single person support The Insurgent in any real vein.
\
Why? I can understand that the cartoons offended people; that much has been clearly demonstrated. I fail to understand, however, why people seem to not consider The Insurgent covered by the First Amendment to the Constitution. You know, that thing we like to call freedom of speech.
\
If the cartoons offend you, you have every right to not look at them and even to complain about them, but it is also the right of the staff of The Insurgent to publish them. The day we cease to value our freedom of speech is the day we lose it, don't forget that.

Stop logging in roadless areas
\
Nothing better demonstrates the need to end commercial logging on our public lands than the U.S. Forest Service's recent decision to open up Oregon's last roadless forests to clear-cut logging. This sacrilege proves that unless we keep our national forests completely off limits to taxpayer-subsidized corporate extraction, the timber barons will find a loophole large enough to drive their logging trucks through.
\
Clearly, none of the current protections are enough when the largest unprotected roadless area remaining in Oregon (bordering the Kalmiopsis Wilderness in the Biscuit Fire area) is on the chopping block, and one of the last healthy salmon runs in the Coast Range - Indigo Creek - is threatened with landslides and massive siltation.
\
Gov. Ted Kulongoski has already sent a letter to the Forest Service opposing these roadless area sales - albeit without any media attention. Yet Sen. Ron Wyden (431-0229 in Eugene) and Rep. Peter DeFazio (465-6732 in Eugene) - both of whom claim to be pro- environment - have yet to do the same, despite assurances from their staff that a letter has already been written, just not sent. Meanwhile, it's been two months since that promise and the June auction date of these sales is rapidly approaching.
\
Please urge the supposedly ""green"" Wyden and DeFazio to keep their promise and send out the letter immediately! Also remind them that the only effective way to get any real protection for our public lands is to end the taxpayer-subsidized corporate destruction of our forests!

Castillo's remarks ring hollow
\
On May 31, The Register-Guard ran an advertisement, masquerading as a Mailbag letter, written by Superintendent of Public Instruction Susan Castillo.
\
In her letter, Castillo wrote about working together and ensuring ""that our young people receive the very best in educational opportunities."" She also wrote about our children achieving ""greater academic and social success."" Castillo wrote that more work must be done ""to boost student achievement, increase diploma requirements and prepare more young people for their future.""
\
Castillo's telling us that she supports academia. In reality, however, she is the one person in the entire state of Oregon who has the power to veto the Oregon School Activities Association redistricting proposal, yet she has chosen to sit on the sidelines while the Eugene, Medford and Salem school districts waste hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars fighting this insane proposal.
\
The OSAA redistricting proposal is counter to the goals that Castillo mentions in her letter. Could someone please tell me how driving 170 miles each way to play in a mid-week athletic competition fosters any of the goals that she mentions?
\
I sincerely hope that the people of Eugene don't accept the bone that Castillo has thrown us, but instead read the final sentence of her letter: ""What can we do together, to ensure that we prepare every child for a successful future."" Overturning the OSAA redistricting proposal would show us that Castillo means what she says.

Gas tax hike is best strategy
\
The editorial ""An empty CAFE"" (Register-Guard, May 30) advocates a top-down, supply-based approach to improved vehicle fuel economy. The history of the CAFE (corporate average fuel economy) standard and its loopholes question that strategy.
\
In the 1970s when gas prices soared, demand for small cars was great, with selling prices often above MSRP. Actual fleet fuel economy outpaced the CAFE standards some years. From the mid-1980s until about 2001, fuel prices became increasingly cheaper and vehicle demand swung dramatically to trucks and SUVs, which have a lower CAFE standard.
\
Manufacturers resorted to tricks to help meet fleet averages: through loopholes, the Subaru Outback and Chrysler PT Cruiser are classified as light trucks in order to help their manufacturers meet the CAFE standards. In Europe, where fuel is running at $6 to $7 a gallon, average vehicle economy is about 50 percent greater, the automobile industry is on track to deliver a total reduction in CO2 output, and there is no CAFE or its gas-guzzler penalties.
\
Europe's attitude is: If you can afford to fuel a 9 m.p.g. Ferrari or Hummer, help yourself. Phasing in a federal fuel tax that would raise and keep prices to about $5 a gallon, with the money collected going to renewable energy research and development, would make a much more dramatic difference in average fuel economy and moving us towards energy independence than tweaking the CAFE.

Punishment should fit crime
\
""Juan Lara freed from prison two years early"" reads the headline (Register-Guard, May 31). It should have been ""Another corrupt cop gets off easy.""
\
Meanwhile, a dozen or so people accused of property damage sit in jail or on strict house arrest, facing the rest of their lives in prison because their actions hypothetically might have, could have, would have, harmed somebody. Only they didn't. But people who do deliberately cause harm all too often get off with little punishment, such as Officer Lara.
\
I don't support so-called eco-terrorism, but the sentences they're threatening to give these people are more criminal than anything they're accused of doing. Let the punishment fit the crime. Property crimes are serious, but they don't warrant life sentences.

Court undermined free speech
\
The Supreme Court decided wrong.
\
That is a stout statement but one that must be shouted. The court decided that it is permissible for the government to punish a public employee who attempts to notify his superiors that a law has been broken. Specifically, it allows the government to order employees to tone down internal communication regarding official misconduct and to punish those employees when they fail to meet an unwritten standard of political speech. You may still report misconduct. But if someone does not like how you say it, you can be punished.
\
In other words: If you are surrounded by corruption, don't rock the boat. The high court has set a de facto standard that authorizes official corruption at every level.
\
The court's opinion tells us, incorrectly, that the law is less important than observing the prevailing culture in the workplace, even for district attorneys and cops. We here in Eugene have seen where such an attitude leads, when the culture includes high tolerance for corruption. Weeks ago Federal Magistrate Judge Tom Coffin lambasted the Eugene Police Department for its unforgivable institutional failure to follow up on complaints against Officers Juan Lara and Roger Magana for a litany of misconduct.
\
I find it ironic that Lara should have been released the same day that the court handed down its ill-considered and politically- motivated opinion. We need a new amendment that guarantees free speech. This one is broken.

Money squandered on Iraq war
\
This war in Iraq is costing so very much. I have not heard a single soldier injured or on their way to tour who says this is the wrong thing to do. The bravery to say and do what soldiers must do brings me to tears.
\
How many times does it have to be said that Iraq was not connected to Sept. 11? That there were no weapons of mass destruction? What there was, was oil.
\
We are so deep in debt with the pursuit of this war; I don't see how we can recover in our lifetime. We could have spent that money on education, highways, technology, medical research, land management and conservation. Instead of advancing the evolution of humanity, we have slapped down all our dollars to kill each other.
\
Our country is no longer at the forefront of technological advancement, or advancing the human race, because we are being led by men who exploit fear and promote suffering.

181,"All owners should pay as much as owners of hybrid and electric cars.\Energy-conscious Oregonians should be the first to encourage vehicles that conserve fuel and reduce air pollution.\But the state sends a mixed message by giving a nice tax credit to owners of hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight - then doubling their vehicle-registration fee.\The answer isn't to halve or eliminate the registration fee, as some legislators have suggested. It's to increase the registration fee for all vehicles from $30 to $60 for two years.\Hybrid and electric vehicles have cost $60 to register since Jan. 1, 2002. Legislators raised the fee because hybrids use less gas, meaning they generate less gas tax for road repairs.\The state must find substitutes for the gas tax or it will continue to come up short of money to keep roads safe. Raising the registration fee to $60 for all vehicles is a start.\Oregon's registration fee is the lowest in the nation, as Gov. Ted Kulongoski noted in his State of the State speech. Even a modest increase will help repair or replace critical parts of the state's transportation network.\Hybrids wear down roads just as surely as other vehicles do. They should pay their share of vehicle-registration fees.\State incentives can help alternative-fuel vehicles become commonplace by bringing the cost of hybrid vehicles closer to the cost of gas-powered cars. The existing state tax credit does that, and generously: It provides up to $1,500 off the top of an individual's taxes and even more for businesses.\That benefit - and the glow that comes from doing right by the environment - should be all the encouragement that hybrid owners need."
182,"A bill that would require gas and diesel sold in Oregon to contain less carbon over the next decade had its first hearing in the House Committee on Energy and Environment on Tuesday afternoon.\The debate surrounding Senate Bill 324 had not changed from the discussion that surrounded it in the Senate. Democrats said the program is necessary for Oregon to reduce its creation of greenhouse gases, and Republicans said it will unnecessarily raise gas prices.\Any future increase in prices is hard to pin down, experts said. The increase would likely fall between 4 cents per gallon and 19 cents by 2025, according to the Department of Environmental Quality.\However, the bill contains a provision that would allow the state Environmental Quality Commission to shut down the program if gas prices rise more than 4 percent above the projected annual cost increase in the price of gas and diesel.\Republicans said any increase is unacceptable.\Rep. John Davis, R-Wilsonville, said he supports reducing greenhouse gases and the goals of the bill. However, he said the program is too complicated to be implemented as quickly as it seems to be moving.\""I believe the opponents and the proponents have probably overstated the effects of the bill,"" Davis said, but it's impossible to know at this point as there are too many questions.\Davis said he would rather see gas price increases be used for better purposes, like a gas tax for roads, instead of lining the pockets of private companies.\Davis and Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, both oppose the carbon standard bill, but they are both members of an informal work group assembled to create a transportation package that would raise the gas tax.\The passage of this bill would jeopardize the future of that package, they said. That would be a shame, Davis said, as a transportation package would be better benefit taxpayers.\House Republican Leader Mike McLane has asked Speaker of the House Tina Kotek to halt work on the bill until some of the questions can be answered, but she said Monday she plans to move forward with it as planned.\hhoffman@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6719 or follow at twitter.com/HannahKHoffman"

184,"If Democrats in the Oregon Legislature were confident in their beliefs about what will happen as a result of the state’s clean fuels program, they’d accept Republican demands for protections against the program’s worst potential consequences. Instead, they’re acting as though those consequences will come to pass, and as a result are placing one of the state’s top priorities - a bill to pay for improvements to Oregon’s transportation system - in peril. Such a failure would tarnish the record of the 2017 legislative session.\A bipartisan group of legislators has devised a transportation plan that enjoys wide support in Salem. It’s ambitious, costing $8.2 billion over a 10-year period. It’s comprehensive, addressing urban and rural transportation needs while providing significant assistance for cities and counties. It’s forward-looking, because it extends support for mass transit, bicycle and pedestrian transportation systems and acknowledges the shift to fuel-efficient and electric vehicles. It would enhance Oregon’s economy, environment and quality of life.\And it’s about to stall because of a deadlock over the clean fuels program. The same thing happened in 2015. Instead of serving as an example of how government can get things done in response to a pressing public need, the transportation package is in danger of becoming an example of how partisan and ideological disputes can keep members of both parties from working together for mutual benefit.\The Legislature created the clean fuels program in 2009, and passed a bill to implement the program in 2015. Its goal is to achieve a 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in Oregon by 2025. The reduction will occur by blending low-carbon fuels into gasoline and diesel, or by switching to low- or no-carbon fuel supplies. Fuel suppliers who fall short of the carbon-reduction target will buy credits, and those purchases will subsidize lower-carbon alternatives.\Market forces will determine the price of the credits and the amount of the subsidies. Supporters, mostly Democrats, believe the clean fuels program will encourage the growth of an already-emerging low-carbon fuel industry that will require minimal subsidies. Skeptics, mostly Republicans, maintain that large subsidies will be required, and that these will entail expensive credits whose costs will be passed to consumers. If the credits end up costing $200 apiece, the result would be a 23-cent-per-gallon increase in the price of gas.\The transportation plan calls for gas tax increases eventually totaling 14 cents per gallon. Republicans aren’t willing to support such an increase on top of an open-ended price hike resulting from the clean fuels program. A gas tax for transportation programs can’t pass either the House or Senate without at least one Republican vote. Republicans are demanding that the price of clean-fuels credits be capped at $200 to protect consumers against a combined fuel price increase of more than 37 cents per gallon.\Democrats are resisting such a cap on grounds that it would amount to a retreat on an important piece of environmental legislation. But if they’re right in claiming that a transition to lower-carbon fuels will be relatively easy and inexpensive, the price of credits will remain below the cap - Republicans could get what they want, and the clean fuels program would be unaffected.\A cap, meanwhile, would give Oregonians insurance against the worst-case scenarios offered by opponents of the clean fuels program. California, which is pioneering low-carbon transportation fuel standards, has a $200 cap on the price of credits.\Republicans are also insisting on a provision that would freeze the clean fuel program if fuel shortages develop. Again, supporters of the program say it won’t create shortages, which puts them in the position of resisting protection they believe would never be needed.\Democrats’ refusal to accept a California-style cap threatens to scuttle a transportation plan that has a number of environmental benefits - notably, congestion relief. A vehicle stuck in traffic pollutes the air and contributes to climate change, even if it’s burning low-carbon fuel."

CORRECTIONS (ran 5/10/02): The Web site address for Lane County West Lane District commissioner candidate William ""Bill"" Fleenor was inadvertently omitted from the list of ways to contact him published on Thursday's Communities page. The address is www.williamfleenor.com.
\
Anna Morrison of Florence broke a trend nearly four years ago when she captured the West Lane District seat on the Lane County Board of Commissioners.
\
Previously, most of the commissioners filling that seat had come from the district's east side, where most of the voters live in places such as Junction City, Veneta and the Santa Clara area. Few west-end candidates even sought election in the past, and Morrison was the first person from the Florence area to be elected since Ralph Peterson, who served four-year terms in 1952 and 1956.
\
Now in her re-election bid, two of Morrison's three challengers - Dianne Burch of Florence and William ""Bill"" Fleenor of Mapleton - are also from the district's west end. Bonnie Kuhn from Santa Clara is the only candidate from east of the Coast Range.

Does that mean the vote west of the Highway 126 tunnel named for Petersen might be fractured and put Morrison at a disadvantage?
\
Morrison doesn't think so. In fact, she says she may have a shot at attracting more than 50 percent of the vote, eliminating the possibility of a runoff election in November.
\
""I think my record is good,"" she says, adding that she has done her best to represent all the people of Lane County and not just those in west Lane.
\
With the name familiarity she has developed during her time in office and a sizable coffer of campaign money, Morrison has to be considered the front-runner. Looking back, she says there's nothing she would have done differently during her first term as commissioner.
\
And that includes a private meeting with Eugene Sand & Gravel President Mike Alltucker during the county's deliberations on the company's quest earlier this year to develop a new mining site north of the Santa Clara area.
\
The meeting generated much criticism of Morrison, but she says she talked with people on both sides of the issue trying to get information because she needed to make an informed decision.
\
What she would bring to a new four-year term, she says, is the respect she has earned from policy-makers in a variety of groups and organizations, and a reputation for getting things done.
\
""People trust my abilities,"" she says.
\
But Morrison's opponents say they have attributes that make them a better choice. Burch, a Florence city councilor who ran for the west Lane seat four years ago without making it to the November runoff, says her experience in local government and working as an aide to Commissioner Cindy Weeldreyer and former Commissioner Ellie Dumdi makes her well-suited for a commissioner job.
\
""I have a network, and I understand the system,"" Burch says.
\
She claims to be more of a ""team player"" than Morrison. ""I don't need to be standing out front,"" she says. ""I think (Morrison) likes to take credit for a lot of work other people do.""
\
Kuhn says her main reason for running is to provide some leadership that will instill some badly needed accountability in county government - from the top down.
\
""I don't see where the incumbent right now is doing anything about that or even thinks that's an issue,"" she says.
\
She acknowledges that she has limited experience in local government but says her background as an internal auditor for PacificSource Health Plans gives her the know-how to help the county run more efficiently and find some innovative new revenue sources.
\
Kuhn also claims to have better ""people skills"" than Morrison and says she is more in tune with the needs of the people in the east end of the district. She hopes her position as the only candidate from the eastern part of the district will help her reach a runoff election in November.
\
Fleenor declined to be interviewed in person but answered questions by e-mail. He has a variety of business interests and is an elected member of the Central Lincoln People's Utility District Board.
\
""I am the candidate with the best combination of qualifications; from education to business, to community volunteerism and public service,"" he wrote.
\
 Fleenor wrote that Morrison has little college education and a minimum of business experience - an observation Morrison takes issue with.
\
She says she has three years of college and more than 18 years of business experience in the Florence area that included owning a property management company and previously being co-owner of a road construction business.
\
Some differences on issues have emerged among the candidates during the campaign. Morrison and Burch have both expressed their distaste for a proposal by the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Coquille Indians to build a casino on tribal land east of Florence.
\
The U.S. Department of Interior has approved the land for gaming, but the state, at the direction of Gov. John Kitzhaber, is appealing that ruling. Burch supports Lane County joining the appeal; Morrison says she does also, if legal research indicates the state and county will prevail.
\
Kuhn expresses no opinion on the proposed casino and says it's ""a state issue"" rather than a county issue, and it would be a waste of county tax dollars to join an appeal that will likely be rejected.
\
Fleenor supports the tribes' right to build the casino, given that the federal government has given it a green light and other Oregon tribes have previously done so.
\
""I do not support the use of vice as a method of stimulating the local economy,"" he says in a statement on his Web site, ""but we must obey the law and we should welcome the tribes to our community.""
\
Morrison and Burch oppose an effort by the tribes to have up to 95,000 acres of Siuslaw National Forest set aside for tribal management. Kuhn has no opinion on the plan, and Fleenor backs the tribes.
\
""It's their land to begin with, so on what basis could I oppose their request?"" Fleenor said in his e-mail response, contending that the federal government should stand by past agreements with tribes and ""do what is morally right for a change.""
\
All of Morrison's opponents say they have a stronger commitment to protecting the environment than Morrison, who last year received a zero percent rating from the Oregon League of Conservation voters.
\
Two of the candidates, Burch and Fleenor, take issue with Morrison's support of a Coos County Board of Commissioners decision to sue the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service seeking to have critical habitat for a federally protected shorebird, the snowy plover, set aside because the economic impact of the habitat designation wasn't properly addressed.
\
Kuhn says she can understand the Coos County commissioners' motivation but has no position on the merits of the lawsuit.
\
The Fish & Wildlife Service didn't complete the economic analysis as required by law, Morrison says, and it's not wrong to ask them to do so. As for her concern for the environment, she says the Oregon League of Conservation Voters gave her a bad rap.
\
She says she cares about the environment, and her record will show she has promoted environmental awareness programs for young people and has supported recycling programs.
\
""I'm just not into the extreme,"" Morrison says. ""I don't think that locking up some of our resources is going to preserve them for the future.""

\
CANDIDATES Q&A
\
What are your top three priorities if elected?
\
Burch: Transportation issues, including looking at a countywide transit plan; improving employment opportunities, including high school and college training programs; improved law enforcement coverage.
\
Fleenor: Stimulate economic development and family wage job growth; reorganize county government to be more cost-effective and efficient, with a priority on service and accountability; take the special interests and politics out of county government.
\
Kuhn: A complete review of every county department with an eye for eliminating wasteful spending, streamlining processes and cutting red tape in the permitting process; actively seek diverse businesses to locate in Lane County and try to change county's anti- business perception; pursue more equitable distribution to cities and counties of locally collected state tax dollars such as room and gas taxes.
\
Morrison: Working to take care of current businesses and jobs and finding ways to attract more; stable long-term solution to replace county revenues lost from federal timber lands taken out of production; streamline getting dollars to effective programs and services benefiting roads, youth and public safety.
\
What are your specific proposals for improving public safety?
\
Burch: Explore the possibility of creating a countywide public safety district to include all or some of the police agencies and fire departments.
\
Fleenor: More family wage jobs will result in less unemployment and crime. Decriminalize drug use and focus on drug prevention, education and treatment - a course that will free up jail space now used by those arrested on drug charges. Promote better citizenship through youth education and intervention programs.
\
Kuhn: Look at some different revenue possibilities for public safety including possible county vehicle registration fee or gas tax. Also explore combining Lane County public safety agencies into one.
\
Morrison: Develop a program to have juvenile offenders do public service work using county forest work camp as a model; also have them involved in rural search and rescue work. Forge more partnerships among public safety agencies to reduce duplication and improve effectiveness - particularly in west Lane County.
\
What principles would guide your approach to land use issues?
\
Burch: We must be willing to work to ensure that land is protected from overdevelopment, but at the same time promote forward- thinking clustered developments that provide good infrastructure, cost effectiveness and meet the demands of larger populations.
\
Fleenor: Fairness and equality would be my primary guide in dealing with land use issues. I would also encourage developers and citizens to pre-negotiate any land use problems prior to commencing the permit process. I believe we need to stop using the judicial system to resolve every matter that comes before the commissioners.
\
Kuhn: Apply laws and regulations to the permit process, not politics. My decisions would be based on the evidence presented and the pertinent laws and regulations that apply to the issues.
\
Morrison: Look at impacts both today and in the future, balance between private property rights and long-term effects to the environment, and follow state laws. The county cannot legally go outside parameters set by the state.
\
What do you see as the county's main problem/obstacle/challenge?
\
Burch: They will require new and innovative ideas. Some will be acceptable, others will bring an uprising as neighborhoods lose some of the ""good old days"" feeling. But streets deteriorated from years of disrepair, breakdowns in water and sewer systems, changes in safety - we can expect no less than to be ever challenged every step of the way.
\
Fleenor: The county's main problem is the lingering recession as well as the lack of leadership at the commissioner level and subsequent mismanagement down to the department heads. We need to reorganize, reprioritize and clean out some of the deadwood that has been accumulating over the past decade or so. The other main problem is the polarity that has arisen due to the special interests and politics clashing with the interests of citizens.
\
Kuhn: The problem is the county commissioners not taking a leadership role and running the county as a business; not holding departments accountable for their spending. The obstacle is too many politicians making decisions on a political basis. The challenge will be to prioritize county services and then think outside the box for new and innovative revenue streams that are long-term and then sell them to the citizens of Lane County.
\
Morrison: We have a reputation as a county of not being friendly to jobs and business. Without a strong economic base, the county as a whole struggles with a high cost of housing, reduced service levels to our vulnerable citizens, less opportunities for youth, and a lack of investment in good infrastructure such as roads.
\
What is the one thing county government could do to most help residents of your district?
\
Burch: Listening to residents and bringing back a sense of community pride in who we are, and recognizing the value of rural west Lane County to the entire county.
\
Fleenor: Become more efficient, cost effective and service- oriented - including removing the red tape and layers of bureaucracy that ensnare small businesses.
\
Kuhn: Listen to what they say and what their concerns are; be in touch with all of the citizens and not just the few who scream the loudest.
\
Morrison: More flexibility in land use planning laws and rules. West Lane County depends upon being able to utilize the land to create jobs and contribute positively to the economy. Without such flexibility in rural areas, small communities and schools will struggle to survive.
"
186,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate could vote this week on Sen. Ron Wyden's proposal to keep the federal highway trust fund alive temporarily while Congress seeks a permanent solution for the program's perennial funding shortfalls.\The Oregon Democrat, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, and that panel's ranking Republican, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, announced an agreement July 10 to keep the fund solvent beyond Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. The fund, made up of federal fuel taxes, helps states pay for road, bridge and transit projects.\Their deal, which won the finance committee's approval, is similar to a plan that passed the House on July 15 on a bipartisan vote of 367-55 and won the White House's endorsement.\Both would transfer $11 billion from general revenue into the highway fund to plug the financial hole. The House bill would keep the fund solvent through May 2015. The Wyden-Hatch deal didn't specify an end date, though it's also thought to extend the fund until May 31.\The proposals also differ on how to replenish the general revenue account over time. The House version, for instance, would tap into a surplus built up in a fund aimed at cleaning up leaking underground storage tanks. The Senate plan would close some tax loopholes.\It wasn't clear Monday if the Senate would vote on whether to modify the House bill with the Wyden-Hatch proposal. Though a Capitol Hill newspaper said that was Majority Leader Harry Reid's plan, a Finance Committee aide said a decision is still in the works.\""The path forward is currently under discussion,"" Lindsey Held, the panel's spokeswoman, wrote in an email. ""At the end of the day we can all agree that we have to find an immediate solution to protect our infrastructure needs while also working on a long-term plan. We stand behind our bipartisan committee bill.""\The trust fund will start running out of money on Aug. 1 unless Congress provides a cash infusion. Oregon could lose $470 million in federal transportation money and 4,700 jobs next year if Congress allows the fund to expire by Sept. 30, according to state transportation officials.\Not all Democrats like the Wyden-Hatch agreement. Some, like Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer and Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., are pushing for an $8 billion extension that would expire around Christmas. They want to maintain pressure on the current Congress to find a long-term solution for the trust fund's revenue problem instead of leaving it up to a future Congress. Political considerations are also at play. Many analysts believe Democrats could lose their Senate majority in the November midterm elections.\Wyden has said he prefers a shorter extension, but had to agree to a longer deal because that was the only way he could get Republicans on board.\The trust fund, which has been extended 11 times in the past five years, is plagued by dwindling revenues as people drive less and automobiles become more fuel efficient. Advocates say increasing the federal gas tax is long overdue. The tax has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993 and repeated attempts to increase it over the years have failed.\Oregon's gas tax is 30 cents per gallon.\Contact Raju Chebium at rchebium@gannett.com"

Recreation: For decades, Ruth Bascom pushed for the completion of the bike path along the Willamette River. Her day has finally come.
\
It struck Ruth Bascom like a sudden spring thaw when she and her husband, John, moved to Eugene in 1960 from what she refers to as ""iron-cold gray Minnesota.""
\
""I knew I was in a place I could bike all year around,"" she says.
\
The only problem was, ""bicycle-friendly"" was a foreign concept back then. Streets were for cars and trucks, and bicycling was largely considered children's play.
\
But things had taken a dramatic turn by 1971, when the Oregon Legislature of Gov. Tom McCall's era earmarked 1 percent of Oregon's gas tax for the construction of bike paths and on-street bike lanes.
\
Not coincidentally, that's the year Bascom got her civic start as a member of the newly formed Eugene Bicycle Committee. She would later be a city councilor and then, during the early 1990s, Eugene's most bicycle-happy mayor to date.
\
Bascom was among those who developed a community vision back in the early 1970s that was known as the Eugene Bikeway Master Plan. Integral to the city's biking blueprint was a paved trail looping around both banks of the Willamette River, connected by bicycle- and pedestrian-only bridges.
\
She dogged her civic and political colleagues over the next 30 years to complete the dream, and today Bascom will get the payoff for her persistence.
\
The final leg of the three-mile east bank path will be opened to the public, and the entire 12-mile loop - from the Knickerbocker Bike Bridge just west of Interstate 5 to the Owosso Bike Bridge just south of Belt Line Road - will be dedicated as the Ruth Bascom Riverbank Trail System.
\
A ceremony honoring both Bascom and the trail - featuring a Dixieland band - will be held at noon, on the Valley River end of the Greenway Bridge.
\
""I have mixed feelings about that,"" Bascom says. ""But if my six children will be pleased, that's something - or the grandkids.""
\
A biker to the bone. For the joy of it primarily, but also for the health and the correctness of it.
\
""It's that feeling of freedom, and the wind in your face,"" she says. ""And using your body, and the exercise - that's part of it. I don't mind at all that it's good for the environment and the city, but that's not what got me caught.
\
""And it's not so bad, when you can marry self-interest and civic values.""
\
Most of the Willamette path actually had been completed by 1980 - a year after the Legislature reversed course and abandoned its 1 percent bike path requirement in the state gas tax. About nine miles of riverfront paths and four bridges were paid for with a combination of the state money, federal grants and some creative local financing and partnerships.
\
But the money couldn't be stretched quite far enough to include that missing link on the east bank, from the Valley River end of the Greenway Bike Bridge northward to The Boulders apartment complex.
\
Congressional funding for the last section finally came through in 1995, but political and bureaucratic roadblocks led to more fits and starts for the project - continuing even after work on a $2.5 million, one-mile final leg began last summer.
\
A first portion of the east bank path was completed in 1997, but then came a dispute with Marist High School officials, who maintained that a path on the western edge of their school's campus would compromise security and privacy.
\
A heated community debate led to political and legal skirmishes between the city and Marist, and a condemnation suit by the city was narrowly averted by a settlement that required the city to keep the route as far as possible from the school, to buy 5 acres of school property and to install a security fence.
\
The section past the Marist campus was built in 1999.
\
Then came a request that the final leg be moved away from the property of the Willamette Oaks Retirement Center, and that privacy fences and a retaining wall be included. The city complied, but still had to wait for final approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for an 800-foot concrete causeway that crosses the Delta Ponds.
\
""Every section (of the 12-mile loop) that was built, people complained about the dangers,"" Bascom said during a ride along the apartment-heavy new stretch north of Valley River Center. ""And (they) just never happened.""
\
Steve Gallup, the city's project manager for the loop's final segment, is just relieved that all the massaging of plans and hard work have paid off.
\
""I'm very excited that we've finally got this accomplished, and basically we have bike paths on both sides of the river,"" Gallup says. ""That (trail system) is one of the unique things about the city of Eugene, and I think we're pretty much known for that.""
\
He also gives a lot of credit to Bascom and other biking proponents inside and outside local government for shepherding the overall project through to its conclusion.
\
That kind of comment brings only a modest shrug from Bascom.
\
""I didn't have anything to do with this (section) at all,"" she says, taking a break at a birding overlook on the Delta Ponds causeway. ""I just nipped at their heels a little.
\
""But it's just like a highway,"" she says. ""If you take out a mile of it, or a half-mile or even 40 feet, you don't really have a trail. So we couldn't give in.""
\
And the final portion had its hitches, even after the money was lined up and permits were issued.
\
Originally scheduled for completion last November, it was hampered by minor delays in the shipment of railing segments for the causeway and by on-the-fly adjustments to the route, as input from adjacent property owners continued pouring in.
\
""I think we knew all along that the path was getting close to the abutting property owners and business owners and things like that,"" Gallup says. ""So we knew we were going to have to do some negotiations with them. And then we had to further refine some of those negotiations.""
\
But the project came in on budget, and was pronounced ""substantially complete"" Thursday evening. A little more work on the causeway railings is expected next week.
\
""But it will be open to the public, and hopefully will never be closed again,"" Gallup says.
\
DEDICATION CEREMONY
\
The Ruth Bascom Riverbank Trail System, a 12-mile loop along the Willamette River, will be dedicated at noon today during a ceremony at the Valley River end of the Greenway Bridge.

Don't forget the adoptive mothers
\
I've read many stories about ""birth mothers"" in magazines and newspapers. I feel a certain compassion for birth mothers but when, on Mother's Day weekend, I see a front-page story about an adoptee and her birth mother being united, I feel an urge for recognition of mothers who spend the childhood years raising adopted children (""Reuniting with mom: priceless,"" May 9).
\
I don't easily hand all recognition of mothering rights to the birth mother. I truly cannot find the correct words for my feelings. Whatever the reasons for relinquishing her child, my daughter's birth mother gave me the right to believe she is my daughter.
\
I clothed her, changed her diapers, nursed her when ill, comforted her when she cried, read to her, taught her the ABCs and loved her as she grew into a young girl, teenager and adult. Her father and I consider her to be our daughter, and she's loved equally as her older brother, who was born to us.
\
I'm proud of my daughter, and she has given us three granddaughters and six great-grandchildren. We can't imagine considering them to be anything but our ""grands"" and ""great-grands.""
\
In our haste to recognize reunions with birth mothers, let's not forget or diminish the mothers who spend years loving and raising adoptees. Love and commitment aren't determined by genetics.

Donate restored PERS COLAs
\
The writer of a May 6 letter suggested Oregon Public Employees Retirement System retirees are a greedy lot, and that the state Supreme Court had a conflict of interest in restoring PERS retirees' cost of living allowances that had been reduced by the Legislature.
\
The Oregon Constitution governs contracts, and the court has consistently ruled that PERS is a contract between the state and employees of state and local government.
\
The basic principle is that a contract can't be modified unilaterally, but the Legislature doesn't seem to grasp that concept.
\
Remember, legislators are also covered by PERS.
\
The proper thing for local PERS retirees to do now would be to use their COLA increases (actually a restoration) to up their contributions to the Eugene Education Fund - and, if and when the state income tax ""kicker"" kicks in, to also give part or all of that money to the EEF.
\
That's where the money belongs.

Many City Hall questions remain
\
Where are the plans for our ""new"" City Hall? I assume the city mothers and fathers have seen the final design and know the cost, given that our ""old"" City Hall was trashed so quickly.
\
I don't remember seeing a written cost comparison between remodeling and rebuilding, but maybe only the city mothers and fathers were privy to that information.
\
I can't believe they would have built their personal homes and business projects without an approved plan and a known price, so why would they do so with the City Hall project?
\
I see Hilton is building a four-level hotel downtown for $6.5 million on a quarter-block site, with a parking garage and many amenities.
\
If I remember correctly, our new City Hall will be four stories with a mezzanine and no covered parking for $15 million to $18 million, also on a quarter-block.
\
Will we have a gravel-based parking lot on the remainder of the block for five, 10, or 20 years? Will the parking lot be paved with drainage and landscaping, as required by city code? Will it be trashed as the second, third and fourth phases of construction become known?
\
Do we know where the new City Hall project is headed? Is there a timeline? Will the fence around the project be festooned with the city mothers' and fathers' good intentions for the next year?
\
I'm waiting for the answers.

Replace fee with gas tax increase
\
I noticed the ballot title for Lane County Measure 20-231 calls for a ""modest"" increase in vehicle registration fees. Increasing the biennial fee of $86 to $156 is an increase of more than 81 percent. I don't call that modest.
\
If approved, the measure would adversely affect those of us who seldom drive; those who are financially challenged can always walk to save on gas, but they'd still have to pay the higher fee.
\
I understand the position our road people are in - cars are getting better gas mileage, road maintenance and repair costs are up - and I concede the need for more road funds.
\
However, if the measure passes, Lane County drivers would pay for maintenance and repairs on streets and roads that all drivers, including out-of-county and out-of-state drivers, use.
\
The only fair method is the gas tax, which would need to be raised at the state level or people would ""tank up"" out of town. It would tap travelers from out of state as well.
\
Those who drive less would pay less, and those who drive behemoths - which do the most damage to the roads - would pay more.
\
The fuel tax system's already in place and doesn't require creating a new bureaucracy, allowing 100 percent of the increase to reach the proper agency.
\
That leaves only the issue of electric cars and bicycles paying their portion.

Climate has reached crisis stage
\
I'm asking The Register-Guard to stop using the words ""climate change"" and ""global warming"" and to use the phrases ""climate crisis"" and ""climate chaos"" instead. It would be helpful if readers started using those substitutes also, as they more accurately describe the situation.
\
Some would dismiss that as semantics, but it may awaken people to the situation's gravity and give less credence to the naysayers who still hold sway, as witnessed by the 2014 election results.
\
While the climate's getting warmer overall, weather patterns vary wildly and people are confusing climate with weather. ""Climate change"" doesn't indicate good or bad, just change. ""Global warming"" is actually ""global heating.""
\
The fossil fuel companies' scientists, the Koch brothers and their Republican lapdogs have influenced how slow the United States has been in addressing the problem. Unfortunately, they hold power and have millions of followers.
\
The East Coast of the United States was one of the few places on Earth where temperatures were not above average after history's warmest recorded winter. Republican senators have finally conceded the world is getting warmer, but say it would be ""egotistical"" to think humans are responsible.
\
Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, brought a snowball into the chamber and declared that snow on the ground in Washington, D.C., ""proves global warming is a hoax.""
\
Old beliefs die hard - and the more that can be done to raise awareness, the faster we can address the crisis.

Public needs to know what's in TPP
\
""Here, sign this contract. You can't read it, just sign it. Trust me."" Imagine someone shoving a document in front of you regarding your car, your home or your bank account and telling you to sign without a chance to read it.
\
That's what President Obama, Sen. Ron Wyden and a host of global corporations - including infamous Wall Street bankers - want us to do regarding the questionable Trans-Pacific Partnership.
\
Just as they did with the job-killing North American Free Trade Agreement boondoggle, they want us to trust them that the TPP is good for us. More to the point, they want Congress to approve it without disclosing its contents.
\
Let's forget the laughable ""trust-us"" issue for a moment, and just ask: Why can't we read it before we sign it?

Homeless need more shelter
\
We can all be proud of the compassion people in our region show to the less fortunate. The fund-raising record set by United Way of Lane County in 2004 is an example of that. It shows that we care about our youth, the ailing, the hungry.
\
But before we pat ourselves on the back too hard, let's ask if we've really covered all the needs of our community. One need that isn't getting enough attention is shelter for the homeless.
\
The few nonprofits that provide shelter for the homeless aren't meeting the need. We can see that on our streets every day. What's needed is a community-wide effort to make sure that no one has to spend their nights in the rain and cold.
\
Isn't it about time we bit the bullet and recognized this need? Our city and county governments should take the lead and come up with solutions. Otherwise, we can't really say that we're compassionate.

People of color still struggle
\
Too many United States citizens act as if the country belongs to white people. They seem to wish for people of color to play a subordinate role. Nonetheless, the post-Civil War 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution weighs against discrimination by mandating ""equal protection under the laws.""
\
People of color must still wage a continuous struggle for civil rights. One possible solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be the creation of two countries within which only one group could feel it has ownership. An alternative would be a single state that would formally grant equal rights to all citizens, as under the U.S. model.
\
The descendants of migrants from Europe would continue to have the advantage, as in South Africa today. For arguments in favor of the one-state solution, see the Winter 2005 issue of the journal Race Traitor, Internet address: racetraitor.org.

Dowd column was incoherent
\
I read Maureen Dowd's column on evolution on the Internet. I was surprised and disappointed to see the column in The Register-Guard on Feb. 4, and not for the reasons some people are probably thinking.
\
I actually agree with much of her sentiment. What I find objectionable about this piece is the poor quality of writing. Dowd's ideas jump all over the place with the only common thread through the piece being her tone.
\
This type of incoherent tizzy-fit does nothing to advance political thought, scientific understanding or literacy.

Must be nice to work at LTD
\
Last year, my college-educated husband took a job with a $10,000 pay cut after the company he had been working for moved out of state. In addition to our $250 per month insurance premiums, we now pay for his new employer's health insurance plan. We now have a $4,000 deductible before we receive any health coverage.
\
This plan offers no coverage for preventive care such as routine physicals, well-baby visits, routine vaccinations, prescription drugs or vision care. He took this job and is grateful to have it to keep his family in this job-forsaken state, where both our families live.
\
In hindsight, I think we had the wrong plan. He should have joined a union, perhaps become a Lane Transit District union worker. How nice it must be to be able to demand your salary and benefit package and make the public suffer when you don't get your way. Certainly, we all think we're overworked and underpaid, but these are not exactly high-rolling times for Oregon.
\
I say, let the LTD workers strike and offer the jobs to some of the thousands of educated, loyal and hardworking Oregonians who would jump at a chance to just work and feed their families.

Smith's vote a disappointment
\
We learned in The Register-Guard that Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon voted with the rest of the Republican senators to confirm Alberto Gonzales as attorney general of the United States.
\
Gonzales, on prompting from the White House, delivered legal opinions declaring the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war ""quaint"" and obsolete on the one hand, and justifying the torture of such prisoners on the other - providing that it did not lead to organ failure or death. We must applaud Gonzales' humanitarian impulses in such cases.
\
I had thought that the United States of America was better than this. I guess I was wrong.

Let us now look forward to seeing how Senator Smith will go with President Bush's plan to dismantle the Social Security system.

Gas tax increase was a bad idea
\
As a citizen I am concerned that the city of Eugene has decided without a vote of its citizens to force a two-cent increase in the tax on gasoline - a commodity that is essential in today's world.
\
It puts an undue burden on the citizens, who are already paying about 30 percent of their annual income in taxes. Increasing the gas tax shows a lack of concern on the part of the city of Eugene, and this saddens me.
\
Perhaps if we band together and refuse to buy gas in Eugene the city will see that the way to more revenue is not to dip into the citizens' pockets. The city could be more business friendly or find some other creative solution to increase revenue.

Adoption alternative to abortion
\
In her Feb. 5 letter ""No woman wants an abortion,"" Ann Schwartz failed to mention another option any female faced with an unplanned pregnancy has - adoption.
\
I'm not sure if people realize how many thousands of couples there are who cannot have children of their own. Typically these couples are financially secure, in stable marriages and can give love and support to a child that would be placed in their home.
\
Many of these families are willing for some degree of openness in the adoption. If a birth mother chooses this path early in her pregnancy, a bond can form between the birth mom and adoptive parents during the pregnancy - a bonding that can only have positive benefits to the one who matters most in the situation: the baby.
\
Many agencies and lawyers have profiles of potential parents that a birth mom can go through and possibly choose from.
\
I understand this would be a heart-wrenching decision for any woman who found herself in an unplanned pregnancy. Giving up her own flesh and blood is not a decision to take lightly.
\
But I am one of these women. And I know adoption can be the best decision for all involved - especially when I see pictures of the baby boy I gave up and the grin on his face.

Obey outdoor lighting code
\
Like many other communities, Eugene has a land use code that includes standards for outdoor lighting. The code requires that a permit be obtained for new outdoor lighting fixtures on both commercial and residential sites and that those fixtures confine their light ""within the boundaries of the development site.""
\
The standards are based on common sense. Well-designed outdoor lighting reduces or eliminates unwanted glare; prevents ""light trespass"" into neighbors' windows and elsewhere; saves energy and creates a safer and more attractive night-time environment. The permit simply ensures that new lights will be installed safely and will conform with the standards.
\
Thanks to the code, most new commercial development is nicely illuminated with appropriate levels of well directed light. A good example is Oakway Center.
\
In new residential areas, however, the majority of outdoor lights do not comply with the standards. The typical new house has five so- called carriage lamps - one on each side of the porch, one on each side of the garage and one on a post by the sidewalk. These lights are arguably attractive by day, but downright unpleasant at night and in clear violation of the code.
\
It is time for residential development to join commercial development in complying with the outdoor lighting standards. I am hopeful that local homebuilders and electrical contractors - with some prodding from city inspectors - will do what's necessary to ensure that compliance.

U.S. doesn't need new nukes
\
Hidden within President Bush's 2006 budget is a request for money to develop new nuclear weapons.
\
What message does this send to the developing world? If we are so concerned about halting a nuclear proliferation, how can we allocate money to develop nuclear bunker busters?
\
It seems unlikely that we will successfully convince other nations to abstain from developing nuclear weapons while we maintain our current huge arsenal and continue the funding of new nuclear devices. If nuclear weapons are wrong for North Korea and Iran, they must also be wrong for the United States.
\
Developing, employing and using nuclear weapons all lower the threshold for accidental or deliberate nuclear war. Most of our military experts agree that using nuclear weapons is imprudent and unnecessary.
\
Please encourage your congressional representatives to excise this reckless funding from the national budget. America needs to spend her money to enhance an image that she is concerned for the world rather than acting like another rogue nation.

Stop endorsing candidates
\
In its May 16 editorial ""Why endorse candidates,"" The Register- Guard states, ""Endorsements are not intended to tell anyone how to vote. The aim is to present a fair-minded evaluation of the candidates and issues that readers might find useful in making their own decisions."" I found this reasoning somewhat jumbled, and the stated justification a rather thin rationalization for promotion of The Register-Guard's political agenda.
\
The fact that The Register-Guard claims to be a mere citizen of the community doesn't make it so. A newspaper, by virtue of its prestige in the field, status in the community and its considerable resources for collecting, analyzing and disseminating news and opinions, is elevated significantly above being a mere citizen. Therefore, when The Register-Guard endorses a candidate or takes a position on an issue, it is persuasion of the highest order, very nearly equal to - if not in fact equal to - political statements made directly by candidates in promoting their candidacies and agendas. Such endorsements, even though they appear in the editorial section, signal the newspaper's transition from impartiality to activism.
\
If The Register-Guard's purpose is as stated, it would report the political news impartially, allow voters to assume their positions on issues and candidates by themselves and refrain from making any endorsements. Such restraint is not an abdication of responsibility, as the editorial suggests. It is a newspaper's primary responsibility.

'Pro-life' has broader meaning
\
Many people who claim to be pro-life have supported policies detrimental to life, and consequently undermined the meaning of this term.
\
To my mind, pro-life is not merely a slogan about abortion. It is a way of being, an attitude of reverence that recognizes the dignity and power of each individual life as well as the vital interconnections between the lives of plants, animals and humans. To be pro-life is to stand in defense not only of life's creation but also its healthy and loving maintenance.
\
It is no surprise that in a culture where people willfully abuse and pollute their own bodies, destroy the ecological foundation upon which their survival depends and declare that nonhuman beings exist solely for our use that we would divorce the right to create from the responsibility to sustain. How else could a so-called pro-life proponent endorse war?
\
Yet when we restore the abortion debate to its proper context, we recognize that any effort to promote a safe and healthy environment is in fact a pro-life effort. We should consider nutritious eating habits, education, supportive families and the curbing of profligate human growth and consumption of natural resources all pro-life policies.
\
Those who narrowly focus on individual rights or responsibilities without a deeper sense of reverence and interconnectedness promote a culture of reckless destruction. When people understand how and why they create life, and when they are able to create within a community that promotes life's flourishing, the choice becomes clear.

Fire Cheney and Rumsfeld
\
When I voted for George W. Bush, I thought we would have a moderate president who would operate in an open, bipartisan manner. What we have is a secretive, deceitful and manipulative administration recalling the days of Richard Nixon. The main differences between the Nixon and Bush administrations are:
\
1) Bush is superficially more likeable than Nixon.
\
2) Nixon inherited the Vietnam quagmire, while Bush created the Iraq quagmire by poor decision making starting post-Sept. 11 and continuing through today with his statement ""Rumsfeld has done a superb job.""
\
His arrogant comments such as ""bring 'em on"" when the insurgents started their attacks make it clear that he does not comprehend that this is not a baseball game.
\
The most urgent change needed is in the handling of the prisoner abuse issue. Punishing a bunch of 20-year-olds is not the answer. The whole chain of command needs to be held accountable, particularly Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
\
The most sinister member of the Bush administration is Vice President Dick Cheney. His obsession with secrecy and his blatant abuse of power are the antithesis of a free society.
\
President Bush should be given the opportunity to admit that he has been deceived and misled and remove Rumsfeld and Cheney from their positions. Following that, he should create an honest and transparent administration. If he does not do both of these, the Congress of the United States should remove the president from office, along with Cheney and Rumsfeld.

Tax penalizes fuel-efficient cars
\
In the article by Sarah Linn (Register-Guard, May 16 ), it would appear the engineers at Oregon State University and the Oregon Department of Transportation are working to deal a financial blow to the few of us who drive small fuel-efficient vehicles. Taxing all motor vehicles the same under miles driven sounds great. However, I feel that my small Honda does much less road damage than an 8,000- pound SUV or truck. The owners of large SUVs and trucks who do the most damage to our streets and highways should pay a proportion more than owners of small, lightweight, fuel-efficient vehicles.
\
I drive a small motor vehicle not only to conserve energy and create less pollution but also to do less road damage. As a retired ODOT highway employee, I can attest that the heavier the vehicle, the more damage it will cause. Under the new OSU/ODOT concept, owners of small fuel-efficient vehicles will pay for much of the damage caused by heavy, gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks.
\
I strongly disagree with Republican Sen. Bruce Starr's statement that the per-gallon gas tax be replaced. I feel that the present per- gallon gas tax is fair and as the old saying goes, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I feel offended that our state and federal tax money is being spent on this $1.9 million project. Perhaps Jim Whitty of ODOT might better think of adding a surcharge to those gas- guzzling heavy SUVs and large pickup trucks.

We already started a country
\
Jerry Hayes' comments (letters, May 18) reminded me of when I passed through a German train station years ago. A drunken man was shouting about ""the Turks,"" how they were ""taking jobs away from the Germans"" and ""Germany for the Germans!"" ""I'm a German,"" he shouted, ""I pay taxes!"" As he passed by a shop, an older woman who worked there confronted him. ""You're no German,"" she said with disgust and turned away.
\
Quite a while back, people tried Hayes' suggestion to ""start their own country"" when they didn't agree with a monarchy. It was called America. Land of the free. Hayes and others seem to think they speak for fellow Americans when they vent hatred of those with different opinions. However, the right to tell off our neighbors isn't one for which my father - and many before and since - actually sacrificed.

Thanks goodness for Rumsfeld
\
Paul Neville expressed his opinion in the May 16 Register-Guard. It deserves rebuttal from one who laid his life on the line in World War II on behalf of the millions of others who did the same.
\
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is not only a survivor, we are lucky he is.
\
He has modernized our army to cope with terrorism, a new kind of war that has no end in sight; not because of our actions, but because of the fanaticism of people who intend to destroy our way of life.
\
Neville said Rumsfeld had no plan. Not so. Rumsfeld and President Bush plan to defend our country by trying to defeat the terrorists in their area and not on our soil.
\
Neville wonders about the victims of Abu Ghraib. How about our victims of Sept. 11, 2001, and the sorrow it caused our nation and how it impacted our economy?
\
And how about our fellow citizen, Nick Berg, who got his head sawed off? Neville blames Rumsfeld for that. He should blame Osama bin Laden.
\
No decent American approves of the treatment that our deviant guards wreaked on the prisoners at Abu Ghraib, but was it as bad as was common under Saddam Hussein?
\
What grieves me is that I and millions of others offered our lives against Hitler and Japan for Neville and others who are trying to divide our country in time of war.
\
When a nation is attacked as we were on Sept. 11, either we fight back or give up. I am 88 and too old to fight, but if I could, I would.
\
Can anyone really believe that it is possible to negotiate with terrorists?

Bush to blame for prison abuse
\
I blame President Bush for the torture of the Iraqi POWs. He sent National Guard soldiers, not trained for military police duty, to guard Iraqi prisoners.
\
They had orders from their commanding officers and a hired civilian interrogator to soften up the prisoners.
\
Bush preemptively attacked Iraq, falsely blaming that country for the Sept. 11 attacks. He has always referred to the Iraqis held in prison as thugs, evil and intent on destroying America.
\
He has ignored the Geneva Conventions by using thousands of banned cluster bombs and tons of depleted uranium weapons.
\
He has always rallied the troops with speeches about a war of good vs. evil that must be won no matter what the cost.
\
The Iraqi men in prison are only guilty of trying to defend their nation from foreign invaders. It is wrong to place the whole torture blame on just a few overzealous soldiers.

191,"
Democrat Vicki Walker and Republican Mike Cary are polar opposites on most issues in their campaign for Senate District 7. But it's a rare shared plank on their political platforms that may offer the best contrast in the candidates' approaches.
\
Both list job creation and a bolstering of the state's economy as a top priority for state lawmakers.
\
Cary, a longtime businessman and political newcomer, sees a relaxation of state regulations as the best route to an economic recovery. Everything from picky building codes to a complex maze of land use and environmental policies has created an infertile business environment in Oregon, he said.
\
""People just can't afford to deal with it, and they move out,"" Cary said. ""We have run people out of this state.""
\
Walker, a longtime activist in Democratic politics and two-term representative for the former House District 41 in north Eugene, maintains instead that rebuilding the state's tax structure is a more realistic and far-reaching means of getting Oregon back on track.
\
A decade of tax-limitation initiatives has decimated the former method of funding schools and most other local governments primarily with property taxes, and the state income tax hasn't been able to pick up the slack - particularly during the current recession, she said.
\
""We need long-term funding for schools, and we need to partner with schools and employers to try to get kids good jobs when they get out,"" Walker says. ""If we keep undercutting education - especially the community colleges - we're not going to be able to get people back into the economy.""
\
The liberal Walker and the conservative Cary are vying to replace Democrat Susan Castillo in reconfigured Senate District 7, which now covers essentially all of Eugene north of West 11th Avenue and extends beyond Junction City into rural Lane County.
\
Castillo instead entered the race to become Oregon's superintendent of public instruction, and won with a majority of votes in the May primary. She will take office in January.
\
Cary concedes that his opponent may have had early edges over him in name familiarity and voter history - Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district 25,872 to 21,943, according to the secretary of state's latest figures - but he maintains that he's making headway through hard work and aggressive campaigning.
\
""I believe we're well on the way to overcoming that name recognition,"" Cary says. ""I've been a member of the community since 1974, and I know a lot of people. And I'm getting to know a lot more. I have a lot of signs out, and I walk and walk, and knock and knock.""
\
He's way ahead of Walker in the latest campaign finance reports, raising $46,554 to Walker's $8,692.
\
Before becoming a management consultant, Cary worked in executive capacities for companies including Safari Motor Coaches Inc. of Harrisburg, and Nicolai-Morgan Products Inc., formerly of Springfield, and he's a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.
\
He contends that it's his business experience, paired with a long- standing desire for public service, that make him the right candidate at the right time.
\
""My background in accounting and budgeting is critical at this point to the betterment of the state of Oregon and the people of Lane County,"" Cary says. ""My background allows me the opportunity to understand budgets, to question the areas of said budget that seem out of line. That will then lead to more efficient operations.""
\
But Walker said this year's record five special legislative sessions that have been necessary to balance the state budget - along with millions of dollars in cuts to state programs - are compelling arguments that a Republican strategy of cutting programs to absorb budget deficits has gone too far.
\
She said she and other Democrats pushed during the recent special sessions to form a legislative task force that would analyze the current tax system and the state's revenue needs, then recommend a tax system overhaul when the Legislature meets in regular session next year.
\
""Unfortunately, we're not moving anywhere on that very quickly,"" Walker says. ""I think it's going to take the private businesses and individuals to come up with the strategies to do that, because my colleagues across the aisle just don't seem to realize we have a problem.""

CANDIDATES Q&A
\
Do you support the income tax measure on the Jan. 28 ballot?
\
Mike Cary: ""Absolutely not. I believe there is plenty of room in our state government to encourage efficiencies. I think there's plenty of room to become much more efficient in the operations of most agencies.""
\
Vicki Walker: ""Yes, I voted for that on its final pass through the House chamber ... but my preference would have been to vote it up or down in the (Legislature), because that's what we're elected to do as leaders. The consequences of not increasing revenue would have been devastating to state programs.""
\
Is Oregon's funding of its higher education system adequate, and would you support a tuition increase?
\
Cary: ""I do not believe Oregon's funding of higher education is adequate. I would support a fair sharing of the costs going into the higher education system. There are available resources to support K- 12 education, but as for the funding for higher education, I believe it's necessary to make more available. It may need to come from the general fund, or whatever other fund.""
\
Walker: ""I don't consider the higher education budget adequate but no, I would not increase tuition. It's already very difficult for young people to go to school. We just need to make more opportunities for our young people to go to college. I think it's important for us to beef up those programs.""
\
Do you support increased spending on the state's transportation system, even if that means higher gas taxes or fees? How does mass transit fit into the picture?
\
Cary: ""I believe our roads and bridges need good maintenance, and upscaling. A chunk of that money can come from better use of the resources we have available to us today in our Department of Transportation. It would be against my desires to have any further increase in gas tax, as long as we have inefficiencies within the agencies and within the contractors.""
\
Walker: Supports gas tax if necessary. ""I think a good transportation system is vital to our healthy long-term economic policies. Workers want a transportation system that can move products, services and people around the state. And mass transit is extremely important to Oregon, so we can preserve our fossil fuels and have clean air and clean water and get our people around efficiently.""

Atom bomb use was political
\
The argument that using the atomic bomb saved the lives of troops who otherwise would have invaded Japan is bogus, because there would be invasion casualties only if we decided to invade.
\
If we did not invade, there would be no invasion casualties. There was no military reason to invade Japan, so there was no need to use the atomic bomb to prevent invasion casualties.
\
Japan is an island. Remnants of its army were contained, and there was no remaining viable air force or navy. People were starving, with little food, oil, gasoline or other natural resources to keep up the war effort.
\
No air force or navy and a contained army means no military threat. And since Japan is an island and cannot be resupplied by overland infiltration, it could be blockaded.
\
Six months before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Emperor Hirohito already was negotiating through Switzerland to end the war. Therefore, there was no military reason to invade. Therefore, the use of the atomic bomb was not military, but political.
\
The political reasons included impressing the world (including scaring our own people), revenge, real-life weapons testing (not like New Mexico), the reduction of ""inferior populations,"" and the initiation by some radical Christians of an early Armageddon.

Why do we import from China?
\
I am amazed at all the things being recalled that are made in China. And we are still selling all this Chinese junk in our stores.
\
I just happened to look at a list of recalled items on an eBay site recently, and the list went on and on and on. It ranged from lead paint in toys and jewelry and needle tips in plush toys to parts of toys coming off and being a choking hazard.
\
Putting all this dangerous stuff in things for our children is a crime, as far as I am concerned. Why are all our companies putting up with it and still continuing to have their products made in China? Lead poison in our children, bad chemicals in our food and animals' food that can kill or make us sick - what is going on?
\
I guess this is one way to kill us all without a bomb or guns. And the Chinese can play dumb about what was in all the stuff they send over here.
\
I know the reason we sell all this stuff from China - money, money, money. But I would gladly pay more for U.S.-made things if only I could find some.
\
We need to let our companies know we are sick and tired of all the Chinese-made products and will stop buying them; we want companies to start making U.S. products. We will gladly pay more if we can know the products aren't going to kill us and our children or make us sick.

Fear might make nation safer
\
Recently, we've had a report claiming that global warming has doubled the number of North Atlantic hurricanes. And in Minnesota, an interstate bridge has collapsed, killing a few people and frightening millions.
\
Ordinarily, my innate skepticism would bubble to the surface and I'd point out that although carbon dioxide is doubtless increasing again this year, the hurricane season has been incredibly boring. And that over the past decade, it's been a lot safer driving across Interstate bridges than traveling on the average rural road in America.
\
Instead, I'm ready to jump on the bandwagon, mongering fear to the hilt, if anyone is ready to propose a $1 increase in the federal gas tax, to be spent mostly on replacing bridges. The public would be saved from the menace of collapsing bridges, and by reducing gasoline consumption, global warming would be slowed and the specter of hurricanes abated.
\
Actually, I have doubts about these two effects, but there are a couple of excellent reasons for a gas tax anyway. First, our growing dependence on foreign oil drives foreign policy. We're in Baghdad and not Darfur for a reason.
\
Second, the trade deficit with China is a looming economic catastrophe. We need to stop buying as many doodads from the Far East and spend our cash on domestic activities.
\
 In an ideal world, a person could base all his political opinions on sound science and statistics, but this isn't an ideal world. So be afraid. Be very afraid.

If you're a River Road resident, you understand this concept very well. Where is the park out my kitchen window? It was an advertisement for a bond measure and nothing more, I expect.
\
No, the kids on my street, a diverse bunch from families living below the ""living"" wage in Eugene, continue to play in the street with sticks, pieces of wood and on bikes. We couldn't afford $40,000 to head off some developer if we pooled every dime we had. Eugene will get the ""densification"" it wants from my neighborhood and not on Nectar Way, because we don't have the resources or time to fight it.
\
Here's a concept for the gentrified lot in their fine, woodsy, nearly all-white neighborhood: How about if they build a house in their back yard or an addition to their house and provide subsidized rent to someone who needs a place to live? They're bleeding heart liberals, right? They should either do that or stop pretending they're doing this for everyone. Nobody on my street has the money or time to drive to their neighborhood to hike.

State needs more independents
\
""Merkley makes it a race"" was the heading of an Aug. 2 editorial. A race - when both parties are so alike, obligated to the same donors?
\
In Oregon, with its many independent-minded citizens, the only valid race is that of a nonaligned candidate against political hacks forced on us by Republicans and Democrats. Steve Novick of Portland and Jeff Golden of Ashland are valuable examples of candidates who would give us a fair choice in the next race for the Senate if they ran as independents.
\
When we tolerate our system of bribing party candidates with donations, one has to admit chances for either seem nil. The structure of both parties demands political robots who run on money. Both Golden and Novick would gain grass-roots support if either competed as an independent against the entrenched powers.
\
Novick has announced his candidacy for the nomination as Democrat. Golden, longtime voice of the Jefferson Radio Network, traveled the state recently to gauge his chances. They and democracy would be better served by their running as independents instead of with the baggage of corrupted political parties. They'd get a fair chance if the news media quit assuming political races are limited to old nags who depend on money instead of principle.

Game day drinking not an issue
\
As a member of Eugene No. 11, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, I have been parking cars for Oregon Duck games for more than 10 years.
\
In that time, we have had a handful of incidents involving alcohol that would be considered a problem. None of them that I know of ever required us calling the police.
\
There was that time a frat house drove in with a cube van, emptied out couches and kegs and drew a big crowd, or the time Ace Hardware did the same thing when it pulled up in a tractor-trailer rig and had a party for its warehouse employees, but they were responsible and cooperative, as are all the great people and families that park with us.
\
The Eugene City Council again is using wrong thinking and creating a problem that does not exist. As a Freemason, I believe in freedom of thought and responsible action.
\
Anyone we allow to park on our lot - and we do ask people to leave when they do not respect our rules - is on private property. To me, and I may be wrong legally, this is like inviting someone into your front yard for a beer, and is not illegal. As long as fans are responsible, why make them criminals?
\
I urge all Duck fans to tell the city councilors that they are wrong. Let's find a pragmatic solution that does not penalize the host nonprofits for something we, let alone the police, could not control.
\
Arrest people for serious criminal actions. Let's not create a new class of criminals out of responsible football fans.

Downsize Doonesbury
\
My wife and I recently traveled through Montana and Idaho and were impressed by the way the Billings Gazette and the Idaho Statesman newspapers handled the comics.
\
Both of these papers put a regular-sized Doonesbury and Mallard Fillmore side by side on the editorial page. It seems that The Register-Guard is one of the few papers to feel that Doonesbury is so special to warrant extra size.
\
I also think you should quit these guest comics. They have all been lame so far. Why not be brave and bring back Mallard Fillmore, put Mallard and Doonesbury on the editorial page and create some balance? I would even tolerate Doonesbury's special size.

193,"
Note: Unlike other years, Oregon's 65 delegates are still in big demand by both candidates
\
Tens of thousands of Oregonians already have taken out their political tape measures and unofficially sized up Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And now that ballots have been mailed out to the bumper crop of state Democrats, more than 800,000 voters are now formalizing their decisions.
\
If the calculations of the early deciders are any indication, then it seems that what Oregon Democratic voters are looking for in a leader could be as critical as what the party's presidential contenders are offering up in style and substance.
\
Democratic activist Deb Huntley, who initially supported John Edwards, spent the early spring trying to find out which of the two finalists could best cut through complex challenges and make a clear case for their plans to solve them.
\
The Eugene woman left Obama's March 21 appearance at McArthur Court impressed with his smile, his appealing nature and his good looks. But not with the content of his speech.
\
""He basically gave a wish list. He didn't have any follow up. He was just naming things that needed to change,"" Huntley said.
\
What she heard from Clinton two weeks later at South Eugene High School offered the substance Huntley sought.
\
""Most people really haven't seen bigger issues that clearly, but she sees so many issues so clearly and it's remarkable to me,"" said the semi-retired kindergarten teacher.
\
Jim Rassmann of Florence said he didn't consider Clinton's and Obama's policy positions so much as their character and intelligence. Both are smart enough for the job. But he found Clinton too willing ""to say anything to get elected.""
\
A Vietnam veteran, Rassmann four years ago reunited with the Navy officer who saved his life under enemy fire - John Kerry. Rassmann campaigned for his war buddy and remained active in politics, especially where military and veteran issues are concerned.
\
In Obama, Rassmann said, he found a candidate with the character to stand up for disabled veterans and against torture.
\
""I don't want to sound trite, but I want change in the White House,"" said the retired Los Angeles cop and orchid enthusiast. ""I want major, earth-shattering change and I'm not going to get it from Hillary Clinton or John McCain. But I'm hopeful we're going to get it from Barack Obama.""
\
In most presidential election years, one candidate in each party has locked up enough delegates to claim the nomination long before Oregon's late-in-the-game primary.
\
But this year's tight and still-unresolved Democratic contest means Oregon's 65 delegates are still being sought after.
\
It takes 2,024 delegates to win. Obama has 1,732 delegates to Clinton's 1,596. But with 492 delegates yet to be divided up between the two candidates from states' and Puerto Rico's upcoming primaries, it appears unlikely either will have captured the nomination when primary voting ends June 3.
\
That has both candidates trying to finish strong so they can make the case to uncommitted superdelegates that they deserve the nomination when the Democratic National Convention is held in Denver this August.
\
Clinton and Obama each have appeared in Oregon earlier this spring and their campaigns say they will return this month.
\
Both sides have sent hired staff to work in Oregon for up to two months in the run-up to the primary.
\
Obama's Oregon spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said his campaign has opened 15 field offices throughout Oregon, including one in Eugene. So far more than 35,000 Oregonians have signed up on the candidate's Web site ""to canvass, make phone calls, find information about Obama events and learn more about his message,"" Shapiro said.
\
The Clinton campaign's Oregon spokeswoman, Julie Edwards, said seven field offices have been opened, including one in Springfield. So far, she said, 24,000 Oregonians have signed up to volunteer.
\
While Obama's campaign claims the lead in on-the-ground organization, Clinton has issued the most detailed blueprint for her plans to deal with Oregon-related issues. On April 23 her campaign issued a 13-page ""Oregon Compact"" that describes how she would deal with 11 issues deemed important to Oregonians: from forest thinning and salmon recovery to the state's assisted suicide law and tailpipe emission standards.
\
The Obama campaign on Thursday put out an eight-page document, ""Barack Obama: Change Oregon Can Believe In,"" that summarizes the candidate's positions, in a less Oregon-centric way than does Clinton, on several topics.
\
It cites Oregon statistics in areas such as joblessness, test scores and forested acreage, but largely highlights Obama's agendas for education, the environment, climate change, the economy and health care. Exceptions include Obama's vow to develop a plan to restore wild salmon and his support for county timber payments.
\
When it comes to their positions on national issues, Clinton and Obama have spent more than a year laying out their agendas and ideas for voters, the media and organizations to compare and contrast. The consensus opinion? They aren't that far apart, although they're not identical, either.
\
Unlike Iowa and New Hampshire voters who cast ballots in early January and the 14.6 million Democrats in 22 states who voted on February's Super Tuesday, voters in Oregon and other late-voting states will have seen months of additional campaigning and controversy: Obama's ""bittergate"" incident following a comment about rural residents, and his ex-pastor problem; Clinton's false sniper-fire memory and her ex-president husband's occasional pit-bull performances as her campaign surrogate.
\
That means Oregon Democrats have a lot more to sort through, said Portland-based pollster Mike Riley. It's not that voters here won't take seriously where candidates stand on the Iraq War, global warming, health care and the troubled economy.
\
""Now it's about all that, plus the new scandals and new titillating revelations,"" he said. ""It's kind of snowballing.""
\
Where they stand
\
Here are summaries of where Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton stand on issues. The information is from online news accounts, information from the campaigns, and interviews each candidate conducted with The Register-Guard during Oregon campaign stops this spring.
\
CLIMATE CHANGE
\
Clinton: Would reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050. Would partner with Oregon in its mandated target of 25 percent renewable energy by 2025.
\
Obama: Would reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050. Wants to require that 25 percent of electricity come from renewable sources by 2025.
\
COUNTY TIMBER PAYMENTS
\
Clinton: Wants to restore and make permanent the recently expired federal subsidies to Oregon and Northwest counties that are forgoing timber-harvest receipts.
\
Obama: Supports restoring county timber payments, coupled with the pursuit of ""a meaningful, long-term solution"" to give counties money necessary for good schools and a sustainable economy.
\
ECONOMY
\
Clinton: Wants to provide $25 billion in grants to help poor people pay heating bills. Would invest $10 billion in added unemployment insurance for those who can't find work. Wants to encourage green-collar jobs with incentives to clean technology companies through a $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund from windfall profits taxes on the oil industry.
\
Obama: Wants a $30 billion second stimulus package. Wants to expand clean technology jobs through a federal investment program to help manufacturers modernize and teach workers new skills for green-collar jobs. Will create a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank to provide $60 billion over 10 years to transportation infrastructure.
\
EDUCATION
\
Clinton: Advocates ending No Child Left Behind. Calls for Head Start and pre-kindergarten for all 4-year-olds. Would cut minority dropout rate in half.
\
Obama: Wants to reform No Child Left Behind. Wants to help parents take a greater role in their child's education at home and at school. Would reduce the high school dropout rate.
\
FOREST POLICY
\
Clinton: Wants Oregon to have more federally protected wilderness, on par, proportionally, with other states in the West. Would restore President Bill Clinton's roadless area rule that President Bush reversed. Would increase harvest levels on federal forests by developing plans ""to appropriately thin"" without returning to old, wholesale logging techniques.
\
Obama: Says not enough Oregon land is set aside as wilderness (4 percent), compared to Washington (10 percent) and California (14 percent). Supports sustainable-yield forestry and would provide technical assistance to practitioners on private forests. Will promote biomass energy production that uses forest-derived fuels. Supports ban on import of illegally harvested foreign wood products.
\
HEALTH CARE
\
Clinton: Would require everyone to get health insurance. Employers and government would subsidize costs. Clinton wants two means of providing coverage: a purchasing pool of private plans that would offer coverage similar to that federal employees get, and a public plan that would be comparable to Medicare.
\
Obama: Would require that all children get coverage. Those adults without insurance could buy into a government-run plan. Those who already have insurance could get a premium education of up to $2,500 a year.
\
IRAQ
\
Clinton: Voted in 2002 to authorize the president to conduct the Iraq war. Said two years later she did not regret the vote ""because at the time it was in the context of weapons of mass destruction, grave threats to the United States."" She now says she was among the many of American citizens and leaders misled into their early support of the invasion. Wants to start withdrawing troops within two months of taking office and to get most troops out by the end of 2013.
\
Obama: Opposed the U.S.-led invasion during the 2002 build up, warning it would lead to ""an occupation of undetermined length, with undetermined costs and undetermined consequences."" Now vows to begin immediate pullout of combat troops at a pace that would complete the withdrawal in 16 months. Wants Iraqi leaders to reach a new reconciliation accord, followed by a United Nations-convened Iraq constitutional convention.
\
GAS PRICES
\
Clinton: Supports a summer ""tax holiday"" between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Would make up for the estimated $9 billion in lost tax revenues with a windfall-profits tax on wealthy oil companies. Has attacked Obama for saying ""no"" to the gas tax holiday.
\
Obama: Has decried the gas tax holiday as an election-year gimmick, although he supported a similar state-level tax reprieve in the Illinois Legislature.
\
LNG SITING
\
Clinton: Voted against energy bill that, among other things, removed states' role in authorizing liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals - an issue at the time in her state of New York. Supports restoring that authority and highlights this as Oregonians voice opposition to such development.
\
Obama: Voted for the energy bill, saying he supported some elements but disliked others. Now supports restoring states' authority over LNG terminal siting.
\
MORTGAGE CRISIS
\
Clinton: Wants a $30 billion emergency housing fund for states and cities to draw on. Money would mitigate the effects of foreclosures. Calls for a 90-day freeze on subprime foreclosures and a rate cap on subprime mortgages of at least five years.
\
Obama: Will crack down on fraudulent brokers and lenders. He will also expand disclosure requirements to homebuyers to make sure they have ""honest and complete information about their mortgage options."" Wants to create a tax credit to all middle-class homeowners.
\
SALMON RESTORATION
\
Clinton: Vows to stop the slide of wild salmon population. Will convene stakeholders that value fish and that would be affected by possible restrictions on water diversion and pollution. Does not favor dam breaching for salmon recovery but thinks all options should remain on the table.
\
Obama: Will implement ""a meaningful salmon recovery plan,"" based on advice of fishers, farmers, Indian tribes, environmentalists and foresters. Sees limits on industrial, wastewater and runoff pollution as part of the solution.
\
TAXES
\
Clinton: Would repeal the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000. Would seek $40 billion in tax rebates to working and middle class families if economy worsens.
\
Obama: Would repeal the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000. Also wants to raise capital gains taxes and cut taxes through a $1,000 per family credit and a reduction for elderly, low-income workers.

Hospital and downtown development strike community chords
\
It was neck and neck during five days of online voting, but ultimately readers of The Register-Guard declared the ongoing ""hospital tales"" involving PeaceHealth and McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center to be the top local story of 2007.
\
Running a very close second: the twists and turns of redevelopment strategies for downtown Eugene.
\
Construction continued apace on PeaceHealth's mammoth new hospital, RiverBend, slated to open in north Springfield next August. But we suspect the year's biggest hospital news, in the eyes of many readers, was the acknowledgment by McKenzie-Willamette's new corporate owners that they are looking at alternative sites for a new hospital in addition to the back nine holes of the RiverRidge Golf Course.
\
That site, off North Delta Highway in north Eugene, has drawn stiff opposition from neighbors and the city of Eugene's planning commission.
\
A total of 215 readers responded to the newspaper's invitation to rate the year's top local stories. Nearly twice as many readers identified downtown as the year's top story as did those who cited hospital developments, yet the latter earned more total votes in a 1- through-10 scoring scheme. Our speculation: Most readers felt the hospitals merited mention somewhere in their top 10 lists, while downtown's fate was seen by many as either really big news - or barely news at all.
\
The self-selected reader poll is unequivocally unscientific - but no more so than each year's newsroom poll (see related story). Readers were asked to identify their top 10 stories from a list of 25 culled from this year's front pages of The Register-Guard.
\
A few readers e-mailed story topics missing from the online list: an investigative report on Pacific Seafoods owner Frank Dulcich; the efforts of local residents to preserve the Amazon Creek headwaters and Madison Meadow; and the state football championships claimed by Sheldon, Marist, Mohawk and Gold Beach high schools.
\
Most, however, found plenty of worthy candidates among the contenders listed - and selected Eugene's downtown as the year's No. 2 story.
\
While city voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to commit $40 million in public urban renewal funds, few suggested they were ready to give up on downtown.
\
For most, the question remains not whether but how downtown should be re-created. Many residents, for example, said they're not convinced it requires public subsidies for parking garages or chain stores.
\
In other downtown ups and downs: Whole Foods Market confirmed early in the year that it was pulling the plug on a proposed new store along East Broadway, and Enterprise Rent-a-Car announced late in the year its plans to open a call center at the former Symantec building.
\
In stark contrast to Eugene's development woes, the city of Springfield found itself in the throes of a downtown revival, aided by the well-received opening of the Richard Wildish Community Theater on Main Street. Readers selected Springfield's revival as their No. 6 story.
\
Springfield voters easily approved an urban renewal proposal that will allow the city to spend up to $43 million in tax money for downtown area upgrades. City leaders, meanwhile, had little trouble persuading the Legislature to pass a law that allows Springfield to set its own urban growth boundary without seeking Eugene's approval.
\
About the only thing that didn't go right for Springfield in 2007: The town lost out in a 14-city contest to host the worldwide premiere of ""The Simpsons Movie"" - starring the iconic animated family that hails from a community called Springfield.
\
Back on track
\
In Eugene, downtown may be struggling - but not the city's reputation as Track Town USA ... Forever.
\
Even as renovation of Hayward Field continued apace in anticipation of the 2008 U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials, word arrived in early December that the city had also landed the 2012 Olympic Trials.
\
The Duck men's and women's cross-country teams placed first and second in the nation, respectively, and the men's track team captured a Pac-10 title. Add in a successful inaugural Eugene Marathon, and it was hard to argue against the Track Town mantel. Readers certainly thought so, giving Track Town a high billing - and elevating the University of Oregon in another top 10 category as well.
\
The athletic department made plenty of news off the playing fields - generating a No. 9 placement on readers' list. Longtime sports booster Pat Kilkenny was hired as the university's new athletic director and promptly announced that baseball and competitive cheerleading would be added to the roster of intercollegiate sports. Kilkenny also pushed forward plans to build a new basketball arena near campus.
\
Kilkenny's hire was not without controversy, given that the former insurance company executive helped put up the money to buy out predecessor Bill Moos' contract, attended but never graduated from the UO, and claimed little previous experience with intercollegiate athletics.
\
A UO-related tragedy also qualified as one of readers' top stories: the disappearance of math professor Daming Xu. An exhaustive search failed to find Xu, who didn't return from what was supposed to be a day hike in the Three Sisters Wilderness.
\
Readers made clear their belief that ""the global is local"" with their choice for the year's No. 3 story: the war in Iraq.
\
The year saw local veterans struggling to adapt to civilian life, protesters seeking to end the war, and news that 3,500 members of the Oregon National Guard can expect to be dispatched to Iraq in 2009.
\
Soldiers killed in Iraq in 2007 included Army Spc. Joe Kenny of Veneta, Marine Lance Cpl. Steven Stacy of Coos Bay and Sgt. 1st Class Adrian Elizalde of North Bend.
\
At the polls
\
Readers determined that the biggest political news of 2007 was from two state measures on the November ballot. Voters in Lane County and Oregon supported Measure 49, a not-so-fast response to the Measure 37 property rights law approved three years earlier. But they rejected Measure 50, which would have increased cigarette taxes to fund health care for children. The measure set a campaign record, with the tobacco industry spending more than $11 million to defeat it.
\
In another story that rated top 10 billing, voters in Eugene and Junction City nixed gas tax proposals to help fund street repairs. In other tax matters, residents across Lane County easily rejected an income tax proposal to pay for law enforcement programs, and taxpayers everywhere whooped in joy when the state mailed more than $1 billion in ""kicker"" refund checks.
\
The Democrat-controlled Legislature presided over a short but productive session whose winners included public education, the environment, unions and gay rights advocates. But the biggest legislative issue, according to Register-Guard readers, was field burning. Lane County commissioners at one point threatened to sue over the issue after the Legislature resisted pleas to ban the practice.
\
The year's biggest economics news was the increase in home foreclosures. Reflecting a national trend, foreclosures in Lane County nearly doubled from the previous year as more homeowners turned to the subprime market in the face of higher home values and a bland economy.
\
In local courtrooms, the biggest local story was Operation Backfire - the sentencing of 10 members of ""The Family,"" a group of radical activists who engaged in arson and other eco-sabotage in Lane County and across five states. Some of the defendants were deemed to have met the federal government's definition of ""terrorist,"" a label that added months or years to their sentences.
\
Other stories that missed the top 10 roster include the successful debut of Lane Transit District's EmX bus rapid transit line; the investigation of fumes beneath homes in the Trainsong neighborhood next to the Union Pacific railyard; and a debate over whether to move the Lane County fairgrounds to a new site in west Eugene.
\
Duck season
\
In sports news, the UO once again loomed large. Beyond track and field, Duck athletic squads had a stellar year: The men's basketball team reached the Elite Eight in March Madness; the football team flirted with the national championship title before a certain knee injury dashed the dream; and a reborn volleyball team reached the Sweet 16 semifinals.
\
Another sports-related story: the city's support of an understaffed police department's proposal not to prosecute tailgaters in private lots next to Autzen Stadium on home football game dates.
\
For some, concerns about the Ducks' athletic future washed away when Nike president and UO alum Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, donated $100 million to the university's athletics department - the largest gift in UO history.
\
A few months later, benefactor Lorry Lokey made the largest contribution ever to the UO's academic programs - more than $74 million. Lokey earlier in the year had already contributed $10.4 million to the university.
\
Sports and race collided in the story of a state investigator who confirmed that Portland area students were subjected to repeated racial slurs and taunts by students and adults who attended the state basketball tournament at McArthur Court in March.
\
Church and state intersected when the Archdiocese of Portland won approval of its bankruptcy reorganization, allowing it to settle claims with victims of clergy sex abuse while avoiding the sale of parish assets.
\
A spate of hit-and-run and drunken-driving incidents added new tears to the community fabric. Victims included community activist Lucy Lahr, and Eugene Symphony members Kjersten Oquist and Angela Svendsen.
\
In Florence, the mayor survived a recall election in the aftermath of a decision to let a builder erect a condo that obscures a cherished view of the Siuslaw River, and a casino expanded to bigger digs. In Cottage Grove, city officials gave Wal-Mart a conditional go-ahead to ""super-size"" its mammoth store.
\
In south Eugene, residents mourned the loss of revered video rental store Flicks and Pics, and pondered the fate of Civic Stadium, which the Eugene School District may or may not sell some day.
\
For some, 2007 was the year that the UO Duck was grounded for unsportsmanlike conduct after roughing up the Houston Cougar. For others, the highlight was the Hult Center's 25th birthday. And for still others, it was the heart-tugging story of Isabelle Costa, only 10 months old when she underwent extensive, lifesaving open heart surgery at the University of Michigan for a rare combination of heart defects.
\
Two readers, meanwhile, decided that the year's top story was one that is sure to be with us in 2008, as it is every year: the weather.
\
We don't know if they were thinking about the school-canceling snow in January, the triple-digit temperatures in July, or the windstorms that blew down trees and knocked out electrical power in December. Maybe all of the above.

195,"A plan to cut Oregonians' greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles might not get a fair hearing in the 2015 Legislature.\The concept is called the low carbon fuel standard; that is, encouraging production and sale of vehicle fuels that contain less carbon. A significant question is whether the legislation constitutes a ""hidden gas tax"" that will hurt Oregon families, businesses and nonprofits, especially in rural areas.\On Monday, the first day of the 2015 Legislature, a Senate committee held a lengthy public hearing on the proposal, Senate Bill 324. Afterward, the committee chairman denounced opponents.\""Today it was made clear that the opponents of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon are making theoretical claims based on incomplete information,"" said Sen. Chris Edwards, D-Eugene, who heads the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee.\Edwards reiterated that belief on Tuesday when contacted by the Statesman Journal Editorial Board. ""There's no question in my mind that it's good policy,"" he said.\He said he analyzed most of the objections and decided they lacked merit, but he was seeking more information on a couple of price-related concerns.\Edwards expects the bill to move to the Senate floor within a week: ""If we have the votes, we're passing the bill.""\Bad move.\Instead, Senate President Peter Courtney or other savvy legislative leaders should call a timeout. The bill is a priority of the Democratic majority, but whether it constitutes sound public policy remains unclear.\In certainly is not good for Oregon when all involved have their minds made up from the outset: Legislative Democrats and Gov. John Kitzhaber are in love with the bill; Republicans are dead-set against it.\Are there no legislative curmudgeons who can make their colleagues pause to ponder two obvious questions: ""What could possibly go wrong?"" and ""Are there better, collaborative ways to achieve these same goals?""\The bill would position Oregon as a North American leader, joining California and British Columbia in reducing use of fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change.\However, given Oregon's small size, the provisions would have little global effect. It might be much more effective to collaborate on preventing greenhouse-gas-emitting wildfires through thinning of federal and state forests.\Democrats have the legislative majority to pass SB 324 without Republican votes. If that happens, the low carbon fuel standard could turn into the Oregon version of the constant congressional wrangling over the Affordable Care Act.\If SB 324 is as worthwhile as supporters contend, there is no need to rush it in the Legislature. It will stand up to more scrutiny. It will show its worth. There will be time for its potential effects to be validated by reputable, independent, disinterested analysts who have no political, ideological or financial interests in the outcome.\Oregon's governor and legislators should have learned from the Cover Oregon debacle that trying to be a national leader without doing the proper homework and supervision can backfire badly.\As Senate Republican Leader Ted Ferrioli told the Senate committee on Monday, ""Oregon is the capital of unintended consequences.""\More discussion\Senate Bill 324 is scheduled for a public hearing and a possible work session on Wednesday.\The Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources meets at 3 p.m. in Hearing Room C of the Capitol.

Time to keep your eyes peeled.\Here are some things to watch:\A bill that would make sure women are paid the same rate as men for the same work is headed for final passage in the House.\House Bill 2005, the Oregon Equal Pay Act of 2017, also bans the practice of screening job applicants based on their salary histories, strengthens penalties for wage discrimination violations, and adds remedies for workers facing pay disparities.\The vote is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Monday on the House floor, but may take place later in the week.\A plan to replace Oregon's corporate income tax with a gross receipts tax on business sales -- and generate increased and more stable tax revenues -- may emerge as early as Tuesday's meeting of the Joint Tax Reform Committee.\Rep. Mark Hass, D-Beaverton, who is chairman of the Tax Reform Committee, said a bill with specifics will drop some time in the coming week. The tax committee has mulled a 0.48 tax on income over $1 million in recent weeks.\Earlier, House Speaker Tina Kotek proposed a 0.95 percent gross receipts tax on annual business sales in excess of $5 million.\Supporters say the state needs a gross receipts tax because of a structural mismatch that leaves the state short of cash even in the best of times. Opponents say the solution is to rein in spending.\The Tax Reform Committee meets at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday in Hearing Room A.\The public can weigh in on a bill that would impose a 10-year ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.\Supporters say the state does not have sufficient regulations in place to ensure the environment is protected from the practice, which involves injecting water, sand, and chemicals into rock under high pressure to fracture it and make crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy more accessible.\The Oregon House passed House Bill 2711 last month. The Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources will decide whether to send it to the Senate floor for a final vote.\The meeting begins at 3 p.m. Monday in Hearing Room C.\A committee that has been working for a year to put together a long-term transportation funding package will decide what's in and what's out of a bill that will be drafted for consideration.\Among the options: raising the state gas tax, increasing vehicle title and registration fees, instituting a new tax on bicycles and new cars, and implementing a payroll tax.\Committee leaders are aiming to hold a public hearing on the bill on May 31.\The Joint Committee on Transportation Preservation and Modernization meets at 5:30 p.m. Monday in Hearing Room F.\The Nine Tribes Spring Celebration continues this week with an American Indian Week Exhibit in the Galleria West.

Support mental health funding
\
Diane Magoto has it right: conditions at our state mental facilities are not what they should be (letters, Jan.29), but restructuring the system is too simplistic a correction.
\
Because most patients have not received adequate mental health care early in the course of their illnesses, they have deteriorated, and by the time they reach a state facility they often have serious co-existing medical problems plus addictions to alcohol and other drugs.
\
Facilities have been understaffed and underfunded for years. Too few personnel are striving heroically, with woefully inadequate resources, to treat severely mentally ill patients who present challenges that would make a saint weep.
\
Moreover, the public has unrealistic expectations of the outcome of treatment. Pharmaceutical ads and TV shows imply that if the right medication is prescribed in conjunction with compassionate talk therapy, recovery is assured.
\
Sadly, that is not always the case. Some people are beyond the reach of treatments presently available, and others refuse to cooperate with treatment. Treatment does not always lead to a healthy, productive life outside the hospital. Some people do quite well in a structured environment but cannot maintain a responsible, self-sufficient life on their own. Nonetheless, we can't seem to muster enough political will to create long-term, humane residential facilities that provide safety, respect, community and work options appropriate to people's level of functioning.
\
So let's don't ""throw the bums out."" Instead, let's give our mental health system the money and resources it needs to do a difficult job effectively.

Money for sports, but not jobs
\
It blows my mind that the powers-that-be in this state have no trouble floating hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds for sports arenas for their temples of higher sports and other nonessential toys.
\
In the meantime, the state's infrastructure is going down the tubes, companies are vacating the state and jobs paying livable wages are few and far between.
\
It might not hurt to get rid of the game mentality and get into a permanent job mentality. How far down the tubes does the state have to go before the powers-that-be and the working class wake up?

Bush and cohorts ruined nation
\
We have President Bush and his cohorts who have systemically gone about destroying our country on a multitude of levels.
\
A study by the Center for Public Integrity ""counted 935 false statements in a two-year period"" made by Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld about Iraq and its supposed weapons that resulted in this terrible war. They created an illegal war that has killed and maimed thousands of brave young Americans as well as tens of thousands of Iraqis.
\
America has become an outcast, a pariah among the world's nations. This war has and is creating an insurmountable national debt.
\
Bush's policies have drained our national and natural resources, led to an economy headed for recession, resulted in millions who have lost their homes and made our dollar one of the weakest currencies in the industrial world. Bush, Cheney and friends achieved the results the terrorists intended.
\
Our education, Social Security, jobs, housing, transportation and environment have all seriously suffered from the policies of this administration and Congress.
\
Bush's friends have lost billions of our tax dollars. Yet, with all of this, our Congress spends years, millions of dollars more of our tax money and thousands of hours of our congressional time investigating sports entertainment and steroids and criminally charging athletes.
\
This is more waste and lunacy in a time when our country and our people need dramatic reforms and action.

Nonprofits can always use help
\
According to Renee Irvin (Register-Guard, Jan. 20), 3,500 small nonprofits in Oregon have strength in numbers.
\
But sheer numbers does not mean that these 3,500 organizations have adequate financing to fulfill their missions.
\
As the monetary support for large nonprofits has decreased in the past few years, these organizations have required increased funding from private foundations and individuals. The many small nonprofits have fewer options for funding.
\
Cooperation and creativity is the way small nonprofits can use their sheer numbers to thrive in these times of tight finances. They can share office space, equipment and even staff. The options are as varied as the organizations and their missions.
\
Nonprofit organizations need support from the residents of Lane County.
\
Members for their boards of directors who have business experience and volunteers to help deliver program and assist in their offices are always needed. How can you help?

Piercy is a great fit for Eugene
\
There is a definite irony in Eugene's popular mayor, Kitty Piercy, being attacked by a few from both the left and the right, while a majority of Eugene's citizens support her.
\
She has been criticized by some from the left, as she has tackled such thorny issues as transportation infrastructure and the future of downtown. These issues, of course, affect all of us, and there is no single progressive approach to them.
\
Criticism from the right, as seen in several recent letters to the editor, is perhaps easier to understand as Piercy is the first solid progressive to serve as mayor and has brought to City Hall proposals addressing sustainability, homelessness and responsibly managed growth. She has also taken on problems that are of a concern to the business community, staying true to her promise to be a mayor for all Eugene.
\
Kitty Piercy has a rare combination of progressivism, practicality and passion. It's hard to imagine a mayor, or a candidate for that office, that would be a better fit for Eugene.

Eugene needs a different mayor
\
In Eugene, things seem to be out of control.
\
The City Council's vote on the gas tax is another example of its disregard for what citizens said at the ballot box (only Councilor Mike Clark opposed it).
\
How many votes of the people can this council and the mayor disregard? This is not a democracy.
\
How can these things happen in our city? The police auditor and human rights commission office doors are locked because the occupants don't feel safe.
\
Potholes create a serious driving hazard. We have the lowest ratio of police to population in the nation.
\
Did you know some of our leaders are proposing a Carbon Neutral Conference at taxpayers' expense? And Mayor Kitty Piercy and southeast Eugene councilors want to condemn private property that is really just a private nature preserve for a few of their political contributors. It's time for change.
\
After voters resoundingly tell the leaders that they don't want to spend taxes on downtown development, the leaders are still holding public forums to develop a new City Hall.
\
And who paid for the survey that asked about how well the mayor is doing? Your tax dollars.
\
That's not fair during a primary election. Maybe fair and equitable don't mean much in Eugene any more.
\
We need change, and it should start with the office of mayor. This community deserves government that listens to the diverse voices throughout Eugene.

Don't change Social Security
\
If you have not recently taken the time to reflect on the implications of today's unstable financial market on funds held in 401(k) retirement plans, get out your pencil and take a look.
\
Remember that it was not long ago that there was a serious proposal being fronted to blend 401(k)s into a solution for the predicted Social Security shortfall.
\
My observations are that 401(k) portfolios have taken a hit of between 10 percent to 15 percent in the last four to six months. At this writing I am not sure if they will continue to decline further; and I don't know when and at what pace they will rebound.
\
I do know that the uncertainty is discomforting and scary.
\
Social Security's program commitment should be one of stability to the recipients. Given that we look to Social Security as a cash flow threshold for eligible citizens to use as a base on which to live their life and sustain their well being, who among us want to be part of an approach that would diminish their capacity, especially if it is to happen in an inflationary economy?
\
I hope you'll reach the same conclusion - that Social Security funding should remain grounded in the threshold approach and that tinkerings that would take it to the open market should be avoided.
\
The 401(k) is an excellent supplemental retirement savings vehicle, but it would be unwise to dilute the Social Security program with a 401(k) that is vulnerable to market cycles.

198,"To hear the full conversation with House Speaker Lynn Snodgrass, tune in to KOPB Radio (91.5 FM) at 1 p.m. Monday, Oct. 30. \REPUBLICAN ISSUES CHALLENGE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE \Snodgrass says her business background is asset to office \The House speaker defends her role in state education spending. \Statesman Journal \Lynn Snodgrass, speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives, is seeking a four-year term as secretary of state in the Nov. 7 election. \Before winning office, Snodgrass worked as a teacher, personnel manager and landscape designer. She is an owner of Drake's 7 Dee's Garden Center and Landscape Co. \She was elected to the House in 1995 after serving on the Damascus School Board. She was elected majority leader in 1997 and speaker in 1999. \If elected, Snodgrass pledges to improve schools and secure the funding children need; help run government more efficiently; make sure the state's tax surplus is refunded; and protect voter rights and the initiative system. \An interview with Bill Bradbury, the Democratic candidate for secretary of state, was published in the newspaper Monday. \Snodgrass discussed her candidacy with reporters and editors. Excerpts: \Question: Could you describe the other duties of the secretary of state beyond audits and elections oversight and membership on the State Land Board? \Answer: I sure can. Another elevated responsibility of the secretary of state's office is over the corporation division. You oversee the business information center as well as the corporation division. \I think we've underutilized the corporation division in the past. By that I mean that that is the very first stopping point, if you will, for a new business in our state. And I hope to make that particular area, in addition to the paperwork aspect, a starting point of marketing Oregon also. I want more venture capital coming to our state. \We need to rely, not just on the businesses that are here, but on new venture capital that comes into the state. And we have missed that as an opportunity in the past. I do want to make sure that more things come online so that we can make it easier for businesses to deal with the issues that they need to deal with with the state more convenient. \There's another duty that may be a responsibility of the secretary of state and it'll take the Legislature to approve that - the cultural task force, the cultural trust fund. There's a group gathering together right now because of a bill that I passed this last session that combines all of the arts in all of the state together. And this particular group has decided that it should go under the authority of the secretary of state. I was delighted that they came up with that. \Q: Why are you the best qualified candidate? \A: Well, I'm the best qualified candidate because of my business background, also because of my teaching background and my recent experience in the Legislature, and because I understand keenly how term limits actually limit the information that the House and Senate members have available to them. I want to make sure that the business perspective that I have puts a tool in the tool kit for the House members and the Senate members. \We need to do a better job in the secretary of state's office of auditing, and it's how you ask the questions. You can ask the question, ""Are you spending the money?"" Or you can ask the question, ""How well are you spending the money?"" And I would ask the question, ""How well are you spending the money?"" so that the inefficient programs that are out there can be eliminated. \Not only will I be getting rid of bad programs, or making suggestions to the Legislature and to the governor that certain programs are not effective anymore, that will loosen up dollars for those good programs that I also will be showcasing. \Q: You say you support education, but the state teachers' union endorsed Bill Bradbury and many school advocates criticize you and other Republican leaders for not supporting adequate school funding last year. How do you respond? \A: Well, first of all let's talk about the union. The union did not support me, and in large part the union didn't support me because I'm a Republican. There are many, many teachers in the state that are in favor of not only my principles, not only my perspective on things, but also my attitude and perspective on education. The union has supported Democrats by and large for decades and it's no different this particular time. Until last session, I believe, it was in the 80th percentile that they would endorse Democrats over Republicans. Now it's down to about 70 percent. \The other part of your question is that there are some who were critical that the funding wasn't high enough. Well, the funding was much higher than the governor's recommended budget. We fought tooth and nail all session - the House and the Senate - to try to increase the money. \I would also remind you that we funded education at a 10 percent increase. Actually, it was a little bit higher than the number, that COSA, one of the educational organizations suggested at the first of session. So for me, personally, that was a target. \Q: How do you contrast yourself to Bill Bradbury? \A: I've been in the private sector in business for 26 years, and my opponent, Bill Bradbury, has not. I have been a balanced legislator, if you will, meaning that when I was the speaker of the House, I made sure that not only the Democrats and Republicans but also the independent that I had in the House, were all treated fairly and that we made sure that the issues that went through were in a bipartisan basis. If you look at the record, you will see that that happened over and over again. \I also wanted to make sure that not only my business experience comes through, but again that my education experience. comes through. When I talk about squeezing waste out of state government, I talk about asking the right questions. \His approach is, ""Well, we don't have enough money so let's add a tax."" And if you look at his record, he's sponsored many bills that increased the taxes whether it was a sales tax or a gas tax. \Q: What will be your philosophy for making decisions as a State Land Board member? \A: I'm in a great position to make good decisions, but also to challenge in a good debating kind of format decisions that we make on the Land Board. And I say that because I do have an environmental background, being a landscape owner and a garden center owner. \We've been in the environmental business for 26 years plus, and I've also been a school teacher and a school board member that has had to make those tough decisions when the revenues from the Common School Fund were going down. So I'm sitting on the Land Board along with the treasurer and with the governor understanding all sides of that issue and being able to be a devil's advocate. \Having someone at the table that's been in private business for a number of years I think is an asset. And unfortunately we haven't had anybody on the Land Board for the last decade that has that private business background. \Q: How do you respond to criticism that you presided over a very partisan legislative session? \A: Well, I don't agree with it. That's howI respond to it. I was the speaker of the first term-limited environment in the state Legislature and that does change the environment totally. \When I looked out at the House of Representatives I had 26 brand new members; almost half were brand new. I needed to teach them the process as well as their peers did. The first thing that I did with the House members, every single one of them, is I took private time with them and talked about what their priorities were and what committees they wanted. I put every single member on a committee that was either their first or second or third choice and most got their first choice and third or second and third. So I started the session off and continued all the way through by empowering them, by putting them where they wanted to be. \I will conclude by saying that I did everything that I could to give information to the people that needed the information on an ongoing basis. I met with the minority leader, the majority leader, and the independent leader on a weekly basis. We talked, it was open. They had total access to my office all session. \Also in the race \Lloyd Marbet and E.J. ""Ed"" Pole II also are candidates for secretary of state. \Marbet, the Pacific Green Party nominee, works as a caretaker and is a citizen activist who has defended the initiative and referendum system. His campaign can be reached at www.marbet.org or call (503) 771-7254. \Pole, the Libertarian Party nominee, works as an engineer for Intel.

Torrey is a leader with integrity
\
My 18-year-old daughter is voting for the first time, an important milestone in her life. She recently went to a debate with various local candidates and observed that mean girls, bullies and rude people are not just in high school. Welcome to the adult world of politics!
\
She and a friend decided to vote for Lane County Commissioner Bobby Green - not because they fully understand his policies but because the ""other guy"" was so mean-spirited and rude. They were also appalled at the rude behavior toward Jim Torrey by an opponent and her supporters.
\
It always troubles me when people misrepresent, exaggerate and malign others for their own personal gain. I see this again in this campaign toward Torrey. He was asked, ""Why don't you fight back the same way?"" His response was, ""I won't."" It's not that he can't, he won't.
\
I challenge and encourage people to go to his Web site orhis campaign headquarters, or to talk with him. Don't believe everything you hear or read from one-sided opinions.
\
Ask questions; find out why he is an Independent. He'll also listen to you. Torrey's not perfect; after all, he is a human and a politician. But he is an amazing public servant, having already served in so many ways seen and unseen.
\
Jim Torrey is a leader with integrity who does care about Eugene families, business, the homeless and the environment. He is someone my daughter can trust and respect.

Piercy responds to suggestions
\
It is rare for a business to affect the heart of a community, but Flicks 'n Pics, the now-closed movie rental store, was such a place.
\
On Friday nights, the smell of popcorn and the opportunity for good conversation were as welcome and expected as my morning coffee.
\
It's a comfort to know that most of their unique movie collection can be rented from the Eugene Public Library. What may not be known is that the library's purchase of the collection would not have happened without quick action by Mayor Kitty Piercy.
\
After reading an article in The Register-Guard of the pending sale of the Flicks 'n Pics movie inventory
\
in just a few short days, I contacted Piercy and asked her if the Eugene Public Library could purchase the collection. She immediately contacted library cultural services and the collection was bought from its civic-minded owners.
\
Although the mayor's action may not rank as high as issues raised in the heat of a contentious political campaign, to me it demonstrates how Piercy quietly and effectively gets the job done. I've lived in Eugene since 1978, and this is the first time I've felt that a mayor would take my suggestions or concerns seriously.
\
Regrettably, Flicks 'n Pics is gone due to changing video technology and economics. But I'm told the former owners are pleased with the outcome. Thanks to Piercy, both the collection and legacy of a much-beloved neighborhood video rental store continue.

High gasoline prices are good
\
I'm really disappointed that none of our leaders, either on the left or right in the political or public-opinion arenas, have had the guts to acknowledge one glaringly obvious fact: high gasoline prices are a good thing.
\
The global warming phenomenon that is about to overwhelm our environment and topple our way of life is driven by our over-consumption and waste of energy. Anything that will reduce our appetite for oil should be greeted with open arms. Instead, we demand that our leaders rein in the oil companies, lower gas taxes, invade Middle Eastern nations and otherwise do whatever it takes to keep the flow of oil running at top capacity until the last drop is sucked from the ground. Rather than reduce consumption,we've started to burn our food supply for fuel.
\
I have a practical suggestion for any candidate who is willing to stop pandering and start dealing with the problem. We need to make fundamental changes to our lifestyle in order to slow the rate of climate change. Since long commutes are a major factor in our gasoline consumption,encouraging people to live closer to work will be a big step.
\
I propose a carrot and stick approach: offer massive tax breaks for people who will move to within five miles of their place of work; and raise the federal gas tax to 25 percent of the price.
\
This may seem drastic, but you know what they say about desperate times.

Rob Handy for Lane County commissioner? Absolutely! Handy is a hard-working populist in the classic Oregon sense: Broad-based constituency, working for the common good and not special interests, looking to the future.

It doesn't take a genius to see that the world our children will be adults in will be very different in terms of resources and economics. In our community, we need people in leadership positions who are ready to embrace these issues with flexibility, intellect and forward thinking for the common good.

As an employer of the county commissioner, I believe that I will get the greatest value for my money with Handy, and I believe that unless you are one of the privileged few, you will, too. If you want business as usual, vote for someone else. My vote is for Rob Handy.

Piercy sees beyond profiteering
\
When I moved to Oregon, my maternal grandfather's home state, I told people who asked where I was from that I was a refugee.
\
""From where?"" they'd ask. ""From the Los Angeles basin,"" I'd reply. A puzzled look usually followed.
\
Growing up after World War II, the citrus and avocado groves, the lettuce, bean and tomato fields, the flower and dairy farms surrounding our towns had all but disappeared in 20 short years. They were replaced by oceans of tract homes, malls and freeways - unbridled development. The air became polluted, the water a chemical soup with few parks or open spaces.
\
Returning from a job in Wyoming, I came through Oregon's Columbia Gorge. Awed, I heard grandfather calling and moved in with my backpack. Unbridled development can make a beautiful place toxic and unlivable in a very short time. Many Oregonians don't realize this, although in 1970, ""Don't Californicate Oregon"" was a popular bumper sticker.
\
The Register-Guard's list of Jim Torrey's contributors raises concerns. I am voting for Kitty Piercy because she has exhibited the vision, stamina, humor and courage to look beyond short-term profiteering and resource extraction to an inclusive view of our common future. She invites all players to the table, while upholding principles that demand accountability, sustainable business practices and wise ecological and economic development.
\
She's not perfect, but monetary profit is not her bottom line. Nature's health cannot be bought back.
\
Oregonians are innovative and forward thinking. Piercy is worthy of the job and deserves our support.

Costner could help save Civic
\
The May 2 Register-Guard reported that Kevin Costner may be coming to town with his band, Modern West, to perform a concert in support of a new baseball stadium for the University of Oregon.
\
Does Costner know that the new UO stadium may lead to the destruction of Civic Stadium?
\
I would like to see Costner and his band perform, but unless the show is a benefit to save Civic Stadium I will not attend. If it can be arranged as at least a partial benefit for Civic Stadium, I will do my best to be there.
\
If I had a way to contact Costner, I would invite him to an Ems game at Civic Stadium this summer. I believe if he attended even one game there he would appreciate this beautiful, historic structure and would himself work to keep it from being torn down.

Piercy is mayor Eugene needs
\
I read in the April 22 Register-Guard that Springfield is considering whether and how to assist the owners of mobile homes in the Patrician Mobile Home Park who will have to relocate because of development.
\
While Kitty Piercy has been mayor, Eugene has improved assistance for mobile home owners who are displaced because of development and personally lobbied the Legislature to allow Eugene to require more protections than the state requires.When mobile home owners in Eugene are required to vacate a mobile home park because of development, they are able to get reasonable assistance with their moving costs from the property owner.
\
That is the kind of mayor Eugene needs.

A display of petulance
\
Rep. Bob Ney (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Administration Committee, has ordered all House restaurants to start serving ""freedom fries"" and ""freedom toast"" rather than ""french fries"" or ""french toast"" as a sign of the U.S. government's displeasure at the French government's having dared to exercise its freedom in reaching its own conclusions for its own reasons.
\
I suppose the next measure will be to direct the National Park Service to put a plaque on the Statue of Liberty saying that it is a gift from some unknown donor.
\
Many might think that the congressman's action is an embarrassing display of pique. I do not.

Founders feared theocracy
\
Norm Fox's viewpoint (Register-Guard, March 9) is a propaganda piece masquerading as a fact sheet.
\
If you actually read Thomas Jefferson's opinions regarding religion and government, you realize that Fox, not Jonathan Turley (Register-Guard, March 2), is doing most of the fantasizing. In his ""Notes on the State of Virginia,"" Jefferson wrote: ""Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the advent of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned."" To what effect? ""To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites.""
\
Fox claims that the Supreme Court, in 1947, took Jefferson's ""separation metaphor out of its context."" Nonsense. I've read Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists, and it is a pure and clean definition of church-state separation, nothing more, nothing less.
\
I notice Fox doesn't mention the ""Jefferson Bible,"" an intriguing cut-and-paste reduction of the New Testament. Expunged from Jefferson's version are most of the miracles, the Resurrection and the Apocalypse!
\
James Madison, whose views were certainly more conservative than Jefferson's, was just as strong a supporter of church-state separation.
\
I agree that America's founders were religious men. But they feared that theocrats and jingoists would twist religion into a tool of imperial government to launch crusading conquests of other countries and to suppress freedom at home. They had good reason to fear, didn't they?

Wrong people running world
\
Watching the Bush administration plunge ever closer to an extremely unpopular war, it is easy to say ""Those guys are crazy!"" But George W. Bush and those surrounding him are not just ""crazy."" They are clinically, diagnosably delusional.
\
To support that statement we must understand the power structure that produces people like Bush. They spend decades being exhaustively groomed and conditioned to believe in a grossly distorted model of reality. Those not capable of enthusiastically embracing the necessary belief system fall by the wayside - never getting to the top. This includes those with too much honesty and integrity and those insufficiently obsessed with money and power. This leaves us with the alarming situation of having exactly the wrong people running the world.
\
If Bush were intent on representing the best interests of the American people, he would not have been put into office. Indeed, the vast majority of people voted for someone else or didn't vote at all. What the Bush administration does represent is a tiny ruling elite - or more accurately, a non-human corporate/financial machine that is part and parcel with the petroleum and arms industries. In its rampage for global domination, this machine literally wants the world to be a turbulent, unstable place. And thus the people of the world are being dragged into yet another completely unnecessary bloodbath that will not make for greater security here or meaningful democracy in Iraq.

New bridge is pointless
\
Early in grade school, a primary lesson to be learned with our fellow classmates was to carry us throughout our life. It was the skill and fundamental principle of being courteous and attentive to our fellow classmates: simply put, taking one's turn.
\
The Mount Pisgah and Howard Buford Recreation Area is an environment which offers enchantment; it's an open page for one to dream, to speak quietly and to personally address the day or one's life. It's an area to exercise, to recreate and stretch about the many wooded trails. The current one-lane bridge is the door to this special park - a bridge with charm, a country feel and seasoned in its place over the Willamette River. It connects us and serves as the initial key to slowing down and welcoming the beauty of the recreational retreat.
\
The $1.7 million proposed bridge scheduled to replace this currently drivable one-lane bridge seems economically unsound during weak financial times. To build a new bridge to equip more cars seems pointless and imprudent. It is most cost effective if we can remember a basic lesson, just to wait and take one's turn.

Support 'pay-as-you-drive' plan
\
Don't you hate to pay for something you don't get?
\
I understand a 3-cent-per-gallon gas tax because it is equitable: you buy the gas, you use the gas, you pay the tax. Auto insurance is what frosts me. I only drive 6,000 miles a year, but I pay the same as someone who drives 60,000 miles.
\
Pay-as-you-drive insurance will only become a reality if we all support it. This makes sense to both your wallet and the environment.

Rockwork creates hazard
\
The front-page photo on March 8 gives dramatic testimony to the grave danger presented by the Eugene Water & Electric Board's rocky construction across the McKenzie River near Walterville. There is Aaron Helfrich of the McKenzie River Guides Association assessing the hazards of trying to float that section of river, his boat dangerously beached upstream on chevrons constructed by EWEB.
\
Last summer I took a young friend down that same stretch of river. I had assured her parents, lifelong friends, that this was a friendly, gentle stretch of the river. We came around a river bend just above the one pictured in the photo and were stunned to see an enormous dredger and huge gravel hauling truck right in the middle of the river! Where the week before there had been just a glassy section of water, now there were two major ledges spanning the river, one upstream of the other, with just two narrow, misaligned chutes through each. No warning signs had been posted anywhere upstream!
\
Fortunately, the water was high enough that we could pass through, even though it meant avoiding the truck and dredger. There are still no warning signs.
\
I agree with Helfrich that EWEB needs to communicate about its activities on and around the river, not just with people in Leaburg, but with all of us who have an active relationship with this wonderful natural resource. I'm afraid that unless EWEB changes its policies, serious injury or deaths could occur - and if they do, it will be EWEB's fault.

Many of our family will die
\
We need to stop this war before it starts.
\
A recent Oregon Public Broadcasting special detailed, through DNA sampling and photo documentation, how all humanity is related to the same tribe that originated in southern Africa: the Bushmen. Therefore, our sons and daughters, sisters and brothers, include both the Iraqis and our American GIs. Many of our family will die on the battlefields, and during the occupation and worldwide terrorism that will likely follow.
\
As I write, the U.N. Security Council does not support the war, and three of the five permanent members are indicating an intent to veto measures calling for war as the only solution to ridding Iraq of any weapons of mass destruction. Thus, war means a unilateral war without United Nations approval.
\
When the United Nations says no, will the Bush administration still go to war against today's Bushmen? Would that make our leader guilty of violating international law? And if so, when innocent Iraqi civilians are killed due to an unsanctioned war, can President Bush be tried at the World Court for crimes against humanity? Remember, Bush not only lost the popular vote, but he won the electoral college vote only through manipulated results in Florida that illegally blocked thousands of African Americans from voting.
\
Let's stop beating around the bush and take another look at presidential impeachment procedures.

Material for satire plentiful
\
Given the tense climate daily in which we find ourselves at the brink of possible war, I nevertheless felt a reply necessary to David Shaw's March 9 Commentary article, ""Why the rush for a liberal Limbaugh?""
\
At these times and even more importantly now, it seems to me that media access to as many points of view as possible is the best avenue to keeping our democracy alive. I find it laughable that Shaw thinks that unlike Rush Limbaugh and Shawn Hannity, a liberal talk show host would have little material to satirize. Almost every domestic public policy the Bush administration proposes these days, it seems to me, is food for satire.
\
That the liberal media tend to obscure what domestic policies are being pushed behind war headlines so that the public gets only the faintest glimmer of what is happening to our Bill of Rights and civil liberties, I think is food for satire. And despite the fact that our cherished American freedoms are being challenged and our economy is on a steep downhill slide - which apparently our most expert economists agree the Bush administration's tax and domestic policies are not helping - the most recent polls are indicating that the majority of Americans still feel the Bush administration, domestically as well as internationally, is doing a great job.
\
Does David Shaw really think there's no room for satire here?

Where's Turkish aid money?
\
Now that the Turkish government has saved the United States $15 billion to $20 billion in bribe - excuse me, aid - money by not allowing American troops on their soil, we can easily fund every ailing school system in the country. Right?
\
Wrong! Funny how that kind of money can appear and disappear when the will of a dynamic leader demands it.

Consider Hynix's record
\
Why should Eugene taxpayers throw more good money after bad by giving Hynix further tax breaks? We already have given this company roughly $46 million in tax breaks. Hynix has proven that it will not provide secure jobs.
\
After laying off workers with no notice, Hynix has reduced the number of jobs at its factory and is asking the Eugene City Council and Lane County Board of Commissioners to waive the requirement that tax breaks lead to creating new jobs. It also sued the city and county to get bigger tax breaks; it violated civil rights laws by illegally discriminating in hiring; it violated laws protecting our water, and it violated worker safety laws.
\
Eugene has much reason to be concerned about the harm to our environment and resources that a computer chip plant can bring. A financier friend of ours who examined the contract was appalled by the water giveaway in the contract, and said the amount charged was far below what other communities charge.
\
We must realize that Eugene and Oregon are unique in having relatively clean and abundant water and good environmental qualities. But these can be easily destroyed and wasted. If we want good jobs, we should support companies with a track record of providing secure jobs. Hynix has proven that it does not. Ask our city councilors and county commissioners to vote against further tax breaks for Hynix.

Let women participate
\
Although I'm sure he doesn't intend it this way, Frank Gibson's guest column on abortion rights (Register-Guard, Jan. 22) contains a statement that is misogynist in the extreme: ""without this right (to abortion), women will not be able to participate fully in the social, economic and political life of our nation.""
\
But abortion rights or not, planned pregnancies or not, many women would never consider putting their bodies, or the bodies of their unborn children, in harm's way by exercising their ""right"" to an abortion. So it sounds rather threatening when Gibson states that without this right women will be excluded from full participation in the life of our nation.
\
Certainly pregnancy, child-bearing and child-rearing do not always fit neatly into the status quo. And certainly it should not be women and their unborn children who pay the price for this, by being forced to choose between submitting to abortions as their ticket to equality, or being sidelined and isolated with their children.
\
In this view, abortion, far from serving women's well-being, actually harms it. The social, economic and political power structures need not change to accommodate - much less appreciate - the full participation of women so long as they can point to the abortion ""choice.""
\
As Gibson so rightly concludes his essay, we need women participating fully in the life of the nation. Even the ones who refuse to choose abortion.

Trees not a yearly crop
\
Geoff Cooper says (letters, Jan. 24) that ""Oregon can grow trees like Iowa grows corn, but nobody makes Iowans let half their land lie fallow indefinitely based on junk science about endangered species."" I want to point out that corn is a yearly crop, whereas trees take many years to grow.
\
You will never, never grow trees as fast as you can cut them down. Cooper needs to be more specific about this junk science - give some details - because fish and other animals are less plentiful. Many loggers agree that there are fewer spotted owls; they just don't care about the owls or they say people are more important.
\
With more than 6 billion people on the planet, we need to slow our population growth even more. Environmentalists know that once the available trees are logged, people in the timber industry will have to find a job doing something else, and we're trying to save as many trees as possible.

The virtues of biking
\
Walking and biking to work has saved me almost $250 in two months - that's what I would have paid for gas and vehicle maintenance. I own my cars and have no payments to make. I have spent $400 for a bicycle set-up and rain gear, and by the end of February I will start saving money. I'll be staying in shape and having a quiet one- hour walk. Now I can feel patriotic, knowing that my actions are a vote for energy conservation and reduced pollution.
\
I hope to see more people on the walks and bike lanes benefiting from exercise, saving substantial amounts of money and reducing pollution. On the downside, I do miss running red lights when I am daydreaming, tailgating cars that refuse to go 5 mph over the speed limit and honking my horn at people in front of me who cannot step on the gas pedal in under a quarter of a second after the signal light turns green.
\
I actually look forward to driving my car on my days off!

Hynix's extortion
\
I must be missing something! Hynix will keep 650 workers if we give them $7.2 million in tax breaks. They had 900 workers before company officials shut down the Eugene plant. They imported green card workers to do this work after they laid off local American taxpayers. We have plenty of skilled workers here if they wanted to be a good corporate citizen. Why do we need to export our work and tax dollars to South Korea?
\
Hopefully Micron Technologies will succeed in its buyout effort, and it will be an American-run corporation. There is no way we should be extorted in this way.

The tuition solution
\
In recognition of our state's recession and declining tax revenues, legislators are looking for ways to balance the budget. Since almost half of state expenditures are for education, major cutbacks in that area are being discussed. The other alternative is, of course, a tax increase. To avoid critically injuring public education in our state, and as a matter of fairness, perhaps it's time to consider an alternative source of public school funding: tuition.
\
Tuition has long been a major funding source for private schools, and for colleges and universities, both public and private. However, funding for the public school system (kindergarten through 12th grade) currently falls entirely on the taxpayers, whether they have chosen to have children or not, and whether their children are in public schools or are home-schooled or privately educated.
\
I suggest that those individuals who actually have children enrolled in the public school system take responsibility for some of the funding beyond the general tax base. Such a tuition system would have to be based on the parents' ability to pay, so that no child would be denied an education.
\
Certainly everyone benefits from an educated populace, and our level of general tax support for public education should reflect that. But - provided they can afford it - shouldn't those individuals who have chosen to have children and chosen to use the public education system take a bit more financial responsibility for it than everyone else? Tuition would lessen reliance on taxes, thereby diversifying and stabilizing public school funding, and close the revenue gap, perhaps avoiding the school cuts currently being discussed.
\
As long as, in the words of Dubya, ""no child is left behind,"" what fair-minded person could object?

Hybrid cars penalized
\
I am a recent purchaser of a gas-electric hybrid car. My wife and I went this route to help satisfy our commitment to conservation of energy and wildlife habitat, while also saving money at the gas pump.
\
I just received a letter from the state Department of Motor Vehicles informing us of a new law affecting registration of these hybrid vehicles. The new state law doubles the registration fees for these cars. The rationalization for this action is that state transportation funding, supported by gas taxes, needs to be compensated for the fact that these cars use less gas then the gas guzzlers now using the state's highways. It does not seem to matter that the hybrids are much easier on our environment and help to lessen this country's oil addiction.
\
Some will point out that the state provides income tax deductions for owners of these cars. But looking for pacifying trade-offs should not be the issue. If highway funding is inadequate, the gas tax should be raised. Owners of these environmentally friendly vehicles should not be penalized.
\
I am writing the governor and my state lawmakers asking for reconsideration of this law. I am also going to pay DMV for future registrations under written protest. I encourage other owners of hybrids do the same. A louder voice is more apt to be taken seriously.

Honor the presidents
\
This past week I have taken note of the numerous celebrations of Martin Luther King Day.
\
Activities have included a march down Chambers Street, a celebration at the Hult Center, assemblies at schools, speakers at the university and an essay contest sponsored by the Eugene School District in which Eugene and Bethel students wrote of the relevance of King's words to today's world. The winning essays were printed in The Register-Guard, along with several columns - including one written by U.S. Sen. Gordon Smith. These were all good and appropriate celebrations honoring King, who lived out his dream to ""make America a better nation.""
\
In the near future, we will have another opportunity to celebrate and honor those who helped make America a better nation - Presidents Day. However, in the past few years the only celebrations I've noticed are sales at car dealerships and department stores. Surely there must be some local educators, politicians or historical societies that are planning programs to honor these 43 men. If not, there should be!
\
In this year of renewed patriotism, let us not forget our presidents or the contributions they made to this great nation.

"
202,"Imagine resorts carved into the coastline, fences blocking access to the beaches, and ""no trespassing"" signs posted on trails to the ocean.\We've never had to in Oregon because we have free unrestricted public access to all the state's beaches.\Landmark legislation passed in 1967, known as the Beach Bill, guarantees us access that only Hawaii can match.\Our 362-mile coastline is a recreational playground, with hiking, camping, fishing and biking, surfing and beachcombing opportunities galore. It is one big viewing platform, with enchanting beaches, seductive headlands and glorious vistas at every single turn.\And it is ours forever.\In honor of the 50th anniversary of the Beach Bill, here are 50 things to know:\The numbers\1601. The number of the House Bill introduced in the legislative session on Feb. 22, 1967, by the Oregon State Parks and Recreation Department. Sponsors were Representatives Sidney Bazett (R-Grants Pass) and W. Stan Ouderkirk (R-Newport) and Senator Anthony Yturri (R-Ontario). The bill was assigned to the Highway Committee and quickly became known as the Beach Bill.\362. The official length in miles of the Oregon coastline, although the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department admits the more accurate number would be upwards of 380. Our coastline has not grown over the past five decades, but our mapping technology has improved. Much depends on how it is measured and whether jetties are included, for example.\16. The elevation in feet, or zone line, established in the bill. The legislature's intent was that it would coincide with the vegetation line. In instances of low-lying areas, where the 16-foot line went through private homes and businesses, an alternate zone line would be established 300 feet inward from the ocean. The bill did not apply the zone line to bays or estuaries.\$400,000. The estimated cost to administer the bill, as reported by The Oregon Statesman on May 23, 1967. In today's dollars, that would be nearly $3 million. Speaking for my generation and generations to come, it was worth every penny.\57-3. After 10 hearings, the bill passed by a vote of 57-3 in the House of Representatives.\27-0. The Senate unanimously approved the bill, with amendments.\36-20. The House passed the amended bill on June 7, 1967.\The players\Tom McCall, the 30th governor of Oregon, signed the Beach Bill into law on July 6, 1967. He described it as ""one of the most far-reaching measures of its kind enacted by any legislative body in the nation."" McCall was one of our most influential governors, serving two terms from 1967 to 1975. He was known for his courage and conviction that led to progressive legislation like this bill, the Bottle Bill, and the SB 100 land-use law.\Oswald West set the stage when he became governor in 1913. He declared Oregon's beaches to be a state highway, the legislature backed him up, and the first major protection of public access was on the books. When McCall signed the Beach Bill, he quoted West for protecting our beaches: ""No local selfish interest should be permitted, through politics or otherwise, to destroy or even impair this great birthright of our people."" A state park south of Cannon Beach is named after Oswald West.\Bob Straub was state treasurer at the time and McCall's political rival. The importance of securing free public access to beaches was one thing they could agree on. Straub, like McCall, was a noted environmentalist. He became the 31st governor of Oregon and helped strengthen the state's energy and land-use laws during his tenure. Straub also has a state park named after him near Pacific City.\Loran L. ""Stub"" Stewart, chairman of the State Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee, deserves much of the credit for getting the legislation introduced. During committee testimony, he affirmed the legislative responsibility to provide outdoor recreation opportunities for Oregonians and visitors. ""We have the finest beach recreation areas in the nation; and the Highway Commission, through this bill, wants to keep it that way for the public."" A state park between Portland and the coast is named after Stewart.\William Hay was a Portland real estate broker who owned the Surfsand Motel in Cannon Beach, where the controversy hit like a sneaker wave. Hay placed large driftwood logs to block off a section of the dry sand area in front of the motel, put up cabanas and tables for guests only, and installed private property signs on the perimeter. The moves exposed a loophole in the 1913 legislation, which technically protected only the wet sands. If not for Hay, the issue might not have been addressed until years later during a much different political climate.\Sidney Bazett, chairman of the House Highway Committee, was another advocate of public rights on our beaches. The bill nearly died in committee before the efforts of Bazett and concerned citizens revived it.\Dr. Robert Bacon and Laurence Bitte led a group called Citizens to Save Oregon Beaches and threatened an initiative petition if the legislation failed. Dr. Bacon was an anatomy professor at the University of Oregon Medical School. Bitte was a graduate student at the University of Oregon. They represented the spirit of all Oregonians who champion our natural resources and environmental causes.\Alfred ""Ted"" Goodwin, the Oregon Supreme Court judge who wrote the 1969 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Beach Bill and declaring that Oregon's beaches should remain public property. He served on the court from 1960 to 1969 before being appointed by President Richard Nixon as a U.S. district judge and then to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\Key moments\Media swell. When hearings for the Beach Bill began, few Oregonians were aware their beach access was in jeopardy, or that legislation was introduced to guarantee that access. Sponsors warned that without the public's support, the bill would die in committee. After a reporter with The Associated Press wrote a series of articles that published in newspapers across the state, the committee was flooded with letters and telegrams, hearing from more than 10,000 people who supported the bill.\Local coverage. The Beach Bill dominated the headlines in The Oregon Statesman during the 1967 legislative session and showed just how heated a debate it was: ""Beach Issue Explodes in Legislature"" and ""Latest Beach Bill Unveiled, Stirs Up Fire."" One of my favorite headlines from another publication was ""This Sand is Your Sand, This Sand is My Sand.""\Strong statement. Grainy video footage of Straub, in the Oregon Historical Society archives, includes this comment about what to expect if the Beach Bill were to fail: ""If the legislature turns its back on passing this needed legislation, you won't recognize the Oregon Coast four years from now because it'll be fenced and it'll be built on, and it'll look like the East coast, and it'll look like much of the area down in California.""\Scientifically speaking. McCall enlisted a group of experts from Oregon State University, including engineers, oceanographers, biologists, and geologists, to develop a formula that would define the boundary for public beach access. When the bill was first introduced, the elevation line was 12 feet instead of 16.\PR stunt. A longtime journalist who knew a golden public relations opportunity when he saw it, McCall planned a trip to the Oregon coast to test the new formula. The governor was joined by a group of surveyors, scientists, and journalists for stops in several coastal communities, including Cannon Beach.\The myth.Despite countless reports, McCall did not swoop in on a helicopter with his entourage and land at Cannon Beach. He did take a ride in a helicopter that day, but not to Cannon Beach. He arrived by limo, and the local museum has photos to prove it. While surveying was done at other locations, none took place there. Stakes were pounded into the sand for prop's sake, but much of what has been written since has added to the legend. ""It's mostly true,"" says Elaine Trucke, executive director of the Cannon Beach History Center and Museum. ""But it's been embellished over the years.""\Iconic image. Photographers captured McCall standing in front of the Surfsand Motel and glaring at the driftwood barriers. He wore a dark suit and dark sunglasses, and it was reported that he grumbled to motel guests about Hay's audacity and at one point drew a line in the sand. Public support grew after that day. Some consider this moment the turning point for the bill.\The aftermath\The survey. The Beach Bill called for the state to survey the entire coast. Aerial photographs were taken during a project that spanned 1968 and 1969, and the zone line was marked. The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department has the black and white, grainy images in its archives. Some of the aerial shots also have been preserved in the Oregon State Library.\Measure 6. There were doubts the bill would withstand legal challenges related to property rights. Bob Straub, for one, wanted more protection. He and a citizens' group, Beaches Forever, Inc., pushed a 1968 initiative proposing a temporary 1-cent-a-gallon gas tax for the state to buy privately owned beach land. The measured was defeated.\Challenges. Bill Hay, owner of the Surfsand Motel, and Lester Fultz, a Neskowin developer who started work on a private road which extended seaward past the vegetation line, challenged the public rights' claims in court but lost. They appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court, where they also lost. The Beach Bill generated other lawsuits that were subsequently dropped.\Second signing. McCall signed into law in 1969 the amendments based on the aerial survey points called for in the original bill. That was the same year the organization originally called S.O.L.V. (Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism) was created by the governor and other community leaders to address the need for community action. Today SOLVE is building on a vision to improve the environment in Oregon and build a legacy of stewardship.\The bounty\Sights. Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach is one of Oregon's most recognizable landmarks. It rises 235 feet from the edge of the shoreline. At low tide, you can walk right up to it and explore the colorful tide pools and observe the diverse bird life. But please don't touch the animals or climb the rock. It is protected as an Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Marine Garden.\Lighthouses. Heceta Head Lighthouse between Yachats and Florence is one of the most popular lighthouses on the Oregon coast. Seven of our lighthouses are open to the public seasonally, if not year-round. Heceta Head rises 205 above the ocean and is a working lighthouse, casting its beams some 21 miles out to sea. It is said to be one of the most photographed lighthouses in the United States.\Wonders. The Oregon Dunes is the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in the country, stretching approximately 40 miles from Florence to Coos Bay. The wind-sculpted sand dunes tower 500 feet above sea level and extend 2.5 miles inland. The 32,186-acre National Recreation Area also includes forest, streams, and lakes and provides numerous recreational opportunities such as off-highway vehicle use, hiking, photography, fishing, canoeing, horseback riding, and camping.\Hidden gems. Secret Beach is a tiny piece of coastal paradise between Gold Beach and Brookings just north of the California border. The Oregon coast is full of paths that lead to ocean overlooks and pocket beaches, and this is one of the most spectacular. Secret Beach is located along the breathtaking 12-mile-long Samuel H. Boardman State Scenic Corridor. You can access it by taking a quarter-mile trail from a small parking area near milepost 346 on the west side of Highway 101.\Shipwrecks. The Peter Iredale is the most visible shipwreck on the Oregon coast, found on Clatsop Beach in Fort Stevens State Park near Astoria. Only the steel hull remains of the ship, which ran aground in 1906. Extremely low tides and winter storms occasionally reveal remnants of other shipwrecks, such as the J. Marhoffer in Boiler Bay just north of Depoe Bay and the Emily G. Reed near Rockaway Beach. Only the rusty remains of the Marhoffer's boiler are visible, thus the name of that bay.\Ghosts. The Neskowin Ghost Forest is a hauntingly beautiful sight to see. Some 100 stumps of an ancient Sitka spruce forest, estimated to be 2000 years old, are revealed when the tide is out. Scientists believe the forest was destroyed by an earthquake or tsunami, burying its remains deep.\Wicked waves. Two locations on the Oregon Coast are named after the devil. The Devil's Churn is a deep chasm in the rocky shore at Cape Perpetua near Yachats. The Devil's Punchbowl is a cauldron located in Otter Rock just south of Depoe Bay. As the tide crashes in at both locations, sea water violently swirls and sprays upward.\Oddities. A massive Sitka spruce called the Octopus Tree is a popular attraction at the Cape Meares State Scenic Viewpoint. It looks like an upside down octopus with its branches growing like giant tentacles from its 50-foot base. Local historians and Tillamook tribal descendants believe its odd shape comes from its function as a ceremonial site, shaped to hold cedar canoes and other ritual objects.\Boardwalk. The Seaside Promenade is a 1.5-mile long concrete boardwalk between the town and its beach. It features an automobile turnaround with a statue of Lewis and Clark as its centerpiece. The Promenade was built in the 1920's, first out of wood, then of concrete.\Longest beach. The 804 Trail includes a 7-mile stretch of sandy beach between Yachats and Waldport that you can walk or bike. The trail to the beach is 3/4 mile and begins from the parking lot of Smelt Sands Recreation Site. Along the way, you pass by beautiful rocky shores and three state parks.\Parks. More than 80 properties are listed in the coastal section of the Oregon Parks Guide, including state parks, recreation sites, scenic viewpoints and corridors, and natural areas.\The legacy\Surfsand. The motel still stands today. In fact, it is now called the Surfsand Resort and has undergone major renovations over the past decade. The resort is now owned by Martin Hospitality, which owns and operates luxury restaurants and hotels in Cannon Beach and Seaside. It supported an event held on the beach last month to commemorate the 50th anniversary of McCall's famous visit.\In memory of. Tad McCall, son of the late governor, traveled from Arlington, Virginia, to Cannon Beach to help celebrate what his father helped save. ""This beach is the beach of history,"" he said during his address to the crowd on May 13. ""This is where the picture of freedom of the beach was painted.""\Life as art. A portrait of his father, painted by Henk Pander in 1982 and commissioned by the state, adds to the myth of what happened that day five decades ago. The scene portrays McCall's highly publicized visit, with a helicopter hovering in the background. The painting is displayed in the Capitol with portraits of other former governors.\Ownership. Some stretches of beach remain privately owned. A 1966 state parks study showed that 112 of Oregon's 262 miles of sandy beach were in private ownership. In a 1977 publication by the department, it was noted by Beach Bill sponsors that the state might have to spend millions to purchase private land. The department estimates today it has since added about 16.5 miles of beach above high tide to the state park system.\Acquisitions. State parks has made around 200 beachfront acquisitions, most of which were additions to existing properties. The most recent examples are the 1.3 miles at the new Sitka Sedge State Natural Area in Tillamook County and extension of the Floras Lake State Natural Area in Curry County. The department estimates it has spent $32 million on acquisitions since 1967.\Protectors. The Oregon Shores Conservation Coalition was founded in 1971 by some of the same folks who led Citizens to Save Oregon Beaches in the campaign to support the bill. Bob Bacon joined forces with other coastal enthusiasts to found the new organization that has been conserving and protecting the landscape and public access to our beaches ever since.\Stewards. Straub said it best in the foreword of the 1977 publication called ""Oregon's Beaches: A Birthright Preserved."" He was governor at that time. ""The Beach Bill is more than landmark legislation. It is a tribute to Oregonians' commitment to a vigilant stewardship of a truly wonderous (sic) natural environment.""\Mini-documentary. Visit Tillamook Coast commissioned a five-minute mini-documentary to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Beach Bill. It includes archival footage of Gov. McCall and cameos from several dignitaries, including current Gov. Kate Brown. Sea Legs Media of Salem collaborated on the project with Visit Tillamook Coast, Tillamook County's tourism organization.\Documentary: ""Politics in the Sand"" by Tom Olsen Jr. is a documentary that follows the efforts to protect the Oregon Coast from private development. DVD copies can be purchased at the Cannon Beach History Center and Museum and through the museum's online gift shop for $10 each.\Photo collections. The Oregon State Library and the Oregon State Archives have created digital collections to mark the 50th anniversary of the Beach Bill.\The celebration\July 8 in Salem.

203,"Imagine resorts carved into the coastline, fences blocking access to the beaches, and ""no trespassing"" signs posted on trails to the ocean.\We've never had to in Oregon because we have free unrestricted public access to all the state's beaches.\Landmark legislation passed in 1967, known as the Beach Bill, guarantees us access that only Hawaii can match.\Our 362-mile coastline is a recreational playground, with hiking, camping, fishing and biking, surfing and beachcombing opportunities galore. It is one big viewing platform, with enchanting beaches, seductive headlands and glorious vistas at every single turn.\And it is ours forever.\In honor of the 50th anniversary of the Beach Bill, here are 50 things to know:\The numbers\1601. The number of the House Bill introduced in the legislative session on Feb. 22, 1967, by the Oregon State Parks and Recreation Department. Sponsors were Representatives Sidney Bazett (R-Grants Pass) and W. Stan Ouderkirk (R-Newport) and Senator Anthony Yturri (R-Ontario). The bill was assigned to the Highway Committee and quickly became known as the Beach Bill.\362. The official length in miles of the Oregon coastline, although the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department admits the more accurate number would be upwards of 380. Our coastline has not grown over the past five decades, but our mapping technology has improved. Much depends on how it is measured and whether jetties are included, for example.\16. The elevation in feet, or zone line, established in the bill. The legislature's intent was that it would coincide with the vegetation line. In instances of low-lying areas, where the 16-foot line went through private homes and businesses, an alternate zone line would be established 300 feet inward from the ocean. The bill did not apply the zone line to bays or estuaries.\$400,000. The estimated cost to administer the bill, as reported by The Oregon Statesman on May 23, 1967. In today's dollars, that would be nearly $3 million. Speaking for my generation and generations to come, it was worth every penny.\57-3. After 10 hearings, the bill passed by a vote of 57-3 in the House of Representatives.\27-0. The Senate unanimously approved the bill, with amendments.\36-20. The House passed the amended bill on June 7, 1967.\The players\Tom McCall, the 30th governor of Oregon, signed the Beach Bill into law on July 6, 1967. He described it as ""one of the most far-reaching measures of its kind enacted by any legislative body in the nation."" McCall was one of our most influential governors, serving two terms from 1967 to 1975. He was known for his courage and conviction that led to progressive legislation like this bill, the Bottle Bill, and the SB 100 land-use law.\Oswald West set the stage when he became governor in 1913. He declared Oregon's beaches to be a state highway, the legislature backed him up, and the first major protection of public access was on the books. When McCall signed the Beach Bill, he quoted West for protecting our beaches: ""No local selfish interest should be permitted, through politics or otherwise, to destroy or even impair this great birthright of our people."" A state park south of Cannon Beach is named after Oswald West.\Bob Straubwas state treasurer at the time and McCall's political rival. The importance of securing free public access to beaches was one thing they could agree on. Straub, like McCall, was a noted environmentalist. He became the 31st governor of Oregon and helped strengthen the state's energy and land-use laws during his tenure. Straub also has a state park named after him near Pacific City.\Loran L. ""Stub"" Stewart, chairman of the State Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee, deserves much of the credit for getting the legislation introduced. During committee testimony, he affirmed the legislative responsibility to provide outdoor recreation opportunities for Oregonians and visitors. ""We have the finest beach recreation areas in the nation; and the Highway Commission, through this bill, wants to keep it that way for the public."" A state park between Portland and the coast is named after Stewart.\William Hay was a Portland real estate broker who owned the Surfsand Motel in Cannon Beach, where the controversy hit like a sneaker wave. Hay placed large driftwood logs to block off a section of the dry sand area in front of the motel, put up cabanas and tables for guests only, and installed private property signs on the perimeter. The moves exposed a loophole in the 1913 legislation, which technically protected only the wet sands. If not for Hay, the issue might not have been addressed until years later during a much different political climate.\Sidney Bazett, chairman of the House Highway Committee, was another advocate of public rights on our beaches. The bill nearly died in committee before the efforts of Bazett and concerned citizens revived it.\Dr. Robert Bacon and Laurence Bitte led a group called Citizens to Save Oregon Beaches and threatened an initiative petition if the legislation failed. Dr. Bacon was an anatomy professor at the University of Oregon Medical School. Bitte was a graduate student at the University of Oregon. They represented the spirit of all Oregonians who champion our natural resources and environmental causes.\Alfred ""Ted"" Goodwin, the Oregon Supreme Court judge who wrote the 1969 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Beach Bill and declaring that Oregon's beaches should remain public property. He served on the court from 1960 to 1969 before being appointed by President Richard Nixon as a U.S. district judge and then to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\Key moments\Media swell. When hearings for the Beach Bill began, few Oregonians were aware their beach access was in jeopardy, or that legislation was introduced to guarantee that access. Sponsors warned that without the public's support, the bill would die in committee. After a reporter with The Associated Press wrote a series of articles that published in newspapers across the state, the committee was flooded with letters and telegrams, hearing from more than 10,000 people who supported the bill.\Local coverage. The Beach Bill dominated the headlines in The Oregon Statesman during the 1967 legislative session and showed just how heated a debate it was: ""Beach Issue Explodes in Legislature"" and ""Latest Beach Bill Unveiled, Stirs Up Fire."" One of my favorite headlines from another publication was ""This Sand is Your Sand, This Sand is My Sand.""\Strong statement. Grainy video footage of Straub, in the Oregon Historical Society archives, includes this comment about what to expect if the Beach Bill were to fail: ""If the legislature turns its back on passing this needed legislation, you won't recognize the Oregon Coast four years from now because it'll be fenced and it'll be built on, and it'll look like the East coast, and it'll look like much of the area down in California.""\Scientifically speaking. McCall enlisted a group of experts from Oregon State University, including engineers, oceanographers, biologists, and geologists, to develop a formula that would define the boundary for public beach access. When the bill was first introduced, the elevation line was 12 feet instead of 16.\PR stunt. A longtime journalist who knew a golden public relations opportunity when he saw it, McCall planned a trip to the Oregon coast to test the new formula. The governor was joined by a group of surveyors, scientists, and journalists for stops in several coastal communities, including Cannon Beach.\The myth.Despite countless reports, McCall did not swoop in on a helicopter with his entourage and land at Cannon Beach. He did take a ride in a helicopter that day, but not to Cannon Beach. He arrived by limo, and the local museum has photos to prove it. While surveying was done at other locations, none took place there. Stakes were pounded into the sand for prop's sake, but much of what has been written since has added to the legend. ""It's mostly true,"" says Elaine Trucke, executive director of the Cannon Beach History Center and Museum. ""But it's been embellished over the years.""\Iconic image. Photographers captured McCall standing in front of the Surfsand Motel and glaring at the driftwood barriers. He wore a dark suit and dark sunglasses, and it was reported that he grumbled to motel guests about Hay's audacity and at one point drew a line in the sand. Public support grew after that day. Some consider this moment the turning point for the bill.\The aftermath\The survey. The Beach Bill called for the state to survey the entire coast. Aerial photographs were taken during a project that spanned 1968 and 1969, and the zone line was marked. The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department has the black and white, grainy images in its archives. Some of the aerial shots also have been preserved in the Oregon State Library.\Measure 6. There were doubts the bill would withstand legal challenges related to property rights. Bob Straub, for one, wanted more protection. He and a citizens' group, Beaches Forever, Inc., pushed a 1968 initiative proposing a temporary 1-cent-a-gallon gas tax for the state to buy privately owned beach land. The measured was defeated.\Challenges. Bill Hay, owner of the Surfsand Motel, and Lester Fultz, a Neskowin developer who started work on a private road which extended seaward past the vegetation line, challenged the public rights' claims in court but lost. They appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court, where they also lost. The Beach Bill generated other lawsuits that were subsequently dropped.\Second signing. McCall signed into law in 1969 the amendments based on the aerial survey points called for in the original bill. That was the same year the organization originally called S.O.L.V. (Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism) was created by the governor and other community leaders to address the need for community action. Today SOLVE is building on a vision to improve the environment in Oregon and build a legacy of stewardship.\The bounty\Sights. Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach is one of Oregon's most recognizable landmarks. It rises 235 feet from the edge of the shoreline. At low tide, you can walk right up to it and explore the colorful tide pools and observe the diverse bird life. But please don't touch the animals or climb the rock. It is protected as an Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Marine Garden.\Lighthouses. Heceta Head Lighthouse between Yachats and Florence is one of the most popular lighthouses on the Oregon coast. Seven of our lighthouses are open to the public seasonally, if not year-round. Heceta Head rises 205 above the ocean and is a working lighthouse, casting its beams some 21 miles out to sea. It is said to be one of the most photographed lighthouses in the United States.\Wonders. The Oregon Dunes is the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in the country, stretching approximately 40 miles from Florence to Coos Bay. The wind-sculpted sand dunes tower 500 feet above sea level and extend 2.5 miles inland. The 32,186-acre National Recreation Area also includes forest, streams, and lakes and provides numerous recreational opportunities such as off-highway vehicle use, hiking, photography, fishing, canoeing, horseback riding, and camping.\Hidden gems. Secret Beach is a tiny piece of coastal paradise between Gold Beach and Brookings just north of the California border. The Oregon coast is full of paths that lead to ocean overlooks and pocket beaches, and this is one of the most spectacular. Secret Beach is located along the breathtaking 12-mile-long Samuel H. Boardman State Scenic Corridor. You can access it by taking a quarter-mile trail from a small parking area near milepost 346 on the west side of Highway 101.\Shipwrecks. The Peter Iredale is the most visible shipwreck on the Oregon coast, found on Clatsop Beach in Fort Stevens State Park near Astoria. Only the steel hull remains of the ship, which ran aground in 1906. Extremely low tides and winter storms occasionally reveal remnants of other shipwrecks, such as the J. Marhoffer in Boiler Bay just north of Depoe Bay and the Emily G. Reed near Rockaway Beach. Only the rusty remains of the Marhoffer's boiler are visible, thus the name of that bay.\Ghosts. The Neskowin Ghost Forest is a hauntingly beautiful sight to see. Some 100 stumps of an ancient Sitka spruce forest, estimated to be 2000 years old, are revealed when the tide is out. Scientists believe the forest was destroyed by an earthquake or tsunami, burying its remains deep.\Wicked waves. Two locations on the Oregon Coast are named after the devil. The Devil's Churn is a deep chasm in the rocky shore at Cape Perpetua near Yachats. The Devil's Punchbowl is a cauldron located in Otter Rock just south of Depoe Bay. As the tide crashes in at both locations, sea water violently swirls and sprays upward.\Oddities. A massive Sitka spruce called the Octopus Tree is a popular attraction at the Cape Meares State Scenic Viewpoint. It looks like an upside down octopus with its branches growing like giant tentacles from its 50-foot base. Local historians and Tillamook tribal descendants believe its odd shape comes from its function as a ceremonial site, shaped to hold cedar canoes and other ritual objects.\Boardwalk. The Seaside Promenade is a 1.5-mile long concrete boardwalk between the town and its beach. It features an automobile turnaround with a statue of Lewis and Clark as its centerpiece. The Promenade was built in the 1920's, first out of wood, then of concrete.\Longest beach. The 804 Trail includes a 7-mile stretch of sandy beach between Yachats and Waldport that you can walk or bike. The trail to the beach is 3/4 mile and begins from the parking lot of Smelt Sands Recreation Site. Along the way, you pass by beautiful rocky shores and three state parks.\Parks. More than 80 properties are listed in the coastal section of the Oregon Parks Guide, including state parks, recreation sites, scenic viewpoints and corridors, and natural areas.\The legacy\Surfsand. The motel still stands today. In fact, it is now called the Surfsand Resort and has undergone major renovations over the past decade. The resort is now owned by Martin Hospitality, which owns and operates luxury restaurants and hotels in Cannon Beach and Seaside. It supported an event held on the beach last month to commemorate the 50th anniversary of McCall's famous visit.\In memory of. Tad McCall, son of the late governor, traveled from Arlington, Virginia, to Cannon Beach to help celebrate what his father helped save. ""This beach is the beach of history,"" he said during his address to the crowd on May 13. ""This is where the picture of freedom of the beach was painted.""\Life as art: A portrait of his father, painted by Henk Pander in 1982 and commissioned by the state, adds to the myth of what happened that day five decades ago. The scene portrays McCall's highly publicized visit, with a helicopter hovering in the background. The painting is displayed in the Capitol with portraits of other former governors.\Ownership. Some stretches of beach remain privately owned. A 1966 state parks study showed that 112 of Oregon's 262 miles of sandy beach were in private ownership. In a 1977 publication by the department, it was noted by Beach Bill sponsors that the state might have to spend millions to purchase private land. The department estimates today it has since added about 16.5 miles of beach above high tide to the state park system.\Acquisitions. State parks has made around 200 beachfront acquisitions, most of which were additions to existing properties. The most recent examples are the 1.3 miles at the new Sitka Sedge State Natural Area in Tillamook County and extension of the Floras Lake State Natural Area in Curry County. The department estimates it has spent $32 million on acquisitions since 1967.\Protectors. The Oregon Shores Conservation Coalition was founded in 1971 by some of the same folks who led Citizens to Save Oregon Beaches in the campaign to support the bill. Bob Bacon joined forces with other coastal enthusiasts to found the new organization that has been conserving and protecting the landscape and public access to our beaches ever since.\Stewards. Straub said it best in the foreword of the 1977 publication called ""Oregon's Beaches: A Birthright Preserved."" He was governor at that time. ""The Beach Bill is more than landmark legislation. It is a tribute to Oregonians' commitment to a vigilant stewardship of a truly wonderous (sic) natural environment.""\Mini-documentary. Visit Tillamook Coast commissioned a five-minute mini-documentary to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Beach Bill. It includes archival footage of Gov. McCall and cameos from several dignitaries, including current Gov. Kate Brown. Sea Legs Media of Salem collaborated on the project with Visit Tillamook Coast, Tillamook County's tourism organization.\Documentary: ""Politics in the Sand,"" by Tom Olsen Jr. is a documentary that follows the efforts to protect the Oregon Coast from private development. DVD copies can be purchased at the Cannon Beach History Center and Museum and through the museum's online gift shop for $10 each.\Photo collections. The Oregon State Library and the Oregon State Archives have created digital collections to mark the 50th anniversary of the Beach Bill.\The celebration\July 8 in Salem. The Beach Bill Birthday Bash is from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Oregon State Capitol.

4-vehicle collision disrupts traffic
\
A car crash at West Sixth Avenue and Chambers Street on Tuesday morning caused a traffic tie-up that lasted for nearly two hours, Eugene police said.
\
The crash involved four vehicles - a Lexus, a Toyota Camry, a Chevrolet Geo and a Eugene school district bus. There were no children on the bus at the time of the 10:20 a.m. collision, police said. The driver of the Geo was taken to Sacred Heart Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries.
\
The driver of the Lexus, 27-year-old Ruben Celio-Rangel of Springfield, was headed west on Sixth Avenue. Police said he drove through the red light at Chambers Street and clipped the front passenger-side edge of the bumper on the school bus, which was headed north on Chambers.
\
The Lexus continued through the intersection, colliding with the Camry headed south on Chambers. The Camry spun and hit the Geo, also going south on Chambers. The Lexus kept rolling until it hit a tree on the south side of Sixth.
\
Police charged Celio-Rangel with failing to obey a traffic control device.

Lane ESD gets grant for safety program
\
The Lane Education Service District has been awarded a three- year, $1.8 million federal grant through the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative to help rural school districts create safer learning environments, reduce substance abuse and violent behavior and provide mental health prevention and early intervention.
\
The grant will benefit 13 Lane County districts: Blachly, Creswell, Crow-Applegate-Lorane, Fern Ridge, Junction City, Lowell, Mapleton, Marcola, McKenzie, Oakridge, Pleasant Hill, Siuslaw and South Lane. Between them, those districts serve almost 15,000 students.
\
Partners in the grant are the Lane County Department of Youth Services, Lane County Health and Human Services, the University of Oregon and Lane Council of Governments. In 1999, the Eugene, Springfield and Bethel school districts received a three-year, $9 million grant through the same initiative, also in partnership with various community agencies.
\
Roadwork to close stretch of Bertelsen
\
The intersection of Bertelsen Road and Roosevelt Boulevard will be closed from 7 a.m. Thursday until 6 a.m. Monday for road repairs.
\
Bertelsen also will be repaved from about 100 feet north of the intersection to the railroad crossing about 1,300 feet south of the intersection. The work on Bertelsen will begin after the intersection reconstruction, and is scheduled to be finished by the end of September.
\
The $375,000 project will be paid for with the city's road fund, which comes primarily from state gas tax revenues.
\
Bertelsen will remain open, but delays and occasional lane closures are planned.

Deputy on leave
\
in shooting probe
\
A Douglas County sheriff's deputy present when deputy Morris Taylor died in a shootout that also killed a Dorena man was placed on administrative leave during the investigation of the fatal exchange.
\
Cpl. Jeff Aalberg of Roseburg has been on paid leave since Saturday. Sheriff's office policy and procedure required the move, which is common practice following an officer-involved shooting, department spokeswoman Pam Frank said Tuesday.
\
Aalberg joined the sheriff's office in November 1987 and was promoted to corporal in January. He will return to the sheriff's office as soon as he is ready, Frank said.
\
He and Taylor exchanged gunfire with Korry Lee Jones, 36, on Saturday while investigating a nonemergency report of a man performing lewd acts at the Stardust Motel in Curtain. Taylor and Jones died at the scene. Aalberg was uninjured. Oregon State Police, with help from the Douglas County major crimes team, is investigating the incident.

205,"Join me in voting no on Measure 24-292. The proponents would have us ""pass it and then we will see what is in it."" Does that sound familiar?\The proposed ""constitution"" is poorly drafted with significant vagueness that will result in costly legal problems the cost of which will be a burden to the taxpayers of Marion County. The ""constitution"" proposed would divide the county into districts creating an environment where commissioners would be fighting for their turf, not the needs of all the citizens of the county.\It would further allow the commissioners by simple majority vote impose a gas tax, payroll tax, transit tax and an endless list of other taxes without a vote of the people.\There is no provision for a county treasurer, so who is going to be responsible for the monies received and spent by the commissioners? Who is going to perform the auditing functions required to assure that there is no fraud or waste of taxpayers' money?\The proposed ""constitution"" is not favorable to the citizens of the county, but instead it is a ploy by a minority to seize more control over the lives of the citizens of Marion County.\-- Ken E.

207,"A task force hopes to gain legislative attention for its recommendations. \BY KRISTEN GREEN \Statesman Journal \A governor-appointed task force that spent nine months wading through Oregon's growth issues has released a report it hopes will influence the Legislature this session. \The 13 task force members, from a wide variety of backgrounds, agreed on seven basic recommendations for the Legislature and the Department of Land Conservation and Development. The proposals are in the spirit of Gov. John Kitzhaber's Oregon Livability Initiative, said Robin McArthur-Phillips, a land use adviser to the governor. \One of the important conclusions the committee reached is that there is a deep public concern about the impact of growth in Oregon that isn't being addressed, according to Gail Ackerman, task force chairwoman. \Another is that significant infrastructure costs required by growth aren't being paid for. ""We've got deteriorating roads, deteriorating sewers, deteriorating schools,"" Ackerman said. ""We have this very major unmet need."" \Larry George, executive director of Oregonians In Action, a property rights group, said the task force's recommendations are obvious and difficult to implement. \But the findings opened up discussion about a need for changes to Oregon's land-use planning system, he said. \""It's at least created a more open environment about how we can fix the problem,"" George said. \He hopes the increased openness will play a role during the 1999 legislative session. More than 20 growth-related bills have been proposed since Monday. \The task force's other recommendations are: \The state should look for better ways to limit growth in certain areas to protect natural resources. \The Legislature should increase the gas tax to fund transportation improvements across the state and find ways to fund local transit needs. \State agencies should better coordinate growth-related activities and programs. \A new task force should be convened to research growth issues more thoroughly.

208,"As your representatives from Marion and Polk counties on the oversight team for the Salem River Crossing, we want to share the facts and timeline about the Environmental Impact Study, or EIS.\While the federally mandated process has taken years to complete, we are getting near the end. We share this with you because we understand that government processes can seem long and arduous, but please know real progress has been made.\Once the EIS is complete, only then can the Federal Highway Administration approve the third bridge in a Record of Decision, or ROD. Completing the EIS will give future local leaders options, but will also minimize the risk of conflicts regarding land use and construction.\The need for another system to cross the Willamette River, connecting both counties, is vital and has been for years. Projections continue to show another 40 percent increase in traffic on the existing bridges between now and 2035, with downtown congestion and traffic increasing as fuel prices have dropped.\As governments look to make buildings and bridges resilient against disasters, our planning now will improve the efficiency of our transportation system and support better public safety, economic development and quality of life in the future.\If we do nothing, 14 of 28 downtown Salem intersections will fail, causing gridlock for all directions of travel and frustrating local commuters and through-region freight movements. Adding lanes to the existing bridges or relying on alternate transportation modes simply won't reduce the downtown congestion, disperse traffic or improve public safety.\With public input throughout the process, we look forward to finishing the EIS, which will designate the crossing locations, the impacts to the environment and the mitigation of those impacts, as well as how the bridge connects for local and through traffic. We've recently outlined the type of bridge structure, including amenities available to enhance the design, when it is designed further along in this process.\We were required to estimate how to pay for it, citing actual experience in funding other current projects in Oregon (such as Sellwood Bridge and Sauvie Island Bridge), learning that likely the $430 million total project cost will require future voter approval for local contribution (50 percent) and state and federal gas tax funding (25 percent each).\Finishing up the EIS tasks include land-use approvals in Polk County and Salem and update/amendment of the Salem Transportation Plan.\There will come a time when elected officials and the public will have the harder work of determining the design, character and cost that voters are willing to pay to improve circulation of people and products in and through Marion and Polk counties. Our legacy to voters and officials in the future is to plan for it and set the table for these very important decisions.\Craig Pope is a Polk County commissioner.

A new viewpoint and an improved trailhead will enhance the scenic experience for travelers along the McKenzie River
\
McKENZIE BRIDGE - Two projects along Highway 126 will offer sweeping new views of the McKenzie River and better access to a popular trail, in an effort to enhance the experience of travelers along this scenic byway.
\
A rock masonry viewpoint is under construction about six miles east of the McKenzie River Ranger Station, which is about two miles east of town.
\
Safety and access improvements are also under way at the McKenzie River National Recreation Trail trailhead, just west of the ranger station. The work will make the area more inviting for Eugene- Springfield motorists heading east and anxious to reach the Willamette National Forest.
\
""They'll be looking at their maps, saying, 'When are we going to get into the forest?' ' said Stacey Smith, the ranger station's scenic byways coordinator. The trailhead is ""right about the time they enter into the national forest land. It's a chance to stop and just get a sense of the river, stop and stretch your legs.""
\
The ranger station is the portal to two scenic byways: McKenzie Pass-Santiam Pass, a 90-mile loop along Highways 126, 20 and 242 through the central Oregon Cascade Mountains; and West Cascades, a 215-mile stretch from Estacada to Oakridge, along Highways 224, 22 and 126.
\
Travelers seek scenic byways out because the meandering roads highlight the variety of landscapes found in national forests, so it was appropriate to make improvements at these two spots along the way, Smith said.
\
The viewpoint, which is on the west side of Highway 126 just north of the junction with Highway 242, will ""get people off the highway just a few feet,"" Smith said. ""You walk through a little bit of forest and get in that riverine environment.""
\
The viewpoint, accessible to people with wheelchairs or canes, also will feature a paved parking area, a footpath and a trail- bridge.
\
At the trail head, workers are paving the parking lot, improving the safety for motorists entering or exiting the highway and adding walkways and information panels, Smith said. The trail head will be closed during weekday construction periods until the beginning of June, although it will be open most weekends and holidays.
\
A roadside riparian area will be restored with a large amount of vegetation, reducing runoff of highway pollutants into the river, she added.
\
Both projects will be completed by June, Smith said, with plantings and seeding to be finished in the fall.
\
The $360,000 construction of the two projects was paid through a partnership of the Willamette National Forest, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, Smith said.
\
Funds were available from the FHA's Forest Highways Program, which allocates gas-tax dollars through the Transportation Efficiency Act.
"
210,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."

Festivities to launch
\
regional sports center
\
SPRINGFIELD - A regional sports center some 16 years in the making will open its doors Saturday.
\
The nonprofit Springfield Regional Sports Center will open at 8 a.m. at 32nd and Main streets, continuing through midnight with recreational competitions, prizes, product sampling and tours.
\
State Sen. Bill Morrisette started promoting the sports project around the time of his election as Springfield's mayor in 1988.
\
Plans for the complex stalled repeatedly because of inadequate financing, but developer John Musumeci of Arlie & Co. revitalized them in October 2001 by donating the land necessary to make the project work.
\
Speakers will include Morrisette, Mayor Sid Leiken, Bob Keefer, superintendent for the Willamalane Park and Recreation District and others.
\
""We are thrilled to be offering the community a place for their children to go and their families to play,"" said Roy Gray, the center's CEO.

Street-sealing project
\
to cause traffic delays
\
SPRINGFIELD - The city will start a one-month street project Sunday that means temporary delays and long-term improved driving conditions.
\
Using revenue from the city's 3 cent gas tax, the city will cover 15 of its 200 miles of roads with an asphalt-based ""slurry seal"" that seals cracks, resists water and improves the driving surface, maintenance supervisor Brian Conlon said. The life of the street is extended by seven to 10 years.
\
The seal needs four to six hours to cure, and delays and street closures could last as long as one day. The $400,000 project should be completed by early October.
\
For more information, call 726-3761.
\
Board seeks comments
\

212,"Oregon would get $530 million under a bill approved by the Senate.\BY ELLYN FERGUSON\Statesman Journal\WASHINGTON - Oregon would get an infusion of $530 million for roads and transit under a multiyear transportation package that the Senate approved Thursday.\If the formula remains the same in the final bill, the $2.6 billion total for Oregon in the next six years would represent a 27.3 percent increase from the most recent multiyear highway bill.\Both Oregon senators voted for the bill, which passed 76-21.\Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., isn't happy with the proposed increase because it falls below the average increase of 35.6 percent for all 50 states. Wyden is a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, one of three panels that put the Senate bill together.\""We want to see something that better reflects the needs of Oregon,"" Wyden spokesman Chris Fitzgerald said.\Wyden and Sen. Jim Talent, R-Mo., are pushing their bill to give states extra money for transportation projects by allowing a federally chartered nonprofit to raise up to $50 billion by selling bonds to the public.\The future of the bill is uncertain as Congress and the Bush administration negotiate on the price tag.\Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said that he expected a consensus to emerge on the $318 billion legislation, which would renew highway, public transit and safety programs.\""The transportation bill may be the only major piece of legislation both sides equally want,"" Smith said. ""Something will pass.""\The administration wants to cap the legislation at $256 billion. The Senate backs its $318 billion plan, and the House wants a $375 billion package.\The House's proposal has divided that chamber because it calls for raising the federal gas tax by as much as 8 cents. As a result, House members Wednesday temporarily extended the current federal highway program until June. The previous six-year transportation law was to expire Sept. 30, 2003, but Congress approved an extension until Feb. 29 in hopes that all sides could agree by then.\President Bush is threatening a veto on the final bill if it significantly exceeds the administration's $256 billion cap.\But during debate on the Senate bill Thursday, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said he thinks that Bush is bluffing.\""He hasn't vetoed any bill. I doubt that his first veto would be of the highway bill, a jobs bill,"" Baucus said.\Sen. Rick Santorum, who challenged the Senate bill's total, warned that Bush is serious.\If the Senate is determined to stick with $318 billion, Santorum said, ""You'll have to do it by overriding a veto.""\""We're spending a ton of money and have no way to pay for it,"" the Pennsylvania Republican said. ""At some point, this Ponzi scheme is going to have come off.""\He and other fiscal conservatives lost their procedural challenge to the bill's cost. Supporters of the $318 billion bill said any reductions would upset regional balances in the bill that allow every state to receive more than they received under the previous bill.\Ellyn Ferguson can be reached at (202) 906-8116 or eferguso@ gns.gannett.com"
213,"
In Lane County and communities throughout the country, more Americans are turning to public transit these days to commute to work, go shopping, travel to medical appointments and for just about anything that requires getting from Point A to Point B in a timely, cost-efficient manner. 
\
A report released Monday by the American Public Transportation Association says more people used buses, trains and subways in 2013 than in any year since 1956. Last year the nation's transit systems reported 10.7 billion passenger trips, an increase of 1.1 percent over the previous year. National ridership last year surpassed the post-1950s record of 10.59 billion set in 2008, when gas prices surged to between $4 and $5 a gallon.
\
What's significant about the 2013 increase is that it occurred in a year when gas prices remained well below the 2008 levels. That suggests a fundamental shift in travel habits rather than a temporary spike prompted by higher gas prices.
\
The report notes that public transit use is increasing in large and small cities, in suburban and rural communities, and in red and blue states. Name the location, and it's a good bet more people are riding buses or using other transit options there.
\
Mass-transit ridership numbers over the last decade underscore this trend. Since 1995, the nation's transit ridership has risen 37 percent. That's nearly twice the rate of population growth and about a third more than the increase in vehicle miles traveled during that same period.
\
The report attributes increased usage to public transit to several factors, starting with recent economic growth and reduced unemployment. (Translation: More people are working, and many of them are using public transit to get to their jobs.) Improvements in pubic transit systems across the country also help explain higher ridership.
\
Locally, the Lane Transit District reported 11.3 million passenger boardings in 2013 - close to the record 11.7 million reported in 2008. While ridership has remained flat for the last couple of years, the overall trend is encouraging. From 1995 to 2013, LTD ridership increased 61 percent. That's impressive, especially in light of major service reductions in 2010 prompted by stagnant payroll tax revenue and rising personnel costs.
\
Not all the study's findings are rosy. While transit systems carried more passengers last year than any time since the Eisenhower administration, the overall percentage of commuters taking public transit instead of driving, walking or biking remains lower than it was in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
\
In 1960, 12.1 percent of the nation's commuters took public transportation. That dropped to 8.9 percent in 1970 and to 6.2 percent in 1980, the study says. By 2000, the overall percentage had dropped to 4.6 percent, but it has begun to steadily increase and transit's piece of the ""transportation mode"" pie hit 5 percent in 2012.
\
That percentage should continue to increase as long as the federal government continues to finance public transportation improvements, such as future expansions of Eugene's successful EmX system. That means federal lawmakers must find the courage to increase the current 18.4 percent per gallon federal gas tax, which hasn't been raised in more than two decades and has been rendered even more inadequate by inflation and an increase in the fuel efficiency of vehicles. And, eventually, Congress should shift to a pay-per-mile system under which drivers pay a fee for each mile driven on state or federal roads.
\
Without an increased federal investment, the nation's bus, train and subway systems will be unable to keep pace with rising demand. For the sake of the nation's economy, the environment and a functioning, modern transportation system, Congress must figure out a way to provide more money for mass transit.

214,"Having been involved with the Oregon carbon conversation for a number of years; attending all of the workgroups during the 2017 interim and as a member of the House Energy and Environment Committee during the 2017 and 2018 Legislative Session, I believe we all can agree that there are changing climate conditions across our landscape.\On the global scale, Oregon contributes less than one-twentieth of one percent of emissions.\And so the question is, what do Oregonians do to further reduce their carbon emissions and at what cost to them?\Oregonians, and their businesses and industries already are making investments on their own to reduce emissions, and they do so within their free-market policies. Prior Legislation has been passed; such as the Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS), that continues to lower emissions as well. So, what's next?\I continue to have the privilege as the Co-Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Carbon Reduction, to work with colleagues on answering these questions, and I can tell you that HB 2020 is not the answer.\Fellow Committee Co-Vice Chair Sen. Cliff Bentz, R-Ontario, Chairs Karin Power, D- Milwaukie, and Sen. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, and I worked on language for a Carbon Reduction bill for many months prior to Christmas 2018.\We discussed language to protect children and families, their communities and the businesses that support them. We discussed the gargantuan economic impacts to our working families across the state, and how we might mitigate those impacts.\Unfortunately, I feel this work was in vain and powers above the Co-Chairs and Co-Vice Chairs decided to eliminate these mitigating concepts out of HB 2020.\Concerns plague HB 2020, from farm to families to transportation. One example is the estimated 15-cent a gallon gas tax increase; although the bill does not call it out as a tax, that is estimated to generate over $330 million a year.\Although constitutionally mandated to be used on roads and bridges, reduce congestion and other transportation-related projects, HB 2020 has language that is ambiguous at best and creates a new fund for these dollars where monies could flow to projects and programs outside of roads, bridges and congestion relief.\Let us all be very clear, Oregonians emit less than one-twentieth of one percent (.14%) of carbon.\When the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Director, Richard Whitman, was asked by me in committee what impact on global carbon would occur if Oregon were to reduce its' emissions to zero, he responded: ""Rep. Brock Smith, you are correct that Oregon's portion of global carbon emissions is, I'll use the word minuscule.""\When Dr. Philip Mote, Director of the Oregon Climate Services and Oregon Climate Change Research Institute, was asked by me what the impact would be on the global climate if Oregon were to reduce their emissions to zero, he responded the impact would be, ""Imperceptible.""\Proponents of this massive tax know the impacts are 'imperceptible' and 'minuscule', so they have begun to shift their argument for this multi-billion dollar increase on Oregonians to a ""moral and ethical"" narrative.\I believe we have a moral and ethical obligation to keep our children and working families warm, fed and employed, with investments in our children's education, so they may create their own future innovative green energy jobs.\HB 2020 will devastate Oregon families, their communities and the businesses that support them.\Rep.

215,"The Oregon Legislature convened Monday and hundreds of bills were read into the record. Many of them will not make it out of committee and it's almost impossible to tell which ones will gain traction as the session wears on. However here are some bills to watch in 2013:\Senate Bill 120: Treasurer Ted Wheeler introduced this one on behalf of the Oregon Investment Council. It would turn the council into a public corporation, which would have its own budget authority. That would allow Wheeler and the investment board to hire more managers to manage Oregon's $74 billion in investments and save money on management fees.\Senate Bill 346: Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, drafted this bill that would make it illegal to sell or possess any gun with a magazine of more than 10 rounds. She pushed it to the forefront last month after the Newtown, Conn., shooting.\Senate Bill 347: The companion bill to Burdick's limit on capacity. This bill would make it a crime to possess a gun on school grounds.\House Bill 2339: This bill would allow Portland State University to withdraw from the Oregon University System and become a public corporation, which would exempt it from certain laws. It would join Oregon Health Science University in being governed by the Portland Metropolitan Universities Board of Directors, an entity also created by the bill.\House Joint Resolution 1: Refers to voters a constitutional amendment abolishing Oregon's death penalty. Gov. John Kitzhaber said he will support the resolution and has already issued a moratorium on executions during his time in office. He said Monday he supports a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.\House Joint Resolution 2: Would allow voters to approve a constitutional amendment allowing two counties to merge. This is likely designed to help some of Oregon's rural counties that are facing bankruptcy.\Senate Bill 11: This bill, introduced by Treasurer Ted Wheeler, would allow the state to create an investment fund for higher education. The money would be used to help lower income students go to universities, community colleges and vocational programs and would operate much like a university endowment. Higher education funding from the general fund has withered in recent years, and the bill is meant to augment some of that drop in funds. It would be invested by the state and earn interest, which would allow it to grow with no additional tax dollars. It would also be subject to market losses, just as individual university endowments are.\House Bills 2275, 2276 and 2331: These bills increase the cigarette tax, gas tax and create a tax on sugared beverages, respectively. And speaking of cracking down on vices: Some Democrats are supporting House Bill 2077, which would make nicotine a Schedule Three drug, along with barbiturates, hydrocodone and anabolic steroids.\Senate Bill 362: This one stands out in sheer numbers of supporters. Forty-nine legislators representing both parties have already sponsored it. The bill will require the Oregon Health Authority to screen a specified number of women for cervical and breast cancers every year. The number hasn't been chosen yet, but that looks like it will be the only real argument on this bill.\Senate Bill 113: The plastic bag ban. It's back, and it already passed in Portland, Eugene and Corvallis, so it stands a better chance of passing than it did in 2011, the first time it was introduced. There are no individual sponsors this time. Instead, the Senate Interim Committee on Environment and Natural Resources is carrying it to the floor.\ID_Code: J0-130116016"

Oregon was among 13 states that did better than the 25.5 percent average increase for highway money.\""I'm flying home a happy man. A little while ago, I was sweating it,"" said Jason Tell, an Oregon Department of Transportation official, who was in Washington, D.C., during Thursday's vote.\""This is a real bright spot. This is going to help our economy and create jobs,"" said Tell, who follows federal issues for ODOT.\Lawmakers gave lopsided approval in a 417-9 vote, hoping that they will produce a final version after two years of failed efforts. The Senate must take the next step and pass its own version before both chambers can negotiate a compromise bill.\Senators might try to add money, but that likely would trigger a veto threat from President Bush, who wants to limit spending.\The bulk of the transportation money is distributed by formula, but the bill also includes $12.4 billion in local projects requested by members. Many House members seek the projects to give them bragging rights with their constituents. Taxpayer watchdog groups consider the spending pork.\Rep. Darlene Hooley, D-West Linn, said that Marion and Polk counties would get $7 million for projects, including:\- $1.5 million for work on Kuebler Boulevard SE to handle traffic generated by the Salem Regional Employment Center.\- $1 million to widen the Interstate 5 interchange in Woodburn.\- $500,000 to renovate the interchange of Highway 22 and Cascade Highway, east of Salem.\- $1 million to make safety improvements along Highway 22 in Polk County.\Tell credited Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Springfield, for boosting not only the amount of Oregon's highway money but also for increasing the state's share of the overall money for transportation needs other than roads. The multiyear bills the House and Senate produced last year would have given Oregon more highway money but a smaller slice of other transportation money such as public transit.\This year, DeFazio became one of four senior members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee responsible for putting together the House bill and for negotiating with the Senate for a final bill.\""I'm really impressed. He's been very focused on this bill,"" Tell said.\The bill does not change the basic formula for how transportation money is divvied up among the states, although the Senate might try to address that.\Under the old transportation bill, states received at least 90.5 cents in so-called ""formula aid"" for every dollar they contributed in gasoline taxes to the Highway Trust Fund. States that give more than they get - such as Florida, New Jersey and Texas - want to raise that to 95 cents. Oregon received $1.02 return in formula aid, according to an analysis by a coalition of states that put more into the Highway Trust Fund.\Tell said it appears that Oregon will continue to get a higher return for every gas-tax dollar that it puts in.\DeFazio and Tell are looking ahead to the Senate. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Portland, is no longer on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will put together the Senate transportation bill. Wyden and Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Pendleton, have told transportation officials that they will lobby heavily for the state.\But the pressure will be on DeFazio, who is expected to be at the heart of negotiations as the new top Democrat on the Highways, Transit and Pipelines Subcommittee.\eferguso@gns.gannett.com or (202) 906-8116"

Call it the bond measure bonus.
\
Thanks to lower-than-expected construction costs, Eugene is expected to complete more street repair projects than originally called for in the $35.9 million bond measure approved by voters in 2008 to improve city streets.
\
The City Council on Wednesday added seven street projects to the list of 32 repair jobs originally promised in the bond measure.
\
The two largest new projects, totaling $4.3 million, will rebuild Fifth Avenue from High Street downtown to Blair Boulevard in the Whiteaker neighborhood, and West 18th Avenue from Washington Street to east of Chambers Street.
\
""We are all delighted,"" Mayor Kitty Piercy said. ""It's a great benefit to the community.""
\
If the lower than originally projected costs hold up, the city could have $10 million to spend after the last of the 32 projects promised in the bond measure are completed next year, City Engineer Mark Schoening told the council.
\
In an interview, Public Works spokesman Eric Jones said that without that money, it would have taken the city ""at least several more years"" beyond 2013 to repair the additional streets.
\
Some of the bond measure financed street repair projects that will take place this year include Hilyard Street between East 24th and 34th avenues; River Road, from Horn Lane to Railroad Avenue; and East 18th Avenue, between Patterson and Washington streets.
\
The seven new street projects were selected with the help of a 12-member citizen committee that has been reviewing the city's expenditure of bond measure proceeds.
\
Since the bond measure financed work began two years ago, the city has paid contractors less than anticipated, namely because of intense competition by road contractors eager for work, and a decline in the price of oil, used in making asphalt. The city saved money by requiring contractors to grind and reuse asphalt in repaving projects rather than using new asphalt. Also, the city repaved some streets instead of completely rebuilding them, another cost savings.
\
""I want to give you praise for innovations and practices that reduce the impact on the environment,"" Piercy said.
\
The seven new projects are estimated to cost $6.6 million, which could leave about $3.4 million to spend on other street projects in 2013, Schoening told councilors.
\
The citizens committee will continue reviewing the work and recommending other streets to be repaved or rebuilt, he said.
\
To comply with a bond measure mandate to spread street work throughout the city, the seven new projects will take place in each political ward. The $260,000 repaving of Coburg Road, from Crescent Avenue to the northern city limits, extends through two wards, 4 and 5.
\
For much of the past decade, the city financed street repair and rebuilding projects through its nickel-a-gallon gas tax. The repair effort got a big boost when voters approved the bond measure on a 57 percent to 43 percent vote.
\
In spite of the progress against potholes, the city still has a backlog of street work estimated at $150 million.
\
In response to questions from councilors, City Manager Jon Ruiz said the council later may want to consider putting another street repair bond measure before voters next year.
\
MORE STREET WORK
\
Lower construction costs will enable Eugene to complete more street projects than planned. The projects are slated for 2013.
\
W. 18th Ave. from Washington St. to east of Chambers St., $2.3 million
\
Fifth Ave., from High St. to Blair Blvd., $2 million
\
Harris St., from E. 18th to E. 28th avenues, $800,000
\
Donald St., from Willamette St. to E. 40th Ave., $690,000
\
Marshall Ave., from Hughes St. to Echo Hollow Road, $310,000
\
Coburg Road, from Crescent Ave. to city limits, $260,000

It's time to put an end to 90-day extensions.""\North Carolina alone, he said, has had to cancel $1.2 billion in projects, costing 40,000 jobs.\""I believe we should get it done before the middle of May,"" DeFazio said.\It used to be that Congress liked few things better than to pass a highway bill, replete with all the press releases they generated about projects back home.\But for Boxer, the two-year process has at several times resembled pulling teeth, due to the atmospherics of the 112th Congress -- partisan infighting, the shadow of $1 trillion annual deficits and a $15 trillion national debt, as well as volatility in oil prices that ensured any new gas-tax revenues were off the table.\To get her bill through the Senate, which she did with an overwhelmingly bipartisan 74-22 vote on March 14, she had to deal with hundreds of side issues, even insurance coverage for birth control.\""You ask yourself sometimes, 'What do you have to do?'"" Boxer said in an interview.\""It's frustrating for me, especially when I know how tough the economy is for construction workers.""\One of the problems lawmakers face in crafting a highway bill these days, said Ken Orski, a former Transportation Department official who now writes a newsletter that monitors highway funding, is that rank-and-file members are no longer inspired to automatically support highway bills, because they no longer contain earmarks funding targeted for special projects in local areas.\""With earmarks out of the equation, they don't have an incentive to vote for it,"" Orski said.\While the highway bill is finally going to conference, Senate and House members retain sharply different visions of what they want in a final version, especially when it comes to funding.\Meanwhile, study after study shows the United States facing astronomical transportation needs over the next decade, with lawmakers at a crossroads in trying to finance that work.\Contact Paul C.

Forum: Ten candidates toss around ideas for the city's future and call for bridging philosophical divides.
\
Eugene's divisive nature and the City Council bickering it often prompts got the once-over at a candidates' forum on Friday.
\
But while all 10 participants acknowledged that something should be done to bridge the city's philosophical divides, there were precious few new ideas about how to accomplish that task.
\
Candidates for wards 3, 4, 5 and 6 spoke to about 100 people at a luncheon sponsored by the City Club of Eugene, wrestling with Eugene's perennial problems: growth, livability and funding.
\
Tucked among the usual promises of future civility on a council known for its fractiousness, however, were some interesting suggestions dealing with other matters.
\
How about a ""welcome kit"" for new businesses, explaining how to negotiate the city's labyrinthine planning and permit process? Thank Ward 6 candidate Rich Cunningham for that one.
\
How about credit against parking or traffic tickets for those who buy and use bus passes? Ward 5 incumbent Gary Pape brought this notion to the table.
\
How about assigning members of the planning commission by wards so that constituents from one neighborhood don't dominate it? Club member Ron Farmer proposed it, and Ward 4 candidates Kevin Wells and George Poling seemed agreeable to the idea.
\
Not all the candidates had the opportunity to answer all the questions posed by club members.
\
Ward 3's David Kelly didn't have to tackle the touchy West Eugene Parkway issue, for example.
\
Only Ward 4 - Wells and Poling - and Ward 5 - Pape, Pat Hadley and Jim Hale - fielded that question.
\
All, but Hadley agreed that the voters have spoken and that the West Eugene Parkway is part of the solution to west Eugene's transportation woes.
\
Wells, Hale and Pape pointed out that the parkway only solves part of the problem, with more work needed on Belt Line Road and West 11th Avenue using money the state should provide.
\
""The problem is the state is not giving us our fair share of the money,"" Hale said.
\
Hadley focused instead on what she considers to be the council's ill-informed decisions: spending money to preserve wetlands only to turn around and run a highway through them or granting Hynix a tax break only to learn that the computer chip maker had appealed last year's taxes in a decision that could cost the city plenty. She scolded the council's lack of fiscal restraint.
\
""If Eugene were my child, I would consider spanking it because it has no discipline and needs to start getting some,"" she said.
\
Candidates from Ward 6 - Jennifer Solomon, Frank Wiley, Kurt Thelan and Cunningham - and Ward 3 - Kelly (his opponent, Maco Stewart, did not attend) - were asked how to restore public confidence in the council.
\
Solomon said councilors should recognize that they represent not just those who voted for them, but the entire ward.
\
""We also need to explain our positions in an open and honest forum,"" she said.
\
Wiley promised to work for harmony and consensus.
\
""The city is not going to move forward until the council gets its act together,"" he said.
\
Cunningham suggested that a coalition of interested parties - business owners, environmentalists, educators, labor leaders - be brought together to define Eugene's priorities and return recommendations to the council.
\
Thelan said that building confidence would not happen overnight because of the presence of incumbent councilors. He suggested restoring confidence by canceling executive sessions, where councilors meet privately.
\
The best way to restore confidence is simply to get the job done, Kelly said.
\
""Nothing succeeds like success,"" he said, pointing to the branch libraries and construction of the new downtown library as examples of what councilors can do when they work well together.
\
Asked about other sources of funding than property taxes, Solomon proposed a transportation utility fee and gas tax as ways to address roads and transportation costs.
\
She proposed tax relief in some other form to encourage voter support.
\
Cunningham and Thelan said streamlining government and living within the city's means were the better options.
\
""We should stop asking people for money. We need to stay within our means,"" Thelan said.
\
And on the inevitable tussle over growth vs. livability, several candidates agreed that growth is inevitable and should be managed.
\
""It's not development or the environment,"" Pape said. ""It's how do we do both.""
\
Perhaps the most pointed question of the day went to Solomon. As a member the Gang of 9, she drew attention to council decisions last summer with an ad campaign of cartoons that targeted the council's liberal members. During most of that campaign the Gang of 9 hid behind a curtain of anonymity.
\
""How do you feel you can bring the community together?"" asked club member Nancy English, considering the divisiveness of the campaign.
\
Solomon defended the cartoons as a long-standing and respected form of political commentary.
\
""We wanted more people to pay attention,"" Solomon said. In that regard, she said, the campaign was a success.
\
""Whether it translates into more people filling out their ballots remains to be seen,"" Solomon said.

ROSEBURG - Visiting a traditional Republican stronghold, Democratic front-runner Barack Obama leveled harsh criticism at President Bush and took aim at likely GOP opponent John McCain, saying a vote for the candidate would be asking for four more years of Bush's policies.
\
Standing before a crowd of about 1,500 that packed the Roseburg High School cafeteria, Obama focused on health care before fielding questions from the audience.
\
Obama drew strong response as he promised universal health care and lower drug costs by the end of his first term.
\
In the past eight years, Bush did nothing for the health care system except ""offer a few tax breaks to a few people who didn't really need them,"" he said before targeting McCain, saying ""he wants to give you the same failed Bush health care plan.""
\
The reason drug costs aren't lower has nothing to do with ideology, he said, but rather ""cronies"" of the drug companies in Washington who fight against making them affordable.
\
In his first visit to Douglas County - part of a weekendlong stump through the state - he also garnered applause from the mostly working-class crowd about creating jobs through manufacturing eco-friendly products, including biodiesel from wood chips.
\
Obama also made several appearances in Eugene on Saturday as he traveled along Interstate 5, including stops at Sacred Heart Medical Center in the morning and Prince Puckler's ice cream shop in the afternoon.
\
Addressing a question about McCain's choice to discuss the environment in Portland last Monday, Obama once again criticized the Arizona senator, calling his plans for more drilling and a gas tax holiday a ""phony solution"" that isn't thinking about the long-term but rather about ""how to get through the next election.""
\
He also weighed in on what he called a ""dustup"" with Bush over statements the president made in Israel on Friday.
\
The pair have been sparring in the press since Bush said that negotiating with America's enemies was ""appeasement"" - a seeming jab at Obama, who said he will meet with any leader for discussions.
\
Using a speech in a foreign country to make a political attack is ""appalling,"" Obama said, adding that Bush's foreign policy has led to the war in Iraq, which he called ""al-Qaeda's greatest recruiting tool.""
\
McCain has also ""embraced"" this policy, said Obama, who promised to have troops out of the country in 16 months.
\
""I will end it, I will end this war,"" Obama said, causing the cafeteria to erupt in cheers.
\
McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds promptly issued a written response, saying that ""Senator Obama is missing the point, it's the 'unconditional' that's unacceptable. Barack Obama's pledge to unconditionally bring (Iranian president) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the world stage isn't 'new politics,' it's incredibly weak judgment and reveals why Americans will elect John McCain's record of experience, and tested leadership.""
\
Despite suffering a loss to Hillary Clinton in West Virginia on Tuesday, Obama seemed assured that he would be the Democratic nominee, saying Clinton was a ""formidable opponent.""
\
The senator from Illinois said he doesn't believe that white working-class voters would necessarily vote for McCain if he becomes the nominee.
\
""For all the differences between myself and Senator Clinton, those differences pale in comparison,"" he said. ""People could not have a starker choice in this election.""
\
But he also said he will cooperate with members on both sides of the political aisle, noting his past work with conservative Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma on government transparency issues, and saying he would meet weekly with bipartisan groups, so ""right away people feel like they're being heard.""
\
Obama seemed at home during the town hall meeting, joking that he would answer questions in ""boy, girl, boy, girl,"" order, then quipping that the microphone being passed through the crowded rows reminded him of the way beer is served at a ballgame.
\
""Or a collection plate,"" he added with a smile.
\
He ended his hourlong session with the crowd by encouraging them to cast their ballots by Tuesday, adding that they now must be dropped off at official ballot collection sites rather than be mailed.
\
""I'm confident I will win Oregon, I'm confident I will win the nomination and I'm confident I will win this nation,"" he said before leaving the stage to a standing ovation, where he shook hands with fans before leaving the high school.
\
Taysia Malone said she is among the more than 60 percent of Roseburg residents who are registered as a Republican, but she's dissatisfied with both McCain and Clinton.
\
Malone, 47, said her mother, a Democrat, encouraged her to attend the meeting, and Obama's personal appearance swayed her. She's never voted for a Democrat before, she said, but the candidate's responses on health care and education impressed her.
\
""I will probably vote for him in the fall - that's a big change,"" Malone said. ""I shook his hand and said I was a Republican, and he said, 'No, you're an Obama-can!'?""
\
Myrtle Creek resident Shawn Eastridge said he's a registered Independent, but that he and his fiancee - also an Independent - will vote for Obama.
\
""I liked the health care plan, I think it's a good deal,"" the 26-year-old millworker said.
\
Obama's tour through the state continues today. Stops include a rally at Waterfront Park in Portland at 2:30 p.m. and another town hall meeting in Pendleton at 6:30 p.m.

222,"A tight budget means that few sites actually will be developed. \BY SARA SHIPLEY \Statesman Journal \Recreation is booming in Oregon. And for 26 years, Roger Kirschner has been riding that wave. \Business has been brisk at his Highway Trailer Sales Inc. company in Salem, where adventurers can buy a truck camper or a trailer to haul their stuff for a weekend of fishing, camping or relaxing. \But for all the new campers Kirschner sells, there are precious few additional places to camp. Oregon's population has grown more than 25 percent in the past two decades, but Oregon hasn't added a new state park campground in 20 years. \Kirschner himself reserves state campsites three months ahead of time and avoids the most popular campgrounds on holiday weekends. \""I think there's a lot of people moving into the state, and there needs to be more places for them to recreate,"" Kirschner said. \With the voter-approved addition of up to $$@$!43 million in lottery funds a year for state parks and salmon recovery efforts, hopes have grown high for the creation of state parks. \State legislators this session have proposed creating at least four new state parks with the Measure 66 funds, including scuba diving parks on the coast and a new park in suburban Washington County. \But it's unlikely that the historically cash-strapped Oregon Parks and Recreation Department will be able to fulfill most of those demands. Rather than getting a @$!12 million net increase. \The rest of the money has been used to replace other funding sources revoked since Measure 66 passed. The department's @$!15 million in lottery-backed bond revenues have been replaced by the Measure 66 money. \""The bottom line for the public is, people's expectations were raised, and nothing near their expectations is going to occur,"" said Jim Lockwood, government relations manager for the parks department. ""Things are better, but not nearly as much better as people had hoped."" \The Oregon Parks Department relies on day-use and camping fees to keep its budget afloat. But with only $$@$!5 million allocated for new park creation, the department is unable to create many new parks to generate additional money for further development. \The loss of gas tax money 20 years ago has forced the parks department to rely on its wits and increased fees for survival. Creative campsites - such as yurts, cabins, houseboats and covered wagons - are wildly popular. Officials hope to generate more cash from a new line of state park clothing and accessories. \Campaigns encourage Oregonians to fill up parks in the off-season with discounted winter and spring rates. Free camping and day use during the annual State Parks Day, celebrated this year on Saturday, is another lure to get locals hooked on state parks. \Some additional money has been proposed in the 1999-2001 parks budget, which awaits a vote on the House floor next week. The budget contains @$!5 million for new park development. \But legislative proposals for new parks far outstrip the available funding. \One pending bill would require the state to purchase Thompson's Mills, a 140-year-old water-powered grist mill in Shedd. The state has estimated the cost to buy and restore the site and associated water rights at more than $$@$!4 million. \Another proposal would require the creation of a new park in Washington County. It would be the first state park in the county, a thickly populated region adjacent to Portland. \An attempt to create scuba diving parks similar to those in California and Washington died in committee, while a bill to develop Crissey Field in Southern Oregon as a state park has passed both houses and now heads to Gov. John Kitzhaber for consideration. \Some of these are great ideas, Lockwood said. \But none of these ideas qualifies as a funding priority, according to a list created by the Parks and Recreation Commission in February. The commission cited $$@$!8.3 million worth of projects, most focused on the popular Oregon Coast. \Parks are costly to build. They must not only be pretty, but profitable, Lockwood said. \""What's really got to happen is somebody's got to weigh the benefit to Oregonians of the diversity, location and other factors,"" Lockwood said. ""One factor is the ability to generate revenue."" \New priorities \WHALEN ISLAND, TILLAMOOK COUNTY: 179.5 acres north of Pacific City, $$@$!2.85 million \SOUTH BEACH STATE PARK ADDITION, LINCOLN COUNTY: 35-acre campground addition, $$@$!1 million \CAPE SEBASTIAN ADDITION, CURRY COUNTY: 258 acres, seven miles south of Gold Beach, with one mile of oceanfront, $$@$!2.4 million \FORT YAMHILL ADDITION, POLK COUNTY: 93 acres adjoining undeveloped historic site, $$@$!1.1 million \SISTERS ROCK, CURRY COUNTY: 75-acre scenic headland 13 miles north of Gold Beach, $$@$!1 million \Source: Oregon State Parks and Recreation Commission recommendations Environment; Land Use; Park Salem Oregon West\PAGE ONE; Pg. 1A"
223,"The Oregon Legislature will meet Monday to swear in newly elected members, adopt rules, and officially read bills -- lots of bills.\The Senate has set a record for the number of presession-filed bills, with 738 this year.\That compares with about 125 in the early 2000s and around 500 for recent sessions, said James Goulding, the Senate's reading and journal clerk.\As a result, fewer bills should be filed during the session, Goulding said, meaning lawmakers are getting more work done ahead of time, and the public gets more time to weigh in.\All those bills will give the public an idea of what will be on the agenda when the Legislature returns Feb. 1 for the start of the 79th Legislative Assembly.\But clearly, the biggest issue is the budget.\Oregon is facing a $1.7 billion budget shortfall to maintain current services and fund education ballot measures approved by voters. New programs will cost even more.\Gov. Kate Brown's recommended budget includes proposals for new revenue, including increased tobacco and liquor taxes; fees on hospitals and insurers; and closing some tax loopholes.\Lawmakers also will look at ways to cut spending, with the most likely target the state's growing public pension costs.\Here are some other issues to watch for:\Transportation\Republicans blocked a transportation funding package during the 2015 session after Democrats passed a contentious bill extending the state's clean fuels program.\But both sides acknowledge funding is desperately needed.\The governor and lawmakers have been working since to develop support for a transportation package, which would send millions of dollars to the Oregon Department of Transportation for roads, bridges, and traffic congestion relief.\A package would likely come with revenue proposals such as a higher gas tax and registration fee increases.\Distracted driving\Drivers who occasionally take a peek at their email, post a selfie or take calls while driving will want to keep an eye on the proposed amendments to Oregon's distracted driving law.\If passed, drivers who text, use social media or talk on the phone while driving could face jail time and thousands of dollars in fines.\Oregon Senate President Peter Courtney, a member of Oregon's Distracted Driver Task Force, met with law enforcement and state officials in December to discuss changes to the existing law.\The amendments would steepen distracted driving fines and clarify the law to include any mobile electronic device. Illegal actions would include text messaging, talking, navigation, accessing the internet or reading emails.\Officials are hoping stricter laws, combined with education and enforcement, will help reverse the uptick in distracted driving deaths.\""Distracted driving-related injuries and deaths are becoming an epidemic,"" Courtney wrote in his testimony. ""Until we, as a state, take distracted driving as seriously as drunk driving we aren't going to be able to change behavior.""\Environment\Conservation groups are expected to again push legislation dealing with antibiotics in farm animals, genetically modified crops, and pesticides.\Another proposal would require the Environmental Quality Commission to come up with a plan for tracking air pollution from large dairies such as the Threemile Canyon Farms in the Columbia Gorge.\In 2005, researchers found elevated concentrations of ammonia and other nitrogen compounds in the eastern Gorge, with Threemile Canyon as a possible source.\The discovery prompted the formation of a legislative task force on dairies and air quality, but its recommendations, made in 2008, never were implemented.\Spurred by a proposed second mega-dairy in the area, lawmakers may require state officials to revisit the recommendations.\Marijuana\Expect the Legislature to address reported marijuana shortages that rattled the marketplace last year. In addition, there are a few interesting legislative concepts to watch out for.\There is a proposal to change the name of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission.\Right now, the OLCC oversees recreational sales of marijuana. Medical dispensaries, regulated by the Oregon Health Authority, had to stop their sales of recreational pot at the end of last year.\The proposal calls for the addition of four commissioners from the marijuana retail industry, bringing the total number of commissioners to nine.\Another proposal calls for the establishment of a task force for ""social consumption of cannabis.""\That means 14 people would determine where residents and visitors could legally use pot in social places in Oregon.\The task force would ""develop, in consideration of individuals who want to consume cannabis in this state but who do not have access to a private residence where cannabis can be lawfully consumed, recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes.""\Education funding\Last year, the legislature passed the K-12 education budget in the shortest amount of time in more than 20 years. It was considered a significant win by many as it had bi-partisan support and was one of the largest education budgets to date.\This year, however, is anticipated to be much more difficult. Gov. Kate Brown's recently announced budget falls short by millions of dollars for education, compared to previous budgets. Some institutions need more to stay afloat, let alone grow.\The Oregon School Boards Association plans to focus on revenue reform and cost containment, which could affect PERS, Oregon's Public Employees Retirement System.\The Oregon Department of Education plans to focus on subjects including absenteeism, graduation rates, career technical education, safety in schools, and a more diversified teacher workforce in the upcoming session.\Reporters Jonathan Bach, Whitney Woodworth and Natalie Pate contributed to this report.\Organizational days\The Oregon Legislature meets Monday to swear in members, adopt rules and read bills.\Here's the schedule:\8:30 a.m. House convenes, swears in newly elected members.\9:30 a.m. Senate convenes, swears in newly elected members.\10:45 Joint session.

That Oregon's economy is mired in recession is no longer in dispute. But less clear is how quickly it will recover.
\
The economic and revenue forecast released by the state Wednesday was the latest piece of bleak news on the economy. It came on the heels of a report Monday that found the state had shed 14,100 jobs in September and the jobless rate was up nearly a full percentage point from the previous month, to 7.3 percent.
\
State economists were hard pressed to find any good news in their quarterly economic report, stating flatly, ""Oregon is in a recession.""
\
""We see this recession getting deeper than what was previously expected,"" State Economist Tom Potiowsky told lawmakers.
\
Employment is likely to decline 3.2 percent in the last three months of this year, and continue to fall in the first nine months of 2009, the economists said. One bright spot is that Oregon is not seeing the same level of subprime foreclosures on real estate that many other states are facing.
\
""We'll probably come out of this a lot better than other states,"" Potiowsky said.
\
That said, however, Potiowsky added that Oregon's track record doesn't bode well for an early recovery.
\
""We are not in as bad a situation, but to the extent that this recession is deeper and lasts longer, Oregon has a history, once it's a full-blown recession, to generally do worse,"" he said. ""We have to be prepared for that possibility.""
\
Oregon's economy won't start to recover until the first half of 2010, according to the state's forecast. But the state economists noted that forecasting the length and depth of a recession is difficult, a point reiterated by economist Ed Whitelaw, founder and president of EcoNorthwest, a consulting firm based in Eugene.
\
Economists are ""especially bad at forecasting corners"" - those moments when conditions peak or bottom out and begin to turn, he said. ""Everybody in forecasting has a terrible time forecasting when it will hit the bottom and start back up.""
\
Tim Duy, director of the Oregon Economic Forum at the University of Oregon, said a 2010 recovery may be overly optimistic, given the ""sudden downshift"" in economic activity in the third quarter that's continuing in the final three months of the year.
\
State economists seem to imply that this recession won't be as bad as the 2001-03 recession but, based on recent job losses, the employment sector of the economy is already weaker than it was in the first part of the decade, Duy said.
\
""That concerns me that the revenue forecast is going to have to be downgraded significantly in future months,"" he said. ""I hope that I'm wrong.""
\
Bryce Ward, a senior economist with EcoNorthwest, also said he thought the economy may not be in recovery by late 2010, but the speed of any recovery will depend greatly on government policy, particularly at the federal level.
\
""Consumers aren't spending. Firms are not investing, both because they can't get credit and they know consumers aren't spending,"" he said. ""Now it's up to the government to grease the wheels a little bit.""
\
Gov. Ted Kulongoski has proposed raising the gas tax and vehicle fees to fund an ambitious plan to build and fix roads and bridges and pay for transit projects, which he said would provide a major economic boost to Oregon.
\
Ward and Whitelaw said spending money on transportation is not a bad idea, but there are other ways government can stimulate the economy, through social, human and natural capital. Spending public money to improve health care, education and the environment also will produce jobs, help stimulate the economy and leave the country in a better position when the economy recovers, they said.
\
""All these expenditures are based on a simple premise,"" Whitelaw said. ""Do we expect recovery from recession? If the answer is yes, then as we are spending money today, then let's pay attention to what we'd like to look like tomorrow.""
\
Ward likened the economy in recession to a sick patient.
\
""Right now we're sick, and when you're really sick, you don't think you're going to get better,"" he said. ""You might think you're going to die. You're miserable.
\
""You've got to keep in mind we'll get better, but we don't want to do something while you're sick that you might end up regretting when you're healthy.""
\
Said Whitelaw: ""The medicines you take and the care you receive now play a role in what kind of physical and mental condition you'll be in when you're in recovery.""
\
Ryan Deckert, president of the Oregon Business Association, said he's struck by what experts are saying about how long the recession will last.
\
""Never have I heard people who I trust talk about this national, global recession with such a pessimistic long-term outlook,"" he said.
\
But Deckert said there's no place he'd rather be than Oregon because the state is not overly dependent on the sectors hardest hit by the current downturn, and because it is rapidly becoming a national center for the renewable energy industry. Five or six major solar manufacturers have located in Oregon, and two or three more are looking at locating here, he said.
\
""We have a disproportionate share of those jobs already,"" he said.

225,"
SALEM - Gov. Ted Kulongoski sought Monday to inspire lawmakers to overcome the gloom of an economic downturn as they embark on the Legislature's 75th assembly since statehood.
\
Oregon's economic rainstorm - marked by unemployment above 8 percent and a budget shortfall of more than $1 billion - forced a somber mood on those in the Capitol for the opening day of the 2009 session.
\
In his State of the State address, Kulongoski said the times call for Oregon's decision-makers to ""redeem hope"" and fulfill the highest calling of public service.
\
""Today I say to you: Do not use this legislative session to surrender to fear,"" he told a House chamber packed with all 90 legislators, statewide officeholders, black-robed judges and others.
\
The governor cast the current economic and budgetary downturn in historic terms, noting that past governors and legislatures have served during times of war, natural disasters and the Great Depression.
\
""But we always treat these difficult times not as the hand of fate at work - but as a call to get to work with our own hands, minds and spirits,"" the governor said. ""That is what we must do again - by building on what is already here.""
\
The governor's speech was shorter than his earlier State of the State addresses, lasting just more than 15 minutes. Still, he took advantage of his audience's newly seated legislators to urge their support for the agenda he's been laying out for the past two months.
\
Kulongoski wants to expand health coverage to 80,000 uninsured Oregon children and 75,000 poor adults. He wants to increase a green-energy tax credit for businesses that spend money on conservation or renewable power. He wants to put $2 billion into public works projects on campuses, roadways and the sites of future prisons and psychiatric hospitals - including two such institutions in Junction City. And he wants to bolster a scholarship program for college students and to increase education spending.
\
Under the governor's plan, those initiatives would be paid for and the budget balanced by trimming social safety net programs, raising targeted taxes and fees by $2 billion, and borrowing on the bond market.
\
Kulongoski acknowledged that asking the Legislature to raise taxes - even in a session when Democrats hold solid majorities - is a tall order.
\
While discussing his plan to raise taxes on hospitals and medical insurers to cover children's health care needs, he said: ""Yes - that means finding the political courage to raise revenue. What are we afraid of? These are our children!""
\
Some lawmakers said afterward they were troubled by Kulongoski's omissions.
\
The Democratic governor made no mention of other tax proposals he's pushing: a 2-cent increase in the gas tax and higher vehicle fees, an added 60 cents per pack for the cigarette tax and a raise in the corporate minimum tax from $10 to between $25 and $5,000.
\
Senate Republican Leader Ted Ferrioli of John Day said the governor's plans for taxing and borrowing represent what's wrong with the Democrats' approach to the state's fiscal and economic woes.
\
""They want to tax, borrow and spend until every credit card is maxed out,"" he said.
\
House Republican Leader Bruce Hanna of Roseburg said his party would rather see the Legislature work on economic revival by lowering taxes and the cost of government.
\
""We see the session as being about jobs because until you create that environment that fosters jobs, keeps businesses in Oregon, you're going to have a revenue problem,"" said Hanna, whose district includes eastern Lane County.
\
Sen. Bill Morrisette, D-Springfield, said he deliberately limited his applause to a single clap of the hands as a small way of protesting the low priority he sees the governor giving to seniors and people with disabilities.
\
Cuts to their services would be as deep as 18 percent. Kulongoski made no reference to this in his speech.
\
""It just bothers me that he didn't even talk about that,"" Morrisette said. ""I don't know that he really understands the impact of his cuts.""
\
While such political discord is certain to mark the session, the stagecraft of the Legislature's first day back in Salem kept conflict to a minimum.
\
In the House, majority Democrats elected Rep. Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone, as speaker. The chamber's members voted unanimously for the first time in years to adopt rules governing the flow of bills to the floor and other matters.
\
Hunt, a Sheldon High School graduate, will enjoy the most commanding Democratic House majority - 36 out of 60 members - since the 1970s. In a speech following the vote, Hunt paid homage to his late father, a Baptist minister who wore a lapel pin of a sword being beaten into a plowshare. The image evokes a passage from the biblical book of Isaiah, in which the prophet makes the case for turning from conflict and war to peace and productivity.
\
The Democratic speaker gave identical pins, made from melted-down remnants of a fighter jet, to each of his 59 colleagues, saying he hoped they might prompt legislators to resist the urge to fight and try to get things done instead.
\
A half-hour after Hunt's election, veteran Sen. Peter Courtney was re-elected to a record-tying fourth session as that chamber's president.
\
Courtney, D-Salem, was elected unanimously, with the 12 Republicans joining their 18 Democratic colleagues in backing him. Sen. Jackie Winters, R-Salem, introduced him with accolades and Ferrioli handed Courtney the gavel as they met at the Senate rostrum.
\

226,"
Four candidates are vying in the May 20 election for what promises to be an unenviable job of dismantling Lane County government as a member of the Lane County Board of Commissioners representing the north Eugene district.
\
Much of the demolition may already be done by the time the winner of the primary, or of a possible fall runoff, is sworn in next January. With prospects for renewal of federal timber payments dimming, commissioners plan to cut 12 percent of the county's workforce by July 1. That will mean sharp reductions in jail beds, sheriff's patrols and prosecutions. It will bring the elimination of search and rescue, animal control, communicable disease control and a long list of other services.
\
The prospects of finding new revenues to restore those services are grim. Voters have twice rejected county income tax proposals since 2006 - and before that turned down 11 straight public safety measures.
\
Against that bleak backdrop, one might assume three-term incumbent Bobby Green, 53, would eagerly be planning to move on to other opportunities. His departure seemed likely after he was targeted by an unsuccessful recall effort stemming from last year's defeat of an income tax that Green, along with Commissioners Faye Stewart and Bill Dwyer, voted to enact in the face of what appeared to be an imminent loss of federal payments. (Congress eventually extended payments for a year.)
\
Instead, Green is seeking re-election, saying his experience will be needed as the county deals with the loss of federal payments and charts a new course without the funds that have long been county government's revenue lifeblood.
\
Voters should take Green up on his offer to serve another term. His experience and understanding of county government is immensely valuable, but his biggest contribution is his steadying, unifying presence on a board whose proclivity for fractiousness could prove problematic in the critical years to come.
\
Green's main opponent is Rob Handy, a 50-year-old landscape contractor, neighborhood activist and core member of Eugene's progressive political community. Also running are Steve Sherbina, a 48-year-old heavy equipment operator at the Eugene Water & Electric Board, and Nadia Sindi, a 54-year-old translator and educator.
\
Sherbina decided to run after what he says was a frustrating effort to secure Green's help resolving a personal tax dispute. He has no political experience and his priorities are boosting tourism and economic development. He criticizes Green's support for an income tax and would prioritize social services and public safety in future budgets.
\
Sindi made unsuccessful runs for the Lane Community College Board in 2003 and the Eugene School Board in 2005, and is a past member of the Lane County Human Rights Commission. She believes the solution to the county's budget woes is a new income tax that targets large companies, and would prioritize treatment and prevention services over public safety. Sindi says Green is biased toward development and timber interests that contribute to his re-election campaigns and says she would do more to protect the environment.
\
In contrast to Sherbina and Sindi, Handy is a veteran political activist. He is the toughest challenger Green has faced since 2000, when he defeated former Oregon House minority leader Kitty Piercy. Handy is waging a vigorous grass-roots campaign that has drawn more than $50,000 in contributions and a large corps of volunteers from both the River Road-Santa Clara area and Eugene's progressive community.
\
While this is Handy's first try for elective office, he has an impressive political rsum. It includes co-chairmanship of Eugene's Neighborhood Leadership Council, and participation in government and volunteer groups addressing River Road-Santa Clara annexation issues, Union Pacific Train yard pollution, parks and greenway protection and transportation issues. He is a member of the Citizens for Public Accountability board.
\
Handy's top priority is to close the ""trust gap"" between county government and the people it serves. He says Green widened that gap last year by voting to enact an income tax after voters had already defeated an earlier income tax.
\
Handy is right that enactment of the tax alienated many voters, a point Green readily concedes. But Handy glosses over the very real crisis that prompted Green's vote - an imminent loss of federal payments that was narrowly averted by a one-year extension of the program. Handy mischaracterizes Green as brazenly defying the will of voters, when the reality is he responded responsibly and courageously in an effort to avert the same budget crisis the county now faces one year later.
\
Handy also criticizes Green for failing to prepare for a loss of federal payments that he says commissioners should have predicted more than a decade ago. That's revisionist history. When Congress approved the Secure Rural Schools Act in 2000 to replace falling timber revenues from federal forests, rural counties were hopeful that lawmakers would honor the federal government's century-old commitment to rural counties by extending the payments, or even making them permanent.
\
Handy wants to put the county's budget ""back on track"" but is light on specifics of how he would make up for the sledgehammer losses of $20 million to the county's general fund and the same amount to the county's road fund. He would consider raising fees and a new restaurant tax, but that overlooks the hefty fee increases that already have taken place in recent years and the small amount of money they, along with a restaurant tax, would generate.
\
By contrast, Green offers a more realistic approach to the county's budget dilemma, one that includes negotiating for the state to assume responsibility for targeted health and human services and lobbying in Salem for a statewide gas-tax increase, which could replenish the county's road fund. Both Green and Handy believe proposed federal legislation that would increase logging in Western Oregon forests through increased thinning could also generate new county revenues.
\
In light of reductions to the road fund, Handy questions recent expenditures, including $8 million that commissioners shifted from a stalled Belt Line Road/Delta Highway project to build the Bob Straub Parkway in Springfield's Jasper Natron area. Handy is wrong to criticize spending on the parkway, which is vital to development of the largest remaining undeveloped area inside the city's urban growth boundary. But he is right to suggest the county should consider recouping a larger portion of future road projects through an increase in systems development charges.
\
Aside from such policy arguments, Handy makes an unconvincing case that Green is weary and emotionally burned out after three terms and that it's time for a high-energy, motivated newcomer such as - well, such as Rob Handy. That doesn't jibe with Green's consistent, steady performance as a commissioner, in related activities involving tourism (he was a key player in bringing the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials to Eugene), and in his youth and human rights advocacy.
\
Voters should re-elect Bobby Green to the north Eugene seat on the Lane County Board of Commissioners.

227,"Richard R. Aguirre\Capitol Watch\Gov. Ted Kulongoski and the Legislature's chief budget-writers fired rhetorical shots across the bow of the ship of state late last week.\It's time for Oregonians to fire back - in person, preferably, or by a phone call, letter, e-mail or fax.\Those are the best ways to let lawmakers know what you think about their proposed state budgets.\Whether you get involved in this debate or not, lawmakers soon will make decisions that will affect your education system, your public safety, your environment, your state economy and the social services hundreds of thousands of people rely on every day.\It's important that you communicate with lawmakers now - and that they take time to listen.\Friday could provide the perfect opportunity for those conversations.\The Legislature won't be in session Friday; legislators are supposed to meet with constituents.\Some lawmakers are planning to meet with community groups; others will return messages from constituents.\Unfortunately, the nine representatives and four senators whose districts cover parts of Marion and Polk counties have not announced plans to hold public meetings Friday.\In light of that, I'd like to offer a modest suggestion.\Since plenty of meeting space and parking will be available at the Capitol on Friday, the 13 local lawmakers should convene a public meeting on the budget to learn more about local needs. It would be nice if the governor, who also lives in Salem, dropped by to listen.\A weekend meeting would be better, so students and working people could attend, but a Friday session at the Capitol would be a good start.\Local lawmakers could outline the budget proposals and invite constituents to offer their reaction and ideas. Lawmakers also could spend time meeting individually with constituents.\Providing this outreach would help local lawmakers show they care what their constituents think and set a fine example of public spiritedness.\The state of Oregon faces enormous budget problems - a fact made abundantly clear by the new proposed budgets.\Oregon's recession has lowered projected tax collections during the past two years, sharply reducing the money needed to pay for education, public safety, social services and other programs.\Lawmakers held five special sessions last year to rebalance the general fund and lottery budget for 2001-03. They used reserves, cut state programs and services, pushed costs into the next two-year budget and asked voters to raise taxes. They had to rebalance the budget a sixth time - in March - because of further revenue declines and the defeat of a proposed income tax increase in January.\The budgets suggested for 2003-05 by legislative leaders and the governor propose nearly the same level of spending as four years ago even though the state population has grown and it costs more to operate government than it did in 1999-2001.\Budget leaders propose spending $11.2 billion and keeping $400 million of that in reserve. They are calling for about $4.8 billion for K-12 schools, cuts to universities, human services, corrections and other programs as well as a freeze in public employee wages and benefits.\Gov. Kulongoski on Friday also proposed an $11.2 billion general fund and lottery budget. He called for $4.9 billion for public schools and a 1-cent gas tax increase to pay for state troopers. He opposes general tax increases, saying government must live within its means.\All that sets up great opportunities for public debate, said Sen. Kurt Schrader, D-Canby, the co-chairman of the budget-writing Joint Ways and Means Committee.\""Is this enough for K-12? What happens to higher education? In both budgets it doesn't look too good, quite frankly,"" he said.\""How do you want to spend economic development dollars? What role does the government play in that area?\""What about labor and apprenticeship programs? Is that important, or is it not? What role do community colleges play in terms of getting things going?\""The big discussion has to be, what do people think about human services? Is this just a welfare giveaway program, or are these programs worthwhile for seniors, children, and for men and women who have been thrown out of their jobs because of this tremendous recession. Do we have to do something there in a thoughtful manner?""\Sen. Steve Harper, the vice chairman of the Joint Ways and Means Committee, said he believes state government must trim expenses and not raise taxes.\Still, he said lawmakers want to learn what Oregonians think about the budget.\""What you have here is our idea. What you had Friday was the governor's idea. If you have a different idea, tell us what that idea is,"" Harper said.\Schrader agrees, adding that he hopes the news media encourage lawmakers to reach out to the public.\""We spend a lot of time in this building and talk to ourselves and listen to ourselves talk, and talk to the usual suspects,"" Schrader said.\""I think it's a lot more valuable if you (reporters) encourage us with that gentle drumbeat to get out there and have town hall meetings, go to school board meetings, meet with chambers of commerce, so the legislators can start to lay some of this out, and community members push back and talk about what is important to them.""\Hopefully, local lawmakers will listen to Schrader - and you.\State Editor Richard R. Aguirre can be reached at (503) 399-6739 or raguirre@StatesmanJournal.com\Make a difference\There are many ways to influence lawmakers on the budget and other issues:\VISIT THE CAPITOL and meet with your representative or senator. Lawmakers say they value face-to-face meetings with constituents. Letters, telephone calls and e-mail also have an impact, but only if they are personalized, specific and offer solutions.\TESTIFY AT PUBLIC HEARINGS and observe House and Senate sessions. Personal involvement shows lawmakers you have a stake in the outcome and that you are watching what they do.\FOCUS YOUR LOBBYING efforts on lawmakers in the middle - moderate Democrats or Republicans from districts that are evenly divided among political parties. They tend to be most responsive to constituent requests because their re-election is most dependent on their service and how they are perceived by the public.\CHECK THE State Legislature page of the Statesman Journal, Monday through Saturday, for the session convening times, committee hearing schedules and news.

Christian-bashing sparks voters
\
Let's have lots more letters like the ones on the Dec. 6 editorial page.
\
They provided even more examples than usual of the arrogant anti- Christian attitude that has been the principal response of the Democrats to the moral values voters who carried so many conservative candidates and ballot measures to victory last month. If Democrats for some reason want to solidify the redness of the red states (or ""Jesusland,"" as some of them have derisively nicknamed most of the nation), and imperil the blueness of the blue, this is the way to do it.
\
One letter on Dec. 6 mocked those who just elected a president as being less intelligent than monkeys. On the same day, a second letter labeled many Christians as ""absolutists ... impervious to dialogue"" and noted the ""rambling incoherence"" of their scriptures. A third could not tolerate the intolerance of those who disapprove of homosexuality and built an argument on a ludicrous distortion of the words of Jesus. A fourth lamented the ""proto-fascist administration"" re-elected by a ""misinformed or uninformed electorate.""
\
I'll keep this short to allow plenty of room for more such letters.

Reindeer theft dampens spirits
\
Merry Christmas to the person or persons who stole my Christmas reindeer from the front lawn of my home at 28th Avenue and Chambers Street on the evening of Dec. 4 or the morning of Dec. 5.
\
I am a very giving person, and if others wanted my holiday decor so desperately, they could simply have asked, and in the spirit of the season I would have given it to them. To awaken and find it stolen made me angry and sad.
\
How can someone steal a holiday decoration and then use it as their own and feel good about it? Please return my reindeer. Our kids miss him, and he is ours.

Citizens ungrateful for police
\
Give me a break.

I too am glad Cortez Jordan didn't have a weapon inside his waistband, otherwise we could have a dead Eugene police officer. Would Lane County Commissioner Bobby Green call that a tragedy? I guess Green would rather have officers hurt or, worse, critically injured before they take proactive measures in protecting themselves and the citizens of Lane County.
\
The fact is the racial profiling charge was ""not sustained,"" meaning the investigation couldn't prove or disprove the complaint. My hat is off to all the Eugene Police Department officers who put their lives on the line every day for a city that seems to be very ungrateful for the job they do.

Spend $40 million to do good
\
Can you believe it? Political donors are going to spend $40 million to celebrate President Bush's second inauguration.
\
How many meals for the hungry in America would that buy? Answer: It would feed 21,978 people for a year!
\
How many homeless shelters would that build? How many teachers and supplies for our understaffed and under-equipped schools would that support?
\
How many doses of flu vaccine would that buy? How many health care workers and medical supplies would that obtain? What strides towards finding cures for cancer or Alzheimer's disease would that make? How much research and development for sustainable energy sources would that fund?
\
Speaking for myself, I don't think Bush's inauguration is worth celebrating at all. But, hey, if anything, just buy everyone a Happy Meal and use the rest of the money to promote the health and welfare of those who really need it the most.

Who paid for turkey giveaway?
\
Someone at the county has been using miscellaneous funds to buy turkeys and give them to the poor. Lane County office staff has even put out press releases for the news media about this Lane County ""Robin Hood.""
\
This taxpayer would like to know:
\
Is the miscellaneous fund personal money given to a commissioner with which to buy turkeys, or is it the taxpayers' money which could be used to fund a position at the Lane County Jail? Does the commissioner not know the county is in financial crisis, or is he just buying votes?
\
Are frozen turkeys an official and a legal expense for a commissioner? Should press releases concerning turkeys for the poor be on county paper and using county payroll to announce to the world that turkeys are being given away to the poor and how wonderful of the commissioner to do so?

Charge a fee for studded tires
\
Before the Eugene City Council adds another two cents a gallon to the gas tax, we should consider an alternative.
\
The majority of road damage is a direct result of studded snow tires, so why not create an annual fee for their use?
\
A green tag could be hung from the rear view mirror to alert law enforcement that the fee has been paid. Colors could change every year; I would suggest a healthy fine for violators.

Our roads are in a sad state of disrepair and expensive to repair. Let those who do the most damage pay their fair share and the average motorist need not be penalized.

Study European sex education
\
I appreciate The Register-Guard's outstanding Dec. 7 editorial on the pitfalls of providing only abstinence education for youth. The editorial was well researched and captured many significant and compelling points.
\
In 2001, Planned Parenthood of Southwestern Oregon launched ""Rights, Respect, Responsibility"" - an innovative and bold initiative on effective approaches to adolescent sexual health. This initiative is informed by western Europe's success in which countries like Germany, France and the Netherlands boast rates of teen pregnancy, birth, abortion and sexually transmitted infection that are mere a fraction of those in the U.S. and Oregon.
\
One significant component in these countries is the provision of comprehensive sex education. In fact, young people in western Europe are not told to abstain from sex; rather, they are taught about sex within healthy, loving, intimate and responsible relationships. They learn about what constitutes such relationships and what it takes to build them. Consequently, they decide, on their own, to delay the initiation of sex up to a year or longer than U.S. youth, despite a lack of emphasis on abstinence.
\
Young people deserve to be respected and trusted for their capacity to make sound and healthy decisions about sex when taught comprehensive information and skills, and when provided the support to do so. Comprehensive sex education is a vital part of the mix.

Americans must work together
\
As citizens, our common moral mission this and every new year should be to help people everywhere live richer, freer and longer lives.
\
Despite repeated assertions on these pages to the contrary over this past election year, neither political party owns all the tools necessary to accomplish this perpetual and enormously important task.
\
Neither still do the core American values of equality, justice and opportunity uniquely belong to a single political party, nor do the causes of freedom and democracy. No matter whether our heart is red or blue, we all want the same things: stronger communities, a cleaner environment, a fair and just society and a safer, freer and more peaceful world.
\
In this increasingly complex and interconnected world, durable solutions are possible only through comprehensive approaches and cooperative efforts. Teamwork is a requirement, not an option. Only through teamwork and mutual respect can we build successes toward our mission.
\
Americans are doers and fixers; there is nothing we can't fix if we take the time to solve problems together. After this bitterly divisive political year, let us resolve to work together this and every new year to put America's great strength to great purpose: defending the right of people everywhere to have a chance at a better life.

EWEB sale hurts ratepayers
\
Patrick Lanning, president of the Eugene Water & Electric Board of commissioners, along with board members Ron Farmer and Melvin Menegat, are mismanaging our community utility.
\
As a real estate investor, I analyze real estate transactions for profit potential. By my calculations, the proposed sale of the EWEB property to Triad Hospitals property investors would result in a $100 million net loss to Eugene ratepayers and taxpayers through tax subsidies, rate increases and unrealized profit.
\
This transaction is not a done deal, and we as owners of EWEB must act now to stop this boondoggle. I urge you take action now: call Lanning, write the commissioners, attend the next EWEB board meeting, contact the Eugene City Council and, most importantly, voice your views any way you can.

Land use planning dealt a blow
\
Springfield has achieved a true milestone, something that will secure its place forever in Oregon history: the end of land use planning in Oregon began here.
\
It may take some time for Oregon to be engulfed by the limitless sprawl that dominates other metropolitan areas across the country, but our course is now clear and probably irrever- sible.
\
Of course, Springfield couldn't achieve such an accomplishment all by itself. While the credit for leading the charge to effectively wipe out the Eugene-Springfield urban growth boundary must go to Sen. Bill Morrisette and Rep. Terry Beyer, they have been backed by a 50-5 majority in the House, and likely anticipate a similar reception in the Senate.
\
After 16 years of split government in Oregon, when the most important function of the Democratic governor was to veto all the land use bills coming from the Republican Legislature, it's more than a little ironic that this move has come from a Democrat- controlled Legislature.
\
Oregonians may still care about our state, but we simply don't understand the measures (such as the need for regional land use planning) that have preserved it over the past 30 years. And when citizens don't take the trouble to understand, they (and their representatives) can easily be manipulated by the development and homebuilding industry.
\
Gov. Tom McCall and that concurrent generation of thoughtful legislators would be ashamed to see how their legacy is being squandered. Is there anyone left in Oregon public life with any vision at all?

Reconsider incandescent lights
\
Before discarding incandescent light bulbs and replacing them with compact fluorescent bulbs, some facts should be considered.
\
In Oregon, some furnace heat is required most of the year. Incandescent light bulbs are 100 percent efficient as a heat source, so furnace heating - which is not nearly as efficient- is reduced somewhat.
\
Ordinary light bulbs are easily discarded, whereas mercury fluorescent light bulbs must be carefully handled, which may involve the use of gasoline to deliver to a recycler.
\
When all these factors are considered, there is little if any energy savings in using those little twisty light bulbs - and they make lousy lighting in reading lamps. I tried one.

Tax cheaters transfer burden
\
We have become an unlawful society, be it running red lights - which imperils others - to not paying income taxes according to the law and placing that economic burden on the rest of us.
\
I am quite familiar with the latter example. Some boast of it as if to show how clever they are. Some take great pains to cover their tracks. Some are just thoughtless or ignorant.
\
Being a tax professional, I would be the first to admit that the tax code is more than convoluted. However, my concern is not with those who make mistakes but with those who knowingly under-report income or overstate expenses. Many are just plain greedy and think only of their personal gain. Others may rationalize their actions and attribute their unlawful behavior to higher motives. Both attitudes cost society as a whole, especially the most vulnerable in our society.
\
Many are aware of corporate greed, but how do they justify their own? Silent statements of principle make no statement at all. I am totally disgusted with these dishonest people who live a lifestyle of plenty and take advantage of at least some of what federal and state taxes pay for.
\
If you feel compelled to break laws, you had best be out there working for change to those very laws you break. That is, if you have any self-respect.

Students tackle global warming
\
I'm an eighth-grader at Monroe Middle School. We've been studying about global warming, and we've seen the effects of this disaster.
\
We were surprised to see what this was doing to our Earth and even more surprised to know that we are the ones causing it! Every time we drive a car, leave the light on or even when we don't recycle, we are contributing to global warming.
\
After we realized what we were doing to our beautiful planet, we decided to take a stand. A couple of my friends organized a light bulb exchange. Everyone who wanted to participate would bring in an old light bulb and exchange it for a new compact fluorescent light bulb. These light bulbs save energy and cause less air pollution.
\
According to the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Star Web site, ""If every household in the United States replaced one light bulb with a CFL, it would prevent enough pollution to equal removing 1 million cars from the road.""
\
By organizing this campaign, we were hoping to encourage other schools to take a stand and to do their part in protecting our environment. As individual kids, we don't have much impact on what goes on in the world, but if we stand together, we could make a difference.
\
If people knew more about what was happening, there would be more effort in protecting the planet. That's why I'm asking The Register- Guard to inform its readers about global warming and possibilities for reducing it.

Voters right to be frustrated
\
The Register-Guard articles and editorials over the past several weeks have been enlightening.
\
Facing the cutoff of federal timber payments and after the November 2006 income tax defeat, the Lane County commissioners raised the salary levels of department heads and gave them the opportunity to make an additional $20,000 in overtime pay with the justification that the employees they manage are reaching their salary levels. How many county workers are making close to $100,000 annually? Why wasn't this revealed prior to the May election?
\
The commissioners have stated county sheriff's patrols will be cut because of the funding crisis, yet three sheriff's deputies were photographed in one boat patrolling the Willamette and McKenzie rivers. I'll bet they saw no more than 10 boats all day on those rivers.
\
The city of Eugene is close to seizing property by eminent domain in the southwest hills of Eugene, yet it claims a lack of funds to fix the roads. Where is the city going to get the money to pay for this land?
\
The Eugene gas tax will be increased to 8 cents per gallon, the highest in Oregon. Eugene officials are also exploring an increase in property taxes, which are also among the highest in Oregon.
\
Add to this Eugene's refusal to update the 20-year inventory of available building lots.
\
No wonder the voters are so frustrated with our city and county officials.

Want to take that summer road trip? Conserve energy now and stockpile for bigger, fun outings.
\
Consider human energy as an alternative. The weather is warming. Walk or ride a bike.
\
Spend the equivalent of less than one tank of gas ($35) and purchase a monthly bus pass. Use it.
\
Lastly, encourage your elected officials to engage in better urban planning. It is possible to travel less than 150 miles a week to manage routine affairs if you can walk to obtain provisions and seek entertainment.

Don't preclude dialogue
\
Friends of Eugene and Citizens for Public Accountability recently held their second annual review of the state of Eugene. David Monk reportedly said in his address: ""We must either create a dialogue with those who control the economy here in Eugene or defeat them at the polls."" I hope these two options are not mutually exclusive.
\
In the future, people supportive of Friends of Eugene and Citizens for Public Accountability will presumably promote local candidates who advocate philosophies similar to their own, and they should. That is how the democratic process works. I hope, however, that advancing future candidates for council positions does not preclude the possibility of creating a dialogue with other groups that may share divergent opinions.
\
I don't know if the Home Builders Association of Lane County would qualify for such a dialogue because, heaven knows, we don't control the local economy. If we do qualify under some other premise, however, we would welcome such a dialogue. More important, I believe the community would welcome such a dialogue.
\
As residents of the Eugene-Springfield area, all of us care about the quality of life in our community. All of us care about the environment, living wage jobs, minimizing traffic congestion, the quality of our schools and all of the other issues that affect our lives. If we can start with that premise and work together to resolve our problems, we can accomplish a great deal. The Home Builders Association would certainly like to try.

Cuts not a scare tactic
\
Do the people who keep saying the proposed budget cuts are scare tactics read the same newspaper I do? Cuts are already happening in several sectors. I know they are happening to the elderly. It's pure chaos, in fact.
\
On Jan. 10, my 83-year-old mother who lives in an assisted living setting received a letter saying her Medicaid benefits will end Jan. 31; there was no mention of the election. Originally she was evaluated as needing assistance with daily living, but now she is too independent. A few days later, her caseworker called to say the state realized it had to give 30 days' notice, so mom wouldn't have to move so soon; her medical card would also continue to be valid until the move. That afternoon the caseworker called again to say she had just been told the medical card would not continue. The caseworker later called back to say if the ballot measure passes, my mother won't have to move. Then another call: The decision could change any day.
\
After my father died, mom made it for 21 years without needing Medicaid. Prescriptions changed that first, and then declining health. I lost my job two years ago, was diagnosed with a serious health condition and had to move in with a friend. I told myself, ""Well, at least my mother's OK.""
\
The cuts are real. Please vote yes on Measure 28.
\

\
He's still voting no
\
I wish The Register-Guard had balanced its daily front-page drumbeat for Measure 28 with a series on our state budget's countless expenditures for things less essential than the ""at-risk"" programs that are being publicly threatened.
\
Yes, I'm still voting no on Measure 28, even after reading practically every word of the newspaper's crusade. In campaigning for a seat last year in the Oregon House of Representatives, I offered a ""no new taxes, no classroom cuts"" budget alternative called the ""CARE Package for Schools."" I lost a close race on that theme in November but earned a share of the votes 16 percent higher than my party's voter registration in the district. I credit that to people wanting the state to live within its means and voting accordingly across party lines. The Care Package, or something like it, is still the way to go.
\
It is scandalous that our Legislature wrote such an inflated budget in the first place, increasing expenditures when we knew we were facing an economic downturn. Fiscally conservative legislators from both parties have confessed that this budget was ill-conceived and profligate. Even with the highly-publicized school cuts that have already happened, and even if Measure 28 fails, this budget is 5 percent higher than the previous one.
\
Vote no on Measure 28 and then hold this new Legislature's feet to the fire. Make its members cut the new programs, unnecessary increases and wasteful spending rather than cutting the schools, law enforcement and other high-priority programs we've been reading about in The Register-Guard.

Make change at pump
\
Oregon's Road User Fee Task Force should recommend an at-pump gas tax adjustment and then be disbanded. That way, besides saving money up front:
\
1) An existing revenue system can be used with no additional administrative costs.
\
2) Road maintenance costs are more equitably divided. Vehicles with higher fuel consumption are also likely to be heavier and cause relatively more road wear. A tax tied to fuel consumption permits the operators of large vehicles to contribute their relative share toward road maintenance. Also, road use cost based on fuel consumption encourages purchase of more environmentally responsible vehicles. As the auto and oil industries like to say, the consumer will have a choice.
\
3) A system capable of monitoring all cars in the state, county or city will be cumbersome and expensive. How much will it cost to install a reporting device on every car? How about vehicles visiting Oregon from out of state? How would this system be phased in? Would we start with new cars and hope that eventually all the old ones would be retired? Administration of the tracking system would require inspection and certification stations for the new devices.
\
Of course, the bright side of imposing a user fee tracking system is reduction of unemployment. In addition to being a windfall for the new bureaucracy and its employees, a new industry might arise for techno-cheat devices that could blank out mileage monitoring data, inspired by devices now available which defeat police speed- reading radar.

Sales tax inherently unfair
\
In a Jan. 15 letter, Bob Loomis offers his support for a sales tax, saying, ""45 other states can't be wrong."" You know what? All 45 states that have a sales tax are wrong.
\
A sales tax is inherently unfair because it places a higher burden on the poor. Why? Because the poor use a higher percentage of their incomes to survive, which means they spend a higher percentage of their money on taxable items. Wealthier people may purchase more goods, but those purchases are a lesser percentage of their entire income. Let me illustrate.
\
A poor family that makes only $1,200 a month, say, has to spend almost the entire $1,200 to survive, of which at least $600 would have to be on sales-taxable items. That means that half of that family's income is taxable (arguably to a family that shouldn't have to pay any tax at all due to its low income).
\
A family that makes $20,000 a month, on the other hand, has the option of only spending, say, $5,000 (or less) on sales-taxable items. That means that the wealthier family is paying sales tax on only one-fourth of its income.
\
I am still undecided on Measure 28; however, I am clearly against even considering the inherently unfair concept of a sales tax.

Range poses safety risk
\
I'm grateful for the reporting of the settlement of the lawsuit I brought to address environmental contamination from the Izaak Walton League shooting range (Register-Guard, Jan. 9).
\
I'd like to clarify that my environmental claims did not permit me to raise issues of public safety. I believe the range still presents a serious danger to Crest Drive Elementary School, Edgewood- Evergreen Elementary School, Spencer Butte Middle School, the Edgewood Safeway store and the Solar Heights neighborhood. These are all in the direction of fire and within shooting distance of the league's high-powered rifles; the intervening hill is apparently only about 8 to 16 degrees above the targets; the range is rarely supervised and apparently devoid of oversight by public authorities, and bullet damage suggests the range experiences a considerable amount of accidental or negligent weapon fire.
\
Also of concern: Izaak Walton League management might be immune from liability for injury, even from negligence, due to a law protecting directors and officers of nonprofit organizations. I hope that changes required to address further contamination from the range might coincidentally reduce the danger to our community.
\
Meanwhile, however, I believe these schools and neighborhoods remain at unreasonable risk.

Tax amnesty tools being honed
\
The Register-Guard's May 14 editorial ""Avoid tax amnesty pitfalls"" raises excellent points about the risks of amnesty programs. We have addressed those concerns in the proposed amnesty program outlined in Senate Bill 880.
\
SB 880 would offer the amnesty only to those Oregonians who have failed to file, have failed to declare income or have taken deductions to which they are not entitled. The amnesty provisions would not be available to delinquent taxpayers that the Department of Revenue has already identified.
\
Eligible taxpayers who don't take advantage of this amnesty program will pay more when discovered, and we're working with the Department of Revenue and the attorney general's office to equip them with the appropriate set of tools for investigation and enforcement so we can discover noncompliant taxpayers and penalize them appropriately.

South Lane's cuts are deep
\
The Register-Guard's May 21 article ""Student swims only"" has a glaring omission.
\
Not once does it mention the sacrifice that the employees of South Lane School District have had to make in order for the district to make ends meet. This needs to be stated for a variety of reasons.
\
First, it is important that the public understands the tremendous concessions educators are making during this budget crisis. It is also necessary to quiet those individuals whose agenda includes demonizing public employees' pay packages as the sole reason for all of society's woes.
\
For the current academic year, a six-day reduction has resulted in South Lane School District teachers' take-home pay being reduced by hundreds of dollars per month for the last seven months. It also fails to mention that in the next academic year, 2009-10, staff will not receive the full cost of living allowance provided for in our contracts.
\
While it does mention the four-day reduction of student contact days next year, it does not mention the additional two-day reduction of teacher planning time. This prep time loss for educators results in less time to plan meaningful and engaging lessons for students. This additional six-day cut will result in another significant loss of wages for all employees, including administration, for many years to come.

Billboards are not a 'blight'
\
In response to Dan Schmieding's letter (Register-Guard, May 19) which characterizes billboards as ""a remarkable blight,"" I would like to write in defense of the local businesses that use outdoor advertising in Eugene to attract customers, announce new products and locations, and provide information to the traveling public.
\
Our advertisers are local restaurants, insurance agents, real estate agents, banks, hotels and numerous other retailers. Our advertisers create jobs and contribute to the tax base of our city, county, state and nation. Additionally, we provide the opportunity for government and nonprofit organizations to communicate messages of public service.
\
Our industry is committed to the highest ethical standards, including self-imposed restrictions on advertising near schools. In the past year, we have transitioned our business to use products that are more environmentally friendly and we will continue to work toward our goals of improving the communities in which we operate.
\
Before we rush headlong to condemn advertisers and seek the removal of our local businesses' ability to attract customers, we should carefully consider the potential impacts on our economy and wage earners. Far from being a blight on the visual environment, outdoor advertising is a valuable part of the business community.

Warrior Project helps returnees
\
I became interested in the Wounded Warrior Project because they help America's troops who have been harmed by war. In 1968, I met a survivor of the Vietnam conflict; a couple of years ago, I welcomed home a woman friend who had been deployed in Iraq. The sacrifices made by these friends have changed me forever.
\
When I visited the project Web site, I decided to provide a backpack to an injured member of our troops. The backpack holds those indispensable articles that the individual needs to move to life in the hospital ward.
\
This Memorial Day I intend to provide another donation to support our wounded warriors. The sacrifices they have made to protect our nation and its independence should not be forgotten. I want to make my own personal commitment to our nation through the Wounded Warrior Project (www.woundedwarriorproject .org).

Was rejection worth seven jobs?
\
It was disappointing to see my fellow Springfielders reject a measly 2-cent gas tax in the May 19 special election. It became even more infuriating when I learned that this will result in at least seven jobs lost in the Public Works Department. While people enjoy their 40- or 50-cent savings on each fill-up, perhaps they should think about seven more people out of work, and look forward to further deterioration of Springfield streets.

Minimize cuts to public schools
\
Oregon law forces difficult and painful choices in these most difficult of times. Balancing the budget puts legislators and the governor between a rock and a hard place. They're forced to find what cuts will do the least harm.
\
Let's urge them to minimize the cuts and harm to our public schools. They should ask everyone to pay their fair share. We can't think of a better investment for Oregon and Lane County. Public schools are a critical economic driver. The jobs of the future require an educated work force. We can't attract new business without them.
\
Some Oregon corporations pay as little as $10 per year in income tax - the same amount since the Great Depression and less than a movie and a soda. It is in their interest to start paying their fair share.
\
Oregon has the largest elementary class sizes in the nation, with one of the shortest school years. Better educated kids make better choices out of school; after-school programs keep many at-risk kids out of trouble. The numbers speak for themselves - our expensive, overcrowded jails are filled with high school dropouts. Eighty percent of Oregon inmates are high school dropouts. Those who have the most to lose - those making more than $250,000 - should pay their fair share.
\
We know legislators' choices are difficult. Our public schools are a good investment. For everyone.

A way to remember
\
As you drive south over the Ferry Street Bridge this Memorial Day weekend, there will be 114 memorials on the grassy knoll by the Eugene Water & Electric Board building for each of the 114 Oregonians lost in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is constructed and manned by veterans of other wars who have not forgotten the service of others who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Each of us knows that we could have done so ourselves; there but for the grace of God go I. It is intended to capture the essence of what Memorial Day is.
\
So as you come and walk through the markers, or bike or drive by, remember these Oregonians as well as those in your family who have perished in wars past. Honor their service with a prayer, a thought or reflection.

Principal stepped over the line
\
Diversity? Hey, I'm about as diverse as it gets in this community. Maybe Meadowlark Elementary School principal B.J. Blake (Register-Guard, May 21) could hang a photo of me in her school and teach the kids to tolerate and respect my values. It would be a refreshing change from hanging beside Rodney Dangerfield for so many years.

Seriously, Blake has no right to preach her social values to other peoples' children in a public school, especially without consent from the parents. She has abused her position, which should disqualify her as a public educator.

Workers must fight for fairness
\
In the current U.S. economy, I am disheartened to see all the negative letters with regard to the Lane Transit District union members.
\
Companies have been given so much power by our current administration, and they are using that power to intimidate workers into thinking a job at any pay is a good job. Unions have been fighting for the rights of workers not only for a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, but for safety issues. It seems the negative responses have been focusing on the pay and benefits issues of the current negotiations. Also, take into consideration that along with reducing the time union drivers have to perform safety inspections on their buses, LTD has refused to release its financial numbers and refuses to cooperate with the LTD-ATU Community Committee.
\
Do we want to become a nation of Wal-Mart employees? A nation where we allow the big companies to bully the workers into living paycheck to paycheck and praying that no family member gets sick because they can't afford to meet the deductible set by employers?
\
While the CEOs buy their vacation homes, employees need to start standing up for their rights and working toward jobs that allow us to feed, clothe, educate and keep our families healthy. Union jobs offer these benefits, and union employees are willing to fight to keep their jobs.

Citizens can't afford more taxes
\
I cannot believe that we have idiots who want to add a 10-cent- per-drink tax to alcohol. What next, candy bars?
\
Voters have voted down all sorts of increases in taxes, and yet politicians just keep on wanting more in little ways. We have seen the city gas tax raised by 40 percent already this year, to 5 cents a gallon. Give me a break.
\
Don't these people get it? We don't have any more money.
\
Then they want to increase the number of companies on the Eugene ""toxics right-to-know"" law. I don't understand why a company that doesn't have to comply has to pay the fee. All this is, is a grab for more money from business. Who do they think is going to pay that increase? It will be the consumer, of course.
\
I am curious as to when the soda tax is coming or the ""you are too fat or too skinny"" taxes. There is no reason for the state to need more money. It has enough, and that goes for the city as well.
\
Do you think there is a reason Oregon has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation? We are taxed to death here, and it is time for the legislators to understand that they will get no more! We need to vote out everyone who wants to raise a tax or create a new program. If not, good luck to Oregon, as we will be leaving.

Cash still drives college sports
\
Money trumps academics, despite what University of Oregon Vice President Dan Williams says (Register-Guard, Feb. 13).
\
I agree with him that just ""win and loss records"" should not measure success in intercollegiate athletics. He argues that when coaches are relieved from the fear of ""win at all costs,"" this creates an environment that allows coaches to focus on their athletes' ""learning experience."" But the need to generate money for athletics, which depends on playing more rather than less and winning most of the time, means that the student athletes' academic experience never remains front and center.
\
Some years back, the Ducks broke tradition by holding the Civil War game during the fall term's dead week - the time before final exams. The UO Senate voted its disapproval of this intrusion into academics, but the following season, when a lucrative TV contract for a game with the Huskies at the same crucial time of year seemed a possibility, the Ducks were ready to sign on.
\
It's not much different with Oregon basketball. There's no movement among coaches to eliminate those midweek games that cause students on the road to miss two or more class days. The UO also called for restarting Pac-10 postseason play, even though this competition invariably falls during the dead week and final exam week of winter term.
\
For student participants in these games, lower grades have been the result. But for Duck athletics and coaches, postseason play has meant fuller coffers, and that is what has priority at Oregon.

Schools can't take more cuts
\
Enough. No more cuts. Oregon schools are not adequately funded. We are currently spending on average $611 less per student than in 1992.
\
Gov. Ted Kulongoski is seeking an additional $400 million in cuts to public schools in his proposed budget. We are more than $2 billion short of what we know it would cost to fund a high quality education system as defined by the Quality Education Model, and this gap is continuing to grow.
\
The reality is that we are the first generation that is providing less for our children than was given to us. Our classrooms are bursting. We have the second-largest average elementary class sizes of all 50 states and are one of only 10 states that have no legal class size limits. Oregon continues to have one of the shortest school years in the country; several states have nearly 20 more school days per year. We are expecting our schools to do so much more with so much less.
\
We are Americans. We know what makes us great. An undereducated citizenry and an unskilled work force undermine our freedoms and prosperity more than any external threat.
\
Enough is enough. No more cuts to schools.

School choice worth protecting
\
Improving curricula, offering new programs, raising teachers' salaries, funding neighborhood schools, providing transportation to low-income families who choose alternative schools and educating parents about the choices are the ways to address inequity.
\
Alternative schools are fragile units that were extremely difficult to create. It took an incredible effort on the part of parents and community. Their cadres and curricula are unique. They serve children with talents and families with different educational ideas - bilingualism, art, science. Talent is a challenge schools should address, just as special needs. Children barely catching up with their age group need professionals such as speech therapists. Teachers at alternative schools have addressed yet another challenge: advanced and hard-working children. And they have succeeded.
\
If alternative schools merge with neighborhood schools, the cadres will be gone with the curricula. Private schools will emerge in the same neighborhoods. Meanwhile, some alternative schools' families will leave town. Eugene will become a less attractive relocation choice for professional families.
\
But the poor will be really hurt. They cannot afford private schools or housing in rich neighborhoods, and their choice will be gone. This has happened elsewhere. The level of segregation in Atlanta, Boston and California is unbelievable. No choice there: Middle class deals with private schools, lower classes with disastrous public schools.

Don't devalue workers' struggle
\
My jaw just dropped when I read the letter from Carmen Getz (letters, Feb. 10) who complained about Lane Transit District workers who are trying to hold onto their benefits package with a possible strike.
\
Her resentment seems to stem from the fact that her college- educated husband took a $10,000 pay cut in order to stay in Oregon. It is obvious to me that her attitude is one of the main contributors to the situation we now have in this country, that is, CEOs making obscenely huge salaries and options while nearly everyone else struggles to pay the light bill.
\
It's the divide-and-conquer strategy that has led to this. These days, having a college degree cuts no ice with companies that only want to make more and more money. I can attest to this as can my former co-workers, who lost their jobs when our company pulled out of Oregon.

I say more power to any workers who demand to be compensated for their hard work. We're all in this together, and when you devalue one worker, you devalue us all.

Congratulations to Superintendent Nancy Golden for making computers happen for Springfield school- children.

It's hard to believe a project like this hasn't happened before in Oregon. The price of computers has precipitously dropped month to month, year in year out, while the quality continues to improve logarithmically.
\
Furthermore, computers are a way of life like never before, and will only continue to be woven into our children's educational lives.

Contrast that with the constant reports of worsening public education for our children along with overburdened teachers seeking early retirement and the constantly increasing costs of the whole system.

Support Fern Ridge Library levy
\
On Territorial Highway in Veneta, just past the fire station, is a center of light, learning and activity.

You can hear the voices and laughter of the children as they sing and giggle during story time. After school, the older children gather around the computers to work on school projects. In the evening, people of all ages meet in the Konnie Room to learn about tidepools or how to prune rosebushes.
\
What is this place where so many things are happening? It is the Fern Ridge Library, the heart of our community. Our area is growing as more people discover how pleasant it is to live here. One of the things that makes our community unique is our library, and we are truly fortunate to have it here - unlike many rural communities in Oregon.
\
The Fern Ridge Library is a success, but it didn't get there by itself. Our community is the partner in good times and bad, and without it the library would not exist and be allowed to grow into the flourishing place that it is today.

Therefore, I am asking our community once again to invest in our future on Nov. 4 by voting yes on Ballot Measure 20-149, thereby allowing the library to continue to operate and be a source of pride for us all.

Piercy has supported businesses
\
I support the re-election of Mayor Kitty Piercy. She has been unfairly attacked as being anti-growth and anti-business. This is not true.
\
She voted for the extension of the West Eugene Enterprise Zone to give tax breaks to new and expanding companies that will grow and thrive in Eugene.
\
She has developed a nationally recognized sustainable and green jobs program that has won awards for its forward thinking. This program is now creating many new jobs here in Lane County. Mayor Piercy has promoted downtown development with two good proposals to fill the two pits.
\
A new city hot line to report potholes has been established, and thousands of potholes are being filled. A vote for a two-cent gas tax increase is on the ballot this November to make even more road repairs.

She has worked tirelessly to keep a major hospital in Eugene after PeaceHealth was lost to Springfield during ex-mayor Jim Torrey's tenure.

For these and many other reasons, join me in voting for Kitty Piercy for mayor this November.

Taxes won't help middle class
\
The idea that raising corporate and business taxes somehow will benefit the middle class, as Sen. Barack Obama has claimed, is silly.
\
First of all, corporations don't pay taxes; consumers pay it for them in the price we pay for their goods and services. Simply put, corporations have two ways of dealing with higher taxes (costs): They either raise the price that you and I pay for their goods and services, or they cut their costs by cutting payroll (jobs).
\
Considering that the middle class buys most of the goods and services that corporations offer, the middle class is hurt most by the increase in prices caused by higher taxes. Considering that the middle class makes up the majority of workers employed by corporations, the middle class is hurt the most by jobs being cut due to higher taxes. This is basic economics - simple stuff, plain logic.
\
Senator Obama is a smart, highly educated man, and I have no doubt he is aware of these basic economic fundamentals. So can somebody please tell me how raising corporate taxes can possibly benefit the middle class?
\
Can somebody please explain to me how even higher prices and even fewer jobs is good for the middle class? Really, I would like to know.

Dems ready to pass out goodies
\
Why didn't our Democratic Party, which has controlled the House and Senate for the past two years, see the meltdown coming? Or did they?
\
Our Democratic Party leaders, Barney Frank, Christopher Dodd, et al., wanted to make housing affordable and encouraged mortgages of 100 percent, or more, at below-market rates, to people who couldn't afford it. If housing prices rose, the Democratic base would be well served. If prices tumbled, all the better! Those needing government-supplied health care, housing and food boxes (the all-important base) would increase.
\
The Democrats want the people beholden to them to pass out the goodies. As we rely on the government to supply our needs, we will need to keep the sugar daddies in office - and that base will increase. A side benefit is that those who have money are losing it, and what is not lost will be taxed away to pay for the goodies. You know, ""spread the wealth around.""
\
I'm looking forward to Barack Obama as president. With a unified Democratic House, Senate and president, our country will be great! There will be tofu in every pot, solar panels on every roof, wireless computers on every desk, a cell phone in every pocket and a hybrid car or two in every garage.

McCain throws away his honor
\
What I see from John McCain's campaign these days doesn't make me angry; it makes me sad.
\
Over the years, I've had a few opportunities to explain to young children, some nieces and nephews and some children of friends and colleagues, that who a famous person is who keeps showing up on TV.
\
Back in 2000, I would've explained John McCain to a child this way: ""He's a very brave man who wanted to protect America, so he went to scary places and let other people hurt him because he thought that would make all of us safer. He says what's true even when people don't want to hear it. He has a lot of something called 'honor.'?""
\
Today, I'd have to say, ""He's someone who used to do hard things that he didn't want to do because they were right and needed doing. But now he's realized he won't get what he wants, so he's saying mean things, a lot of them made up, because he's so mad about not winning a contest.
\
""He used to have a lot of something called 'honor,' but then he threw it all away, and no matter what he does from now on, he can't ever have any of it back again.""

Small donors support Rob Handy
\
Rob Handy is running for Lane County commissioner, and he impresses me as being on target with several issues that I care about: supporting local businesses, maintaining a clean environment and figuring out a way out of this local fiscal mess the county has been mired in for years.
\
I've done a little research about who supports Handy and who supports Bobby Green, who's been in office for 13 years. I found out that while Handy's typical campaign donation is about $85, many of Green's donors give more than $2,000.
\
I also found out that Green's largest donors represent special interests such as mining, timber and commercial development. So it's not surprising that Green's votes on the county commission support those special interests.
\
It's clear to me that Handy will represent what is important to me for the future of Lane County.

Upward redistribution is OK
\
The McCain-Palin campaign and ""Joe the Plumber"" have made quite a commotion lately over the idea of spreading the wealth.
\
They have called the redistribution of wealth un-American. The tumult they have raised has led to people shouting ""socialist"" at Barack Obama at campaign events.
\
However, over the last eight years we have seen the wages of the average working person drop by as much as $2,000 per year while the wages and bonuses of CEOs and Wall Street executives have risen exponentially. What is this but the redistribution of wealth? 
\
John, Sarah and Joe seem to agree with the redistribution of wealth - as long as it is distributed upward.

List tribal homelands accurately
\
Who were the Indians who lived in Oregon before they were displaced by the white Americans, and where did they live?
\
An April 3 article in The Register-Guard on the ceremonies honoring the late Chief James Lott Sr., chief of the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw, contained a grossly incorrect statement concerning the crucial description of their aboriginal homelands: ""The 800-member tribe historically occupied land between the Siuslaw and Umpqua rivers from the coast to Eugene and now owns the Three Rivers Casino in Florence.""
\
In fact, for coastal Native Americans, the rivers were the center of their homelands, not the boundaries, and their lands extended up into the Coast Range but certainly not to Eugene. Thus, the Siuslaw Tribe's northern limit was part way to the Yachats River, with their main villages on the Siuslaw around Florence and their southern boundary about half way to the Umpqua River; the Lower Umpqua, home tribe of Chief Lott, lived along the Umpqua River south to about Tenmile Creek; and the Coos lived from there down through the Coos Bay and South Slough area to Whisky Run.
\
The Confederated Tribes' neighbors were the Coquilles on that river to the south, the Alsea to the north and the Kalapuya and Upper Umpqua to the east. As these tribes are officially nations, their aboriginal homelands are significant in establishing modern- day rights to forests, casinos, cultural centers, etc., even when they are abused by modern politicians.

We must change energy habits
\
With the increasing worldwide demand for oil and the record price of gas at the pump, isn't it time for a change? We must put more of our resources into finding alternative energy sources, developing more fuel-efficient vehicles and expanding passenger rail service. We can't continue to put more gas-guzzling vehicles on our highways, especially in the cities where driving is a nightmare.
\
Maybe Congress and our state legislators could channel some of those gas tax dollars used for the never-ending road repairs toward other modes of transportation, such as improving passenger rail systems. Since the big oil companies are making record profits, maybe they could be taxed to promote some of these proposals. Fat chance there, eh?
\
As gas prices go beyond $3 a gallon this summer, many of us will be walking or riding bikes more on our short trips around town. Just think, it could solve our obesity problems.
\
For those long trips, there is always the train. And for some people I don't mean passenger trains, as the economy goes downhill because of the rising costs of goods and services based on higher transportation costs.

Oil crisis is on the near horizon
\
In 2005, we will produce more oil than in any year previous and, ominously, than in any year hereafter. And this might well be the death knell of the bell curve of the oil economy to which our civilization resonates.
\
Following on the echoes of the fading industrial sputter will be an era already dubbed ""The Long Emergency."" While some few folk may have different priorities, most of us are going to be confronting starvation. Without cheap fuel to harvest the ocean of its fish and the fields of their grain, we're going to be eating what we and our non-internal combustion neighbors can grow with shovel and hoe. Live more than five miles from work? You'd better learn to nail shoes on Queeny and stock up on Uncle Pete's Prodigious Ointment for the Alleviation of Saddle Sores.
\
The fact is that the vast majority of middle class Americans derive not only their recreation but their livelihood from the oil economy. Alternative fuels haven't the faintest hope of replacing the cheap stuff we pump out of the ground. Mostly those alternatives depend on that black slippery residue from the carboniferous age.
\
When the stuff ain't cheap no more, ain't nothing cheap no more, whether it be hydrogen, biofuels, photovoltaics, concrete for dams or copper for high-efficiency electric motors. No, the long emergency will bring about a change much more fundamental than the fragrance of the exhaust wafting from the pipe of your fashionable mobilhicle.

Tax bicycles to repair roads
\
With high gas prices plus the new tax on gasoline, the owners of cars and trucks are paying about all they can possibly pay to operate their vehicles. I am surprised that the government has overlooked a source of revenue - licensing and/or taxing bicycles.
\
We have wonderful bike paths, lighted ones, all over the city and out in the country. Where do they find the money for all these lovely improvements, and why can't some of that money be spent to fix the potholes in the city streets?
\
Also, it would be nice if bicycles observed safety regulations. A few do, but a lot don't, and they present a hazard to everyone on the street. The gas prices are affecting everything we use or buy, so let's use this alternate source of revenue for some of the much- needed road repair money.

People must control their pets
\
My mother lives alone in Creswell with only her two cats to keep her company. They have been a good source of comfort as she's been battling cancer for the past four months.
\
A recent Monday morning, two neighborhood dogs attacked one of her cats in her driveway. Luckily, she was able to muster enough strength to yell at the dogs to get them away from her cat. He spent the rest of the day at the veterinarian's office being stabilized, then had surgery. Today his little heart gave out.
\
Now my mother's heart is broken. She is not in a condition to deal with more trauma. People, please keep an eye on your pets!
\
I know it is natural for dogs to chase what runs from them. This is why I make sure my dog is secured at all times. It would break my heart to lose him to a car or have to put him down if he were to injure someone's dear pet - not to mention the guilt that I would feel if he injured someone's pet.
\
I honestly hope that the people who own these two dogs come forward and, at a minimum, offer to pay for Willis' vet bills. It is the least they can do to make up for this loss.

Bush policies cause destruction
\
The president has pontificated that he has a lock on space in heaven and is unconcerned about the decisions of history. In this I sense the belief that God is a Republican.
\
The ledger shows policies that exemplify Robin Hood in reverse. I see extreme avoidance of truth, and a pre-emptive war causing death, maiming, destruction and a dissipation of resources. There is the senseless and counterproductive matter of condoning torture.
\
Anyone heading a small, less powerful country would surely be treated as a war criminal for such corrupt meddling. The blocking of United Nations efforts to counter genocide in Darfur shows a pathetic disregard for loss of life and suffering.
\
If these are good works that earn passage, the bar has been set awfully low. The appalling thing for me is that many people, in this country at least, seem to accept, approve or applaud.

Turks should admit genocide
\
April 24 marks the 90th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, the first state-sponsored genocide of the 20th century.
\
Ninety years ago the government of Turkey executed a plan to exterminate the Armenian population of Turkey. Under the guise of the First World War, 1.5 million Armenians were murdered and a 3,000- year-old culture was virtually annihilated.
\
To question the veracity of the Armenian genocide is akin to questioning whether the Holocaust ever occurred. Yet, to this day, the Turkish government denies that the Armenian genocide ever took place.
\
As Turkey begins preliminary talks on its desired admission into the European Union, one of the prerequisites for membership set forth by member countries is that Turkey acknowledge the Armenian genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks in 1915.
\
Denial is the final stage of genocide. It murders the memory of the event.

World is on verge of collapse
\
Having just read Jared Diamond's ""Collapse,"" a history of collapsed societies of the past and the causes for their collapse, I've concluded that there are common causes for the collapse of otherwise well-developed societies. The main causes are overpopulation and thoughtless destruction of the common environment.
\
Our world society seems to be approaching the point of self- destruction. Perhaps we can still save our society by the use of some common sense. We should limit the population and be more considerate of the results of our actions on the planet.
\
If we can't control our own destructive actions, the world we live on will do it for us, protecting itself by reducing our population with starvation, pestilence and allowing us to self- destruct when the scarcity of resources causes us to go to war to survive.
\
In other words, we may have to destroy humanity to save it - and the planet!

Iraq war is a compound disaster
\
I was in The Register-Guard's Jan. 22 photograph showing the red flags at the Iraq war memorial on the University of Oregon campus.
\
There was an Iraq war veteran who also put up the red flags, along with a sergeant, who as I recall served between wars. The organizers had a preference for veterans to put up the red flags. It is as if Shannon Smyth (Register-Guard, Jan. 26) never saw these pictures.
\
I served a year plus two extensions in Vietnam. We waged our war in, not on, the hamlets, and our war was very personal. There were enemies and friends in this series of hamlets all living - and dying - together. So I know a thing or two about the confusion of whom to call enemy and whom to call friendly. Nevertheless, that still allows me a sense of sympathy and sense of vast waste regarding Vietnam.
\
The same applies to Iraq. For all its vastness depicted on campus, at least four times the amount shown would truly reflect the costs of this war. And that does not include the nearly 1 million deaths between Bush One and Bush Two on the one side, and Saddam Hussein on the other.
\
In short, this war is disaster compounded upon disaster. The white vs. red flag controversy would in fact be only the start of America's and the world's coming to terms with this disaster.

Spanking can harm children
\
As a psychologist specializing in the treatment of young children and adolescents, I found The Register-Guard's Jan. 21 article ""Proposed bill seeks to punish parents who spank"" informative.
\
Parents in this culture tend not to differentiate between discipline, which means ""to teach,"" and punishment, which means ""to hurt or harm."" As an advocate for children I support the former, not the latter.
\
Although I have questions regarding the efficacy of criminalizing spanking, it has met with considerable success in the civilized countries that have banned this form of harming children.
\
As a student of comparative psychology, I also attempt to learn from other animal species, most notably chimpanzees and bonobos, neither of which spank their dependent offspring. But then it could simply be the case that these ""lesser"" apes are more humane than their human counterparts.

Quality of life linked to water
\
Oregon RiverWatch believes that it represents the majority view of this community: that the quality of life and the quality of water in our community are directly linked.
\
It has been common knowledge for decades in this community that from time to time sewage has been released into the Willamette River and the Amazon Slough. We have smelled it. We know it is there. We want management of our watershed to improve; and Congress has given us the right, as citizens, to enforce the Clean Water Act.
\
Congress has acknowledged that citizens will be successful in their efforts to enforce environmental legislation only when attorneys are adequately compensated. We are disappointed that Jack Moran's article, ""Clean Water Act lawsuits raise issues of motive"" (Register-Guard, Jan. 28), which could have addressed the critical issue of water quality in our area, instead chose to focus on the non-issue of attorney fees. This is an obvious attempt to discourage and intimidate us, our lawyers and our fellow citizens from becoming involved in this kind of valuable, legal activity.
\
We, the Oregon River Watch board of directors, want Eugene, Springfield and the Lane County Board of Commissioners to sit down and negotiate a resolution, according to local and federal rules, to improve the quality of the water in our part of the Willamette Valley.

Reducing speed saves energy
\
Columnist Charles Krauthammer mentioned three serious things we can do now for a better energy policy (Register-Guard, Jan. 28): Tax gas, drill in the Arctic and go nuclear.
\
All of his recommendations have their dark sides that could hurt the American public. For instance, the poor are hit with the gas tax, the environment suffers from drilling in the Arctic and there are waste disposal and security issues associated with nuclear power.
\
We have an answer that can help our pocket books, help global warming, help our dependency on foreign oil and avoid nuclear power, if we can. The answer is simply to reduce the speed limit on our highways to a maximum of 60 miles per hour.
\
We found, in traveling across our fair land, that we could increase our gas mileage from 27 miles per gallon to 32 miles per gallon by reducing our speed to 60 mph from 70 mph. Not only can we help our pocket books, help global warming, help our dependency on foreign oil, avoid nuclear and save millions of gallons of gasoline a year, but we would be saving thousands of lives that are lost on our highways due to high speed.

America blessed despite flaws

Ridding our world of the Timothy McVeighs and the Osama bin Ladens is necessary pest control.
\
There is a time, place and, almost always, an allowed forum for extremist views, whether they be pro or anti on any topic, so long as they are presented peacefully.
\
We aren't a perfect America. We've made some huge blunders in our history, and it appears we may be headed for another now with our presence in Iraq. We all know how this one is likely to play out if unstopped. Iran will be next, but this time we won't stay to help pick up the pieces.
\
In spite of it all, I am proud to be an American citizen. Let Western Europe, Asia and many of our own citizens label us arrogant. Because if arrogant means we maintain military superiority in order to maintain a modicum of world peace, I'm on board. What other superpower could we entrust with this mission? Russia? China? Don't make me laugh!
\
If arrogant means we insist new immigrants get jobs, abide by our laws, speak the English language and become productive citizens while living within our borders, then I say maintain the arrogance. We have a long way to go and may possibly never quite get there; however, in the interim, while we watch Western Europe being overrun and destroyed by immigration by fundamentalist factions, let's get down on our ungrateful knees and thank God for blessing America in spite of its hideous warts.

Iraq a detour in war on terror
\
In reference to Bill Eddie's (letters, Jan. 27) charge that Americans are unwilling to face terrorism, I don't now where Eddie has been for the last five years - maybe holed up in a bunker with ""Dead-eye Dick"" Cheney - but America went after the terrorists responsible for 9/11 and had them nearly defeated and Osama bin Laden surrounded when our forces were diverted to the quagmire known as Iraq.
\
President Bush has admitted that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/ 11 but since he sent our troops there, Iraq has become a recruiting center for terrorism. Had we remained on the hunt in Afghanistan this war on terror might be over or at least kept confined to that country.
\
And Eddie claims that ""Today, America faces an even greater threat, because we are fighting an enemy that doesn't fear death."" Apparently he's never heard the term ""kamikaze."" We've faced this kind of enemy before and we will undoubtedly face them again, but their numbers would be fewer if we would have ""stayed the course"" in Afghanistan and not taken the errant detour into Iraq.

Men can help reduce abortions
\
Judy Kinsworthy's Jan. 20 letter was right on target. It was refreshing to see a letter that so clearly stated what is rarely said regarding the issue of abortion.
\
I would love to hear those who label themselves as pro-life (as if the opposition is anti-life) speak to the responsibility that men hold when a pregnancy occurs. I am certain that there would be an immediate and significant drop in the rate of abortions if the pro- life faction pushed for some type of legislation that dictated a monetary or legal consequence for any male engaging in unprotected sex that results in a pregnancy.
\
Statistics show that approximately 70 percent of our nation's population favors reproductive choice, and unless women wish to go back to the ""good old days"" when they were viewed as property, we must all speak up and be part of the solution. That solution must include both parties that create a pregnancy. We cannot address only unintended pregnancies, but also need to be concerned about resource availability vs. population size.
\
If we are truly concerned about the sanctity of life, it must extend not only to the newly conceived but also to the millions of humans who go to bed hungry, homeless, abused or forced to fight in an illegal war. We can all work together on these concerns - that is, unless it is more important to be right than to protect life.

Any bill that does not require immigrants to enter the U.S. legally to be placed on a path to U.S. citizenship is amnesty. Such a bill is rewarding illegal behavior. I taught my children that we must obey the law even, if at times, it seems burdensome. Giving citizenship to illegal immigrants makes me feel that what I taught my children was a sham and a lie.
\
I am somewhat of a student of history, and history points out the seriousness of this issue. The Roman Empire fell, in a large part, because of an ill-conceived immigration policy. For a modern example, take a look at France. I would urge the citizens of Lane County to carefully consider their position on illegal immigration. Ask yourself if you desire a better future for your grandchildren or a long struggle and social upheaval. Contact your representative and senator and express your desires.

Be responsible for pets
\
Why should any city be charged to care for private citizen's animals? I must pay to license my dogs - which is of no benefit to me, only a fee the city collects - pay the vet for their shots, have them neutered and update vacations as needed. I also am responsible for cleaning my own flower beds and it seems every cat in the neighborhood uses them for a litter box. I must keep my dogs in my yard, under my control, and if they happen to get out and bite someone I can be sued, fined and my animals put down.
\
It's my responsibility, not that of the city or state. It's my choice to have an animal and it's my choice as a human being to be responsible! I am tired of people like Deanna Kuhn whining (letters, June 7), wanting someone else to pay. If you can't afford it, don't buy it or take it home. If you can afford it, keep it in your own yard! Wake up, America. What happened to your common sense and decency? Be responsible for your own decisions and actions.

Blame traffic engineers
\
The death of Princess Diana is in the news again.
\
After viewing the crash scene on the news after the actual event, it occurred to me that something like that would not have happened in this country. I was shocked to see that the car had collided head on with a pillar in the tunnel! In all my considerable travels throughout this country, I can never remember seeing a traffic hazard such as those pillars, so close to moving vehicles, left with no guard rail or barrier to prevent such a collision!
\
Yet no mention of such a grievous omission of such a simple preventative measure was ever made.
\
The French should be ashamed of themselves for omitting something so obviously important and putting their citizens' lives at risk.

No more taxes
\
I think it's about time that Lane County, Eugene and Springfield are put on notice! No more taxes.
\
It is definitely not the time to raise the gas tax when gas is over $3 a gallon.
\
Where is the City Council's collective head? And trying to pass an income tax, give me a break. It is time for a change in Lane County. We have no representation for the people. Let's just throw money at the problem and make low-income people pay for it.
\
The pothole problem hasn't gone away with a 5 cent tax, so why would you think it would get any better with 8 cents? It is time for us to live within our means. Eugene and Lane County are no better or worse off than the rest of the state.
\
Why can't these officials see this by now? When is enough, enough? We all need to remember this come election time.

Where is extra coverage?
\
As a Springfield resident, I have to question the Springfield Extra insert in The Register-Guard.
\
The insert describes it as expanded coverage of Springfield and east Lane County. It is a weekly section of The Register-Guard that comes out on Thursdays.
\
Front-page expanded coverage this week included in full color four nice-sized photos of a man running, a dog, a pigeon and a pickup truck.
\
Page 3 included pictures of a grandfather with his grandson, a rainbow, a kitten, a couple in Halloween costumes and two women dressed up in formal wear to watch TV.
\
On Page 8 you can find another color photo of a couple and their two dogs.
\
I have to question why the newspaper chooses to print the Springfield police log. Do we really need to read about a dog chasing children or a husband in flannel pajamas chasing two teenage girls down the street to recover his mail?
\
Why is the Springfield police log considered expanded coverage while I have yet to see a detailed list of the Eugene police log in The Register-Guard?
\
I am having a difficult time finding expanded coverage in the weekly inserts.

Read to children
\
Happy news and pictures of all Springfield first-graders receiving new books through the Gift of Literacy celebration has me smiling. How enthusiastic the children and volunteers are as they participate in sharing stories.
\
Literacy is indeed the foundation of our society, and what joy for a community to embrace the notion of motivating young children to love reading.
\
Kudos to Team Springfield, Rotary Clubs of Springfield, Lane Community College, super supportive businesses and all the volunteers that partnered in inspiring and motivating young readers.
\
While serving as a reading specialist in Springfield schools for 16 years, one of my most enjoyable tasks was encouraging parents to read aloud to their children as they progressed through elementary grades. Now retired and a board member of the Emerald Empire Reading Council, I still share in the promotion of literacy by serving on a committee giving free books to parents of babies and preschoolers. We model reading aloud and discuss the importance of regularly reading stories to little ones. They will be the children entering school ready to learn.

Celebrate in silence
\
The Fourth of July will soon be upon us. What is special about this date? It is a time that we celebrate our independence and appreciate those things that we love about this country of ours.
\
It is the date that we proclaimed our independence. Somehow it seems that we have forgotten the meaning. Now, it has become a time in our neighborhoods to explode illegal devices, terrifying our pets and polluting the air and the water as the remains of fireworks left in the streets wash into the storm drains and thereby into our precious rivers. Wow, haven't we come a long way in how we celebrate this special day? And it isn't just one day anymore. It goes on for days prior to the fourth and days after. Isn't it time we grew up and nurtured a more conscientious society? One that is more considerate and sustainable.
\
I don't mean to spoil anyone's fun. I remember enjoying sparklers as a child, but really, come on, what is happening in our neighborhoods now is absolutely ridiculous. We actually have had our windows concave from the percussion of people blowing things up in the streets. And it's always good to have your garden hose hooked up ready to go for when something that has been shot into the air lands on your roof!
\
Please, let's get back to a more sincere celebration of Independence Day and be more respectful of our neighbors and environment. And more importantly, let's have respect for the men and women who have returned from wars. They might appreciate a quieter holiday.

Arsonists wreck lives
\
After reading Garth Kahl's June 5 letter to the editor, I cannot justify his category of defining arsonists and terrorists. After doing some research, I found that the majority of arsons are paid for by the terrorists. It all goes back to ELF, the well-known terrorist group.
\
In April of 2000 ELF claimed responsibility for the torching of 30 SUVs at Romania's. An arsonist is a potential killer. It is someone who is determined not to leave things the way they were before his or her arrival. An arsonist is a destroyer of property and occasionally a wrecker of dreams. They are literally a walking time bomb.
\
Kahl says they never hurt anyone! How many firemen respond to these malicious acts and how many have been harmed in putting out someone's radical and extreme acts of hate and violence? These groups of arsonists commit their obscene acts under anonymity and the cover of night all the while receiving funding and accolades from mainstream tax-exempt activist groups.
\
You claim your new little baby will never know these felons. I say this is the best thing that could happen.
\
You also say they went to great lengths to not hurt anyone. They are going to a federal prison. Be thankful for your new sweet little girl. Our world is a negative, hateful, angry place. I pray for all of our young people.

PERS return doesn't add up
\
Let me get this straight. After investing in real estate and private equity firms that are described in your editorial as ""high- risk, high-yield investments,"" PERS only made 15 percent in 2006?

The S&P 500 went up 14 percent without all that risk. Even I made 18 percent in my retirement account, and I could only choose among five diversified index funds like the S&P 500.

School should stay put
\
Why would the Springfield School Board consider moving Thurston Elementary School nearly half a mile from its current site down an undeveloped rural section of Thurston Road?
\
There are no good reasons for the board to relocate Thurston Elementary to a site near Bob Artz Park. Common sense dictates rebuilding the school on the current site, which has adequate space for the new building with improved parking and traffic flow. Many logical considerations support keeping the school's present location:
\
Moving the school would require widening 0.4 miles of Thurston Road and installing sewers, sidewalks and bike lanes. This infrastructure is already in place at the current location, making the proposed school relocation an irresponsible spending of taxpayers' money.
\
Students would be required to walk farther to school to a more remote rural location, endangering their safety.
\
Thurston Elementary would no longer be located in the urban Thurston neighborhood close to the students it serves.
\
Relocating the school would destroy an environmentally important open space, damage the local ecosystem, contribute to urban sprawl and destroy the rural quality of east Thurston Road.
\
An ecological learning park could be created at the Bob Artz site as an educational resource for teaching about plant and animal habitats.
\
Concerned parents and neighbors, please contact the Springfield School Board and the Springfield School District superintendent in support of retaining the current school site. Hold them accountable for how they spend your bond money and provide for your children's safety.

Fans often out of bounds
\
Commendations are in order for Superintendent George Russell and the OSAA for finally recognizing that more needs to be done to hold spectators and crowd management school personnel accountable for unsportsmanlike behavior displayed at basketball games.
\
Having either refereed or attended many local prep basketball games over the years, I have observed unsportsmanlike behavior that has not been proactively quelled by staff. It has almost been laughable to hear the PA announcer read the league spectator sportsmanship policy at each game in light of these persisting actions.
\
What happened during the 5A boys basketball tournament is the culmination that is to be expected when crowd management staff at high school basketball games have failed to adequately do their jobs and when adults at home neither modeled nor taught their offspring courtesy and respect for others.

EmX is part of the solution
\
In response to the woman who did not want the EmX bus line to expand to West 11th Avenue: I had the opportunity to ride the EmX bus from Spring- field to Eugene a couple of weeks ago. What a pleasure! My thoughts were we need to expand this to east Springfield and west Eugene and implement a gas tax to pay for it. Encourage citizens to ride rather than drive.
\
We also need to expand the bus system and use biodiesel fuel produced locally. To solve the problems of congestion on West 11th, we could have a park-and-ride near the corner of Greenhill Road and 11th Avenue. With the population increasing, the price of gasoline rising and climate change breathing down our backs, we must plan accordingly.
\
The downtown development should make this a priority. There is a big disconnect there. Yes, we need to make sacrifices. Walk and ride bikes more, conserve energy, buy less stuff, share, carpool, grow and preserve our own food. It might actually be fun and empowering.
\
A year-round covered farmer's market is essential. Local businesses are good for Lane County's economy and the environment. We must stop purchasing cheap junk from the other side of the planet. Scientists believe we only have five to 10 years to turn this ship around! This is an exciting time and we are obligated to do what we can for all species on Earth. Our lives and the lives of future generations depend on us to act now.

Eugene ignores neighbors
\
Springfield, in its desire to rid itself of the Eugene City Council's helpful influence regarding its urban growth boundary future, has turned to the state Legislature for help. That action has apparently offended Kitty Piercy, the mayor for all of Eugene (except, of course, the voting majority).
\
In her guest viewpoint (Register-Guard, May 3), Piercy laments, ""We respect our neighbors and meet with them regularly. We only ask for that respect to be mutual."" When Piercy says ""we respect our neighbors,"" does she mean like when she ignored three city-wide votes in favor of the West Eugene Parkway (and specifically, NO other alternatives) ... or when she and then-Councilor David Kelly threatened to block favorite projects of Eugene's two partners, Springfield and Lane County, if those two entities didn't go along with Piercy's demand to kill the parkway project? Incredibly, Piercy was quoted at the time as saying something to the effect, ""Why can't we all just work together on this?"" Yikes!
\
But Piercy did say Harvard University thinks we're swell here for an affordable housing program that is up for an award. As it turns out, that program has been operating since 1979, long before the current mayor and City Council began alienating hospitals, voting majorities, neighboring communities and virtually anyone with a lick of common sense. The real issue at hand is Eugene leadership's unwillingness to update its own urban growth boundary and Piercy's growing legacy of ""let's all be reasonable and do it my way!""

Voice of the voters ignored
\
Oregon Democrats in the Legislature and our governor are working hard to gut our property rights under Measure 37 that we recently approved. The Legislature and governor ignored our vote, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman, and passed the functional equivalent by authorizing civil unions. Lane County's effort to pass an income tax likewise reflects official contempt toward the public they are elected to serve.
\
Why does our government so easily disregard our will? Simply put: We elect Democrats and like-minded Republicans to political office perpetuating the cycle of abuse. If you vote for a Democrat in the state of Oregon you are voting for big government, less freedom, higher taxes, reduced economic growth and a much higher chance of being unemployed.
\
Democratic Party officials are deeply elitist. They won't admit it, but it flows naturally from their philosophy that puts more trust in bureaucracy to improve society than private ingenuity and effort.
\
It is time to trust government less and earn the respect of our politicians. We must hold our representatives accountable for their treachery every time they thumb their noses at our votes. Until then we have no one to blame but ourselves.

It's not all up to you
\
My heart goes out to Madeleine Albert Berenson for her difficult and lonely struggle to decide to keep her first born child rather than abort him (Register-Guard, May 9). But I'm troubled more by her argument that it was a decision that was no one else's business to inform her in any way, shape or form. Can she look into the face of her ""brilliant and kind 27-year-old son"" and say that her choice to abort him instead would have been equally valid and right ""for her own house?"" If she can, how would she reason this conclusion? What is the basis for her decision to abort or keep her son that keeps it from being capricious and arbitrary?
\
Why can't her argument that no one has a right to speak to her situation about what is right, good, better, moral or wrong be applied to Seung-Hui Cho? He too faced difficult and troubled times and at the end of the day he went home alone to face his demons. He finally made a choice that, if we apply Berenson's reasoning, ""no one has the right to tell any (person) faced with (these) profound circumstances how (he) should feel, what (he) should endure and what (he) must do. ... .""
\
People like Berenson do not realize that the ultimate logic of their individualistic and subjective thinking leads to frighteningly absurd and unsupportable conclusions.

'Same old liberal agenda'
\
While it's certain that a new paradigm (Kathy Reay's letter to the editor of May 11) has been forced on the majority of Oregon voters by an arrogant minority, it's also clear that false stereotypes are being used to justify the new order.
\
In Reay's letter, she chooses to blame the Bible for several half- witted ideas that the Bible simply does not teach.
\
The Bible teaches that all human beings are created in the image of God. And the Bible nowhere teaches the sun revolves around the earth. It just reports man's view of the sun, just like The Register- Guard reports the daily times of sunrise and sunset.
\
The truth is that Oregon's governor and his legislative cohorts pushed a homosexual rights bill on the public because they couldn't get it done by the voting process. The rich, radical gay rights crowd just got richer as they hoodwinked a lot of people into thinking it was an affirmative action issue. God created all people equal, but the governor made some more equal than others when he signed the bill. He assumed a moral authority that the voters of Oregon never granted him.
\
The new paradigm is really the same old liberal agenda wearing a different mask.

Nuclear deterrence eroding
\
Few realize the nuclear proliferation threat that is looming over the horizon. A United Nations report on proliferation states that, ""We are approaching a point at which the erosion of the nonproliferation regime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation."" At least 40 nations have the technology to build nuclear weapons at relatively short notice.
\
Administration policy now authorizes pre-emptive nuclear attack against nations that it says are close to acquiring nuclear weapons. No proof needed. The United States now spends nearly $7 billion a year for nuclear research and upgrading U.S. nuclear capabilities, and the spending curve keeps rising. If the United States is boosting its own nuclear program, why shouldn't others follow suit? The only reason this administration will give them is fear of U.S. attack.
\
Nuclear issues will be discussed next year in New York during the review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty - the legal cornerstone of non-proliferation efforts. May 1, 2006, as the meeting in New York begins, will be a day for massive demonstrations to warn the world of the coming nuclear tidal wave. It will be a day to say no to President Bush's nuclear bully approach and yes to a nuclear-free world.
\
It's not too early to begin sounding the alarm. Those of us who care about the safety of America and the world can't wait for the mainstream news media to do it. We have to take care of that business ourselves.

Toxics reporting is a burden
\
As one of the targeted companies of the expanded toxics right-to- know proposal, I would like to respond to Steve Johnson's Feb. 10 guest viewpoint about hazardous waste emissions and reporting.
\
According to other members involved with the toxics board, reporting is not ""fairly easy,"" as Johnson proclaims. It is cumbersome and expensive for the large manufacturing firms who now report. To suggest that small companies such as those listed in his column would find it easy to report is misleading and contrary to fact.
\
To also suggest that most of these companies release toxic chemicals without regard to the environment and without controls is also mislead- ing.
\
The auto body industry is regulated by the state fire marshal, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Environmental Protection Agency and Lane Regional Air Pollution Authority. We do not randomly install paint booths without permits or inspections.
\
The legitimate body and paint facilities in Eugene have expensive, state-of-the-art equipment that monitors and refines any emissions. Johnson needs to come visit our facility and become informed before he promotes an ordinance that will so negatively impact our industry.
\
We do not emit ""large amounts of toxic materials."" We report to the state fire marshal and, contrary to John- son's suggestion, we would not benefit from this proposal. We are environmentally conscientious and currently use products and practices that handle the toxic materials we use.
\
Perhaps one of the reasons the board would like to expand this ordinance is to fund the existing program.

Preserve Nectar-Dillard forest

One thing money and labor cannot build is an intact wild ecosystem such as the one found in the south hills known as the Nectar-Dillard forest. This is a jewel that needs to be preserved and added to the Ridgeline trails system.

LTD workers forced to fight
\
The outpouring of derisive letters against our apparently overpaid and over-benefited Lane Transit District workers illustrates the anger many of us feel over the demise of the working class.
\
The difficulties we face in obtaining living-wage jobs that also provide adequate health care for our families is immense. Unfortunately, these letters only work to encourage further subjugation of the working class.
\
This attitude that the workers should be happy with what they have or get is exactly what those who hold the power want to hear.
\
The LTD union is not asking for more, but asking to maintain what they already have. We thank you for your service by cutting your benefits? If we are truly outraged by the cost of health care or our lack thereof, why not attack the beliefs and bureaucracies that prevent the basic human right of health care?
\
Taking what we get is exactly what has gotten us where we are today: profits before people.
\
I'm sorry Carmen Getz (letters, Feb. 10) sees the LTD workers guilty of greed while we all are suffering. I say we're all in this together and hope the workers triumph, because their triumph is a triumph for us all.

Inauguration isn't a wedding
\
Bill Royle (letters, Feb. 4) draws a comparison between the presidential inauguration and a wedding cere- mony.
\
Say what? An inauguration is a national public event. It may be celebrated by some - those who are pleased with the administration about to take office. But, as we know, at least 50 percent of the nation is not pleased with this administration, so the event is clearly not an occasion for all citizens to celebrate.
\
However, should Royle persist in his analogy, I might remind him that, at least in the Protestant tradition, anyone who objects to the conjugal contract is invited during the ceremony to come forward and voice those objections. What better occasion to exercise our constitutional right to free speech, to voice our objections, than during an inauguration? And since when are protests supposed to be conducted with the social graces reserved for private social affairs?
\
On what occasion is it OK to speak out against one's government? And what are the rules of etiquette for conducting such a protest? It's called protest for a reason. I suppose Royle would rather the Boston Tea Party had been conducted in white gloves and lace collars.
\
Peter Chabarek, Willow Rose and Carol Melia have my great respect and admiration for having the courage to stand up for their beliefs. Social change does not happen when people keep their mouths shut because they don't want to offend or because they are afraid of embarrassing the status quo.

Bush is preserving retirement
\
President Bush is preserving my retirement and the retirements of millions of Americans by taking the first step in his plan to change Social Security.
\
On Jan. 17, 1935, President Franklin Roosevelt, who gave us Social Security, addressed Congress with the need in the future to change the pay-as-you go financing and establish ""self-supporting annuity plans,"" Wall Street Journal columnist John Fund noted. ""For perhaps 30 years to come, funds will have to be provided by the states and the federal government to meet these pensions,"" Roosevelt told Con- gress.
\
But after that, he said, it would be necessary to move to ""voluntary contributory annuities by which individual initiative can increase the annual amounts received in old age."" Roosevelt proposed that ""the federal government assume one-half of the cost of the old- age pension plan, which ought ultimately to be supplanted by self- supporting annuity plans.""
\
The real reason the Democrats don't want to change Social Security is because they don't think the average person is smart enough to handle retirement without them. The Social Security trust fund has been spent for many years on things other than it was intended.
\
We need to follow the advice of Roosevelt and stand with President Bush and the Republicans to change Social Security into a system that will work in the 21st century.

Oregon needs damage caps
\
There you go again. The Register-Guard's negative reaction to any news item about a malpractice damage award cap is doggone Pavlovian!
\
The latest example was an editorial concerning the president's proposal for civil tort reform (Register-Guard, Feb. 7). Rather than an evenhanded editorial statement concerning both sides of the malpractice issue, the opinionated comments against malpractice insurance reform were typically unbalanced and cliched: ""grievous"" and ""all carrot and no stick.""
\
Also, the statements were inaccurate: Insurance rates have not continued to spiral upward in every state with damage award caps already in place. Furthermore, Oregon's malpractice insurance rates started spiraling upward as soon as our current governor and other attorneys on the state's Supreme Court removed the damage cap in 1999.
\
Oregon's malpractice insurance crisis is a major reason that there are fewer specialists to care for Oregonians. Sacred Heart Medical Center accepts patients in transfer from all over Oregon because there are not enough doctors elsewhere in the state.
\
I invite The Register-Guard's editorial staff to visit Sacred Heart's emergency room and find out firsthand how hard it is for patients to get a doctor to care for them.

What's on readers' minds: The debate over President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security vaulted back into the top spot among letter topics this week. Though local writers overwhelmingly oppose Bush's plan, some letters of support are beginning to emerge, particularly from younger workers. Other topics generating multiple letters included concern over the impact of a possible strike at the Lane Transit District, plans to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the debate about school choice in the Eugene School District.

Tax plan is a shell game
\
Anyone who believes Bush's assertion that tax cuts will put money in their pockets is being duped. The only way to put money in your pocket is to cut taxes and cut spending - which Bush doesn't do.
\
The Bush tax plan is a shell game that works like this: With his right hand, he cuts taxes, and a working stiff like me gets to keep an extra $100 or so. Woo hoo!
\
But wait. With his left hand, he borrows $1,000 in my name to cover government's now-unmet expenses. (Why $1,000? Because that's what the average American family receives in tax cuts. A thousand people like me getting $100, and a $900,000 tax break for Richie Rich: an ""average"" of $1,000 each). But I will eventually have to repay that $1,000 Bush borrows, and I have to pay the interest on it until it's paid back. It's like Bush using my credit card to spend $1,000 and giving me $100 cash to put in my pocket. Some deal.
\
Why would anyone propose such lunacy? Because, for the rich, while Bush also puts them $1,000 in debt, his tax break stuffs their pockets with hundreds of thousands of dollars. I wonder if Bush and his cronies happen to be rich.

Take hike, pack a lunch
\
This is my first letter to the Mailbag in the 30 years I've been reading The Register-Guard. After reading Sylvia Bigontina's somber piece, ""Saddened by clear cuts"" (letters, Jan. 28), I need to share my thoughts. I write this as a third-generation tree farmer, a species probably more rare than some stands of old growth, and as someone who will never live anywhere else but in Oregon because of our beautiful trees.
\
I feel partially to blame for not giving Bigontina a copy of the map titled ""50 of the Best Old Growth Hikes in Lane County"" before she set off on her ""drive across Oregon looking for big trees."" Someone should have told her to take a hike and pack a lunch, because the ancient forests here in Lane County alone would take her weeks, if not months, to explore.
\
She says ""ugly tree farm clear-cuts seen from her car killed the mood."" I reply: Get out of the car, hike and explore up close any of the untouched old growth forest that are here in Lane County. Stroll through a stand of these giants; hug a 1,000-year-old tree. I guarantee it won't, as she said, leave her ""going home to Austria sad and depressed.""
\
A walk in the woods is one of the best attitude adjustments we earth travelers can get. So I advise Bigontina to take a hike and pack a lunch.

Give athlete second chance
\
In a Jan. 28 letter, former Lane County Circuit Court Judge Jim Hargreaves shames University of Oregon head football Coach Mike Bellotti for giving a former felon a chance to join the Oregon football team. With an attitude like that, it is easy to see why we have so many repeat offenders in the criminal justice system.
\
I wonder what Hargreaves would like to see this young man do with the rest of his life. I would like to see him attend college and play football where he would gain more self esteem, associate with people who have goals and are good role models, and most likely lead a life as a contributing member of society. If every door is slammed in his face for his mistake, how will that teach him to be the person he says he would like to be?
\
It sounds to me like Bellotti has done a lot of research into this case and this young man's situation. Thank goodness there are people like him who are willing to give young people a second chance. What better way could there be to reduce the prison population and save the taxpayers' money?

There is much to love about Eugene, but it is shameful to be part of a privileged white majority while those who are not experience the continuous corrosive effects of overt and covert abuse.
\
Milagro Vargas' commentary (Register-Guard, Feb. 2) was painfully true. Her words about racism - ""occasionally direct, most often subtle"" - hit me hard. When I chose to wear a scarf to stand up for Muslim women who were being terrorized into hiding in their homes, even here in Eugene, I learned what hatred feels like. Not ""racism,"" ""discrimination"" or other euphemisms, but hatred. Driving became dangerous. On foot I was roughly knocked. I experienced many furious glares.
\
That was overt and menacing. But the insidious covert acts, although less frightening, were worse. Being told, ""I'm so sorry, we just ran out of what you want as soon as you walked in"" and wearing a smug pleased smile that said, ""We both know what I'm doing to you and you can't do anything about it.""
\
Until you experience it, you cannot fully understand how it feels. This exhausting hostile environment also includes the ever- present threat of physical violence.
\
I am amazed and humbled by the kind, generous grace of so many nonwhites, even while enduring our complicit silence. It is hypocritical to be horrified by killings and beatings while we tolerate this continuous soul murder.
\
And make no mistake. It happens because we tolerate it. And when we tolerate it, we participate in it. Right here in Eugene.

Radicals need to wake up
\
How many more Americans have to die? How much more blood has to be shed on our own soil? How much longer will it be until the radicals in this country wake up and realize that the freedom of this country is a right that must be protected? It is a gift over which numerous wars have been fought, and it is a gift that must be preserved if we are to have a future.
\
How many more letters will I have to read claiming that George W. Bush is a tyrannical dictator? These arguments are paper thin. Where was Ken D. Johnson (letters, Feb. 1) when President Clinton ordered attacks on Kosovo without the United Nations? To Johnson, who served in World War II, I ask: What did Adolf Hitler ever do to us? How would the citizens of the Eugene-Springfield area feel if a terrorist cell exploded a bomb laced with anthrax, purchased from Saddam Hussein, in the basement of the Eugene Library? Would that be enough evidence?
\
Thank goodness we have a president who understands the threats our nation now faces and is committed to protecting us from future attacks.

Deny RiverBend proposal
\
The proposal for RiverBend before the Springfield City Council on Feb.18 should be denied because our current roads can not handle the traffic that it will generate. We cannot afford $15 million to upgrade the Pioneer Parkway-Highway 126 intersection when PeaceHealth will only bring $750,000 to the table. How can we add a gas tax to pay for existing roads, and then think we can build the infrastructure needed to have this development?
\
It should be denied because the Gateway Refinement Plan was written by 200-plus residents and city officials, and it never envisioned a hospital or medical offices. It allowed for three additional acres of neighborhood commercial development. It certainly did not intend there to be 33 acres of land for community commercial uses, regardless of pipe dreams about nodal development or urban villages. The refinement plan should be respected. It represents a promise regarding future development made by the city to the residents of that area years ago.
\
Officials who say they do not want to be like Eugene and change the rules mid-game as they vote to approve PeaceHealth should consider that they are changing the rules for all who worked on the refinement plan. These residents lack the money PeaceHealth has to change the rules now. Elected officials should not make a mockery of our planning process; they should uphold the integrity of the system. Springfield development cannot be bought simply because big money rolls across the bridge.

Council bordering on sanity
\
There is hope for Eugene!
\
I was extremely happy to read that the Eugene City Council may be making moves toward sanity. It voted to stop speaking nonsense about a wishful-thinking proposal for a living wage.
\
Our newest councilors appear to be excellent representatives of common sense. Along with those already on the council who struggled against the insane, Jennifer Solomon and George Poling are welcome additions.
\
If the three remaining councilors - David Kelly, Betty Taylor and Bonny Bettman - could be voted out, then Eugene would prosper. The council wouldn't have to spend hours debating every oddball proposal that is made. Example: transgender restrooms.
\
The council could instead concentrate on the real issues of government that may benefit the majority and represent the taxpayers better.

Nation at critical juncture
\
With so much at stake, now is the time for extended public debate about the direction and objectives of U.S. foreign policy on Iraq. Instead, we have liberals and conservatives drowning out the discussion with name-calling and '60s rhetoric. Meanwhile there are serious questions to be answered.
\
To the liberals: Short of deploying U.S. troops, how can the world get rid of Saddam Hussein's stash of weapons of mass destruction? Do you really believe the United Nations can effectively take action to force him to do so, and if so, how? Do you really think it wise to risk Saddam using those weapons against his neighbors or to risk him selling them to the highest terrorist bidder?
\
To the conservatives: What happens after Saddam? Can an Iraqi civil war really be prevented, or will war spread outside Iraq, drawing in more and more countries? Will U.S. deployment reduce or increase the likelihood of future terrorist attacks? Can the U.S. economy really afford to shoulder the enormous costs of war and peace by itself?
\
We are at a critical juncture, a time when cool heads are needed to look at the problem from all angles in order to come up with lasting solutions, not knee-jerk reactions. ""Kumbaya"" and ""My country, love it or leave it!"" ain't gonna cut it.

Baseball proposal strikes out
\
Recently an article (Register-Guard, Jan. 28) appeared in the sports section about efforts to bring a professional baseball team to Portland. A partial quote: ""So next month, officials from Portland are expected to introduce a bill in the Legislature that would raise $150 million to build a stadium whose price tag would exceed $300 million. ... The time has to be now because the Legislature only meets every other year.""
\
At a time when we are in dire straights and are struggling to support basic services in Oregon, this seems to be insane!

241,"Oregonians could see their meters move in reverse with ""net metering."" \BY STEVE LAW \Statesman Journal \Eight years ago, Brian Bowman flew Air Force cargo jets over Kuwait, serving his country in a Gulf War he now believes was all about protecting foreign oil. \Now Bowman is doing his bit for energy independence in his own back yard - or, in this case, on his roof. And he's hoping the Oregon Legislature will make it easier for others to join him. \Sitting atop the Bowman family home in Hillsboro is a 10-by-10-foot photovoltaic panel, which collects the sun's rays and converts them to usable electricity. \While the Bowmans are home, sun powers their lights or appliances, reducing their PGE bill. On weekdays when everybody is at work or school, the system redirects unneeded electricity to the family's PGE meter on the side of the house, sending energy backward through the utility's poles and wires. \The meter literally spins in reverse, cutting Bowman's bill by one-third and allowing PGE to resell ""green power"" to other customers. \""A very common situation is no one's home at the house, and the solar system is working every day and every second,"" said Bowman, now an American Airlines pilot. ""This also happens at a time when PGE has the most demand on it, so it's really a good deal for them."" \So-called ""net metering"" may sound dangerous or complicated, or the province of fringe conservationists. But that's not the case. Twenty-six states have passed laws or regulations to promote the practice and make sure it's done safely. \Bowman and a handful of others think Oregon should, too. But their bill is stuck in the Senate Public Affairs Committee headed by Salem Republican Gene Derfler, after sailing through the House 59-0 in early May. \Solar energy seemed to be catching on after the 1970s energy scare, aided by state and federal tax credits. But prices of solar panels never dropped enough for the technology to catch fire. \In recent years, new photovoltaic panels have been developed, but prices are still daunting. Bowman shelled out $$@$!10,000 for his system and doesn't expect it to pay for itself for 14 years, even with state tax credits. \Solar energy is limitless in supply and the most environmentally friendly source of renewable energy. Hydro power, once considered ""green power,"" is now a proven fish-killer. Wind power is benign but gobbles up large tracts of land for windmill farms. Geothermal power may pose other problems. \""We do enough things to ruin our environment,"" said Christine Clark-King, a Christmas tree farmer who recently installed a solar net-metering system at her North Plains home in Washington County. ""I think the state of Oregon should get on this bandwagon."" \Small following \Only about 10 to 20 families a year are installing photovoltaic solar panels in Oregon, said Peter West of Renewables Northwest Project, a trade group for the fledgling green-power industry. \Only eight or 10 people in the state are going beyond powering their homes and doing net metering. \""What it does is provide an avenue to help build the solar industry,"" said Tom Novick, lobbyist for the trade group. If more people buy the photovoltaic systems, the group reasons, the price will fall. \Utilities sometimes resist net metering, asking customers to sign three-inch thick contracts and $$@$!1 million insurance policies. ""The barriers are too high, so nobody does it,"" Novick said. \The trade group's proposal, House Bill 3219, would require utilities to offer net metering deals. It also spells out safety standards, financial terms and other regulatory matters. \Oregon's two large privately owned utilities, PGE and Pacific Power, are supporting the bill. Other key players in energy issues are endorsing the bill or staying neutral. \The lone holdout is the trade group representing Oregon's 17 electricity cooperatives, which includes Salem Electric. As a result of their opposition, a bill that had no problems in the House is now being held up by Derfler. \The co-ops' opposition boils down to one issue: how much money they must provide to customers for juice sent back to the utilities. \Under net metering, utilities are forced to buy back electricity at the same price they charge customers, explained Sandy Flicker, acting general manager of the Oregon Rural Electric Cooperative Association. That means they pay retail for a product they ordinarily buy for wholesale. Then they have to resell the power for the same retail price without covering their added sales and distribution costs. \Flicker calls it a subsidy for the home-based solar energy supplier, and the solar industry in general. It's also an unfunded mandate for the co-ops to provide electricity at a loss. \""I guess the question is, how long are we going to subsidize the solar industry?"" Flicker said. ""At what point in time do they make it on their own?"" \Ironically, Salem Electric is a state leader in green power, buying 15 percent of its energy from a windmill project in Wyoming. The co-op's general manager was out of town this week and unavailable to comment on the net-metering dispute. \Continuing debate \Net-metering advocates don't dispute that the system amounts to a slight subsidy. But they say it's negligible. \Backers agreed to insert a provision in their bill requiring utilities to buy back the power only up to A of 1 percent of their total revenues. It would take more than a decade to reach that number of customers using net metering, Novick said, and even then the subsidy would amount to 48 cents a year for every customer. \Consumer-owned utilities also could recoup the subsidy by earning equivalent rate reductions when buying electricity from Bonneville Power Administration. That's part of BPA's effort to promote energy conservation. \The co-ops wouldn't mind a net metering bill, Flicker said, if it didn't require them to pay retail. But net-metering boosters complain that removes some of the financial incentives. Instead of getting around 5 cents perkilowatt-hour for electricity sent back through the meter, they might get half that amount. \And today's meters aren't equipped to know the difference between electricity flowing from the utility to the customer or the other way around. \Customers could solve the problem by putting a second meter on their house, Flicker said. Those would cost less than $$@$!200, and utilities would install them. \Solar advocates are resisting the idea. \""The cheapest way is just to keep it the way it is,"" said Doug Boleyn, a solar contractor who uses net metering on his house in Gladstone. Other states with net metering allow customers to fetch the retail price, he added. \Boleyn argues net metering is a service utilities can provide to make their customers happy. A bleaker alternative, he said, is for people to rely totally on solar energy and disconnect from their utility altogether. \Derfler said he's staying out of the fight and is neutral on the bill. ""I asked them to try to work out a compromise,"" he said. Energy Resource; Solar Power Salem Oregon West\PAGE ONE; Pg. 1A"
242,"Measures spur energy from farm products\The Oregon Senate on Tuesday passed two bills aimed at spurring more renewable energy produced from farm products.\Senate Bill 84 would allow utility customers that generate electricity from biomass production to sell unused power back to their utility. That process, known as net metering, already is required for small-scale solar, wind and hydro projects.\Net metering encourages more alternative-energy production by assuring that there is a market for surplus power.\Senate Bill 736 makes it easier to site biodiesel production facilities. Biodiesel energy uses farm products for engine fuels.\""These are very small steps,"" said Sen. Roger Beyer, R-Molalla, a Christmas-tree farmer. But if gas prices continue to rise, alternative fuels will be competitive without subsidies, he said.\""As the price of gas approaches $2.50 a gallon, that's where the break-even point on alternative fuels is,"" Beyer said.\Both bills passed easily in the Senate and now move on to the House.\- Steve Law\Salem\Youth task force will meet with volunteers\Volunteers helping with an international youth environmental summit this summer are invited to an organizational meeting tonight.\The YES '05 Taskforce will meet from 5 to 6:30 p.m. in the Straub Environmental Learning Center at North Salem High School, 1320 A St. NE.\Salem will host the 19th annual Caretakers of the Environment International Conference July 2-9.\The Youth Environmental Summit, as it also is known, is sponsored by the Community Schoolhouse and the Oregon State University Extension Service.\For information, go to www.yes05.org or call Dan Hoynacki at (503) 587-7897.\Pizza will be served and an RSVP is appreciated.\- Tara McLain"
243,"Brent Morace wanted solar power for his West Salem home.\Morace is concerned about global warming and his impact on the environment, which is why he wanted solar panels to have his home produce as much energy in a year as his family uses.\He and his wife, Jennifer, saved $25,000 and paid a company to install a 32-panel home solar system on their roof designed to produce 10.5 kilowatts per year.\And they figured the solar system would pay for itself in 20 years as part of an electricity swap – called net metering – with their utility company, Salem Electric.\In July 2019, their solar system was turned on.\Then Salem Electric informed customers in October it was making two significant changes in billing for customers with solar systems: It would be changing the billing cycle for home solar customers to monthly from yearly, and instead of swapping electricity with homeowners, it would reduce the value of electricity produced home solar systems by 46%.\Salem Electric officials said the company is following the lead of other utility companies in the nation by ensuring the company's few solar customers are paying an equitable amount as other customers.\""We've heard sometimes utilities make the argument, oh well, this is cost-shifting. Non-solar customers are having to pay for it,"" said Angela Crowley-Koch, executive director for the Oregon Solar Energy Industries Association.\After push back from solar customers like Morace, the board of the co-op held off on the changes and may address it at its Feb. 25 board meeting.\""They decided to hold off on the implementation of their initial rate decision,"" Salem Electric general manager Tony Schacher said.\Customers like Morace dislike altering the formula, arguing it discourages home solar at a time when the state and federal governments have made policies to encourage home solar.\He said it would extend the time his system would take to pay off to 34 years from 20 years, and the warranty on the panels expires in 25 years.\""For that $25,000 investment that I had just made 30 days prior, it ultimately null and voids the value of the system,"" he said.\Small home solar systems can cost between $8,000 and $16,000, depending on the type of equipment and efficiency of where the panels are placed.\Along with a 30% tax incentive from the federal government for systems in place by Dec. 31, 2019, Salem Electric and other utility companies offer incentives for homeowners to install home solar systems.\Morace said after his solar system was installed, he received a check for $1,500 from Salem Electric as a reimbursement for the installation costs.\""We've actually offered incentives since our program began,"" said Salem Electric member services manager Britni Davidson. ""It maxes out at $1,500.""\Solar contractors scale the size of home systems – how many panels are purchased and installed – based on the home's average yearly use so the homeowner's only remaining electric bill will be a monthly connection fee of around $15.\""Everyone's system is sized to be 100% of their energy use,"" Crowley-Koch said.\Most homeowners take out loans to pay for the system, so they have a monthly payment that equals their current electric bill, except for the base connection charge with the utility.\That way a customer who previously paid the power company an average of $140 a month would instead make a loan payment of $125 a month, plus the $15 connection fee. Once the loan is repaid, the electricity is essentially free except for the connection fee.\Plus, the solar system remains and adds value to the home, but is tax exempt under state law.\Having solar panels installed on the roof of a house and wiring it in does not take a house off the power grid.\The panels only produce electricity while there is light in the sky, meaning at 2 p.m. on June 3 the system is producing many times more electricity than the home uses and puts power back into the grid; at 2 a.m. on Dec. 21, the solar panels produce none, and the house must receive electricity from a traditional power grid.\When Oregon law required net metering starting in 1999, all major power companies – including Salem Electric – began swapping the amount of electricity they receive from homeowners for credits for use in low production times.\The changes Salem Electric sought to make would pay its home solar customers 4.17 cents per kilowatt hour, the same price the company pays to purchase power from Bonneville Power Administration. Meanwhile, Salem Electric residential customers pay the utility 7.69 cents per kilowatt hour.\Schacher said the company addressed the change to monthly breakdowns at the request of its customers, and he looked at what other co-op power companies have done.\""To be quite honest with you, we don't want to be seen as a pushback on solar,"" Schacher said. ""I got to make sure it's equitable.""\The alteration in pricing structure would be a huge shift and make it difficult for current home solar customers as they would return to having a power bill on top of their loans, in most cases, and the changes could limit future home solar development.\""When you're doing it monthly, kind of like doing the books, balancing books, it's not really a full picture of what the system is providing to the grid,"" Crowley-Koch said.\""The extra power he's producing in the summer, it's not just like it evaporates. It gets used. And so he should be credited with that. He is using power in the winter. The system is producing in the summer. It should be averaged out.""\In Oregon, your electric provider is determined by your address.\The majority of the Willamette Valley receives its power from two major companies, Portland General Electric (which has 892,000 customers including most of Salem and Portland) and Pacific Power (which covers Willamette Valley cities Stayton, Dallas, Albany and Corvallis).\But in Oregon there are 18 co-ops such as Salem Electric and municipalities such as Monmouth that sell power.\Salem Electric started in 1938 and has grown to include 19,738 customers over 17.48 square miles including most of West Salem, a swath of downtown Salem, the southern half of Keizer and a small patch of North Salem along Portland Road.\Oregon Public Utility Commission spokesperson Kandi Young said their agency regulates the three largest utilities in the state, but not co-ops like Salem Electric or municipalities.\""They have a board and that's kind of it,"" Crowley-Koch said of Salem Electric.

245,"Statesman Journal\The 2007 legislative session marks the first time in about 30 years that the environment has played a prominent role in the state's politics.\Not since the era of former Gov. Tom McCall have so many major environmental priorities passed.\Because of bills passed this session, the state has to have 25 percent renewable energy by 2025, free and convenient electronic recycling for all state residents, biofuels mixed in Oregon fuel and tax incentives for energy efficiencies.\One of the most veteran people in the Capitol said the list of new environmental legislation is long.\""It is a landmark session for the environmentalists,"" said Dave Barrows, who has been a lobbyist for 48 years. ""They have had a very lengthy list of successes ... this is almost exceeding the Tom McCall years.""\Barrows, who represents 3M, Progressive Insurance, Nike and several other businesses, said the results are even more impressive given the environmentalists' lack of Capitol experience.\""Most of the folks that are working on environmental issues at the Capitol this session are not old hands,"" Barrows said. ""They are, by and large, people working on their first session, so you have to give them even more credit for their successes.""\Lobbyist Sybil Ackerman, the legislative-affairs director for the Oregon League of Conservation Voters, said the environmental agenda fared better than in the past in part because of the Democratic control in the House, Senate and governor's office.\""The switch in leadership really made a huge difference,"" she said. ""The political climate really made it so the environment was part of our society in a normal way rather than an extreme thing.""\Five priorities of the Oregon Conservation Network, a coalition of more than 40 environmental groups, all passed: biofuels promotion, a suite of bills to promote renewable energy and energy conservation, cleaning up Oregon's waterways, establishing a system for electronic waste recycling and revising Measure 37.\Sen. Brad Avakian, D-Portland, and Rep. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Portland, led the effort to make environmental issues a priority. They both led environment committees in their respective chambers and they worked on an agenda together before the session started.\""Oregon is a state with a very long legacy in smart, natural-resource management, so I think this was just Oregon returning to its roots,"" Avakian said about the 2007 session. ""It's one of those great moments in Oregon history when we return back to these environmental landmarks.""\Dingfelder was able to see several bills pass that she had championed during the past three sessions, including electronic recycling and a package of tax credits and incentives regarding biofuels.\She said she was disappointed, however, in a lack of action to protect Oregon's water.\""Water is going to be one of the big issues in the future in terms of scarcity,"" she said.\Bills related to measurement of water use, limiting groundwater withdrawals and studying water storage died. Funding, on the other hand, increased to agencies that deal with water issues.\But Avakian and Dingfelder both said they are confident that this session laid the groundwork for more environmental legislation next session -- to further deal with water supply and storage, global warming and better recycling methods under the bottle bill.\""Clearly, this session is the best session in over 30 years on environmental issues,"" Dingfelder said. ""It puts us back on the map.""\bcasper@StatesmanJournal.com or (503) 589-6994\Environmental bills that passed\Several environmental bills garnered a lot of attention this session:\Senate Bill 838: Establishes a renewable-energy standard that requires utilities to generate 25 percent of their electricity from wind, solar, wave and geothermal sources by 2025.\House Bills 2210, 2211 and 2212 (the latter two are now House Bill 3201): Establish a renewable fuels standard and tax credits to stimulate development and use of biofuels.\House Bill 2626: Establishes a program to require manufacturers to take back and recycle TVs, computers, monitors and laptops, which contain toxic materials. Effective Jan. 1, 2009.\Senate Bill 707: Expands the bottle bill to include water bottles. Effective Jan. 1, 2009.\Senate Bill 737: Requires state study of persistent and harmful toxins in rivers statewide and then requires municipalities to develop and implement pollution prevention plans for toxic pollution.\OTHER LEGISLATION\The bills above that garnered the most attention make up only a small percentage of the environmental legislation to become law:\House Bill 3488: Expands the property tax exemption for residential use of solar energy to business and other uses of solar and other renewable energy systems, including systems which can be used for net metering.\Senate Bill 375: Establishes minimum energy efficiency standards for appliances, compact audio players and other products. It also prohibits the sale or installation of products that do not meet the standards effective Sept. 1, 2009.\Senate Bill 704: Requires dentists to have an amalgam separator installed in a wastewater drain if materials containing mercury pass through it, helping keep mercury out of water.\House Bill 2925: Exempts wave energy projects off Oregon's coast generating five megawatts or less from regulations of hydroelectric projects if a license is not required under the Federal Power Act. This legislation also allows university research to continue to test wave energy devices off the Oregon Coast.\Senate Bill 432: Prohibits the dismantling of ships, called ship breaking, unless it is on a dry dock or has special exceptions when the Department of State Lands determines that it is impossible to move the shipwreck into dry dock.\Senate Bill 790: Implements a three-year moratorium on gas or sulfur drilling off the Oregon coast.\House Bill 2620: Requires 1.5 percent of public construction funds to be used to install solar technology in new public buildings.\House Bill 3543: Sets greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, creates the Oregon Global Warming Commission and appropriates $250,000 for the Climate Change Research Institute.\Senate Bill 235: Applies the Clean Air Act to large concentrated animal-feeding operations and establishes a state Task Force to develop policy recommendations to address growing air- pollution problems from large dairy operations.\House Bill 2172: Provides incentives for replacing and retrofitting diesel engines in Oregon's school buses, trucks, construction equipment and farm vehicles.\House Bill 2272: Requires that new vehicles, beginning with the model year 2009, comply with low-emission standards consistent with the Environmental Quality Commission in order to register the vehicle. It also authorizes the Oregon Department of Transportation to deny registration to 2009-or-later-model-year vehicles that do not comply with the new standards.\Senate Bill 420: Creates an Environmental Justice Task Force to create guidelines and oversee the activities of present natural resource agencies to better emphasize accountability, democratic practices, equitable treatment and self-determination in regard to low-income people and people of color."
246,"Thank you, Gov. Kulongoski, for keeping your eye on new energy jobs and on reducing global warming pollution in Oregon.\Oregon's conservation community represents the vast majority of Oregonians, people from all corners of the state who believe in protecting the clean air and water for future generations. Unlike the corporate polluter lobby, we see little personal financial gain in fighting for that future.\In pushing through HB 2940, the high-priced corporate timber and trash-burning lobby pushed a special interest add-on benefiting them at the expense of Oregon's clean energy future. It was these special interests who chose a singular path and crushed the innovation of creative and pioneering businesses in building Oregon's green energy economy.\HB 2940 chose the pre-1995 hydro and biomass as the sole winners in the Renewable Portfolio Standard at the cost to the rest of the renewable energy sources. The state RPS requires 25 percent of new electricity come from 100 percent clean, renewable sources. By including old and dirty renewable energy into the RPS, our state's strongest climate policy would've been cut by one-quarter. This was simply unacceptable to the conservation community, and it should have also been unacceptable to legislators facing a terrifying economic downturn.\A one-quarter cut to the RPS is a one-quarter cut in Oregon's ability to reduce our global warming pollution. But it's also a one-quarter cut in new renewable energy jobs. And it's a one-quarter cut in the amount of clean energy business that will blossom in Oregon. So the conservation community understands the everyday challenges of everyday people.\Oregon's statewide June unemployment rate was 12.1 percent. But the counties with wind projects in operation or development (Union, Umatilla, Morrow, Sherman and Gilliam) each had unemployment rates less than the statewide average. By contrast, the rural counties of Crook, Josephine, Deschutes, Klamath and Coos had unemployment rates ranging from 20.6 percent to 13.6 percent.\According to the Renewable Northwest Project, wind projects have invested $2 billion of capital in rural Oregon, producing approximately $225 million in rural property-tax revenues and community service fees. Rural farmers, ranchers and landowners received $4 million to $8 million in annual payments from wind companies. And wind farms created 1,650 construction and operational jobs.\Right now there are projects permitted for development that will triple Oregon's wind energy production. Cutting the RPS would have put many of these projects in financial jeopardy. Thanks to the economic certainty brought by the governor's veto, the new wind projects are projected to generate $219 million in additional rural property tax revenues and community service fees, $8 million to $15.5 million in more payments to farmers and ranchers and 3,000 more jobs.\So the path to a stronger economy starts by strengthening the RPS, not weakening it with old, dirty power advocated by a narrow set of special interests.\Gov. Kulongoski, you were right to veto HB 2940 and protect Oregon's climate legacy.\Brock Howell of Portland is an advocate with Environment Oregon. He can be reached at brock@environmentoregon.org."
247,"As the executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board of Oregon (CUB), Oregon's utility ratepayer advocate for 30 years, I am pleased to have negotiated with a coalition of utilities and clean energy advocates to craft proposed House Bill 4036 or The Clean Energy and Transition from Coal Bill.\In a nutshell, this bill expands on 2007 legislation (known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS) to eliminate coal-fired electric generation from Oregon's electricity mix by 2035 and increase renewable energy to 50 percent by 2040.\Let me tell you why this bill is good for Oregon.\Coal is an old, dirty technology that requires ongoing capital investment in expensive pollution controls, and the Federal Clean Power Plan regulations will continue that trend. I strongly believe that phasing out our use of coal is the single-best action Oregon can take to reduce emissions while protecting consumers from future costs associated with carbon regulation. Furthermore, while the cost of coal and coal plants has increased, the cost of clean energy has decreased.\Since 2009, the price of wind has fallen by more than two-thirds, and in the past five years alone, rooftop solar prices have dropped 80 percent. Expecting coal to be a cheap, pre-ferred resource after 2030 is unrealistic, but anticipating that clean energy will be reasonably priced makes sense.\While it is only possible for the Oregon Legislature to deal with electricity supplied to Oregon, we will still be impacting the region as a whole. More renewable generation in Oregon can mean that coal and natural gas generation in other states will be curtailed during the milder times of the year. Less fossil fuel generation guarantees a reduction in carbon emissions.\And, the truth is that Oregonians don't like coal.\Oregon customers of the utilities affected by this proposed legislation approve of phasing out coal. Polling done by Strategies 360 shows that 71 percent of Oregonians supported a similar 2015 proposal to transition the state to clean renewable energy. To ignore this public sentiment would be politically naive.\CUB believes that HB 4036 is a thoughtful, win-win solution that sets Oregon on a 20-year path to phase out our use of coal and a 25-year path to doubling clean energy standards to 50 percent. It allows us to use tried and true planning tools, and competitive bidding procedures to ensure that Oregon plans for and wisely manages this process.\The transition from coal began when PGE made the 2010 decision to phase out Oregon's only coal plant in Boardman. Since then, hundreds of coal plants across the country have closed or are scheduled to close. We can pretend that coal plants will be the affordable option as we move forward, or we can pass legislation that prescribes divesting from coal and investing in clean technology.\As the director of the utility consumer advocate group that has saved Oregonians $6.9 billion since 1984, I am confident that HB 4036 is what's best for Oregon's energy future: best for consumers, best for utilities and best for the environment.\Bob Jenks of Portland is executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board of Oregon.

248,"Our President and Congress should reconsider the minor environmental impact and major harm to manufacturing, imposed by a carbon tax. This proposed tax attempts to transform consumer behavior, but inadvertently and disproportionately heaps harm onto poorer Americans.\Wise environmental stewards know vulnerable citizens on assistance will be hurt at the pump and by higher utility bills at home inflicted by new lofty goals, perpetuating reliance on governmental assistance. How would rural Oregonians pay for strict new anti-carbon measures?\Manufacturing America would also be hit hard. If America closed all coalmines in Kentucky and West Virginia, we would watch the devastation of Appalachia, while boosting China's economy.

Extracted at exceptional efficiencies from water, hydrogen is combined with nitrogen from the atmosphere (air is 78% nitrogen) creating a powerful, sustainable fuel from our most common renewable elements on earth. This green fuel is the densest, zero-carbon fuel anywhere -- 50 percent more energy dense than liquid hydrogen. It can be stored in existing tanks then transformed into power by creating centers of electric generation on-demand, just like carbon-fueled power plants -- minus pollution.\This technology, or ""Hydrogen Hubs,"" can form the center-pivots of power generation plants and be placed at key grid locations. The only emission by-product from Hydrogen Hubs is thousands of gallons of clean water. Hubs also can use natural gas or this breakthrough green fuel. A combination of these fuels lowers power rates, cleans the air and revolutionizes energy everywhere.\Don't forget the Northwest's long underrated energy trump card -- hydroelectricity! The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) ignored this gem but it remains the key to our clean energy advantage.

Because of the political divisiveness around climate change, we should focus on the things we agree upon, like the climate challenge of CO2.
