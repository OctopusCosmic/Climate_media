0,"Wisconsin's two U.S. senators wisely voted against a sneaky attempt to ram cap-and-trade legislation through the Senate this month.\Sens. Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold joined 24 other Democrats and all 41 Republicans in rejecting a procedural move that would have limited debate and amendments - and prevented a filibuster - on this complex issue.\Climate change is a serious threat that requires a broad range of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A cap-and-trade system that essentially taxes carbon energy may be justified if it's designed carefully with the environment and the economy in mind. Such a system could significantly boost cleaner energy alternatives and technology.\But rushing such sweeping policy through the Senate using a procedural trick intended only for narrow budget action would be wrong.\""We have to take a look at what's in proposals and how it impacts the economy and jobs in the (Midwest), where we have so much coal to get our energy,"" Kohl told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""That's a very complicated thing.""\Feingold said in a written statement that the parliamentary procedure in question, called ""reconciliation,"" has a narrow purpose - deficit reduction - that doesn't apply to cap and trade.\""I have strongly opposed past efforts to use reconciliation to address policy matters, such as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,"" Feingold said. ""It wasn't appropriate then. It isn't appropriate now.""\That means cap and trade will need at least 60 votes to ensure passage, rather than a bare majority of 50.\If designed well, cap-and-trade legislation could cap carbon emissions and require those companies that exceed the cap to buy or trade credits. It would use market-based principles rather than inflexible regulations.\But if designed poorly, Wisconsin and other states that rely heavily on coal for energy to power homes, businesses and manufacturing plants could be socked with fat bills that further stall the economy.\Kohl and Feingold wisely helped stop their Democratic colleagues from short-circuiting the process for debate and refinement. A rush job of federal legislation that batters Wisconsin's economy isn't the answer."
1,"Conservation and stewardship. Aren't they core Republican values?\It is hard to imagine how someone can be considered a conservative if they don't want to be conservative with the most important thing we have -- our environment. Some even perpetuate the myth that conservation and environmental protection are liberal causes to justify their opposition.\Past Republican leaders have been strong advocates for the environment and were responsible for enacting some of our most significant environmental legislation. Theodore Roosevelt was responsible for greatly expanding our national parks system. Richard Nixon enacted many of the nation's landmark environmental laws, including creation of the EPA. Gerald Ford adopted the motor vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, the creation of 18 national parks and designation of 3.4 million acres of wilderness areas.\Ronald Reagan preserved a total of 10.6 million acres of wilderness. He signed the Montreal Protocol, which dramatically reduced depletion of the upper-atmosphere's protective ozone layer. He developed a cap-and-trade system that prevented acid rain from blowing into Canada.\John McCain, during his 2008 presidential campaign, proposed a pragmatic national energy policy based upon good stewardship, good science and reasonableness. He co-sponsored cap-and-trade bills in the Senate in 2003, 2005 and 2007.Cap-and-trade once was considered the market solution to reducing carbon emissions.\But now, Republican leaders are claiming cap-and-trade would cost too much; but the Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost would average $175 per household and that associated savings would reduce the federal deficit by about $19 billion by 2020. The misinformation, the damage to the environment and the additional expense that would be caused by not acting should alarm traditional Republicans. However, according to the Republicans for Environmental Protection, ""the GOP establishment has lost sight of its core conservative values, largely due to the influence of corporate lobbies and political leaders beholden to them for campaign support.""\Do Republicans need to reclaim their environmental leadership role?\Kim Everett\Mishicot"

(EDITOR'S NOTE: The writer is addressing the question, Will cap-and-trade legislation currently before Congress make businesses less competitive?
\
""Cap-and-trade"" sounds fabulous: Those who emit carbon dioxide will have to obtain permits for their emissions. If they are able to reduce emissions cheaply, they will cut their emissions, enabling them to sell the permits they don't need to those who can't cut emissions as cheaply.
\
Thus, the efficient are rewarded, the environment saved. But once you read the fine print, cap-and-trade doesn't look as good.
\
First, for the system to be effective the permits must be worth something. Permits are valuable only if there are not enough of them available for current emissions levels.
\
President Obama originally proposed selling the permits through an auction, but special interests have already watered down the bill to provide that 80 percent of the permits will be given to existing emitters. The same thing happened under the European Union's plan, which failed miserably. As a result of the giveaway, the desired reductions won't appear.
\
Let's ignore that problem and imagine Congress decides on a system that will cut emissions.
\
As American legislation, the cap-and-trade system applies only to American emissions, but only 22.2 percent of the world's carbon-dioxide emissions come from U.S. sources.
\
Because it is world emissions that potentially affect the climate, reducing just one country's emissions does little good unless worldwide emissions are cut. As major sources such as China (18.4 percent), European Union (15 percent), Russia (5.6 percent), India (4.9 percent) and Japan (4.6 percent) have not yet agreed to reduce emissions, and many developing countries' emissions are increasing as their economies grow, reducing U.S. emissions merely puts American companies at a disadvantage to foreign competitors.
\
Worse, by reducing U.S. emissions before we reach an agreement with other source countries, the United States would give up its most valuable negotiating chip without getting anything in return.
\
Because many major emitters, including China and India, have shown no willingness to reduce emissions on their own, a unilateral move by the United States makes it less likely that we will be able to negotiate an effective worldwide agreement.
\
Even if we could get other countries to sign on, a cap-and-trade system that works will be an economic disaster because it will raise prices of everything.
\
Unlike many other pollutants, carbon-dioxide emissions are the product of the combustion of carbon-based energy sources such as coal, oil, wood, and natural gas. Some 98 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are energy-related.
\
Cutting carbon-dioxide emissions thus isn't a matter of tweaking an existing process or adding a filter to a smokestack--it requires either dramatic changes in energy production or major reductions in energy use.
\
For example, the federal Energy Information Administration's calculation of total system costs for land-based wind-generated power turn out to be more than 50 percent greater than conventional coal or natural gas power.
\
Solar photovoltaic electricity costs four times as much as power from coal or natural gas. Even if we could quickly increase wind's contribution from the 1.3 percent of electricity it generated in 2008, and reduce the percentage generated from fossil fuels from 70.9 percent, the cost of doing so would be staggering.
\
Yet to actually reduce emissions, cap-and-trade must significantly raise energy prices, and so the price of everything made using energy will go up. Such widespread price increases will likely produce both inflation and unemployment, returning us to the stagflation of the 1970s.
\
Cap-and-trade sounds good, but what it offers is either a chance for politicians to reward special interests or a road to economic ruin. As players in a struggling world economy, we can't afford either.

Some environmentalist groups say climate change legislation pending in Congress doesn't go far enough. Some industrial groups say it goes too far. But we're with those who say the legislation provides a good step in the right direction, one that can be built on or adjusted as time goes on.
\
According to the preponderance of scientific opinion, climate change is here, and human activity is a primary cause. Reversing that course will require leadership from the United States, and that requires leadership from the Obama administration and Congress, leadership that could start with legislation now on the table.
\
Such legislation would put in place a cap-and-trade system that places a cost on carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. The system would limit the amount of emissions and then seek to reduce them over time to help keep the concentration of gases in the air from reaching dangerous levels.
\
Those who argue that the legislation doesn't go far enough are placing the ideal above what's possible now. And what's possible now is the creation of a cap-and-trade system that places a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and then moves toward reducing those emissions.
\
Those who argue that the bill goes too far are ignoring the reality of what's already happening. The climate is changing, and humans are having an impact on that change. If countries can mitigate that change, so much the better. And while key players such as India and China have yet to sign on to the global effort to reduce the human impact, if the United States sets the course, others may follow.
\
It's a course most Americans support: According to Environment and Energy Publishing, the Democratic firm Mellman Group and the Republican group Public Opinion Strategies conducted a survey that found that 78% of voters still want the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That number is virtually unchanged since the firms asked that question in March -- prior to the start of the House energy debate -- when 77% supported action to reduce emissions.
\
Additionally, 72% of voters support the core principles of the energy legislation that would reduce emissions and force expanded use of renewable energy. Eighteen percent oppose such legislation.
\
Legislation moving through Congress seeks to reduce emissions to 17% percent below 2005 levels by 2020. To do that, it would create a cap-and-trade system in which polluters would be required to obtain credits -- which could be bought and sold -- for the greenhouse gases they produce. But the bill, which early Friday was running to more than 1,200 pages, also contains a system of caveats, safety valves and rule changes meant to satisfy unhappy Democrats, many from farming states.
\
The resulting legislation could significantly change the U.S. energy industry and build new businesses in carbon trading and so-called green technology.
\
Under the plan, emitters would have to reduce their emissions or buy credits to keep releasing the gases. The value of carbon credits in the U.S. could reach as much as $220 billion in the first year alone. At first, the government would give away the vast majority of those credits. The rest would be auctioned off, and the majority of the revenue from those sales would be used to help consumers offset increases in energy costs through credits or rebates, supporters note.
\
The Washington Post reported Friday that the bill gives some emissions credits free to rural electric cooperatives so they can sell them and use the money to cushion consumers. And it gives the Department of Agriculture, not the Environmental Protection Agency, oversight of a key program. That would allow farmers to sell ""offsets"" for carbon dioxide that their crops soak up from the air or for reducing greenhouse gases from animal waste.
\
The cost of energy consumption would go up, and that's a reason for concern, especially in the Midwest and Wisconsin, as Diana Marrero and Thomas Content of the Journal Sentinel reported in an article last week. Wisconsin is more reliant than most states on coal plants, a primary factor in carbon emissions. People in the Midwest also are more likely to drive greater distances, operate farms or work in manufacturing than those who live in coastal states.
\
Among others, Journal Sentinel business columnist John Torinus and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) have sounded warnings about cost. Such warnings deserve attention, but the bottom line has to be a serious strategy to significantly reduce emissions before it's too late to affect warming trends.
\
And estimates on the cost of the bill vary widely. Some critics have placed it at as high as $1,000 or more annually for the average household by 2020. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the costs to consumers and businesses would be too small to significantly dampen economic growth, and the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost at $175 per household with offsets.
\
Wisconsin manufacturing jobs could also benefit if the legislation spurs an upsurge in so-called green technology jobs in the fields of conservation and renewable energy production.
\
The reality is that something needs to be done. ""Climate change is going to be addressed, so we better figure out how to do it in a way that is not only effective but protects our industries and energy costs as best as we can,"" said Roy Thilly, chief executive of WPPI Energy in Sun Prairie and co-chairman of the Governor's Task Force on Global Warming. Thilly is right, and the Wisconsin delegation should help make sure that the legislation that Obama eventually signs strikes the right balance.
\
The bottom line is that the nation needs to move now on climate change. There will be a cost in acting, but it won't be nearly as great as the cost of doing nothing.

4," Sen. Russ Feingold accused the Bush administration Sunday night of succumbing to special interests instead of adopting stricter restrictions on mercury pollution.\ Speaking in Madison at the International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant, the Wisconsin Democrat also condemned the Environmental Protection Agency's ""cap-and-trade"" mercury rule, which aims to reduce environmental mercury by 21 percent by 2010 and 69 percent by 2018.\ In the cap-and-trade system, each state willing to participate must meet a mercury standard set by the EPA. The cap-and-trade rule, which was adopted in March 2005, uses the same method as the EPA's acid rain program.\ Feingold attacked the EPA for failing to respond to its own mercury research and create a stricter, more immediately effective plan.\ ""The need for stringent mercury controls has never been more urgent,"" Feingold said to a packed ballroom at the Monona Terrace Convention Center. ""The rule we have now turns back the clock 10 years.""\ Representatives of the EPA are attending the conference.\ An EPA air specialist spokesperson in Washington would not comment today because no transcript of Feingold's speech was available.\ Feingold's Washington office was unable this morning to provide an alternative to the cap-and-trade program. But a staff member did point to a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee vote in May to restore the quality of the Great Lakes. Feingold co-sponsored the effort, which includes reducing mercury levels in the water.\ Feingold also said he has significant backing in the Senate for stronger mercury controls that could gain momentum depending on who has control of Congress after November's midterm elections.\ ""I have hope that we can quickly reverse this rule,"" Feingold said.\ Though Feingold garnered laughter and applause from an audience of international activists, politicians and scholars, not all were convinced.\ ""I think some of his comments were a little strong and a bit (of) rhetoric,"" said John Jansen, principal scientist for Southern Company, an electricity supplier serving Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. ""The cap-and-trade program is not a step backwards.""\ The conference, which will run through Friday, is the first of an annual series to produce a declaration summarizing findings of expert panels. The conference also will give independent researchers, students and non-government agencies the opportunity to share their work and take part in conference committees.\ Research on mercury exposure has found that high levels of mercury pose many health risks, from asthma, to nervous system problems, to a lowered IQ."

Wisconsin lawmakers are paying more attention to the environment than at any time in the past decade.
\
Pollution bans, river and groundwater protections, pro-hunting and fishing initiatives, and measures to fight global warming are getting strong consideration, even as the state grapples with record budget deficits.
\
""It's been an incredibly proactive pro-conservation session,"" said Jennifer Giegerich, capitol liaison with the Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters.
\
The activity has been pushed along by Democrats, who took control of both houses of the Legislature in January. But it's also driven by a sharper interest in energy and environmental issues, especially renewable power and strategies to control greenhouse gas emissions.
\
""What you've seen is that we had about a dozen years of rather relaxed efforts on environmental legislation,"" said Rep. Spencer Black (D-Madison), chairman of the Assembly Natural Resources Committee. ""Now we are going full steam.""
\
Environmentalists say they are better organized than when Republicans controlled the Assembly and environmentalists had to fight efforts to thwart green regulation.
\
And, ""the public is demanding it -- it sits well with constituents back home,"" said George Meyer, executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation.
\
Republicans have complained about the cost of some initiatives and emphasize that the most important issues have not been passed.
\
""We have a different viewpoint,"" said Rep. Scott Gunderson (R-Waterford). ""They (the Democrats) don't always look at the economy.""
\
One example: He said many are worried about a proposal to place stricter limits on the use of groundwater, which might harm industry and agriculture.
\
So far this year, the state's deficit has dominated lawmakers' attention.
\
Environmentalists pleased
\
Still, environmentalists say they are pleased with what they see as substantial progress:
\
- A bill banning the use of phosphorus in most lawn fertilizers has been signed into law.
\
- Two northern Wisconsin rivers -- portions of the Brunsweiler and Totagatic -- are getting state Wild Rivers designation, which limits development. The rivers are only the fourth and fifth to achieve the status since the law was adopted more than 40 years ago.
\
- The influential Joint Finance Committee has more than doubled tipping fees that communities are required to pay to send garbage to landfills. The measure, which has angered many communities, would raise tax revenue for other uses. Environmentalists say it will discourage people from throwing away more garbage.
\
- A bill banning electronic waste from landfills, patterned after Minnesota's, has cleared the full Senate and an Assembly committee.
\
- Oil filters and material used to clean up oil might also be kept out of landfills. On Tuesday, the Assembly is scheduled to vote on the ban.
\
- A bipartisan bill would give authority to the state Public Service Commission to determine the best permitting standards for wind farms. The measure has been approved by an Assembly committee. It would replace a patchwork of local regulations that wind advocates say dissuades investment in the technology. More than a dozen wind projects have been slowed by local opposition in the state.
\
- At a time when hunting participation is declining, a bill that establishes a mentoring program for hunters as young as 10 is awaiting the signature of Gov. Jim Doyle.
\
- Doyle has also signed legislation that delays the start of the musky fishing season in northern Wisconsin until after the spawning season in the spring.
\
Greenhouse gases
\
Once the budget is approved, more contentious issues are expected.
\
The biggest: What role will Wisconsin play in controlling carbon dioxide emissions?
\
The majority of climate scientists say greenhouse gases from power plants, cars and other sources are contributing to global warming.
\
""All other bills will pale in comparison,"" said Scott Manley, director of environmental policy for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce.
\
The Doyle administration and legislative leaders have been meeting privately on the legislation, but the recommendations of Doyle's task force on global warming are expected to be the template for legislative proposals.
\
The task force recommendations include cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 75% from 2005 levels by 2050.
\
Another proposal calls for the state to obtain 25% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.
\
A third proposal supports participation in a cap-and-trade program that uses the market to limit carbon emissions.
\
The task force said it prefers a national cap-and-trade system. But one option under consideration, if Congress is slow to act, is a regional cap-and-trade program in which high-carbon companies in the Midwest could trade emissions among themselves.
\
The concept of a cap-and-trade system -- especially the regional approach -- worries business groups because the Midwest heavily depends on coal for electricity.
\
""That would be devastating to the regional economy,"" Manley said.
\
Businesses and environmentalists also are gearing up for a fight over what renewable power really means. Environmentalists want to see more electricity generated from renewable sources to come from Wisconsin -- not shipped over power lines from other states.
\
And finally, despite opposition from Doyle and business groups, a majority of lawmakers in both houses have cosponsored legislation giving back control of the Department of Natural Resources to the seven-member Natural Resources Board.
\
Since 1995, governors have had the power to appoint the head of the environmental enforcement and conservation agency.
\
That's long angered environmentalists who believe the system puts too much authority over an agency that was created to be insulated from politics into the hands of the governor.
\
Doyle long held the same opinion. But in January, he raised doubts about his support for an independent secretary.
\
His position is even clearer now:
\
Through a spokesman, Doyle said last week he now supports the system in which a DNR secretary is answerable to him.

Bush administration lags in clearing the air
\
By PAUL KRUGMAN
\
Sunday, April 28, 2002
\
On Earth Day, President Bush staged a photo op in the wilderness and touted his ""clean skies"" initiative. Democrats jeered and called him a tool of polluting interests.
\
Is there anything good to say about the Bush administration's air quality plans? The answer is yes. But -- you knew there would be a but -- the good stuff is tentative and inadequate, while the bad stuff is being instituted with alacrity and determination.
\
The current system for controlling air pollution badly needs an overhaul. Back in the 1970s, the Clean Air Act set strict rules -- but only for ""new"" sources of pollution. Existing power plants, factories and so on were grandfathered. The idea was that over time, old, dirty facilities would close down.
\
The result was predictable. Polluters kept those old facilities operating, precisely because they were exempted from the new rules. Corporations poured money into existing power plants and factories, expanding their capacity, rather than build new ones.
\
The Clinton administration tried to crack down on this practice, suing companies that it said were creating new pollution sources under the guise of maintaining old ones. Not surprisingly, polluters hated ""new source review,"" and they contributed millions to Bush's campaign.
\
There ought to be a better way, and there is. It's called ""cap and trade."" Under cap and trade, existing pollution sources receive permits to emit specified amounts of pollutants -- but they can sell those permits to others. This creates an incentive to reduce pollution from old facilities in order to free permits for sale. Cap and trade has been instituted for some pollutants, notably sulfur dioxide from power plants, with great success. By gradually reducing the number of permits, the government can use cap and trade to achieve long-term reductions in pollution.
\
Sure enough, the substantive part of the Bush administration's air pollution plan is a cap-and-trade system for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. So what is there to complain about? Alas, lots.
\
First, the plan conspicuously fails to include carbon dioxide, the main cause of global warming. Aside from violating one of Bush's campaign pledges, this omission casts a long shadow over future policy. Environmental experts tell me that it would be much cheaper to reduce carbon dioxide emissions as part of an integrated, multipollutant strategy than to add carbon dioxide controls later, after key investment decisions have already been made. So by doing nothing about global warming, this administration compromises the policies of future administrations, too.
\
Second, the Bush plan still allows twice as much pollution as experts at the Environmental Protection Agency privately think appropriate. The cost of an additional 50% reduction in pollution, according to internal EPA documents, would be pretty small. But the administration apparently prefers not to ask industry to bear even those small costs.
\
Finally, and most important, the administration's ""clean skies"" initiative so far is pie in the sky: No legislation has been introduced, and there doesn't seem to be any urgency. Meanwhile, the administration is moving rapidly to scuttle new source review, saving its financial backers billions in cleanup costs at the expense of the environment (especially in the downwind states of the Northeast). By scuttling new source review, the administration may well be undermining political support for its own anti-pollution initiative. As long as they were under the gun, polluting companies favored a new, less cumbersome system of pollution control. Now, they and their powerful congressional allies would just as soon leave things as they are.
\
Demoralization is evident at the EPA, where the hazardous-waste ombudsman recently joined a parade of officials resigning in protest. Staff members feel that they have no backing from their political superiors. Eric Schaeffer, who recently quit as the chief of civil enforcement, put it this way: ""The EPA is in the back seat, or maybe even riding the bumper, and the energy industry is having a field day.""
\
So what's actually on offer is a modest new pollution initiative - - maybe, eventually, if and when the administration gets around to it. Don't you know there's a war on? Meanwhile, the big polluters get what they paid for in campaign contributions: multibillion- dollar free passes.

7,"Recently, John Kerry joined with his ""Band of Brothers"" on the DNC stage. Here I would like to talk about another ""Band of Brothers,"" the sportsmen of central Wisconsin and beyond.\I have been privileged to interact with many of these men in the past two years. I have to tell you, there is no more generous group than these hunters/fishers. To a person, they are passionate about preserving habitat and saving natural resources. I like to think of them as compassionate conservationists.\Two examples come to mind: During the campaign for a new ""Education Center"" at MeadSWA, I approached a dozen+ hunting/fishing groups. All donated to this project, which hopes to pass on to future generations the legacy of ""natural resource stewardship."" Moreover, I stood shoulder to shoulder with sportsmen who opposed the trapshooting range in the BVG. Together, we won to keep the BVG ""trapshoot free.""\And, now, it looks like ""the Brothers"" are on the right track again. In 2000, they strongly supported Bush over Gore because they thought he would maintain a healthier environment. But now, President Bush has an environmental track record and it ""ain't pretty."" Sportsmen don't like what they see.\For example, on July 30 (Worcester Telegram and Gazette), the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) put out a report critical of the administration for a ""cap and trade"" program for mercury emissions from coal-fired plants. Trout Unlimited in Maine and other states are also critical.\In Wisconsin, the NWF recently surveyed hunters/anglers (SPJ Outdoors, July 22) and found: 1) 70 percent believe the best way to address America's energy needs is through expanding renewables (45 percent) and conservation (25 percent); 2) 67 percent oppose the administration on mercury pollution; and 3) 64 percent oppose the administration's stand on clean water that eliminates protection for up to 20 million acres of wetlands.\Who knew? Bush's promises sure sounded good in 2000. I call on the ""Brotherhood of Sportsmen"" to join me in supporting the only presidential ticket that will seek renewable energy alternatives and clean water and air. Vote Kerry-Edwards.\Kent D. Hall\Stevens Point\Ex-gay educators' message criticized\We've often been told we're to be tolerant toward homosexuals. ""Live and let live"" seems to be the code. In an open society, this should work both ways, but apparently some in the homosexual community don't like the idea.\The recently held National Education Association's (NEA) conference in Washington, D.C., is one example. According to reports, a group known as the ""Ex-Gay Educators Caucus"" was largely ignored and faced a barrage of verbal abuse from NEA delegates as they walked by their booth. Reportedly one delegate told members of the ex-gay caucus that there was a ""special place in hell for us.""\Noe Gutierrez, a former homosexual activist, is now a member of the Ex-Gay Caucus. To the Washington Times he said: ""People made the association between us and gay-bashers. I mean, they definitely lumped us in with a whole lot of bad and came to our booth with that attitude, not open in any way to learning. Isn't that funny? So at an educators caucus, there is no learning taking place.""\Kevin Jennings, head of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Netword, is to have told the Times, ""Ex-gay messages have no place in our nation's public schools.""\All of this should make us wonder about public education. Is it truly public and is it education? Are there any attempts in the Stevens Point schools to tell young minds that such a group as this Ex-gay caucus exists? That people do leave homosexuality? If not, why not?\Dan Schobert\Plover\Not all proud of `Day Out' event\I'm responding to your article dated 7/27/04: ""Point community proud to host Day Out event."" My heart goes out to gays. Even though I am not a lesbian, I was ashamed of what I believed and afraid of what others thought. Wanting to please everyone but in the process losing my own identity and forgetting who I am; a Christian. I'm no longer ashamed. For so long I've been passive, accepting immorality, afraid to take a stand. Today I am taking a stand. I'm so blessed to be apart of the Stevens Point community, but I can not in good conscience accept the fact that the Stevens Point Journal assumes that all of us support the gay and lesbian's ""Day Out event."" I am not a proud supporter of this event!\There is a call out for Christians to stand for righteousness in our nation. In the process of immorality becoming socially accepted we are losing all that this country stood for. Nations have been destroyed by greed. In Scandinavia, marriage went from being between a man and a woman to: same sex marriage to: marriage being distasteful. Taking a stand is not aggression but expressing the truth. Becoming a solution provider, not problem makers, finding the balance between being loving while still speaking out against unrighteousness.\I thank God for the pastor he has given our church and this community, a man of integrity that stands for righteousness, and speaks the heart of God. America needs more leaders like him and normal people like us to not be passive and stand. And yes, sometimes it hurts but look at the persecution that faced the leaders who signed the Constitution of the U.S. In America we are not currently persecuted for what we believe, but it could happen, look at Canada. I was so proud of my daughter when she took a stand against abortion by doing a speech last year at a public school. She was afraid, but she knew what was right. Remember, nations are destroyed because good men (women) do nothing.\Julie Worzella\Stevens Point"
8,"Gannett Washington Bureau\WASHINGTON -- Rep. Steve Kagen is a hero in the eyes of at least one group dedicated to protecting the environment. The Appleton Democrat voted 100 percent of the time for the environment over the past year and a half, according to a scorecard released Wednesday by Wisconsin Environment.\""He supported new investments in clean energy and conservation efforts to protect the Great Lakes for future generations,"" said Dan Kohler, director of Wisconsin Environment. ""We are pleased to honor him for his commitment to protect our state's natural heritage.""\Along with Kagen, Reps. Tammy Baldwin, Ron Kind, Gwen Moore and Dave Obey, and Sens. Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl, also scored 100 percent on the 2009 scorecard compiled by Environment America, a federation of 28 state-based groups, including Wisconsin Environment.\The group based its scoring on 15 votes in the House of Representatives, including the cap-and-trade bill passed last June, and seven in the Senate.\Baldwin, Kagen, Kind, Moore and Obey were among 144 House members who made the ""champions"" list for their 100 percent scores. Feingold and Kohl were among 40 senators on the list.\Lawmakers who did not vote for the environment on any of the measures -- there were 26 senators and 17 House members -- were labeled ""natural disasters.""\The scoring typically broke down along partisan lines, with Democrats receiving the highest scores and Republicans the lowest. All five Wisconsin lawmakers who scored 100 were Democrats.\None of the state's three Republican House members -- Tom Petri, Paul Ryan and James Sensenbrenner -- made the ""natural disaster"" list. Petri scored 40 percent, while Ryan and Sensenbrenner each were at 13 percent. None could be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon.\Kohler said the scorecard gives Wisconsin voters a glimpse into how their lawmakers feel about protecting the air, the Earth and water.\As for the partisan divide, Kohler said: ""You can't help but quickly see that.

In a time of economic stress, it is imperative that we not forget about our environmental problems. If we fail to do this, we will face a bigger predicament once the economy turns around. We will find ourselves trying to adapt to the sobering, bleak world we have created through our neglect.
\
The most popular piece of legislation for the environment that is getting the most support is the Cap and Trade Bill. This bill would sell credits to big emitting companies that would allow them to keep spewing emissions as much as they do, but the money earned from them buying the credits would go back to repairing the environment.
\
Many of the organizations I interviewed said that the biggest things we need to work on is our consumption levels and how much this country emits so we can slow global warming and climate change. As we live our day-to-day lives, we do not realize how much we consume.
\
""The average Google search takes enough energy to heat a cup of tea,"" stated Laura Loomis, executive director of the National Parks Conservation Association.
\
We also fail to see that almost every family is consuming just as much as our own, and that everything we do adds up.
\
""It's what's consumed, what's utilized, our nature of transport. Everything from electricity use to the type of light bulbs, you name it,"" said Scott Hajost of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. ""There is a broad litany of things in which one can actually make a difference.""
\
The United States is one of the largest emitters in the world, alongside China and India, and if we do not change, the future for our children and grandchildren will not be bright. We also need to work on International Conservation Policy, which would attempt to get other big emitters, such as China, on board to reduce their emissions.
\
While in Washington, D.C., I became aware of many issues that will affect the quality of our lives if we are not more aware of our impacts on the environment.
\
First, I am fully convinced that global warming and climate change are happening. Evidence is in the rise in sea levels and the rapid growth of endangered species.
\
Second, I am worried about water quantity and quality for future generations.
\
""Basically we are putting too much into the ocean, whether that's runoff or plastics, or waste,"" said Jennifer Palmer, International Union for the Conservation of Nature. ""We are taking too much out, we are over-fishing way beyond our means of a sustainable market--and then we are not doing too good of a job protecting the edge (the coasts). The costal habitats are really important places for the ecosystems.""
\
Finally, there is a concern about the loss of biodiversity, which directly affects our way of life.

10,"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Steve Kagen, D-Appleton, is a hero in the eyes of at least one group dedicated to protecting the environment.\Kagen voted 100 percent of the time for the environment over the past year and a half, according to a scorecard released Wednesday by Wisconsin Environment.\Along with Kagen, Reps. Tammy Baldwin, Ron Kind, Gwen Moore and Dave Obey, and Sens. Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl, also scored 100 percent on the 2009 scorecard compiled by Environment America, a federation of 28 state-based groups, including Wisconsin Environment.\The group based its scoring on 15 votes in the House of Representatives, including the cap-and-trade bill passed last June, and seven in the Senate.\Baldwin, Kagen, Kind, Moore and Obey were among 144 House members who made the ""champions"" list for their 100 percent scores.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The writer is addressing the question, Is drilling into America's restricted oil and gas reserves the best way to achieve energy independence?
\
It's too bad that Theodore Roosevelt is not alive today to witness the grotesque policies of the Republican Party toward the environment and the sloganeering of GOP pin-up girl Sarah Palin in howling ""Drill, baby, drill!"" The conservationist and environmentalist Roosevelt would be comforted that he eventually ditched the greedy and corporatist Republican Party to run for president as the candidate of the progressive Bull Moose Party.
\
Once again, Republicans in Congress are attempting to open up pristine Arctic wilderness areas in Alaska, as well as Florida coastal marine areas of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico to the environmental destroyers of Big Oil and Gas.
\
And if Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., has his way, he will compromise with Republicans like Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona on offshore drilling in order to see a carbon cap-and-trade bill passed. It appears that Kerry waffles on the environment as much as he does on U.S. military engagements overseas.
\
Rather than adopt a policy of steering the world's energy demands away from carbon fuels like oil and coal, the Republicans, aided and abetted by wafflers like Kerry and conservative ""Blue Dog"" Democrats, will erect offshore drilling platforms off our nation's most environmentally sensitive coasts to produce perhaps enough oil to supply the United States for a half year at most.
\
Even if the United States drills all the remaining oil and natural gas from within its economic zone, that represents a mere 3 percent of the world's known reserves. The United States, which hoggishly drinks up a fourth of the world's oil output, would continue to rely on oil imports from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Russia and its new virtual colony, Iraq.
\
After the oil and gas supplies are depleted, America's coastlines will look like the aftermath of an invasion by Star Trek's Borg: ravaged coastlines and marine ecosystems with seascapes marred by huge corroding metallic skeletons sitting atop dry wells.
\
When people are addicted, they must be weaned away from the addictive substance. The American people, rather than be sated with a finite amount of oil and natural gas for a few months in exchange for environmental damage of our nation's coastlines, must be weaned away from their gas-guzzling SUVs and pickup trucks. The Environmental Protection Agency, which recently staked an impressive claim to regulate global warming gasses in the continued absence of congressional action, must get even tougher on the unholy alliance of Big Auto and Big Oil.
\
While small-minded propagandists harp over leaked e-mails from Britain's University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit and suggest that the e-mails--some from 10 years ago--prove a global climate change conspiracy of scientists, records from NASA and the U.S. National Climate Data Center prove that rising temperatures are contributing to global glacier retreat, the disappearance of permanent Arctic sea ice, and the rise of the world's oceans.
\
Prince Albert II of Monaco, who heads up a foundation designed to save our beleaguered planet, recently told a National Press Club newsmaker luncheon about personally witnessing the effects of global climate change during visits to the Arctic and Antarctic.
\
The prince also noted that his great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert I, who was an early proponent of ocean conservation, took a photo of a glacier in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in 1906. On a recent trip to Svalbard, Albert II said the same glacier has retreated more than 4 miles since 1906.
\
The supporters of unrestricted offshore oil and gas drilling want to avoid the uncomfortable, massive evidence of global environmental collapse by clinging to cheap bumper sticker slogans like ""Drill, baby, drill!"" It's time for the Obama administration and Congress to put politics aside and stand steadfast on environmental principle like Teddy Roosevelt's Bull Moose.

The hard work is done. Now, the harder work begins. Last week, the Governor's Task Force on Global Warming completed 16 months of labor by voting on a series of measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 22% by 2022 and 75% by 2050. Now, it's up to Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature to turn those recommendations into policy. They need to start that work soon.
\
Perhaps not every recommendation needs to be enacted or enacted exactly as the task force recommended. But the overall thrust of the recommendations is in the right direction and a necessary response if Wisconsin is to do its part to meet the challenge posed by climate change. And, as the editorial below notes, the state should do all it can to achieve those goals earlier.
\
The best response, of course, would be a sustained and aggressive international and national effort, but Wisconsin can become a leader on climate change, thanks to the work of Doyle's task force under the leadership of co-chairs Roy Thilly and Tia Nelson.
\
The task force recommended 63 policies to achieve the recommended emissions. Broadly, it calls for reduced dependence on coal and foreign oil, a serious increase in energy efficiency and expanded power from wind turbines and other renewable sources.
\
Among its recommendations: expanding the current Focus on Energy conservation program and encouraging other energy-efficiency tools; building wind turbines on the Great Lakes; expanding mass transit, including commuter rail from Kenosha to Milwaukee; establishing more stringent emission standards for vehicles; increasing the availability and use of renewable biomass and biofuels; relaxing limits on the construction of nuclear power plants once certain conditions are met; and participating in a regional or national plan to cap emissions and reduce them over time by allowing parties to trade in emission credits.
\
Some of those goals will be easier to achieve than others. All of them deserve a healthy debate, especially the recommendations on nuclear power and a cap-and-trade system.
\
Only this much is sure: The state needs to seriously address climate change issues, and the task force has given the state a good starting point for doing so.

One of the objections to seriously addressing global warming is the cost. Some critics argue that curbing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will bankrupt companies, create an unreliable electricity network, drive families into the poorhouse and generally ruin the economy.
\
There is no doubt that there will be a cost and that some sacrifice will be required. And it's true that many Americans today don't handle sacrifice very well. But the evidence produced by a United Nations panel and other scientists leaves little doubt about the reality and the seriousness of the threat, a threat that both presidential candidates appear to have taken to heart, unlike the current occupant of the White House.
\
But there is also an opportunity here to create a new economy that provides jobs at the same time that it reduces emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, a significant portion of which come from a volatile part of the planet. And if the country acts now to create that economy, it would be ahead of the curve and could take the international lead in providing a brighter future for the planet.
\
The opportunity lies in creating more green jobs -- many of which people already know how to do -- to use energy more efficiently and build the technologies that, from biofuels to wind turbines, could curb climate change.
\
That economy is in the process of being created, and among the builders are key companies in southeastern Wisconsin, such as Johnson Controls in Milwaukee, which has been doing excellent business in energy efficiency. Green jobs were the subject of recent conferences in Milwaukee and at Racine's Wingspread conference center. Nationally, the Blue Green Alliance -- a joint venture of the United Steelworkers and the Sierra Club -- is campaigning for green jobs and energy independence.
\
We hesitate to use the New Age concept of harmonic convergence, but something does seem to be happening across the country at a number of levels.
\
Even more of the same is needed.
\
Among the immediate priorities:
\
- Congress needs to pass this year the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. The bill would extend federal tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies that have expired or will expire at the end of the year.
\
In a recent meeting with the Editorial Board, representatives of the Blue Green Alliance said that 100,000 jobs could be lost at the end of the year if the tax incentives and credits aren't extended. The bill would extend for another eight years investment tax credits for installing solar energy and would extend for one year the production tax credit for producing wind power. It also would extend for three years credits for geothermal, wave energy and other renewables.
\
- Federal renewable energy standards should be stepped up. In Wisconsin, the Governor's Task Force on Global Warming has recommended a series of measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 22% by 2022 and 75% by 2050. Those are reasonable goals, but the closer the nation can come to Al Gore's 10-year goal of producing all electricity from sources that don't produce greenhouse gases, the better off it will be.
\
- The federal government needs to set a clear cost for carbon emissions, either by taxing such emissions directly or establishing a cap-and-trade system that would cap emissions and reduce them over time by allowing parties to trade in emission credits. Such a system was proposed by the governor's task force. Whether such a system is better than a straight tax on emissions deserves a thorough debate, but, either way, affected industries need stability on the regulatory front.
\
- Governments at all levels need to do a better job of promoting and encouraging businesses that produce green jobs.
\
As the Blue Green Alliance points out, such jobs aren't necessarily something new, although they could be.
\
Electricians, steam fitters, plumbers, sheet metal workers and heating, ventilation and air conditioning workers will be needed to retrofit buildings to make them more energy efficient.
\
Steelworkers will be needed to build the blades and towers needed for wind turbines and the stainless steel needed for biomass refineries.
\
Workers will be needed to erect the turbines and to install solar panels; engineers and researchers will be needed to further develop and capitalize on technologies such as biofuels and biomass.
\
According to a report released in June by the alliance, increased investment in energy efficiency and alternative fuels would benefit more than 340,000 Wisconsin workers, ranging from bus dispatchers to chemical engineers. The report identified 45 occupations expected to be more attractive because of six ""clean-energy"" strategies.
\
""The reason why I'm kind of fired up about doing renewable energy and solar panels and wind panels and biofuels is it opens a whole new way to create good-paying jobs,"" Tom Peplinski, an instrument electrician at the NewPage Corp. paper mill in Whiting, told the Journal Sentinel's Joel Dresang in June.
\
Peplinski said the push to go green offers opportunities for local workers with technical skills, even as older industries, including papermaking, are contracting. NewPage announced last week it was closing its Kimberly plant this month.
\
""What we're trying to do is promote a whole new economy, a green energy economy,"" said Peplinski, a local union president who has taken a leave from the mill to campaign for green jobs.
\
The prospects for that new economy are exciting and deserve the support not only of unions and environmental groups but of everyone who cares about a healthy economy and a healthy planet.

14," Environmentalists always said there would be a price to pay for all the carbon dioxide being spewed into the atmosphere. Well, now there is.\ While prized resources such as oil, gold and wheat have been traded for decades, there is a budding market for one of the industrialized world's abundant but unwanted byproducts: carbon dioxide, a gas produced when fossil fuels are burned and which many scientists believe causes global warming.\ If it succeeds, the new market for carbon emissions will reward businesses that minimize their output of this ""greenhouse"" gas. It will also benefit the environment and thereby prove, advocates say, that making green and being green are compatible goals.\ ""It's a sign of things to come,"" said Luis Martinez, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\ The only mandatory carbon emissions trading program is in Europe. It was created in conjunction with an international treaty on climate change - the Kyoto Protocol - that goes into effect Wednesday and caps the amount of carbon dioxide that power plants and fuel-intensive manufacturers in more than two dozen countries are allowed to emit.\ A similar program is scheduled to begin in 2008 in Canada, which also signed Kyoto.\ By contrast, the United States, one of the few industrialized countries that did not ratify Kyoto, is many years away from compulsory trading or nationwide caps on carbon dioxide, concepts that are strongly opposed by industry and the Bush administration.\ However, nine Eastern states are developing a regional cap-and- trade program that will require large power plants from Maine to Delaware to reduce their carbon emissions and California is attempting to place greenhouse gas limits on automakers.\ Separately, a small group of companies has voluntarily agreed to cap their carbon emissions in the United States as part of an experimental market that is based in Chicago.\ ""We believe that at some point in the United States there will be mandatory legislation,"" said Bruce Braine, vice president of strategic policy analysis at American Electric Power Co., a large power producer and one of the founding members of the Chicago Climate Exchange, or CCX. Other members include chemicals giant DuPont Co., computer manufacturer IBM Corp. and electronics maker Motorola Inc.\ Under the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, some 12,000 industrial plants will be granted a limited number of emissions allowances, or credits, equaling the amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit.\ Companies that exceed their limits must purchase credits to cover the difference, while those that produce less carbon dioxide than they are legally permitted can sell surplus credits for a profit.\ Companies can trade directly with each other or through exchanges located throughout Europe.\ By giving the private sector a financial incentive to make their operations more environmentally friendly, proponents believe the market-based approach will accelerate investment in emissions- reduction equipment, create positive reinforcement from investors and spur technological innovation.\ ""We're confident that once people get used to managing carbon in their businesses it will be successful,"" said David Hone, climate change adviser at Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which has 46 facilities across Europe that will be regulated under the cap-and-trade system.\ Hone said his optimism is based in part on the success of the cap- and-trade system the United States designed more than a decade ago to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, which cause acid rain. The U.S. sulfur dioxide market, on which the EU's carbon market is based, is widely praised for accelerating emissions reductions at a lower cost than originally anticipated by industry.\ But environmentalists and executives said there is much more at stake when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions, both in terms of the ecological benefits and the potential costs to industry.\ ""Carbon is the mother of all environmental commodities,"" said Richard Sandor, who helped design the U.S. exchange for sulfur dioxide and is now the chairman of CCX.\ The first phase of the EU trading program runs from 2005 through 2007 and the caps will be lowered from one year to the next. While detailed plant-by-plant limits are still being finalized, participants estimate that EU-wide industrial emissions will drop as much as 5 percent by 2008.\ The cost to European industry over the next three years is estimated to be a few billion dollars, based on current market prices for carbon dioxide of about 7 euros per ton, according to Ilex Energy Consulting of Oxford, England.\ Of course, companies with surplus allowances stand to profit an equal amount.\ ""Frankly, a lot of companies will be hoping that the emissions price is low so they face lower penalties from having to go out and buy allowances,"" said Andrew Nind, principal consultant at Ilex.\ ""The main concern of environmentalists is that the governments have been too generous in how many allowances they've given out,"" Nind said. The lower the price, the less incentive there is to invest in equipment that reduces emissions, he said.\ The second phase of the program runs from 2008 through 2012, by which time the European Union must lower its carbon emissions to 8 percent below 1990 levels. Canada must cut its emissions by 6 percent to comply with the Kyoto treaty.\ In the United States, carbon-intensive industries successfully lobbied against Kyoto by refuting the threat of global warming itself, and by arguing that the treaty would hurt the global competitiveness of American companies and cause electricity prices to rise.\ ""There are some notable exceptions, but on the whole it remains an ongoing battle to try to convince corporate America to deal with greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Ethan Podell of Orbis Energy, which advises companies seeking to devise long-range strategies on carbon emissions.\ U.S.-based companies that are already engaged in the issue - either because they have factories in Europe, or are part of CCX - believe early involvement could pay off down the line, in large part due to the logistical expertise they are gaining.\ CCX participants agreed beginning in 2003 to cut their carbon emissions by 1 percent per year through 2006, or 4 percent below their baseline, which is determined by their average annual emissions from 1998 through 2001.\ There is virtually no chance of federal limits on carbon emissions under the Bush administration, which is openly skeptical of the threat global warming poses. But U.S. executives anticipate a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide, at least at the state level, within the next decade.\ The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which aims to produce a preliminary market design by April, already has the support of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont."
15,"Every presidential candidate is talking tough about ending America's dependence on foreign oil.\But none of them is giving nuclear power - a proven, reliable and carbon-free energy source - the attention it deserves.\Democrat Hillary Clinton, in typical fashion, is both for and against nuclear power. She says she has ""no preconceived opposition"" to it yet expresses vague concern about safety.\Similarly, her rival Barack Obama won't rule out any energy option but insists he's ""not a nuclear proponent.""\On the Republican side, both John McCain and Mitt Romney support expanding nuclear power on paper but have so far failed to make it a campaign priority.\No matter their reasons for downplaying this vital issue, the candidates are making a big mistake. America must meet its energy needs while simultaneously inflicting the least amount of damage on the environment. To accomplish this, nuclear power is this country's best bet.\Every energy source has its downside. Coal and oil contribute to global warming and perpetuate America's dangerous obsession with the Middle East. Wind and solar technologies are far from being cost-effective. Ethanol requires large amounts of land and energy for production and has increased crop prices. Hydroelectricity can destroy fish and wildlife.\The problem with nuclear power is the radioactive waste that must be stored safely. But this is hardly the environmental boogeyman so often portrayed. Technology is making it easier to safely contain and recycle waste. And any environmental threat from nuclear waste is localized, rather than spread indiscriminately throughout the air or water like carbon-based pollutants.\Nuclear opponents regularly emphasize doomsday scenarios in which harmful radiation is released - either by accident or because of terrorism - killing thousands and irreparably damaging the environment. In reality, this is highly unlikely. Even the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union was the result of human error and lax oversight. Furthermore, the plant is a relic by today's standards.\Plant designs are getting safer all the time. Waste is stored in multi-layered steel casks capable of withstanding any plausible accident or attack. And new, post-9/11 security measures are meant to protect against proliferation and terrorism at nuclear plants.\In fact, a growing number of environmentalists, including former Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore, now advocate for more nuclear plants. They're enthusiastic because of nuclear's potential to stave off global warming and bring about American energy independence.\Currently, nuclear plants are more expensive to build than coal plants. However, a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system, coupled with the recent Supreme Court ruling that carbon dioxide must be regulated as a pollutant, will soon make fossil fuel production more expensive - and nuclear power more attractive.\Wisconsin has essentially banned the construction of new nuclear plants for nearly 30 years. Even so, Wisconsin receives about 20 percent of its electricity from three in-state nuclear plants. France, which gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, has some of the cleanest air in the industrialized world and some of the cheapest electricity costs. That should be a huge incentive to consider nuclear power as an alternative energy source in this state and throughout the country.\Unfortunately, our presidential candidates are content to stick with focus group-tested rhetoric and environmental buzzwords. Instead, they should be talking about the obvious benefits of nuclear power. What have they got to lose?\Nothing. Except, of course, our addiction to foreign oil."
16,"Among the most absurd realities of modern politics are all those polls that political parties conduct for themselves and then pass off as if they were true public opinion.\Reader Judith Landsman of Madison sent along a prime example of a ""survey"" she got in her mail the other day from Michael Steele, the chairman of the national Republican Party.\""Although I am not (and never have been) a Republican, somehow I received the enclosed survey in the mail. Glancing through it, I was horrified at its biased and leading questions, clearly designed to elicit specific responses,"" she wrote.\To be fair, Democrats do the same thing. Both parties claim to be gauging the opinions of their members and then pass it off as somehow representative of what Americans actually feel.\Here are some examples of Steele's survey: ""Should the Democrats' so-called stimulus bill with its wasteful pork-barrel spending be repealed?\""Should Republicans in Congress work to expose and eliminate new spending from Obama/Pelosi/Reid that amounts to welfare payments for Democrat interest groups?\""Do you oppose the Obama National Energy Tax, also known as 'cap and trade,' which would skyrocket your utility bills and destroy jobs while having virtually no impact on the environment?\""Should Republicans fight against judicial nominees who bring a personal, left-wing agenda on social issues to their jobs as judges?\""Should we fight military-cutting efforts in Congress, such as the proposal from liberal Barney Frank to slash the Pentagon budget by 25 percent?""\Obviously, few dyed-in-the-wool Republicans are going to say ""no"" to any of those questions. When the results are tabulated, the party will insist that the answers reflect the mood of the country, when in truth they represent already pre-conceived notions.\What they are aimed at doing, though, is raising money. The survey comes complete with a handy contribution form where you can send anywhere from $25 to $500 to help the party fight for your views.\Oh, if you are unable to send a contribution now - perhaps you lost your retirement savings when the Bush administration declined to keep an eye on the Wall Street gamblers - hopefully you will enclose just $12 ""to cover the cost of tabulating my survey.""\Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com Posted in Dave_zweifel on Monday, November 16, 2009 5:00 am Updated: 8:47 am.\Credit: Dave Zweifel| Capital Times editor emeritus"

""The effects of climate change present growing economic, social and environmental risks in the Midwest and the world. ... We must begin to take action now.""\Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle, as well as the governors of Minnesota, South Dakota, Iowa and Michigan plus Gary Doer, premier of Manitoba, performed a symbolic signing Thursday in Milwaukee. Not all states in the association have agreed to every part of the two deals.\One agreement calls for developing a cap-and-trade mechanism to reduce greenhouse gases. Under that system, businesses that don't meet the goals would be able to obtain credit from ones that do.\Establish goals\The plan calls for laying out concrete goals within the next eight months and establishing the cap-and-trade system within a year, with the entire agreement implemented within 2 1/2 years.\Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Manitoba, Michigan and Minnesota agreed to that deal, according to an association ballot circulated among the states. Indiana, Ohio and South Dakota have agreed as observers.\Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland believes the federal government should deal with greenhouse gases, not the states, his spokesman said.\South Dakota Gov. Mike Rounds said he wants to understand the costs to energy consumers and producers before signing. ""We're not convinced we have in front of us the answers we can all agree to,"" Rounds said.\Under the other pact, biofuels produced in the Midwest and other low-carbon fuels would make up at least half of all transportation energy consumed in the region by 2025. A third of retail gas stations in the region, or about 10,000 stations, would offer the ethanol-based gasoline E-85 by that year.\Thirty percent of electricity in the region would come from renewable sources by 2030. All new coal plants would capture and store carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, and a multijurisdiction pipeline would be permitted by 2012 to move carbon dioxide captured from new plants to a reservoir.\The deal calls for working groups, state officials and gubernatorial and premier staffs to being making recommendations early next year on how to reach those goals.\Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Manitoba, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio agreed to all parts of that pact, according to the ballot. Other states agreed to parts.\""If we continue on with the status quo, we are in serious, serious danger in terms of quality of life,"" Doer said.\Economic opportunities\Doyle, a Democrat, praised the deals, saying they would create ""enormous"" economic opportunity for Midwestern energy researchers and manufacturers.\But some Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature are skeptical.\""I don't like the idea of Wisconsin getting involved in that sort of thing,"" said the Senate GOP caucus chairman Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, who called man-made global warming a ""hoax.""\He said if the federal government thinks global warming is a problem, it should address it. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, said the accords could serve as a national model.\""In the not-too-distant future, we want to see national improvement and we hope the states can lead the way,"" Pawlenty said.\Republican Minnesota state Sen. Michael Jungbauer called the accords a ""boondoggle"" and criticized Pawlenty for being part of it.\He accused Pawlenty of focusing on a politically popular issue at the expense of more pressing concerns such as transportation.\""I'm mad as heck at our governor for implementing policies that cost a lot of money,"" Jungbauer said. ""There's no cost-benefit analysis and really what they end up being is huge tax increases.""\Doyle spokesman Matt Canter said the state Legislature would likely need to approve aspects of the accord, but not necessarily the greenhouse gas limits.

18,"About these columns\These columns, written by Custer-based Midwest Renewable Energy Association, compare and contrast each presidential candidate's proposals for renewal energy. The MREA promotes renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable living through education and demonstration.\Obama: Federal government should push for renewable sources\Over the past few years, we have seen energy take center stage as a national issue, and it has become a major topic in the presidential campaign. The two presidential candidates agree that global climate change is happening, but the debate centers on what should be done to address it. Below is an overview of some aspects of Democratic Sen. Barack Obama's energy plan:\Offshore drilling\Obama generally opposes opening additional U.S. waters to offshore oil drilling, but says he would consider it as part of a comprehensive energy plan.\What's missing? The offshore drilling issue is complex, with impacts on the economy and environment. It has the potential of releasing methane into the atmosphere, which is about 20 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Allowing additional drilling will not guarantee that oil companies will sell the oil in the U.S. markets, and it may only postpone dealing with peak oil.\Efficiency\Obama supports a 50 percent reduction in energy intensity by 2030. For transportation, he supports raising fuel-economy standards 4 percent, roughly one mile per gallon, each year, and proposes spending $4 billion to help U.S. automakers upgrade their plants to produce more efficient cars and trucks.\What's missing? There is not a detailed plan on how the U.S. would reach this goal of reduction in energy intensity. Energy efficiency in buildings, appliances, vehicles and utilities is the quickest and cheapest way to reduce global warming pollution. In your home, for example, for every dollar you spend on energy efficiency, you'll save three dollars on a renewable energy system.\Emission limits\The candidates agree in principle that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions should be pursued through a federal cap and trade system, but they differ on limits. Obama would require carbon dioxide emissions be cut by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. Polluters would pay for the right to emit greenhouse gases.\What questions remain? Because of the complexity of a cap and trade system, this may take years to implement, which is time the planet cannot afford. Some argue a cap and trade system will add to the volatility of energy prices, will not be as transparent as a federal program such as carbon tax, and according to an article in The Financial Times, may leave room for private market manipulation.\Alternative energy\Obama supports a federal renewable energy standard, which would mandate getting 25 percent of U.S. electricity from renewables by 2025. To help meet this mandate, Obama proposes investing $150 billion over 10 years in renewables, advanced biofuels, efficiency and other clean technology. He proposes federal tax incentives and other inducements to help develop advanced biofuels.\Other power sources\Obama supports ""clean coal"" technology. Obama would consider a ban on new, traditional dirty coal facilities. Obama said the U.S. should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix, but is concerned with safety, storage and the reliance on government subsidies.\What concerns remain? We need to evaluate the realistic options of increasing coal and nuclear power. Consider the impacts of extracting coal from the earth, and other pollutants (such as mercury) that are emitted into our air and water. There are contentions that if the U.S. decided to replace all fossil-fuel-generated electricity with nuclear, there would only be enough economically viable uranium to fuel reactors for only three to four years.\Bottom line\Many of these energy issues are complex, and have no simple solution. They cannot be understood through a 30-second sound bite, or even a 600-word column. We encourage you to research more about national, state and local energy policies, but also learn more about what you can do in your own home or business.\McCain: Supports boost in wind, solar, biomass energy\The presidential candidates -- Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) -- say a lot of the same things about energy and environmental policy. While their goals may sound similar, the candidates would pursue different paths to achieve them. Below is an overview of some aspects of McCain's energy plan:\McCain's policy puts a lot of options on the table, while he generally steers clear of federal incentives or mandates and favors a more market-based approach.\Emission limits\The candidates agree, in principle, that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions should be pursued through a federal cap and trade system, they differ on how much should be limited. McCain supports a cap-and-trade system to cut U.S. emissions 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. He would give away emission credits at the start of his plan, and would phase in auctions of credits.\What questions remain? Because of the complexity of a cap and trade system, this may take years to implement, and some argue creates a non-transparent private program that is not accountable to the public.\Offshore drilling\McCain wants to lift the current federal moratorium on offshore drilling and provide incentives to states permitting offshore exploration. He had opposed new offshore drilling up until June 2008. Both candidates are against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\What's missing? Lifting the federal ban on offshore drilling will bring its own economic and environmental issues. When drilling deep enough, it has the potential of releasing methane, which is about 20 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. It may not do enough to address peak oil. According to McCain on May 28: ""I also have to tell you that, with those resources which would take years to develop, it would only postpone, or temporarily relieve our dependence on fossil fuels.""\Alternative energy\McCain supports increasing the use of renewable energy such as wind, solar and biomass. He has shown reluctance to support mandates or tax incentives, and does not support a national renewable energy standard, which would require utilities to get a certain percentage of electricity from renewables. He supports efforts by state and local governments to create their own standards.\McCain proposes to eliminate mandates, subsidies and price supports for corn ethanol, which he contends prevents the development of market-based solutions.\What's missing? McCain supports renewable energy, but has not offered specific target. Without a detailed plan, or support for the industry, it may be difficult to move the technologies forward.\Efficiency\McCain has offered general support for energy efficiency. He said he would more effectively enforce existing fuel-economy standards. In 2007, McCain said the standards should be raised, but his plan does not offer specific targets.\What's missing? There isn't a detailed plan on how the U.S. would encourage energy efficiency and curb consumption. Energy efficiency is the quickest and cheapest way to reduce global warming pollution.\Other power sources\McCain wouldn't restrict new plants, but believes they should be able to use carbon capture and sequestration technology. He would spend $2 billion a year to help develop clean-coal technologies. McCain recently called for 45 nuclear reactors by 2030, and calls for government support for the nuclear industry.\What questions remain? Policy makers should take time to consider the front-end impacts of coal extraction, and the other pollutants coal plants emit. Nuclear, already heavily subsidized by the federal government, would need more support, and brings its own concerns of energy use, water use and safe storage.\Bottom line\With energy prices rising and a heightened concern about global warming, national policy makers (and the presidential candidates) are under pressure to take action. We encourage you to research the details of the candidates' energy policies, and learn more about what you can do in your own home or business.

20,"Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin says a cap-and-trade system - which would limit total greenhouse gas emissions but allow energy users to buy and sell the right to spew out heat-trapping gases - will be the cornerstone of U.S. efforts to halt global warming.\Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says that cap-and-trade is more dangerous than climate change itself.\These two Wisconsin members of the U.S. Congress presented their widely varying views during separate speeches at the Future of Midwest Energy: Coping With Climate Change Conference presented by Wispolitics.com at Monona Terrace on Monday.\Some others at the conference favored a carbon tax or price that would lead to a meaningful reduction in the use of fossil fuels. Some favored more nuclear plants. But most panelists stressed that quick action by Congress is essential.\Aging power plants could be replaced with cleaner, more efficient models, but owners hesitate to spend millions of dollars without knowing federal policy, said Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member Philip Moeller. ""The uncertainty has to be addressed,"" he said.\""We all know that global warming is real and that it's an issue we should take seriously, but we should also approach global warming wisely,"" Sensenbrenner said.\""In Congress, there is clamoring for a legislative solution and some members think they've found one in a cap-and-trade solution. What they've found is a job killer.""\Under cap-and-trade, a total limit would be placed on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions, and economywide allocations would be given or sold to emitters. Companies that are able to keep their emissions under their allocation could sell their savings, or credits, to companies that could not.\The total cap would be reduced over the years to reduce the greenhouse gases that trap heat near the Earth.\The result, according to Sensenbrenner, would be soaring electricity costs and the loss of jobs to China and India or other countries that do not reduce emissions.\""We cannot use the actions - or inactions - of developing nations as an excuse for our behavior,"" Baldwin said, adding that Congress is moving toward cap-and-trade. She also promised that a climate control law will include a provision to encourage developing countries to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\""What is clear is that we are laying the groundwork for the 111th session and our 44th president whom, I believe, will lead the nation toward solutions that reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.\""Whether Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain or even Mike Huckabee is president, with a Democratic Congress climate change will be acknowledged and confronted with mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions.""\Sensenbrenner alleged that cap-and-trade has not reduced carbon emissions in Europe because carbon credits are often awarded there based on emissions reductions in other parts of the world, sometimes for projects that would have occurred anyway.\""Many European nations are simply outsourcing their greenhouse gas reductions to other nations,"" he said. ""The U.K. estimates that two-thirds of its future emission reductions will occur not just outside of the U.K. but outside of the European Union.""\Sensenbrenner contends that the solution to climate change lies in technology, and that the United States should devote its efforts to research and development of technological solutions.\""Significant greenhouse gas reductions will occur only when the technology is readily available and relatively inexpensive,"" he said. ""That includes renewable technologies like wind and solar power. But that should also include proven greenhouse gas-reducing technologies like nuclear power, which supplies about 20 percent of Wisconsin's electricity.""\Baldwin said that extending tax credits and investment tax credits for renewable energy sources is essential, as is reducing subsidies for the oil industry.\She added that state and regional efforts - including those in Wisconsin led by Gov. Jim Doyle that have set timetables for increasing the use of renewable energy - are leading the way toward control of greenhouse gases.\""Our state government, municipalities and schools are taking meaningful steps,"" she said. ""Gaylord Nelson would have been proud. He knew it would be the people, not the politicians, who put the environment on stage.""\aweier@madison.com"
21,"Gannett Washington Bureau\WASHINGTON -- The August uproar over health-care reform almost muted public discourse over global warming, a climate phenomenon that holds serious implications for Wisconsin and the rest of the nation.\But the health-care din hasn't quelled the fight among supporters and opponents of a House bill dealing with energy and climate change as combatants anticipate consideration of a similar proposal in the Senate soon after lawmakers return from their summer break.\The central goal of the House bill is a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, based on 2005 levels. Scientists say those emissions -- carbon dioxide is the most prevalent -- are warming the Earth and, if unchecked, could lead to catastrophic environmental consequences.\To reach its goal, the House bill would establish a cap-and-trade system in which polluters could buy credits from nonpolluters. The House bill also would require large utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity through renewable fuels.\In recent weeks, the oil lobby and a manufacturers trade group ignited a campaign in the Mountain West and Midwest protesting that the House legislation would be a job killer.\Environmental and labor groups have countered with a ""Made in America"" tour to highlight the green jobs they say would be created.\While cap-and-trade has been the major point of contention, environmentalists and some energy industry groups are pushing for a Senate bill that would have a stronger renewable-electricity standard than what has been discussed.\In an Aug. 28 letter, several Wisconsin environmental groups urged Democratic Sens.

24,"A report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a few weeks ago provides a sobering assessment of the impact global warming could have on the climate and has prompted government officials, environmentalists, and even some of the most skeptical conservatives to sit up and take notice. Now, the question on most everyone's mind seems to be shifting from a rhetorical one, ""is global warming real,"" to one with a growing sense of urgency, ""what should we do about global warming?""\While Gov. Jim Doyle is forming a task force on global warming to develop recommendations to deal with this phenomenon here in Wisconsin, the major problem is that there will be a significant time lag to develop a long-term plan to address a very immediate problem.\Fortunately, there are steps Wisconsin-based companies can take now to begin formulating a strategic plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, along with developing the means to measure, verify and certify the emissions reductions.\The IPCC report, which provides an assessment concluding that human activity is having a major influence on climate change, warns that ""continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system.""\In response to the growing evidence of climate change, the European Union has begun a ""cap-and-trade"" system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is the same approach used in the 1990s by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to significantly reduce the emissions causing acid rain.\Massachusetts, New Hampshire and most recently California are among the states in the U.S. establishing their own cap-and-trade programs. The cap-and-trade protocol controls a company's or utility's right to emit greenhouse gases by setting a cap or limit on emissions, but lets each entity trade emissions allowances to meet compliance caps. This system provides flexibility to participants with differing abilities to reduce emissions in a cost-effective manner.\The cap-and-trade approach works because it provides certainty - companies have a specific emission target - and because free markets are the most efficient way to reward innovation.\For Wisconsin companies, the Chicago Climate Exchange offers a voluntary cap-and-trade system they can join that represents the only emissions registry, reduction, and trading system for all six greenhouse gases. The exchange is a self-regulatory, rules-based exchange designed and governed by members representing business and industry across North America. Members make a voluntary, legally binding commitment to reduce emissions or to use the exchange to buy emission credits if they do not.\A market-based system like the cap and trade system used by the climate exchange has two added benefits: It creates new revenue sources for companies clean enough to sell credits, and it enables free markets to determine the best solutions, rather than having governments bet on the next big innovation or choose winners and losers among the available technologies.\Until a nationally mandated cap and trade system is in place, Wisconsin - indeed, the entire Midwest - needs to begin planning a strategy that helps mitigate the future risk of climate change. As Gov. Doyle has said, ""you just can't pretend this isn't happening anymore.""\Accordingly, the governor's task force on global warming could serve just such a function by bringing together all of the energy stakeholders: legislators, utilities, regulators, environmental groups, large industrial companies, energy policy advisors, business groups and energy service providers.\Like the energy efficiency and renewable energy task forces before it, the one on global warming must develop a viable solution.\In the meantime, Foley and Lardner, Stora Enso and Orion Energy Systems are the only Wisconsin companies who are current members of the climate exchange.\However, several large industrial companies in the state are considering joining. In the meantime, Wisconsin companies are missing many large-scale emission reduction opportunities that can be achieved cost effectively through pragmatic energy-efficiency initiatives.\Wisconsin's economic development and environmental future may very well depend on developing thoughtful plans to control greenhouse gases that include Wisconsin's energy stakeholders and the business community.\But waiting for a government mandate to act - federal or otherwise - will only continue to exacerbate the problem of global climate change here in our home state.\Stephen Heins is vice president of corporate communications for Orion Energy Systems of Plymouth.

25," When Wisconsin Republican legislators told state officials this summer to hold off on a proposed mercury regulation until the federal government came up with its own rule, state Rep. Spencer Black had a quick rejoinder.\ ""Waiting for the Bush administration to protect the environment is like waiting for the Brewers to win the pennant,"" Black, a Madison Democrat, said at the time.\ Now that the Bush administration has come up with an arguably weaker plan, Black says his baseball metaphor still applies.\ ""The Brewers finished in last place,"" he said in a recent interview. ""The Bush administration approach to mercury is definitely a last-place finish.""\ Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal, power plant owners could postpone, in some cases for as long a decade, requirements that they install specific technology designed to reduce mercury pollution.\ Instead, they would be allowed to trade emissions under a national ""cap and trade"" program.\ ""The Bush administration rules are a big step backward,"" Black said. ""It won't cut down significantly on mercury from power plants. Mercury is a fairly local problem, you're not dealing with long- range transport as much. So trading between one region and another won't do much for the Midwest.""\ The state rule, proposed by the Department of Natural Resources earlier this year, would have forced Wisconsin utilities to drastically cut their mercury emissions.\ But the chairman of the Assembly Natural Resource Committee, Rep. DuWayne Johnsrud, said a state rule may not be necessary at all now.\ ""We finally got the word on what EPA will do on a national basis, which is obviously more sensible for us,"" Johnsrud, an Eastman Republican, said. ""Most of our mercury comes from outside the state.""\ Coal-fired power plants are the nation's largest source of unregulated airborne mercury pollution, sending an estimated 48 tons into the atmosphere annually. The mercury can enter the food chain and threaten public health, especially for children and pregnant women who eat tainted fish.\ State utilities are enthusiastic about the flexibility they would get in a cap-and-trade approach.\ Kris McKinney, manager of environmental policy at We Energies in Milwaukee, said his company could save tens of millions of dollars in capital costs by trading emissions. That's because buying emissions could allow the company to avoid expensive capital improvements to meet new mercury standards.\ Alliant Energy in Madison has not quantified the dollar savings from cap and trade. But spokesman Chris Schoenherr said the company has been supportive of this approach.\ ""It will allow us to reduce mercury in a cost-efficient way,"" he said.\ Ed Newman, director of environmental services for Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay, anticipated significant cost savings from the plan, but said it was too early to say how much.\ Newman said Wisconsin Public Service would more likely be a seller than a buyer of emissions credits.\ But the state Department of Natural Resources views the federal rule as inadequate.\ ""We see value in moving forward with a state requirement,"" said Jon Heinrich, a senior policy analyst in the department's bureau of air management.

28,"Efficiency supports many strategies Using energy more efficiently is a universally supported component of the policies recommended by the Governor's Global Warming Task Force. We reduce our vulnerability to the very costs that some are concerned about (renewable energy and costs from cap and trade) by eliminating energy waste now.\A highly respected study by McKinsey and Co. found that our choice as a country is to invest $520 billion in reducing energy waste, or pay $1.2 trillion to meet growing power needs.\In our study for the Public Service Commission, we found that Wisconsin has enough cost-effective potential to save the equivalent of $900 million in energy costs each year, beginning in 2012. The resulting increase in disposable income is exactly what families and businesses need in these economic times. All sectors - residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural - have substantial savings potential.\More strategically, a redoubled effort towards efficiency will slow or eliminate growth in electricity use, thereby reducing the amount of renewable energy needed as well as the amount of energy eventually subjected to some form of carbon price.\Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio currently lead Wisconsin in aggressive but realistic energy saving requirements. To remain competitive, we can't afford to leave our savings on the table.\- Susan Stratton, executive director, Energy Center of Wisconsin\Efforts should not put U.S. economy at risk\Climate change might be happening, but there is not conclusive proof that man is totally responsible. Temperatures have changed throughout the history of the world. We do need another form of energy eventually, but one that is constant. Wind and solar will never provide a high percentage of our needs.\A rapid switch away from fossil fuels and allowing India and China to proceed as usual will put this country into the deepest depression in our history. We will never recover from the loss of industry plus the huge debt that will occur. Subsidized green jobs cannot make up the difference and will only add to debt.\Our spoiled population couldn't handle this type of calamity. We'd be forced back into the culture of a developing country. Maybe that's the lifestyle we deserve, considering our lack of common sense, responsibility and sacrifice.\Let's take our time developing a dependable, affordable form of energy.\- Bill Sime, Madison\Cap and trade will hurt Wisconsin\It's clear that based on good stewardship of God's creation we should not be desecrating the planet to the disadvantage of ourselves and others, including those yet to come On the other hand, with our God-given talent and intelligence, we need to use these resources to serve mankind. Therefore:\* Given the substantial cost and the consequent limiting of the standard of living for mankind, the scientific community must be 99.9 percent certain that fossil fuel burning is causing global warming.\* The U.S. is spending billions on ""smart meters"" for houses that will allow Washington to access the information, but we don't have temperature and carbon dioxide measuring stations around the world reporting results. Some scientists say you can only look at the long term to avoid short-term variability. This is nonsense. We need to see the results of efforts made in the last five to 10 years.\* If Wisconsin politician's favor cap and trade over a straight tax, know they are for ""greenbacks"" or ""recognition"" since they know that Wisconsin more than other states will be at a disadvantage under cap and trade.\- Merle Lebakken, Stoughton\Enough evidence to compel action now\Overwhelmingly the scientific community, those without corporate funding and profit motive (and increasingly those who do have corporate funding), is speaking with one voice that man-made greenhouse gases are having significant and irreversible impact on climate.\They point to the direct and irrefutable relationship between increases in carbon dioxide and temperature over time, generally spiking with the Industrial Revolution and continuing through the present. The documentation, using ice core samples and other historical information, is clear and undeniable.\Constant, ongoing international research does nothing to dispel this evidence, and in fact reinforces it.\Those who would call for more research instead of action use as a foil the lack of consensus over the interplay of the many variables affecting climate change. In so doing, they ignore the elephant in the room - that climate change is upon us, and that we bear the responsibility for a major portion of its cause.\Sadly, even those who call for action on climate change often seem inclined to sidestep the related issue of human population growth, which virtually no one will seriously address.\- Peter Fisher, Madison\Fear of nuclear energy is holding us back\So far we have not taken climate change seriously. We have extended daylight saving time (trivial), mandated corn ethanol (either trivial or harmful, depending on which analysis you believe) and pushed wind and solar energy backed up with natural gas (inadequate).\There is a lot of ""natural gas"" (methane) available, including methane hydrates in the deep oceans. That makes for a reliable electric energy source if you don't take greenhouse gases and climate change seriously. But being ""better than coal"" just won't do if climate change is a problem.\And if you think the ""solution"" to climate change is solar or wind to generate electricity, that really means mostly natural gas, since both require backup for most of their power.\But methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Leaks and spills of it now contribute about as much to climate change as half of the coal power plants, and increased use of methane will mean more leaks and spills, not to mention the explosion hazard. And, of course, it converts to carbon dioxide when burned.\If you really want reliable electric power without carbon dioxide, there is a way that has produced 20 percent of U.S. electricity for the last 40 years causing far fewer deaths than methane.\But we'd need to overcome our fear of energy's ""N"" word to expand its use.\- Jim Blair, Madison\Less energy use is possible and painless\Your editorial implied that we couldn't cut carbon emissions without sacrifice. We disagree.\Since 1994 we have cut our own gas and electricity use by 30 percent to 40 percent without giving up anything. A highly efficient boiler, on-demand water heater, front-loading washing machine, Energy Star refrigerator and compact fluorescent bulbs had the biggest impacts. The technology is here if you consider energy consumption before every purchase.\It doesn't always cost more (our refrigerator was only $500). We save on fuel bills, and cut pollution and energy imports too. If more is needed, we are personally willing to make some sacrifices.\The level of carbon dioxide is higher than in the past 600,000 years and rising fast. Man has taken carbon that was stored for millions of years and put it into the atmosphere over a few decades.\Of course scientists can't be certain of the consequences, but the potential consequences are alarming and include rising sea levels, more powerful storms and ocean acidification and warming that could seriously harm coral reefs and other ocean life.\If we do nothing we may get the proof - but at what cost?\- Laura J. Brown and Mark N. Shahan, Madison\Save Wisconsin's future from being lost in hype\It is breathtaking how you undermine your own pragmatic and reasonable strategies for Wisconsin in a hodgepodge of climate change fear, uncertainty and doubt.\Your stated bottom line was correct - moving to cleaner energy makes sense ""regardless of climate change fears."" But you undermine your own argument by falling back on the crutch of climate change hype to support your assertions.\As for the question, we should do as your piece suggests underneath all the fear. Yes, we can benefit from clean energy research, but we are put at economic risk by changes in energy policies that are overly aggressive or insufficiently balanced.\Because there are both risks and opportunities, we must make sure that any response is crafted by our political processes.\Politics is local. Our contribution to the debate needs to be based on what's best for us in Wisconsin. We need to be engaged in the debate and not surrender our interests to idealists, demagogues or ""Chicken Littles.""\- Charles E. Dillon, McFarland\Overpopulation must be considered too\The coal-powered Industrial Revolution initiated rapid expansion of world population and an exponential growth in demand for resources and energy.\In the past 100 years, world population has increased by 5 billion people to the current 6.8 billion. In developed countries, this increase has been accompanied by an increase in per capita demand for resources and energy. The United States has about 5 percent of the world's population, but uses 25 percent of the world's energy.\Reversing or even stabilizing greenhouse gas trends will require more than development and widespread adoption of alternate energy sources. It will also require that we each make a conscious effort to reduce our energy use. We should expand the amount of land devoted to forests as trees sequester carbon and produce oxygen.\Finally we must make a conscious effort to maintain zero or even a negative population growth.\- Ron Wolfe, Waunakee\Financial incentives would make difference\If Wisconsin were really serious about seeing to the reduction of greenhouse gases emitted here, it would offer financial incentives to encourage citizens to use less fossil fuel energy in their homes and burn less gasoline by using more fuel- efficient vehicles and driving fewer miles on public roadways.\- Michael Neuman, Madison\Geothermal systems worth investigating\Wisconsin is a 65,500-square-mile solar energy collector. Due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, northern regions including Wisconsin receive much more radiant energy from April through September than during the cold, dark months.\Much of our incoming visible and infrared radiation is converted into heat and passively stored in our soils, shallow ground water and lakes.\With efficient heat pumps we could move plenty of that converted solar energy from our waters and soils into our buildings and industrial processes.\Wisconsin is blessed with shallow ground water temperatures between about 47 and 51 degrees Fahrenheit. That is cool enough for direct water-to-air heat exchangers (fan coils) to provide most of the air conditioning load without compressors and Freon. These heat pumps can be used in reverse to dehumidify recirculated indoor air.\Quit wasting so much coal, natural gas and electricity to heat and cool our Wisconsin buildings. See the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery geothermal system at www.news.wisc.edu/16110.\- Ron Renkoski, Madison\Look to our past to determine future action\In the scientific and political communities we hear ""the time for action on climate change is now."" I disagree, not only with our approach to affecting change in our environment, but also to the idea that having a strong legislative body that is relatively free from corporate interest is somehow less important than other social issues.\As the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 creeps through the Senate, each citizen needs to reflect on the evolution of our culture. Policies such as taxing carbon emissions become unnecessary when individuals are educated on healthy relations with their environment.\We need to recognize that fossil fuels are not evil and renewable energies are really not even scratching the surface of our neglect of the environment. We must look to our history and not an idealized future scenario to determine what actions to take in the present.\- Adrian Avery-Johnson, Madison\Legislature should push regulations, incentives\More pressure needs to be placed on politicians and the state Legislature for stricter regulations regarding emissions and greater incentives or subsidies for the construction of solar panel or wind turbine arrays.\And more funding is needed for alternative energy research and energy efficiency/conservation education. Also, incentives should be put in place for individual households to build solar or wind power arrays for their own use.\- Klee Vanderhoop, Madison\If we could only return to simpler times\Climate change is a natural change in the world God created. I remember as a child on the farm when summers had day after day of over 100 degrees. Then, in the 1970s, there were winters with temperatures below zero for a month.\This does not mean that we should not do all we can to conserve our planet and its resources for future generations, regardless of what the ""scientists"" say is happening.\We should strive for more energy-efficient vehicles, and more means of public transportation, even in communities the size of Fort Atkinson. Has anyone tried biking or walking to the store?\Another thing that has hurt is the lack of neighborhood stores. Everyone has to drive to get even meager staples. Today a neighborhood store is sometimes several miles across town. As much as people love the mega stores such as Wal-Mart, having them has not helped with air pollution from vehicles.\If we all had not become so greedy to ""have it all,"" there would not be so many two-income households and maybe wages and the cost of products would not have risen so much that we have to relay on China to produce the goods we ""want.""\- James L. Rinden, Fort Atkinson\Issue is social control, not climate change\People should respond to climate change by seeing it for what it really is - culture creation.\The term ""climate change"" is a joke because everyone in Wisconsin knows the climate changes at least twice a year. How else would we go from 90-degree sunny days to 20-degree snow storms?\The new culture created by this hoax crisis will have neighbors policing each other's energy usage and other activities that are not ""eco-friendly.""\This green movement is backed up by the world religion of science. Where once people said things were ""God's will,"" now they say it's science, but it's always someone giving it to you instead of figuring it out for yourself. Those who disagree or complain will be looked at with the same regard as heretics once were.\And if you want to discuss the science, then why not point out that carbon dioxide has nothing to do with temperature or that the Earth warmed and cooled naturally long before humans existed. Would we not have a far colder climate without all those ""heat trapping"" gases?\Those who are wise enough know this is all about societal control and about science or saving the Earth.\- Derek Rideout, Madison\Clean energy solutions already available\Sunday's editorial was right to crank up clean energy. Wisconsinites paid $21 billion for energy in 2007 with $14 billion leaving the state, costing us 310,000 jobs.\The good news is that we can make significant progress to reduce greenhouse air pollution by saving energy, money and jobs.\We have the solutions before us. Burning biomass instead of coal and biofuels instead of gasoline are ways to promote clean energy, according to the Cellulosic Prairie report. Wisconsin has 15 million tons of excess biomass like switchgrass, wood and crop waste and manure that could be burned to replace 15 million tons of coal - half our use.\There are many other clean energy solutions. Wisconsin grocers like Roundy's and Piggly Wiggly are reducing their energy use and using solar energy. The Didion ethanol plant separates corn kernels to feed the hungry in Africa and make fuel for us. And the Baptist Housing Ministries are insulating their housing units and using solar energy.\We can solve this problem in a way that protects our jobs and environment.\- Brett Hulsey, Madison, president, Better Environmental Solutions"
29," The U.S. House and Senate seem committed to producing an expensive disappointment for an energy bill. Here's what should happen instead.\ A federal energy policy including four key programs outlined below would provide the United States with greater energy independence at less risk to the environment.\ * A strategy to encourage new-technology cars and trucks. Transportation accounts for nearly two-thirds of U.S. oil consumption. This is where to look for a way to get the most bang for our buck in energy policy.\ The energy bill is likely to offer modest support for hydrogen fuel cells, which hold great promise for the future, and ethanol, a fuel from renewable sources that can reduce reliance on petroleum. But bolder steps are needed.\ The first step should be significant tax incentives to promote the manufacture and sale of cleaner-running, more efficient hybrid cars and trucks. Hybrids combine gasoline or diesel engines with electric motors.\ The Energy Future Coalition, a group with members ranging from the Big Three automakers to the Sierra Club, recommended a $10 billion investment in government-sponsored research and tax incentives to jumpstart the country's transition to new-technology vehicles. In contrast, the House energy bill provided $18.7 billion in tax breaks, mostly for the oil, natural gas and coal industries.\ * A fuel tax increase. An increase in the federal gasoline tax, or a new tax on fuels based on carbon content, should be adopted with new money earmarked for investment in the new technologies required to provide a secure, clean energy supply. In view of the sluggish economy, a delay in the effective date of the tax increase, and a phased-in introductory period, would be prudent.\ * A ""cap and trade"" system to reduce air pollution. The goal would be to establish a market-based strategy to cut overall air pollution by capping emissions at progressively lower levels. Companies cutting pollution beyond an established cap could build up credits. They could then sell the credits to companies unable to meet their caps. Thus, businesses would have a profit motive to cut pollution. But, businesses unable to cut pollution could preserve jobs by buying credits.\ Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., proposed a ""cap-and-trade"" plan, but the Senate rejected it.\ * A ""smart grid"" for electricity transmission. A ""smart grid,"" to be developed over the next 20 years, would employ new technologies to make the nation's electricity more secure against terrorist threats and better able to deliver power efficiently.\ The ""smart grid,' another recommendation from the Energy Future Coalition, is a bolder version of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's plan to create a nationwide electricity transmission grid - a plan at which the Senate and House have balked.\ The energy bill is now in the hands of a conference committee of House and Senate members assigned to hash out differences between bills passed by the House and Senate. The House bill was chiefly a collection of favors to the oil and natural gas industry that will cost the treasury more than it will yield in energy benefits. The Senate simply passed the same bill it passed a year ago as a ploy to let the conference committee write the legislation.\ Let's hope the next Congress can do a better job of steering the country toward a safe, clean and reliable supply of energy for generations to come."
30,"Proposal's 70% reduction goal stirs debate\Critics of a Bush administration plan to trim mercury pollution are making claims based on ""fiction,"" the nation's top environmental regulator said Wednesday.\""In a political atmosphere, talk is cheap,"" said federal Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Mike Leavitt. ""When you actually have to write rules that people live by, and spend tens of billions of dollars on, you better get it right, and we're going to get this one right.""\Leavitt's comments came at a meeting Wednesday with the Green Bay Press-Gazette Editorial Board.\The Bush administration announced in December a plan that calls for a 70 percent nationwide reduction in mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants by 2018. Coal-fired power plants are the biggest source of mercury emissions in the air in the U.S.\Leavitt left his post as governor of Utah to take over as EPA administrator in November 2003, just one month before the agency issued the proposed mercury rules.\The Bush plan has been attacked as a pullback from a tougher 90-percent reduction standard favored by environmentalists and some in Congress.\The 90 percent reduction is the subject of some dispute.\The EPA under former President Bill Clinton's administration is said to have concluded that the 90 percent reduction goal could be achieved by 2008 using the best currently available technology.\But Leavitt said Wednesday the 90-percent standard is one of several myths surrounding the proposed mercury rules.\""I have looked everywhere to find any evidence the agency or the former administration said anything about 90 percent"" without success, Leavitt said.\""They didn't even decide it was going to be a regulated pollutant until 10 days before they left office.""\""He must not have looked very hard,"" said Eric Uram, a regional representative in the Sierra Club's Midwest office in Madison.\Uram produced electronic documents bearing the EPA logo he said the Bush administration presented to utility industry officials in 2001 that spell out how the 90 percent reduction could be achieved.\Leavitt said that reductions of 90 percent in mercury emissions resulting from incineration of medical waste have been achieved, but that no simple solution exists for achieving similar goals at coal-fired power plants.\""One of the fictions that has grown up around this debate is that there does currently exist technology that will allow 90 percent reduction of mercury from coal-fired power plants across the spectrum,"" Leavitt said.\Technology for removing mercury from smokestack emissions is rapidly improving -- one reason why Leavitt said he supports a so called ""cap and trade"" provision in the new rules.\""If we don't give people incentive to try something new they're going to do, naturally, the least amount they have to,"" Leavitt said.\The cap-and-trade provision is a market-based approach to reduction that would allow polluters to buy and sell mercury pollution allowances.\Leavitt pointed to the success of a cap-and-trade provision contained in existing rules aimed at cutting smokestack pollutants that cause the acidification of waterways -- ""acid rain.""\""I look at what happened with acid rain and I say to myself, we ought to learn from that experience,"" Leavitt said.\But the toxicity of mercury pollution, Uram said, makes it a different issue.\""Cap and trade of toxic emissions under the Clean Air Act is illegal,"" Uram said. ""EPA is setting themselves up for legal challenges that will postpone implementation of this rule for years.""\Leavitt said EPA will issue final mercury rules by March 15 that he said would protect the vulnerable.\""This rule, in its final form, will concentrate on the health of pregnant mothers and children,"" Leavitt said.\But Leavitt said there is a ""100 percent certainty"" of a legal challenge of the new rules.\""You can take it to the bank,"" Leavitt said.\About mercury\Mercury is a naturally occurring element present throughout the environment.\Coal-fired power plants are the biggest source of mercury emissions to the air in the U.S. In the environment, mercury converts to methylmercury -- a compound easily absorbed into the living tissue of aquatic organisms and the fish that eat them.\Fish consumption is the chief risk of human exposure to mercury.\Mercury affects the nervous system, and causes neurological problems and learning difficulties in children exposed to it while in the womb.\The National Academy of Sciences concluded in 2000 that people are vulnerable to the effects of mercury at lower levels than previously thought, and estimated that 60,000 children born in the United States every year are at risk of learning disabilities because of exposure to mercury.\Sources: EPA and National Academy of Sciences"
31,"
Cutting carbon dioxide emissions won't be cheap, but delaying action on addressing global warming will be worse, both for the environment and the Midwest economy.
\
That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. The group is urging that the Midwest turn the challenge of energy and climate change into a competitive advantage and says enactment of greenhouse gas regulations is ""essential to the Midwest's future prosperity and competitiveness.""
\
The study released Monday by the global affairs council's energy task force said the region can tap its potential in the areas of energy efficiency and low-carbon energy production, including renewable energy, nuclear power and advanced coal-fired power plants that bury the carbon dioxide released from burning coal underground.
\
Due largely to its reliance on electricity supplied by coal plants the Midwest is more carbon-intensive than the national economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of the United States' greenhouse gas emissions and roughly 4% to 5% of global emissions.
\
That reliance on coal could leave the region vulnerable if the Midwest isn't well represented as Congress considers passing a cap-and-trade plan in the coming weeks.
\
Group develops outline
\
To help boost the region's voice, an advisory group of several Midwestern governors has developed an outline for a regional cap-and-trade system designed to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 20% between 2005 and 2020.
\
""There was a strong sense that they needed to move quickly to participate in the federal debate effectively,"" said Pat Henderson of the Department of Natural Resources, who represented the State of Wisconsin during the negotiations that produced the agreement.
\
The Midwest Governors Association advisory group has been meeting since November 2007, when Gov. Jim Doyle and other Midwest leaders signed an accord calling for a regional cap-and-trade system.
\
Opponents of a cap-and-trade program have warned of the effect on electricity costs. Opponents include a coalition of state chambers of commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, led by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state's largest business lobby.
\
Other efforts
\
In Chicago on Monday, leaders of the global affairs council's energy task force said Midwestern states also need to move ahead with efforts to boost energy efficiency, develop new energy technologies and engage regional universities in energy research and innovation.
\
John Rowe, chairman and chief executive of Exelon Corp., co-chaired the global affairs council task force that released the study Monday. Rowe said at a news conference that it's clear energy prices are going up. But strong attention to energy efficiency will help offset higher prices and could be an economic advantage for the Midwest, the report says.
\
""If you spend all your time looking for free lunch, you end up with no lunch at all, or you pay too much too late,"" he said.
\
The region should also tap its auto-industry heritage ""to make the Midwest region a national center for advanced vehicle technologies, including plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicle technology,"" the report states.
\
Other regional strengths include the Midwest's wind resources as well as the farmland and forests that could be tapped for carbon-offset projects, the report found.

Give me some unbiased research that is definitive and time-tested, not an acute knee-jerk reaction, and I'll listen.\Chad Nehring,\Suamico\URGENT: The delighted howls of global warming deniers at the revelation that some researchers can run off at the mouth in private are as fatuous as the rest of the deniers' case against reality. We'd do better to listen to the calm judgment of reputable scientists, who don't find anything scientifically significant in those e-mails. An editorial in ""Nature,"" one of the most prestigious scientific journals, said, ""Nothing in the e-mails undermines the scientific case that global warming is real,"" and Scientific American agrees that ""nothing in the stolen e-mails or computer code undermines in any way the scientific consensus ... that climate change is happening and humans are the cause."" Examples could be multiplied to show that calm expert opinion, as opposed to the hysterical propaganda of special interests, counsels us to continue our urgent efforts to save our planet from the results of our disastrously shortsighted energy profligacy.\Jon Corelis,\Appleton\BIG HOAX: Even before global warming was exposed as a hoax, anyone with the common sense God gave a broomstick knew it wasn't true. I realize Al Gore's movie ""Inconvenient Truth"" was praised and even showed to schoolchildren as fact when it wasn't. Since 1998, the Earth has been cooling. Years ago, all to the middle of North America was covered with a glacier. Where did it go? Maybe it was the dinosaurs' flatulence that melted it. One good volcanic belch spews more pollution into the atmosphere than all mankind can do (with the exception of Washington, D.C.) When the hoax was exposed, they said this coldness was a ""pause"" in warming. Oh yeah? How long? Why no mention of a ""pause"" before? These hypocrites know it's a lie, but they want the money, power and to send us back to the Stone Age.\Marion Koepke,\Center\WORRISOME: Earth is warming; human activity its major cause. Despite recent publicity, scientific evidence is overwhelming. Why worry? First, planetary systems can reach an irreversible tipping point -- think hellish Venus. More immediately, warming causes disruptions: coastal cities submerge, farmable lands become arid (think America's plains, Australian near-outback), storm patterns intensify, insect and disease habitats shift. Food, once plentiful, becomes scarce while elsewhere, former tundra or deserts flourish. Even if we are lucky and the balance nets out, millions of people will need to migrate across international boundaries. Canada might accept a few Midwesterners, but will the Aussies fare as well with Indonesia? Will Norway welcome the inundated Dutch? The Mongols the Chinese? Will we welcome Mexicans -- or they us? Today's conflicts in the Middle East or in Africa or Central Asia are but a prelude. Those who today deny global warming may not suffer, but consider your grandchildren -- and theirs.\Andy Wegner,\Winneconne\OVERBLOWN: White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had to gather input from noted American climatologists before the Copenhagen summit. I know nothing about hacking the White House computers, but, by golly, my name got on that list of scientists. I also obtained an advance copy of the president's speech he'll give on Dec. 18 before 191 world leaders. After explaining the EPA's ruling regarding the deadly nature of CO2, his tele-prompter will inexplicably say, ""However, based on the conclusions reached by noted climate researcher Steve Erbach, I can safely say to the world that the entire climate change disaster scenario is overblown. It's going to be all right. We don't need to reduce emissions. As a matter of fact, our carbon emissions are going to prevent the next Ice Age. Don't worry. Go back to your lives. There's nothing to fear, so cool it!"" I'll be writing to you from jail before Christmas.\Steve Erbach,\Neenah\UNCERTAIN: To paraphrase a quote I heard once, ""If all the scientists in the world were placed end-to-end, they still wouldn't be able to reach a decision about global warning."" During the last 15 years or so, the average temperature on Mars (where, at last count, there were no factories, automobiles or Al Gores) increased by about the same amount that Earth's average temperature did, but some scientists think that there is a different explanation for Mars' increase. In spite of the uncertainty and disagreement on the global warming subject, I do believe we should do whatever we reasonably can do to protect our planet and its atmosphere. I don't want to witness the disappearance of any island nations or coastal cities (not even Los Angeles), even though after the Fox Valley's latest snowfall, it's awfully tempting to wish for higher temperatures around here.\Roger Boisen,\Appleton\BIGGER PICTURE: My opinion is that I'll probably be dead before it's proven or matters. Thus, I asked some members of Waupaca's high school curling team about it. The consensus, from a small sample, is that the scientists on both sides present evidence that supports their view rather than conducting a comprehensive study. These students felt that the causal relationship of greenhouse gases and climate change could well be a hoax, but they were very upset about the overall amount of environmental damage that is being done and that they will inherit. Lesson: Let's look at the total damage man is doing to the environment, not focus on just one aspect that seems to be debatable.\Keith Murie, Iola\HYPOCRITICAL: Al Gore and company are bloviating hypocrites. Here's some factual information you won't get from the ""main-sleaze"" media. Get online and check Al Gore's ""Hypocrisy and Awards"" by Roger King. As far as the hypocrites attending Copenhagen, they are arriving in more than 140 private jets and utilizing more than 1,200 limos, of which only five are hybrids. Then they want to sit down and discuss global warming? Unbelievable, but a good ruse for Obama's cap-and-trade agenda. My opinion is global warming is not a threat. The people at Copenhagen are as misguided as most of their e-mails and records, and that includes the Hollywood lefties. Leonardo DiCaprio? Puleeeez. I'll believe it when I hear it from reputable sources. Obama should stay home and fulfill the promises he made. Recession and 10.2 percent unemployment? Hellooooo.\Greg Reischl,\Appleton\POLITICAL QUESTION: I don't know, and I'm not sure anyone else does, either. What I do know, however, is that one's view depends on where one's politics lean. Conservative chamber of commerce types who abhor any hint of government regulation of businesses tell us that any information pointing toward human activity being responsible for climate change is ""junk science."" Those who see great benefit in the work of the EPA and other regulatory agencies tend to believe that industrial smoke and waste affect the Earth's atmosphere, thus producing climate change. So it becomes a matter of science-schmyience. If the question was really about science, only a handful of white-jacketed nerds working in labs and sporting pocket protectors would have enough interest to voice an opinion either way on the subject. The question should be: According to your political outlook, how big of a threat is climate change?\Miles Vander Molen,\Appleton\NO THREAT: It's no more a threat today than it was 1 million years ago. The Earth's orbit and the sun have more to do with ""climate change"" than anything we puny humans can do to have any real effect on it. Cleaning up our water and air will do more for our health and serve humanity better than ""cap and trade"" would do for so-called global warming (i.e. ""climate change""). The reality of our (human) impact on the Earth's weather has been theorized but never proven through any scientific model. In fact, all ""real"" scientific models have shown human impact is, at best, minimal when tested on a global scale.\Larry Smith,\Neenah\DISRUPTIVE SPECIES: The Earth's climate is going to change. We are only here for a little while, no matter what the human ego wants to think. In other words, we are small in the course of Earth's history. Still, we are a powerful species with the ability to disrupt the natural cycle of the planet. Global warming is happening, and while we may not be able to go back, we can challenge ourselves to walk a little lighter over our world. I question why anyone would want to remain shackled to fossil fuels. Sometimes, I think we are afraid of anything new, and find the status quo easier to live with, no matter how screwed up it is, like the person who keeps a bad habit until he's too sick to cure it. Maybe it's that all too human failure of looking to the money -- as if it will matter in the end.\Julie Genisot,\Sherwood\DOLLAR DETERMINES: There are much brighter minds than mine on each side of the issue that will continue to opine on this subject, so I will leave the debate to them. I will hazard a guess, though, that this issue will ultimately be decided by the same thing that decides many issues in our daily life -- the Almighty Dollar. Many believe that preventive measures should be taken, but few will want to foot the bill. Our rich Uncle Sam is already taking steps toward mortgaging not only our children, but also their children's children. But despite all the world's woes, let's do our best to have a blessed and merry Christmas.\Ron Colling,\Little Chute\DISTORTION: When the media (including The Post-Crescent) talks about ""Climategate,"" it refers to the documents involved as stolen, implying a question of their validity. William Gray, a professor at Colorado State University, published an article at climatedepot.com. He claims these recent revelations are the tip of the proverbial iceberg on this issue. I agree with his position that there has not been an honest and broad debate on the basic science involved. Al Gore recently pointed out that one of the incriminating e-mails was 10 years old. That tells me that the distortion or ""hiding"" of this information has been going on that long. Gray says it has been 25 years. It seems that everything associated with the current administration requires immediate action. Let's have that open debate and make some common-sense decisions. It looks like a loss of sovereignty and worldwide wealth redistribution, not climate protection.\Paul Breitbach,\Kaukauna\NO DRASTIC MEASURES: We are always to be good stewards of the planet and its inhabitants, regardless of the global warming situation. However, the impact of the proposed changes to cap and trade are far-reaching and will have a great impact on our economy, both on a personal homeowner and large-scale industrial degree. (On a side note, I find it humorous that China wants a reprieve from this regulation.) In my opinion, until the research is confirmed, the current proposal should be reworked. Eliminate the energy audits and changes needed on current homes prior to resale and lessen the amount of carbon reduction required from our industries. While we do need to be good stewards to the world, we also need to be realistic in our approach and be aware of the economic impact of these regulations. This is especially true when the drastic regulations could be due to false data.\Susan Volkman,\Appleton\OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE: Scientific evidence of the contribution of human activity to global climate change is overwhelming. It's a travesty that a solid factual consensus has been politicized, sullied, degraded and swiftboated into a partisan emotional issue that disregards evidence and logic to advance special interests. Climategate is just the latest example of demonizing the messenger using contrived evidence to discredit underlying truth. The magnitude of the threat of climate change depends on perspective. While the relative rate of change is accelerating, it is unlikely that I, as an individual, will be affected to any extent during my lifetime. This is a function of my age and where I live. Humans are in no danger of extinction, but the lives of coastal peoples and those who depend on climate-sensitive agricultural production for sustenance will be impacted shortly. The carrying capacity of the Earth is being diminished to what may soon be an irreversible extent.\Steve Carroll,\Buchanan\BE LOGICAL: It appears from information being leaked lately that we have been fed a bunch of bull for the last 10 years. Al Gore sure has become a millionaire many times over and profited. But, regardless, as people of this Earth, we need to take care of our environment and do what we can to conserve, recycle, etc. We are all responsible for this wonderful world we live in, and what we do now will have a great impact on years to come. That said, this upcoming conference sure seems to be scare tactics and/or blackmail and going way too far. Maybe meeting somewhere in the middle would seem to be logical and make no rash decisions that it has to be now. Nothing wrong with gradual and logical.\Jean M. Haese,\Menasha"

THIRD IN A SERIES
\
Europe tries trade in 'hot air' to stem greenhouse gases
\
CarbonExpo relies on fickle principle of supply and demand
\
By CHARLES J. HANLEY Associated Press
\
Sunday, June 6, 2004
\
Buyers, sellers, brokers and lawyers, even ""specialists in carbon asset creation management,"" convene Wednesday on the banks of the Rhine to launch a business for a worried world.
\
CarbonExpo, in the cavernous congress halls of Cologne, Germany, is a three-day trade fair for those who would deal in carbon dioxide -- buying and selling permits to discharge the waste gas chiefly blamed for global warming.
\
This carbon trading is a Europewide effort to use supply-and- demand to control emissions and protect the climate, in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol.
\
But the supply far outstrips demand, Europeans are finding. The climate of this marketplace itself is decidedly cloudy. Advance prices have plunged by half. ""At this point, one shouldn't portray it as a liquid, vibrant market,"" said Atle C. Christiansen of PointCarbon, a research firm in Norway.
\
More than six years after governments negotiated the historic climate accord in Kyoto, Japan, the world is taking only halting steps -- not always forward, never in unison -- to follow through.
\
In fact, the Kyoto treaty itself is not yet in force because it hasn't been ratified, as required, by industrial countries emitting a total of 55% of ""greenhouse gases,"" such as carbon dioxide, that trap heat in the atmosphere that Earth otherwise would give off.
\
Russia's accession, expected this year, would clear the 55% hurdle. But even a functioning Kyoto agreement would have little impact: Its limited reductions would barely slow the greenhouse buildup, and the biggest emitter, the United States, would remain outside the treaty.
\
Scientists, meanwhile, grow increasingly concerned.
\
""If carbon dioxide had a color, if people saw the sky getting darker, people would have no problem recognizing what's going on,"" said climatologist David Pierce of San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
\
What's going on is that the world's daily output of man-made carbon dioxide, from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, is 11% greater today than a decade ago.
\
Under Kyoto, industrial nations were actually supposed to be cutting back greenhouse gas discharges, to 8% below 1990 levels by 2012. The planet, meanwhile, is warming. Global temperatures rose almost 1 degree Fahrenheit from 1981 to 1998, NASA scientists report.
\
If greenhouse emissions aren't cut back soon, temperatures could rise many degrees more, expanding oceans, causing drought, intensifying storms and altering climate in other ways, say scientists of the U.N.-organized Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
\
As the mercury rose in recent years, so did U.S. political opposition to reducing power-plant and car-exhaust emissions, imposing energy taxes or taking other steps to try to stabilize the atmosphere.
\
Higher energy and other costs would damage the economy, it was said.
\
Costs of action, and inaction
\
Economic analyses ranged widely, from a projected annual cost of $112 per U.S. family to comply with Kyoto, to $2,700 a family, with heavy U.S. job losses. Environmentalists said dire projections didn't factor in the costs -- to coastal states, agriculture and other sectors -- of doing nothing, or the job growth in new energy industries.
\
""It is hard to think of a public policy issue that is harder than this one,"" said American economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, who has studied climate's complexities.
\
But he and others say any ultimate plan must include ""cap-and- trade"" -- schemes whereby emissions caps are imposed, and companies that emit less gas than allowed can sell unused allotments to others who overshoot the target. The profit motive is expected to drive efforts and technology to rein in emissions.
\
""Market incentives on this can be enormously powerful,"" Sachs told an April symposium at New York's Columbia University, where he heads the Earth Institute.
\
Europe's ""cap-and-trade"" is by far the biggest and most ambitious.
\
""We want to demonstrate that this works, using market-based tools,"" said the European Union's environment commissioner, Margot Wallstrom.
\
Europe progressing, if slowly
\
The EU's 25 nations, whose leaders claim a ""special responsibility"" to lead on climate with Washington on the sidelines, ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 and put its provisions into European law.
\
Now, whether the treaty takes effect elsewhere or not, Europe must reduce greenhouse emissions overall to 8% below 1990 levels by 2012, via formulas distributing the burden to individual countries. It has made progress, but slowly: Emissions are 2% less than in 1990, thanks largely to big reductions in Germany and Britain.
\
To kick off trading, national governments are allocating carbon dioxide quotas to some 12,000 plants across the continent, from power plants and oil refineries to paper and cement factories.
\
Those permits and the ability to trade them, as of next Jan. 1, are what will draw company reps and technology salesmen, legal experts and would-be dealers to Cologne for CarbonExpo.
\
As national allocation plans were announced, however, the ""hot air"" market lost some of its bounce.
\
Germany's pace-setting plan, in particular, deflated expectations: In its first round, Berlin shaved just 2 million tons off current annual output of 505 million tons of carbon dioxide gas. Following the German lead, other EU governments drafted lax emissions plans.
\
With hundreds of millions of tons of quotas issued, but relatively little need for anyone to buy them, speculative prices on the carbon market slid by nearly half, from about $16 a ton of CO-2 in January.
\
Quietly, with the support of both Democratic and Republican governors, 10 states in the U.S. Northeast are developing their own regional ""cap-and-trade"" plan for power plants and carbon dioxide, to be unveiled in April.
\
Some see it as a potential ""backdoor Kyoto,"" a seed for U.S. national action -- even for carbon trading between Europe and American states -- in defiance of the Bush administration.
\
In Washington, meanwhile, a front-door Kyoto has been offered on the floor of the Senate, where Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have proposed legislation to cap U.S. greenhouse emissions at 2000 levels by 2010 and create an emissions trading system.
\
The same bill was defeated in the Senate last year by a 55-43 vote, but its supporters sense some momentum: A bipartisan House group now backs the bill, and it was supported last year by Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate.
\
The Kyoto formulas would have required the United States -- home to 5% of the world's population but more than one-quarter of its carbon dioxide emissions -- to reduce greenhouse emissions to 7% below 1990 levels by 2012.
\
President Bush rejected the climate accord as based on ""incomplete"" science and as a threat to the U.S. economy. His administration instead called for voluntary emissions reductions by industry, and continued government-funded research into climate and clean-energy and other technologies.
\
Bush also complained that Kyoto's controls didn't apply to China and some other fast-growing economies, poor nations that didn't create the ""greenhouse"" problem and were deemed unready to bear the burden now of fixing it.
\
The China question
\
China looms larger year by year as a big coal burner. Some suggest it be held to improved energy-efficiency standards, if not outright emissions caps. To help wean the Chinese off coal, some suggest the West give their nuclear-power industry more advanced technology.
\
Some at Sachs' Columbia University symposium viewed Kyoto as a distraction and ""an unattractive deal,"" in economist Geoffrey Heal's words. Sachs envisions a truly global new deal encompassing all. ""China needs to be at the table right now,"" he said.
\
Some scientists and engineers said so much time has been lost that only carbon ""sequestration"" -- technology to capture and store emissions -- can save the climate.
\
One calculated, however, that a Lake Michigan in liquid CO-2 would have to be hoarded away in the next 100 years. If nothing else, concerned citizens should act individually, said former U.S. climate negotiator Eileen Claussen.
\
""The choices you make are very important -- the car you buy, the transport you use, the washing machine you buy.""
\
MAKING A DIFFERENCE
\
Some ways to reduce carbon dioxide and other man-made gases that enter the atmosphere:
\
TECHNOLOGY
\
Energy sources: To reduce burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels, make greater use of wind, solar, nuclear power and hydropower, and electricity generated by burning biomass (plant material or animal waste); substituting natural gas for coal at power plants.
\
Buildings: Improved energy efficiency of windows, lighting, insulation, air conditioning.
\
Transportation: Better fuel efficiency in vehicles; wider use of hybrid cars combining electric and gasoline engines; development of hydrogen-based fuel-cell vehicles.
\
Manufacturing: Improved energy efficiency in factories; reduced emissions of other warming gases, such as perfluorocarbons, byproduct of aluminum production.
\
Carbon sequestration: Technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions -- from power plants, for example -- and to liquefy and store them underground.
\
GOVERNMENT POLICY
\
Taxes: Higher fuel taxes or taxes on emissions to discourage use. ""Cap and trade"": Capping emissions at industrial plants, and issuing permits for those amounts that can be traded, allowing more efficient operators to sell permits to less efficient ones.
\
Subsidies: Both subsidizing the cost of conversion to lower- emission technology in industry and removing subsidies that encourage fossil-fuel burning.
\
Energy ""mix"": Mandating, for example, lower proportions of coal- burning in power plants compared with use of natural gas or other fuels.
\
NATURAL
\
Forests: Protection or replanting of forests, which absorb carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Tropical forests are particularly important carbon ""sinks.""
\
Agriculture: Methods to reduce or capture methane emissions, a byproduct of cattle and other livestock waste; better controls on nitrous oxide emissions from nitrogen fertilizers.

CLIMATE CHALLENGE
\
Global temperatures are climbing, glaciers retreating, oceans expanding. ""It's getting dangerous,"" says a 75-year-old man watching his Pacific island beach disappear. This three-part series looks at the impact, science and politics of climate change.
\
Last Monday: The ""greenhouse effect,"" climate change, has languished on the world's agenda since the 1970s, a seemingly distant threat. But year by year, inch by inch, it is rising to the top.
\
Last Tuesday: More scientific groups have joined the chorus: Rising temperatures probably stem from man's ""greenhouse"" emissions. But cutting through the unknowns remains a challenge.
\
TODAY: More than six years after governments negotiated a climate accord in Kyoto, Japan, the world is taking only halting steps -- not always forward, never in unison -- to follow through. But even a functioning Kyoto might have little impact.

34,"On a recent afternoon, state Rep. Jim Ott sits in his office on the third floor of the Capitol. Sunlight streams in from the windows behind him and skylight overhead.\The Republican lawmaker is quick to point out that none of the lights are on. He also shares his inclination to use the stairs, rather than the elevator, to reach his office. Not wasting energy, or much else for that matter, was a lesson he learned early in life.\""I was raised in a house where you didn't have a lot of extra stuff lying around,"" said the 61-year-old from Mequon, a town of roughly 23,000 residents on the shoreline of Lake Michigan just north of Milwaukee. ""So am I against conservation? Absolutely not. The environment is a finite resource. Whether it's the natural resources we use or the air we breathe, those resources are not unlimited. We've got to take care of them.""\Taking care of those finite resources, however, doesn't mean that government needs to step in with legislation designed to protect all aspects of the environment. Like many lawmakers on his side of the political aisle, Ott doesn't buy into the notion that global warming is caused by the human consumption of fossil fuel. Instead, he cites natural occurrences, including volcanic eruptions, forest fires and a change in the strength of the sun's radiation, as other possible culprits. A lawmaker now for just over two years, Ott is making waves - and a name for himself - with a new weekly e-newsletter titled ""Hot Air Report,"" whose sole purpose is to debunk scientific theories about global warming, or as he puts it, ""the hot air"" surrounding the global warming debate.\""I think we've got an awful large portion of the population that thinks global warming is happening, we're causing it, it's getting worse and there are all sorts of dire consequences awaiting us if we don't do something now,"" Ott said. ""I see what's happening as climate change, not global warming.""\In Ott's case, he's not just another lawmaker refuting global warming. Ott has a master's degree in physical geography, which included professional training in climatology, and worked as a meteorologist for a Milwaukee television station for 30 years. He also earned a law degree from Marquette University in 2000.\""It's natural for him to take an interest in the topic and to speak out on it,"" said Rep. Mark Gottlieb, R-Port Washington. ""I think his leadership on this issue is something the Legislature is fortunate to have right now.""\Given his professional training and his current position in the statehouse, Ott has designed his Hot Air Reports to be as political as they are scientific, a slant that has not escaped his critics.\""If people understand the difference between propaganda and peer review science, they will see it for what it is,"" said Shahla Werner, director of the John Muir Chapter of the Sierra Club. ""Hot air propaganda.""\These types of comments don't rattle Ott. On the contrary, he's used to hearing them. He said it is typical of global warming proponents to throw out names like ""deniers"" for anyone who questions the extent to which human involvement affects global warming.\""With global warming, the strong believers don't want to discuss the possibility human-produced carbon dioxide isn't the main factor that they think it is,"" Ott said. ""They just want to do something about it.""\Doing something about global warming often takes the form of legislation, as it did two years ago in Wisconsin with the introduction of the Safe Climate Act. The bill would have laid the groundwork for Wisconsin to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions within a certain time frame. As a freshman representative, Ott spoke out against the bill, which quickly died in subcommittee. While that bill was defeated, Ott says the impending recommendations from Gov. Jim Doyle's Task Force on Global Warming will likely spark the next global warming-related fight at the statehouse.\Ott contends implementing policies to counteract global warming will produce few jobs and do little or nothing to cool the Earth or reduce carbon emissions. Cap-and-trade policies, for instance, would cost state firms millions of dollars, he argues. Under these plans, companies that are unable to meet their emission limits can buy credits from companies that pollute less; in effect, the buyer is paying a penalty for polluting while the seller is rewarded for having reduced emissions. Gov. Doyle has said he would support such a policy as has President Obama.\""I don't think anything an individual state does will have any impact on global temperatures,"" Ott said. ""We'd be wasting our time. Wisconsin fighting global warming is something I have a problem with.""\Rep. Spencer Black, a leading environmental advocate in the Legislature, said it is his hope that a ""very comprehensive bill"" now being drafted by members of the governor's task force will be ready to be introduced shortly. Black is prepared to hear anti-global warming rhetoric from Ott.\""Whether it's Rush Limbaugh, Jim Ott or the Exxon Mobils of the world, every state has that person or group who will speak out against global warming,"" said Black, D-Madison. ""For whatever reason, Jim has chosen that role for himself in Wisconsin.""\Black said the array of anti-global warming arguments he hears from Ott is similar to information coming from the Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based think tank that promotes putting an end to ""global warming alarmism.""\""They don't really have a consistent argument,"" Black said. ""They try to throw as much doubt as possible on the topic so we can't take action. It's reminiscent of the tobacco companies arguing against the health impacts of tobacco.""\Allowing environmentally favorable legislation to sail through the Legislature without question would only lead to problems, Ott said.\""I don't question their motives,"" Ott said. ""But I do question the results of the legislation, which would bring no benefit to the environment, cause higher taxes and the loss of jobs.""\Ott said the costs associated with cap-and-trade programs and laws that require utility companies to transition to other forms of renewable energy will be passed on to consumers. He doesn't see much hope in wind or water power, but believes the moratorium on nuclear energy should be lifted by the state.\""There are things we could be doing as alternatives to coal,"" Ott said. ""We just need to do things that make sense.""\Like he has done since the end of February, Ott will keep spreading his version of what makes sense in regard to global warming in the Hot Air Report.\""Somebody needs to tell the whole story,"" he said."
35,"This fall, for the first time in history, Congress may get serious about global warming.\The Senate Environment Committee has just begun to consider comprehensive global warming legislation, and House leaders continue to state their intention to consider a bill. It is important that our action be proportionate to the challenge and will reduce emissions enough in the next 10 years to enable us to protect future generations from the worst effects of global warming.\Will our leaders stand up and take bold action? Or will they try to pass off half-measures as progress?\Global warming has brought the Earth's climate close to critical tipping points, where only moderate additional warming could lead to dangerous consequences, such as setting in motion the disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet and Arctic sea ice.\Climate scientists warn that there is a very short window of time to begin serious emission reductions and still have a decent chance of avoiding dangerous impacts. According to the most recent science, the United States must halt increases in global warming emissions now, cut emissions by at least 15 percent by 2020, and slash emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050.\These are ambitious goals, and meeting them won't be easy. To protect our environment, our economy and future generations of Americans, we can't settle for less.\Federal global warming legislation must build on the strong actions taken by California, New Jersey, Minnesota, and other states, which have adopted emission reduction targets that are consistent with the most recent science.\Specifically, federal global warming legislation should meet the following four principles:\* Reduce emissions fast enough to avoid dangerous global warming. The bill should reduce total U.S. global warming pollution by at least 15 percent from current levels by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. These are the limits on U.S. emissions that science indicates are needed to protect future generations from the worst effects of global warming. ""We have at most 10 years - not 10 years to decide upon action, but 10 years to alter fundamentally the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions,"" stated James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in 2006.\* Ensure that any flexibility mechanisms, such as emission ""offsets,"" do not allow illusory emission reductions or otherwise undermine program goals. Offsets allow companies to exceed their pollution limits by paying sources not covered by the program to reduce emissions, such as a power company paying a farmer to plant trees to act as a permanent carbon ""sink."" Theoretically, this arrangement would yield the same global warming benefit for less cost, but offsets are fraught with problems.\For instance, a commercial facility could receive offsets for improving the efficiency with which it uses heating oil. But those efficiency improvements might have made economic sense anyway, even without the offsets. Paying for actions that would have occurred anyway will only result in illusory emission reductions.\In addition, offsets delay the transition to cleaner technology that will be needed to achieve deep cuts in emissions. In an expose of a highly questionable offsets project in China, the New York Times wrote that offsets ""encourage short-term fixes at the expense of fundamental, long-run solutions, including developing renewable energy sources like solar power.""\* Protect consumers and ease the transition to a clean energy economy by requiring polluters to pay for emitting global warming pollution. In any cap-and-trade system, the government should sell all of the pollution permits - called ""allowances"" - at an auction as opposed to giving them to polluters for free. An auction is the most economically efficient and fair approach and would create billions in revenue that could be used to transform America into a clean energy economy and provide a regular dividend or rebate to American consumers to alleviate any increases in energy costs that result from the program.\Every state that has considered this issue has decided to auction all of its pollution allowances, in part learning from the European experience, where power companies made billions in windfall profits because they were given free allowances.\* Promote a clean energy future by establishing stronger energy efficiency standards for vehicles and equipment, renewable energy standards for electricity generation, enhanced building energy codes, global warming performance standards for electricity generation and transportation fuels, and incentives for deployment of clean energy technologies. These policies are needed to work in concert with a cap-and-trade program to effectively reduce emissions. For starters, the energy bills passed by the House and Senate this summer should be merged and sent to the president before the end of 2007.\By taking a smart approach to global warming, we can reduce global warming emissions while curbing our dependence on fossil fuels and creating new economic opportunities for America. And while addressing global warming will cost money, the cost of inaction is greater: rising seas that threaten our coastal cities, more frequent droughts, more intense hurricanes, and a host of threats to public health and well-being.\We owe it to our children and grandchildren to craft a federal response to global warming that is commensurate with the challenge confronting us. Some backward-looking companies are banking on weak legislation delivered to a president who has yet to make a serious effort on one of the most pressing issues we face. Half-hearted efforts won't be enough. It will take bold steps, starting now.\Dan Kohler is director of Wisconsin Environment, a nonpartisan advocacy group based in Madison. www.WisconsinEnvironment.org"
36,"Forty years ago, we celebrated the first Earth Day. I was the environmental assistant to the late Sen. Gaylord Nelson, who founded the event and charged me to make it happen.\The project began when the former Wisconsin governor called Chuck Conconi, his press secretary, and me into his office in September 1969. He told us: ""See what you can do about having environmental teach-ins on college campuses around the country on the same day next spring.""\Sensing a tremendous opportunity on behalf of the environment, I made it my mission to transform the idea into a national success, using the senator's public visibility to drive the launch of this vast event. I worked 16 hours a day gaining media attention for the idea, then organizing the rapid response in communities, schools and campuses.\On April 22, 1970, about 20 million people participated in this country alone. Nelson was justifiably pleased. He had made protecting the environment his career, and it seemed that the USA, the world's chief polluter, was ready to lead a cleanup revolution.\But despite new pollution control agencies in the U.S. and globally, hundreds of new laws and regulations, and the growth of environmental organizations lobbying and setting cleanup goals, the ecological health of the U.S. and much of the world has gotten worse. We now face the granddaddy of all pollution tangles: the warming world climate, degradation of the oceans, decimation of tropical forests, the elimination of mountaintops by coal digging, and the loss of habitats and species. At the same time, the supply of sanitary water around the world has been squeezed by the juggernaut of human population. How long can this go on?\Indeed, the moderate environmental crisis on the first Earth Day has become a wake-up call for the human race as the event's 40th anniversary approaches. With powerful clarity, the message is coming across that something is grievously wrong. A common trouble is economic systems that are inimical to the environment and modest, efficient resource use. Even national environmental organizations often play by the system's rules, making compromises with principles as they lobby Congress for least-bad solutions.\Given the record of the last 40 years, the focus of this Earth Day should be to initiate widespread discussions on policies that break from the present environmental quagmire and respect ecological rules. The key word is ""sustainability"": practices to follow that don't endanger the planet's life-support systems.\In fact, numerous cases exist in which individuals, communities and even nations are taking steps to live in long-term harmony with the natural environment. A few examples:\* Food: Supporting farming practices that don't wear out the soil, maintaining genetic diversity, and shifting to lower-food-chain diets.\* Population: Having smaller families by using birth control.\* Transportation: Investing in technology and land-use planning to reduce the travel need.\* Residential: Shading and insulating homes and businesses to reduce heating and cooling needs.\* Energy: Investing in nonpolluting sources of energy and reducing overall energy needs.\This Earth Day urgently needs to advocate such methods for the health and safety of our planetary home. Copenhagen resulted in some initiatives, such as greater protection of forests, but it did not meet the challenge. While it is considering cap and trade and other controls on climate warming, Congress is as far from fundamental environmental reform as it ever has been. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has recently declared greenhouse gases major pollutants to regulate, but industry is already fighting the step.\Famed environmental scientist Rene Dubos said, ""Think globally; act locally."" Will the innovators and risk-takers step forward and demonstrate what Dubos meant, with his emphasis on more tender care of the Earth built on a foundation of individual and community initiatives, boldly challenging the status quo? The goal would be a sustainable quality of life, and wiser management of nature's wealth and productivity. To honor Sen. Nelson and his profound understanding of ecological limitations, the time between now and April 22 would be ideal to begin exploring such an environmentally benign system of human living.\John Heritage, of Fairfax, Va., was the spearhead on the staff of Sen. Gaylord Nelson for the first Earth Day and was editor of the U.S. EPA Magazine from 1983 to 1993.\Credit: By JOHN HERITAGE"
37,"MANITOWOC - U.S. Rep. Thomas Petri on Wednesday toured Orion Energy Systems' manufacturing facility.\Orion Energy Systems is a power technology enterprise that designs, manufactures and implements energy management systems, consisting primarily of high-performance, energy-efficient lighting systems, controls and direct renewable products for commercial and industrial customers.\Petri, R-Fond du Lac, has long been a champion of manufacturing in Wisconsin and is supportive of Orion.\""Companies like Orion - which are expanding, creating jobs and have a strong track record of innovation - are what Wisconsin needs to compete in the global economy,"" Petri said.\Recently, Orion announced it will expand its Manitowoc factory, creating 170 jobs for workers in the region. In addition to the additional jobs, the expansion will allow more energy-saving products to reach the market, which will continue to reduce the emission of toxic, greenhouse gases and protect the environment.\""We appreciate Congressman Petri's strong support, which validates what we're doing for energy efficiency, direct renewable technology, and the revitalization of manufacturing in Manitowoc,"" said Neal Verfuerth, president and chief executive officer of Orion. ""We're proud to be in Manitowoc, where the work force is second to none.""\In July, Orion was featured in a Wall Street Journal article regarding Manitowoc's resurgence of the manufacturing sector after a major company moved to Mexico in 2003, leaving thousands jobless.\Congressman Petri also has supported the idea of a cap-and-trade program in the United States to help limit greenhouse gas emissions, create economic opportunities and advance U.S. competitiveness. A cap-and-trade program sets emission limits for toxic energy production byproducts like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide.\A cap-and-trade program would allow businesses to sell unused emission allowances to other businesses that are having difficulty complying with limits.\Congressman Petri represents Wisconsin's 6th district, including Manitowoc County."

EDITOR'S NOTE: The writer is addressing the question, Should Congress restore funding for ACORN?
\
If you think Congress stripped all federal funding from ACORN, think again.
\
Though it voted to ban federal funding for ACORN--aka the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now--in September, funding for the disgraced group could resume whenever Congress stops renewing the continuing resolution containing the funding ban.
\
What's more, ACORN could receive a windfall should the cap-and-trade legislation now making its way through the Senate eventually become law.
\
In June, the U.S. House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act--better known as Waxman-Markey for its sponsors, Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts--ostensibly to alleviate global warming by mandating an 83 percent reduction in U.S. carbon emissions by 2050.
\
A similar bill, introduced in the Senate by Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts, has been approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Buried in both bills are provisions that would allocate vast amounts of federal money to community development organizations such as ACORN.
\
Members of Congress who played to public outrage by vociferously objecting to ACORN's abuses may now want to take the time to read some of the more obscure provisions of the proposed climate bills.
\
Section 264 in the Waxman-Markey bill provides up to $300 million in funding for ""community development organizations"" so they can assist businesses and others in low-income neighborhoods with ""conservation strategies, supplies and methods to improve energy efficiency.""
\
Stephen Spruiell and Kevin Williamson, writing in The National Review, help put this funding in perspective: ""Think federally subsidized consultants paid $55 an hour to tell businesses to turn down their AC in the summer.""
\
The Kerry-Boxer bill contains similar language in Section 156, allocating up to $200 million to ""promote green development in distressed communities."" The Senate makes no mention of who would oversee such programs, but the intention is clear: community development organizations such as ACORN.
\
Between the passage of Waxman-Markey bill in the House and the introduction of the Kerry-Boxer bill, reports of multiple ACORN scandals were front-page news. Seemingly recognizing how politically explosive it would be to include funding for ""community development organizations,"" Kerry and Boxer deliberately obscured that fact.
\
One can debate the wisdom of spending hundreds of millions of dollars of ""green development"" in economically distressed communities at a time when the deficit is already $1.4 trillion and many Americans are suffering, with the official unemployment over 10 percent.
\
What we shouldn't debate is whether it is a wise idea to outsource these programs to community organizers. In the past, such groups have misused federal funding, skirted tax laws and strayed beyond their missions.
\
ACORN has become the archetype for federally funded scandal. During the last election cycle, a number of its members were charged with turning in thousands of false voter registration forms.
\
Last year, The New York Times reported that Dale Rathke, brother of ACORN founder Wade Rathke, had embezzled nearly $1 million from the organization. Multiple ACORN housing workers have been caught on tape advising people on how to set up a prostitution ring while evading taxes.
\
As these headlined transgressions become distant memories, ACORN, as the largest community-organizing group in America, would likely become a major beneficiary of cap-and-trade should some version of Waxman-Markey or Kerry-Boxer become law. Such funding is even more probable given the large number of ACORN affiliates now promoting themselves as experts on environmental justice.
\
Groups across the ideological spectrum have rejected the cap-and-trade legislation as a misguided endeavor, likely to impede economic growth while delivering minimal environmental benefit. Polls show a mere 17 percent of the public supports federal funding for ACORN.
\
The Waxman-Markey and Kerry-Boxer bills send the wrong message to those who would abuse the public trust.
\
This fact alone should consign them to richly deserved deaths.

39,"America's reliance on fossil fuels - coal, oil and natural gas - is fueling changes to our climate and causing a host of environmental, economic and security problems. While overall impacts from changes to our climate vary from region to region, all sectors of our economy, and specifically agriculture, are affected.\Not all the effects of climate change negatively affect agriculture; growing seasons will be longer and increased carbon dioxide levels encourage plant growth. However, numerous studies have shown that unless efforts are made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture will face increased frequency of heat stress, droughts and flooding events that will reduce crop yields and livestock productivity.\In a new report, ""Hotter Fields, Lower Yields,"" Wisconsin Environment examines the impact of climate change on corn, America's largest crop, which is particularly vulnerable to productivity losses from higher temperatures. Rising temperatures associated with climate change could cost Wisconsin corn growers $41 million a year in reduced yields, ranking Wisconsin 10th for damage estimates.\A recent study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Carnegie Institution found combined changes in temperature and precipitation since 1981 have resulted in lower yields in corn and other crops, leading to wasted productivity and lost revenue, costing growers worldwide approximately $1.2 billion annually.\Destructive storms, pests, weeds, diseases and ozone pollution will result in further damages to corn and agriculture from global warming. More and more rain is expected to fall during intense storms, saturating soils, increasing the risk of floods, and making it harder for plants and soils to absorb water before it washes into streams and rivers. Crop nuisances, such as insect pests, weeds and diseases, will have greater range and reproductive speed with increased temperatures. And ozone pollution, from which rural parts of the Midwest suffer more than almost anywhere else on Earth, is toxic to plants and is expected to become more concentrated with the increased temperatures of global warming.\Agriculture can help reduce the impacts of climate change and spur the transition to a clean energy economy. Clean renewable energy resources, such as wind turbines, solar panels and biofuels, can provide farmers a source of income while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in these and other clean energy solutions, we can help stop climate change and boost the agricultural economy.\Many farmers and forest owners across Wisconsin have already adopted progressive conservation practices that are helping to mitigate climate change. Incentives for further agricultural practices that sequester (store) carbon in soils and forests should build on these successful programs and be included in a cap and trade program. The EPA and USDA have estimated these practices could sequester up to 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, making a significant impact.\Last August, Gov. Doyle's Global Warming Task Force issued a comprehensive set of recommendations on how Wisconsin can do its part to reduce emissions while growing our clean energy economy. Legislation stemming from this report is expected later this summer.\Congress is now considering a federal cap and trade system. The House Energy and Commerce Committee began consideration of the American Clean Energy and Security Act during Earth Week - a bill answering President Obama's call for comprehensive clean energy and global warming legislation. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, is a key member of the committee and has a leadership role in this important legislation. The bill would cap greenhouse gas emissions and require the nation to obtain 25 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that such a standard would generate $13.5 billion in new income for farmers, ranchers and rural landowners.\Those who deny the reality of climate change have launched a full-scale lobbying effort to derail the legislative effort, arguing that addressing our nation's energy crisis will be too costly. It's time to move past these old arguments and set a new course to repower America and revitalize our economy with clean energy. The price of doing nothing is a price we may not want to pay in the future.\Dan Kohler is the director of Wisconsin Environment, a statewide, citizen-based, environmental advocacy organization.

It looks like perfect political symmetry--party-line voting in Congress on the first key pieces of Barack Obama's agenda, matching a deep partisan divide within the electorate in judging his performance as president.
\
But, for reasons that require a little explanation, it may be wrong to conclude from this evidence, as many are doing, that the center has fallen out of American politics and Obama is on a fool's errand if he continues to pursue bipartisan support.
\
First, the data that shouts that I am wrong. No vote is more important in encapsulating the approach of the two parties to the basic issues of governing than the vote on the budget resolution for the year. It defines the spending priorities and the tax limits, along with many of the policy innovations that will be fleshed out in later legislation.
\
This year, not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for the Democratic budget resolution and not a single Democrat endorsed the Republican substitute.
\
The Republicans denounced the deficit-spending envisaged by the Obama-endorsed budget and decried the Democrats' habit of voting down every Republican amendment, as if none of the GOP ideas could possibly have any merit.
\
Democrats, for their part, called Republicans ""the party of no,"" pointing out that the GOP members of Congress had been almost as unanimously negative in their reactions to Obama's stimulus bill and the catch-up budget left over from last year's partisan gridlock.
\
As for the voters, the Pew Research Center reported earlier this month on a survey that showed the partisan gap in Obama's job approval scores is the widest in contemporary history. He rated a thumbs-up from 88 percent of Democrats and only 27 percent of Republicans in the poll--a gap of 61 points.
\
At a comparable point in their first terms, the gaps for George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were only 51 and 45 points, respectively. A separate Pew poll found that since January, the percentage of voters who think that Democrats and Republicans in Washington are bickering more than usual has grown 14 points, with a similar trend on the question of whether the country is more politically divided than in the past. By large margins, majorities now answer ""yes"" to both questions.
\
All this suggests, the notion that Obama's election marked a change for the better in the political environment was as fanciful as Michigan State's chances against the mighty North Carolina Tar Heels.
\
But, still, this analysis ignores several potent factors, starting with the fact that the fastest-growing portion of the electorate consists of people who have no strong partisan allegiance. These political independents are now as numerous as self-identified Republicans and are closing the gap on Democrats.
\
Though badly underrepresented in Congress, where districting rules and campaign finance practices reinforce the two-party hegemony, independent voters make up the swing vote in almost every contested election--including the presidential race.
\
It is the reaction of those swing voters--or the politicians' anticipation of their shifting opinion--that drives the outcome of big policy debates. You've had an example of this already with Obama's cap-and-trade proposal for protecting the environment from carbon discharges.
\
Once political independents, who like the idea of clean air, grasped that cap-and-trade would mean a big tax increase for them, Republican opposition was reinforced and Democratic support weakened to the point that the Obama plan may already be doomed this year.
\
The crucial role of the independents will be demonstrated again and again when Congress takes up Obama's challenge to reform health care, immigration and other broken systems, or renew arms control agreements. Because those independents are impressed when measures find prominent supporters in both parties, it will continue to behoove Obama to woo Republican help--no matter how tough the odds.
\
Presidents who hope to achieve great things cannot for long rely on using their congressional majorities to muscle things through. That is why a strategy based on the early roll calls and polls is likely to fail.

No matter who wins on Nov. 4, the next president promises to chart a different course on energy and the environment than President Bush.
\
Unlike Bush, Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain both oppose drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Both support tapping alternative energy sources. And both have endorsed plans to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other emissions from power plants, factories and motor vehicles.
\
""Both have the credentials that suggest they're very serious about doing something about climate change, and so if you're an environmentalist, that's a good thing,"" said Bryan Mignone, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
\
But there also are some clear differences between McCain (R.-Ariz.) and Obama (D-Ill.) on environmental and energy policy.
\
McCain portrays himself as an environmentalist in the mold of Theodore Roosevelt, a conservationist who set up the National Park Service. Obama told the environmental magazine Grist that his environmental heroes are Rachel Carson, author of Silent Spring, and Roosevelt.
\
McCain has emphasized enhancing oil supplies and building nuclear reactors. Obama has made a high priority of investments in renewable energy and clean-energy technology.
\
Nuclear energy
\
One issue in particular separates the candidates' energy policies.
\
""Nuclear power is the biggest difference of all,"" said Kevin Book, energy analyst with investment bank Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group.
\
McCain backs nuclear energy because of its efficiency and because it generates no emissions linked to global warming. He has called for the United States to follow the lead of France and reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. He has proposed building 45 nuclear reactors by 2030, which by some estimates could cost $300 billion or more.
\
Obama is not opposed to nuclear power but says the disposal of spent radioactive waste must be confronted first.
\
""They're both going to be relying on nuclear energy to some degree because they've both made pretty bold climate commitments,"" said John Wilson, professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""Obama is more tepid on a commitment to nuclear energy, but he doesn't rule it out like many Democrats have done in the past.""
\
Obama has ties to one of the nation's biggest owners of nuclear plants. Chicago-based Exelon Corp. is ranked 25th among companies whose employees have donated to the Democrat's campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
\
In Wisconsin, Gov. Jim Doyle's global warming task force has recommended relaxing the state's ban on nuclear plant construction, a proposal that may be forwarded to the state Legislature next year.
\
Greenhouse gases
\
Nationally, a Supreme Court ruling last year required the government to develop a plan to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, a task that will fall to the next administration.
\
Although McCain differs from most Republicans on the issue -- he visited the Arctic to see the environmental effects of climate change for himself -- he and Obama do not agree entirely on the matter. Obama favors a deeper reduction in emissions than McCain does: Obama wants an 80% drop by 2050, vs. McCain's target of 60%.
\
They also differ in how they would set up a cap-and-trade system, under which emissions would be capped and brought down over time, and utilities would have to either reduce emissions or buy pollution allowances that allow them to keep releasing greenhouse gases. McCain favors giving those allowances to utilities and industry for free at the beginning of a cap-and-trade system; Obama says requiring all allocations to be bought would force more technology changes in the energy sector more quickly.
\
Mignone says voters who want to see a global warming plan enacted are likely to favor Obama, because McCain will face pressure from within his own party for his climate stance. But Book, the energy analyst, expects McCain to be as forceful as Obama in proposing a cap-and-trade system to bring down greenhouse gas emissions.
\
""For his party, he (McCain) really was a maverick. He easily was out in front on climate issues,"" said Michael Kraft, professor of environmental policy at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.
\
Both candidates say they support technologies that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and wind and solar power.
\
No matter who is elected, the regulatory climate toward coal mining and power plants that burn coal will shift in January, observers say.
\
Coal is a key issue in Wisconsin, as new coal-fired power plants are likely to boost greenhouse gas emissions at a time when Doyle's task force has proposed a 22% drop in emissions by 2022. Also, the Milwaukee area is also home to two global mining equipment firms.
\
Both McCain and Obama would be tougher than Bush on regulating issues such as wetlands and coal mining.
\
""If you're looking at coal mining, it's going to change a lot, no matter who wins,"" Book said. ""Things are not going to be as easy for surface mining and especially mountaintop mining. They're going to be more protective of water, and they're likely going to more strictly regulate underground mining safety.""
\
Renewable energy
\
McCain has opposed a renewable fuel standard that requires ethanol in the nation's energy mix, while Obama has supported the standard, said John Biondi, president of C56 Technologies, a Madison firm developing enzymes for biofuels. And Obama's plan to create so-called ""green collar"" jobs in energy efficiency and renewable energy could benefit Wisconsin, Kraft said.
\
""Wisconsin is really well-positioned for decades to be producing fuel from feedstock,"" he said. ""This state really could be helped by major technological developments and a focus on biofuels other than corn.""
\
But Obama's call to invest in renewable energy and create clean-energy technology jobs would not come cheaply: It would cost $150 billion over 10 years, according to his Web site.
\
An Obama administration would be more likely to provide enhanced federal support to expand renewable energy in Wisconsin, whether for wind farms on Lake Michigan or new biofuels projects, Kraft said.
\
McCain said he opposes subsidies for ethanol ""because they distorted the market and created inflation.""
\
On renewable energy, McCain has voted frequently against extending tax credits for wind and solar power, but his platform endorses a system of tax credits that would remain in place until ""renewable energy no longer merits the taxpayers' dollars.""
\
Energy independence
\
Both candidates have talked about the need for energy independence -- a difficult goal to achieve, experts say.
\
The U.S. economy is more dependent on oil, including imported oil from the Middle East, than it was during the oil shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s, said economist Joseph Kalt of Harvard University. The United States imports two-thirds of its oil today, compared with one-third in 1970.
\
Thus, despite the rhetoric, Kalt and others have little confidence that the situation will change.
\
""Our leaders may come along and say they have a solution,"" Kalt said. ""But they've told us that -- Republicans and Democrats -- for the last 30 years.""
\
As energy prices soared this summer, both McCain and Obama shifted from their past opposition to offshore drilling.
\
McCain's call for more drilling, and his naming of pro-drilling Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, prompted crowds to begin chanting ""Drill, baby, drill"" at McCain rallies. The move was popular as public opinion polls responded favorably to drilling, Book said.
\
By last month, congressional Democrats agreed to let a ban on offshore drilling expire at the end of 2008, and Obama joined with others in his party in supporting limited drilling.
\
Obama and the Democrats ""sort of punted"" on drilling, said Mignone of the Brookings Institution. ""They've said it's not worth having that fight this close to the election.""
\
Another key difference between the candidates on energy policy is their attitude toward oil company profits.
\
Obama has proposed taxing oil company profits to fund investment in alternative energy and rebates for consumers. McCain hasn't singled out the oil industry in his tax policies, but analysts expect he would be much less likely to boost oil company taxes.
\
""It's not clear that McCain will defend the oil industry, but he will defend tax policies that are pro-growth and oppose tax policies that are anti-growth,"" Book said.

Sept. 5
\
""We're going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We're going to achieve energy independence. This is a national security issue, it's an economic issue. We'll produce more energy at home, and we will drill offshore and we will drill now. We will drill now. . . .

Oct. 1
\
""I'll help our auto companies retool so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here the United States. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150 billion over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy: wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels, an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.""
\
RATING THE CANDIDATES
\
- The Partnership for America, a Colorado-based group that supports restoration of ""a common sense balance between economic growth and environmental conservation,"" gave McCain a rating of 40 and Obama a rating of 0 (on a scale of 0 to 100) based on votes taken in 2005 and 2006.
\
- The League of Conservation Voters, an environmental watchdog group that has endorsed Obama, gave Obama a 72% lifetime score and McCain a 24% lifetime score for their votes in Washington on environmental issues.

42,"Neither Wisconsin's economy nor its environment can thrive for long if the state continues to depend so overwhelmingly on nonrenewable, imported energy sources that contribute to climate change.\That warning should enlighten policymakers and voters as the debate accelerates over the recommendations from Gov. Doyle's Global Warming Task Force.\Critics of the recommendations cite the costs added greenhouse gas restrictions will impose on industry and consumers.\Supporters argue that the costs global warming will impose on the environment are far greater.\Both arguments have merit. But a focus on cost-benefit analyses leads to an incomplete conclusion. Too much is yet unknown about climate change, including what impact the task force recommendations would have.\The focus should be on what is known: The world's supply of fossil fuels is limited. Demand is increasing, even as pollution worries mount.\As a result, prices are higher and are likely to remain so.\That's a costly consequence for Wisconsin, which has no oil, natural gas or coal supplies of its own.\What is also known is that as the United States turns more and more to renewable energy sources, opportunities are opening for Wisconsin to prosper.\The development of biofuels is especially inviting for Wisconsin. The state's forests and farms can yield the raw material for ethanol and other biofuels. UW-Madison offers the expertise and research labs needed to develop biofuel technologies.\The result can be jobs and income for Wisconsin as well as cleaner-burning, renewable, home-grown fuels for the nation.\Wisconsin cannot reduce the threat of climate change on its own. The global climate change challenge will require an international solution.\But Wisconsin can and should meet the challenge posed by its dependence on fossil fuels - and take advantage of opportunities to prosper from greener energy sources produced within its own borders.\The 63 recommendations from the Governor's Task Force on Global Warming deserve thorough evaluation. They range from boosting the use of biofuels to putting wind turbines on the Great Lakes to participating in a multi-state cap-and-trade plan to limit pollution.\Some recommendations may prove imprudent. But Wisconsin should use the task force report as a guide to adopt policies that propel the state into a new era in energy that benefits the economy and environment."

On this Earth Day, the United States stands poised to make the most significant strides on climate change since Al Gore lost Florida. It's about time. The vast majority of scientific research tells us that climate change is real and that human activity is a major contributing factor. The country needs to finally develop a real strategy to deal with it.
\
And it's doing so: The Obama administration and a Democratic-controlled Congress are proposing changes that when enacted and enforced are expected to fuel major reductions in the production of greenhouse gases. Two efforts are key to this.
\
Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a proposed finding that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare. If finalized, the so-called ""endangerment finding"" would allow the EPA to use the Clean Air Act to limit heat-trapping emissions. That's a move opposed by industry groups, and we agree with them -- sort of.
\
The strategy and limitations on emissions are better done by a Congress that can work out political details that need to be addressed. Holding a healthy debate in Congress and making necessary compromises is better than allowing a bureaucrat to issue a decree.
\
Still, if Congress fails to act, the EPA under President Barack Obama will need to do something to meet the goals of significantly reducing emissions by 2050.
\
This week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is holding hearings on a draft bill introduced by Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Ed Markey (D-Mass.). Obama and Democratic congressional leaders are hoping to finalize legislation this year that would establish a program requiring a mandatory cap on greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The Waxman-Markey draft seeks to curb emissions by 20% by 2020. That's more aggressive than the limits Obama has proposed, but both the Waxman-Markey draft and Obama's plan call for a midcentury target of slashing emissions by 83%.
\
Good goals, but the devil will be in the details of how proposed cap-and-trade legislation will work. Among others, Journal Sentinel business columnist John Torinus and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) have sounded warnings about cost.
\
Such warnings deserve attention, but the bottom line has to be a serious strategy to significantly reduce emissions before it's too late.

44,"A federal appeals court said Friday the Bush administration ignored the law when it imposed less stringent requirements on power plants to reduce mercury pollution, which scientists fear could cause neurological problems in 60,000 newborns a year.\A three-judge panel unanimously struck down a mercury-control plan imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency three years ago. It established an emissions trading process in which some plants could avoid installing the best mercury control technology available by buying pollution credits.\Environmentalist and health experts argued that such a cap-and-trading mechanism would create ""hot spots"" of mercury contamination near some power plants. Seventeen states, including Wisconsin, as well as environmental and health groups joined in a suit to block the regulation, saying it did not adequately protect public health.\Power plants are the biggest source of releases of mercury, which finds its way into the food supply, particularly fish. Mercury can damage developing brains of fetuses and very young children.\The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the EPA violated the federal Clean Air Act when it scrapped a mercury-control policy established in December 2000 under the Clinton administration. Utilities were required to install the best available technology to capture mercury from power-plant smokestacks.\That policy was anticipated to capture more than 90 percent of mercury releases. The cap-and-trade approach imposed by the EPA in March 2005 envisioned capturing 70 percent of emissions by 2018.\The court held that the EPA failed to show that its new approach would not harm the environment or that emissions at all plants not ""exceed a level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety.""\EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said the agency was reviewing the decision, but he indicated it was not giving up on the cap-and-trade approach to reducing mercury.\Environmentalists, hailing the decision as a victory for public health, predicted it will require the EPA to issue the more stringent emissions requirements that were proposed eight years ago.\""This means the EPA is going to have to go back and do a real job of regulating all the toxics coming out of these plants,"" said Earthjustice attorney James S. Pew, who argued the case on behalf of several environmental organizations."

Wisconsin and United Kingdom leaders are considering an agreement that would call for projects to research and share information about approaches to tackle global warming.
\
In a statement released during his overseas trip, Gov. Jim Doyle said he met with two British environmental policy-makers to discuss a potential memorandum of understanding between the United Kingdom and Wisconsin on climate-change issues.
\
The United Kingdom has similar agreements in place with California -- the first state to pass a law requiring reduced greenhouse gas emissions -- and Florida.
\
Doyle's office said the agreement would encourage collaboration between Wisconsin and the United Kingdom in researching and sharing new technologies as well as efforts to educate the public on global climate issues.
\
Doyle held meetings in recent days with John Ashton, special representative for climate change at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London, and Phil Woolas, minister of state for the environment, during his British Isles trip.
\
A final agreement with the United Kingdom is expected by the end of the year.
\
Woolas signaled last fall, during an appearance in Milwaukee, that the United Kingdom would like to be a partner with the Midwestern states as they move to adopt a cap-and-trade agreement across the region that would attempt to reduce emissions across the Midwest by 2020.
\
""I'm optimistic,"" he said at the November Midwest climate and energy conference. ""I genuinely believe that the strategic position of the Midwest is the tipping point in a global political agreement"" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The agreements are considered starting points toward the United Kingdom joining cap-and-trade emissions trading markets that are expected to be developed. The trading systems are being set up on the West Coast and in the Northeast and Midwest.

46,"When a federal appeals court last week slapped down the Bush administration's lax plan to limit mercury pollution, the decision was a victory for environmental protection and for Wisconsin.\But the ruling also handed state and federal regulators an important assignment: Establish new, tougher mercury regulations to replace the plan the court invalidated.\The federal Environmental Protection Agency should clear the way by declining to appeal the ruling further.\At stake is the nation's commitment to limiting the mercury emitted into the air from coal-burning power plants.\Mercury air pollution ends up falling into lakes, rivers and streams, endangering public health.\Wisconsin has a big stake in the regulation of mercury emissions. Almost all of the state's inland waterways are covered by an advisory warning of the level of mercury in the fish caught in those waterways.\The advisory is based on evidence that eating too much mercury-laden fish risks damage to kidneys and the nervous system.\The Bush administration's EPA in 2005 proposed mercury regulations that were plainly inadequate. Consequently, a coalition of states, including Wisconsin, joined environmental groups to sue the EPA.\Last week's decision held that the regulations failed to follow the law - a law requiring all power plants to be fitted with the best available technology to reduce emissions.\The court focused on the EPA's ""cap and trade"" plan for cutting pollution. Under the plan, power plants were required to cut their pollution to reach a cap, or they could buy credits from another plant that was under its cap.\Cap and trade has merit in many anti-pollution regulations. But the EPA's weak proposal risked that some areas would remain fouled with pollution as their power plants simply bought credits.\The EPA replied to the court's decision by warning that it leaves the agency with no control over mercury emissions from power plants.\On that point, the EPA is right. The agency should respond by going back to the drawing board to develop regulations that meet the legal requirements.\Meanwhile, Wisconsin should pursue new state limits for mercury pollution from power plants.\The Department of Natural Resources proposed a rule requiring a 90 percent reduction in mercury pollution. Talks are in progress over the timetable for implementation and whether the 90 percent figure should be relaxed.\Negotiations should continue. But the state should learn from the EPA's mistake. It should not settle for a lax rule.\Wisconsin needs regulation to protect the public and the environment from mercury pollution."
47,"My memory of Lake Superior is that it's frigid in early July. So, when I was canoeing on it last month, the prospect of a dip wasn't all that appealing. Eventually I did jump in, and much to my surprise, the lake wasn't frigid - it was downright warm. In fact, surface temperatures in Lake Superior have increased by almost five degrees over the last three decades.\The lake's warmth is only one sign of a warming planet. During June alone, more than 3,000 high-temperature records were broken in the U.S. This May was also the warmest on record. That made 327 months in a row in which the earth's temperature was above the historical average. \There is no dispute in the scientific community that we are undergoing a significant increase in global temperature and a consequent disruption in the climate that increases the likelihood of dramatic weather events like severe storms and longer droughts. Those disputing global warming are oil- and gas-funded politicians. \There is disagreement, however, about the best way to reduce the greenhouse pollution, especially carbon dioxide, that is causing the rise in global temperatures. \Until now, the main focus has been on cap and trade, in which polluters must either reduce emissions on their own or buy credits from more efficient companies. While cumbersome, this has been viewed as the most politically achievable approach. However, with the failure of cap and trade legislation, attention is shifting to a simpler and potentially more effective approach. \That approach is a fee on carbon emissions, and it's been introduced in a bill by Reps. Pete Stark, D-Calif., and John Larson, D-Conn. The bill has numerous co-sponsors and support from both the left and the right. \Under the legislation, no additional revenue would be raised - rather, funds collected from carbon fees would be used dollar for dollar to reduce payroll taxes. The short hand: ""Tax what we burn - not what we earn."" \The legislation is modeled on what is now in effect in the province of British Columbia in Canada and several Scandinavian countries. British Columbia has reduced its greenhouse pollution by 5 percent in just four years. While gasoline usage is up 5 percent in Canada overall, it's down 3 percent in British Columbia. \Gas use isn't the only thing that is down. Revenue from the carbon fee has allowed significant cuts in both business and personal taxes. The province also provides targeted rebates for low-income and rural households. Noteworthy is that during the period that the fee has been in effect, the economy in British Columbia has grown. \Sweden has the highest carbon fee and the longest experience with it. The country has cut greenhouse emissions by more than 40 percent. And their economy is doing well while much of the rest of Europe is in a downturn. \While many progressives embrace the carbon fee, this approach has also attracted some support from the right side of the political spectrum. Conservatives like the fact that once the fee is collected, the government is basically hands off and the market drives carbon reductions as it responds to price signals. And for those of us who don't have tax shelters in the Cayman Islands, a tax-neutral carbon fee offers a way to cut our own taxes by cutting our energy use. Lower taxes and a better environment - now that's a winning combination. \Spencer Black represented the 77th Assembly District for 26 years and was chair of the Natural Resources Committee.

48," The Bush administration on Thursday finalized a regulation for the eastern United States that would cut power plant pollutants that cause smog, acid rain and soot by about two-thirds over the next decade.\ The rule will cost about $3.6 billion a year to implement but is expected to have $85 billion in annual health benefits.\ It ""will result in the biggest health benefit of any EPA rule in more than a decade,"" said Jeffrey Holmstead, the Environmental Protection Agency's assistant administrator.\ The EPA predicts that the rule will prevent 17,000 heart and respiratory deaths caused by pollution from coal-fired power plants. It's aimed at reducing nitrogen oxide, which causes smog, and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain and soot.\ The rule is part of a two-prong effort to fulfill President Bush's pledge to clean up pollution from power plants that were built before the nation's air pollution laws were enacted. A more controversial rule to reduce mercury - one criticized by environmental activists as being too slow and weak - will be finalized next week.\ Because Thursday's regulation is designed to reduce pollution that travels across state lines, it applies only to 28 Eastern and Midwestern states, including Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.\ Unlike most past regulatory efforts, this rule doesn't tell power plants how to reduce pollution. Instead, it puts caps on emissions and lets the utilities decide how to get below those limits.\ One cap would reduce allowable nitrogen oxides emissions by 53 percent in 2009 and would cut permitted sulfur dioxide pollution by 62 percent in 2010. A more stringent cap for both would then take effect in 2015: 61 percent below current levels for nitrogen oxide and 73 percent below current levels for sulfur dioxide.\ The key to the rule is that utilities are given a free-market tool that allows them to trade the right-to-pollute among power plants much like pork belly futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - a method that helped cut acid rain in the 1990s. A utility that can't reduce its emissions can buy the right-to- pollute from a utility that exceeded cleanup requirements.\ The concept, when first used with acid rain in 1990, turned environmental offices in utilities into valued money-makers, said Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense, a moderate environmental group that worked with the EPA on the latest rule.\ This is how the new system works: The EPA will allocate ""allotments"" for the right to pollute by state based on how much power each produces. The states will then divvy those up among power plants, but the number of allotments will be less than what's allowed for current pollution, so utilities will have to clean up or buy another utility's allotments. Right now, an allotment equivalent to a ton of sulfur dioxide pollution sells for about $650, but could easily hit $1,000, Holmstead said.\ Newer power plants will likely clean up faster than others because it's cheaper for them to clean up and sell excess allotments to older power plants.\ Thursday's rule drew measured praise from industry and environmental groups. But environmental groups and state and local air regulators also said it doesn't do enough quickly enough and will still leave some Northeastern cities, such as Philadelphia, with dirty air even after the toughest rules go into effect.\ Angela Ledford, the director of the environmental group Clear The Air, said the new rule gives power plants more time to clean up than existing law allowed.\ Bill Becker, the executive director of an association for state and local air regulators, called the rule ""a good first step, but the deadlines are too long, the emissions caps are too weak.""\ Ed Krenik, a lobbyist for coal power plants, called the rule ""a good step forward by utilizing cap-and-trade.""\ But Krenik and Edison Electric Institute, an industry lobbying group, said the regulation wasn't really what they wanted. They wanted Bush's more controversial rewrite of the Clean Air Act, which was killed in the Senate on Wednesday.\ The president's more comprehensive proposal - killed by a tie vote in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee - had the shrinking emission limits and cap-and-trade.\ But it also would have eliminated several key aspects of the Clean Air Act that utilities said were duplicative."
49,"
Don't expect mercury to disappear from our fish and lakes overnight.
\
The Bush administration announced new regulations Tuesday that would require power plants to cut mercury emissions for the first time.
\
In announcing those cuts, officials also laid much of the blame for mercury pollution overseas.
\
The intended target of the reductions America's coal-fired power plants is responsible for only 1% of the world's output, Environmental Protection Agency officials said.
\
The top air regulator in Wisconsin, however, said the federal rules have been weakened from initial drafts to the point where the state's electric utilities won't have to do anything to meet the first phase of reductions in 2010.
\
The affected utilities in Wisconsin are:
\
-- We Energies of Milwaukee
\
-- Alliant Energy Corp. of Madison
\
-- Wisconsin Public Service Corp. of Green Bay
\
-- Dairyland Power Cooperative of La Crosse
\
""We're disappointed in it,"" said Lloyd Eagan, administrator of air management for the Department of Natural Resources.
\
As for the role of international polluters, Eagan said, ""there is a big debate about how much is global and how much is local.
\
The better way to look at it is that mercury is building up in the environment, and the longer we wait to remove it, the longer we are going to be dealing with fish consumption advisories.""
\
In 2001, Wisconsin broadened its fish consumption advisory from 341 to all of the state's waterways. The reason: After mercury leaves a smokestack, some eventually falls on water and converts to a more toxic form that accumulates in fish.
\
Wisconsin has never had a target date for when it would lift its fish consumption advisory.
\
But Eagan said the EPA rule package will delay that date.
\
EPA officials announced rules that would cut power plants' mercury emissions from 1999 levels by 21% in 2010 and by 69% in 2018.
\
In doing so, the agency said the mercury rules, combined with last week's rule package to control sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, were a multi-pollutant approach to cleaning up power plants and making the nation's air cleaner.
\
Jeff Holmstead, assistant administrator of the EPA's office of air and radiation, said the agency prefers to ratchet down pollutants using President Bush's ""Clear Skies"" initiative, even though the legislation remains bottled up in Congress.
\
The mercury regulations drew support from business groups but criticism from environmental groups, with one organization, Waterkeeper Alliance, saying it will file a lawsuit against the agency for failing to protect the public from mercury contamination.
\
In Wisconsin, George Meyer of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation said that a 69% cut by 2018 was ""fairly strong.""
\
But he criticized the regulation's ""cap-and-trade"" plan, which allows some utilities to buy pollution credits from other companies rather than install remediation equipment themselves.
\
Meyer is the executive director of the conservation group and a former DNR secretary. He said the EPA's cap-and-trade plan that reduced sulfur dioxide emissions for the government's acid rain program was successful.
\
Even so, Meyer sides with those who believe that most mercury emissions land within 100 miles of a power plant. This could create zones where mercury emissions could spike.
\
The EPA's Holmstead disagrees. He told reporters in Washington, D.C., and by teleconference that EPA modeling shows that market- based trading will reduce emissions in all parts of the country. Also, the biggest polluters will be rewarded for cutting emissions and earning credits, he said.
\
We Energies of Milwaukee is the larger producer of mercury emissions in Wisconsin, according to the DNR. The utility produced 1,068 pounds in 2003, followed by Alliant Energy with 863 pounds, Wisconsin Public Service with 269 pounds and Dairyland Power with 212 pounds.
\
The state's largest mercury polluter is a Vulcan Chemicals plant in Port Edwards in Wood County, which produced 1,462 pounds of mercury in 2002, according to the DNR. The EPA's new regulations only apply to power plants.
\
A We Energies official said it was too soon to say how the company would implement the regulations.
\
Kris McKinney, manager of environmental strategy, said the company's 2002 agreement with the DNR to spend $400 million to $600 million to cut pollutants at its power plants include mercury reductions.
\
The utility is also experimenting with mercury reduction technology at a plant in Marquette, Mich., and is working with others on research that involves the use of an additive that would help strip out pollutants, including mercury, at coal plants.
\
At Alliant, the company is evaluating options. One issue, said spokesman Scott Smith, is the effect on byproducts such as fly ash, which the utility sells and could become less marketable when mercury is removed from smokestacks.

50," Fed up with federal inaction and convinced of the dangers from global warming, five governors from Western states agreed Monday to work together to reduce greenhouse gases.\ Their promise to target global warming was the latest of a rush of new ideas shared this week as states push ahead on climate change and clean or alternative energy.\ ""Thankfully the country has reached a tipping point on this issue. I wish we had done it 20 years ago,"" said Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who last week signed into law a requirement that utilities generate a quarter of their power from renewable sources such as wind, water and the sun by 2025. ""Governors, members of Congress and others are now scrambling to be bold.""\ The twin challenges of global warming and energy were some of the dominant points of discussion over four days at the annual winter meeting of the National Governors Association.\ Others discussed legislation to encourage ""clean-coal"" technology; the economic growth that would come from industries in windmills, solar panels and the like; and tax incentives to spur more renewable energy.\ But out West, increasingly common droughts and bad fire seasons added urgency. The governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington agreed to develop a regional target to lower greenhouse gases and create a market-based program aimed at helping businesses reach the still-undecided goals.\ New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat seeking his party's presidential nomination, said the five-state agreement should spur other states ahead. ""You're going to see a domino effect with more and more states taking action,"" Richardson said.\ On everyone's lips was Sunday night's Oscar for former Vice President Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" - a documentary that illustrated the changes to the nation's climate and the dangers ahead.\ ""We must encourage all the governors to sign onto these partnerships,"" said California GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has pursued some of the most aggressive efforts in the country. ""I just want to make sure that everyone works together and fights global warming.""\ Schwarzenegger said a so-called cap-and-trade program, which lets companies that can't meet their emission reduction targets buy credits from those that reduce carbon dioxide, would provide ""a powerful framework for developing a national cap-and-trade program. ... This agreement shows the power of states to lead our nation addressing climate change.""\ Such a market pact is close to becoming reality among a number of Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, which plan to impose caps on power plant emissions and encourage trading of allowances among utilities. More than two dozen states have drawn up plans to combat warming in various forms, and many governors have signed onto efforts to use 25 percent renewable energy sources by 2025.\ The latest agreement - called the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative - builds on earlier efforts.\ Last year, Schwarzenegger signed California legislation imposing a first-in-the-nation emissions cap on utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020. And Schwarzenegger and British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans to work toward a possible joint emissions- trading market.\ New Mexico and Arizona last year agreed to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions. A similar joint effort on climate change was agreed upon in 2003 by California, Oregon and Washington.\ President Bush also spoke out on his administration's work on energy issues, telling governors after private meetings Monday morning that his efforts to expand research and use of alternative fuels would reduce gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next 10 years.\ ""It's in our national security interest, it's in our national economic interest, and it will enable us to be better stewards of the environment,"" he said.\ There also are numerous proposals before Congress to move ahead on energy and climate change."
51,"There is a tidal wave of government regulation regarding the production of energy on the horizon. Both the U.S. House and Senate are currently considering bills that would require substantial amounts of energy to be produced from renewable or cleaner sources. The two bills both enact a set of mandates that ""cap"" future carbon emission levels and allow utilities to ""trade"" emissions on the commodities market. I would be negligent to not point out how well using these same markets worked for the banking and mortgage industries.\This system of ""cap and trade"" regulations will change the way we do business in the U.S. and the Midwest. States that rely on the use of coal - and have less than ideal conditions for the production of solar, water or wind energy - will suffer. These states will be forced to either pay for more expensive/less productive technologies or will have to purchase credits from areas requiring fewer resources or producing more carbon-free energy. The end result, in either case, will be higher energy costs for Midwest manufacturing states including Wisconsin.\Unfortunately the real winners may not be the U.S. at all. Countries that ignore environmentally friendly policies and are able to supply lower cost energy will attract new manufacturing. Nike shoes and Apple Computers, manufactured abroad, would benefit - while New Balance and Dell, with North American facilities, would suffer. The debate has also become extremely partisan, which makes little sense to me because at the heart of the issue are domestic jobs and the U.S. economy. In the end we may actually create substantially more carbon emissions worldwide as our heavy manufacturing moves to countries with lower or nonexistent emission regulations.\Let me outline the dilemma as I see it. Assume the UW-Madison develops new technologies for an electric vehicle. A Wisconsin company licenses the technologies and develops a cost-effective prototype for a car with zero emissions. Plans for production begin and the company is forced to another region or overseas because of energy costs and government regulation. Can't happen, you say - I would point out that there are no televisions that are made in the U.S., most other consumer electronics are foreign, most cars are imports, most toys, clothes, and even much of our food is no longer domestically produced. I am a fan of the global market but the playing field has to be somewhat level for the game to be fair.\Now for the positive side of the energy dilemma. One Wisconsin firm has seen the tidal wave and decided to grab a surfboard and ride it in. I sat down with Scott Neitzel of Madison Gas and Electric and asked about the future of energy production in Wisconsin. Scott shared an MGE initiative, the Energy 2015 Plan, to create economic and environmentally responsible energy. The plan outlines that the company will discontinue burning coal at the downtown Madison Blount Generating Station by 2011, increase its use of wind tenfold, involve the customer in energy efficiency efforts, and secure a cleaner more reliable and affordable product across the board.\To date MGE has made good on the promise. The Blount facility will soon no longer rely on coal, MGE has increased its wind generation from 11 to 137 megawatts, and the company has incorporated new cleaner technologies into its generation facilities portfolio. In addition, MGE has educated the consumer and offers a Green Power Tomorrow program, which allows customers to voluntarily purchase renewable energy for a penny per kilowatt-hour and sell solar energy back to MGE for $0.25 per kilowatt-hour.\Neitzel suggests, ""Renewable energy is a part of our corporate culture from the top down."" In describing how they got here he used a sports metaphor from Wayne Gretzky: ""You skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is.""\The most interesting observation I can make is that MGE was not motivated by current policy or the looming cap and trade initiative. In fact the 2015 Plan was adopted in January of 2006, a full two years before the new administration or current legislative agendas. I learned a lot about balancing good business with good policy from Scott and MGE. I hope this lesson will be shared on Capitol Hill before legislation is drafted. We must remember that energy, the environment and good business is, like surfing, a balancing act. If we are really going to ride the wave to shore, we need to see it coming.\One more confession, I stole the whole surfing analogy from Scott. Sorry - Cowabunga dude!\Ken Harwood writes an opinion column for the online Capital Region Business Journal, where this column first appeared.\Posted in Column on Sunday, December 27, 2009 4:35 am Updated: 10:16 am\Credit: Ken Harwood Capital Region Business Journal columnist"
52,"State utility regulators made clear their decision to reject a proposed power plant in Cassville was not based solely on the fact it would generate the majority of its power from coal.\But they also seemed to have as many questions about coal's future as anyone else.\The decision to reject the plant was the latest in a series of blows coal has taken in Wisconsin lately and created some uncertainty over what's next for the dominant source of the state's power. One thing driving some of the immediate uncertainty is the likelihood of new limits on carbon emission as part of the effort to battle global warming.\Gov. Jim Doyle has set goals for reducing greenhouse gases in Wisconsin, while a task force he created on global warming pushed for new caps on such emissions. And with President Obama now directing the country's energy policies, many expect a nation-wide approach to reducing carbon emissions.\Taken altogether, some say that paints a difficult picture for any proposals to build a new coal-fired power plant in the near future here.\Carbon regulation\""We need some regulatory certainty with carbon,"" said Brett Hulsey, an environmental consultant who supported the Cassville plant.\Coal is and will likely remain for the near future Wisconsin's main source for energy, producing just less than 70 percent of the state's power. Nuclear energy is a distant second at less than 20 percent, according to the Public Service Commission.\It's also a major source of pollution in the state, which was on the minds of PSC commissioners when they rejected the Cassville plant.\Commissioner Mark Meyer made clear he was not ""closing the door"" to voting for a coal-fired plant down the line. But he and fellow commissioners also raised concerns about how the Cassville facility would fit in with state goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\Alliant Energy , which proposed the plant, had pledged to generate up to 20 percent of the plant's power from biomass, as well as other steps to lessen the facility's impact on the environment. But those steps didn't go far enough to ease commissioners' concerns.\They also had major questions over the $1.3 billion price tag for the proposed plant on the Mississippi River. The PSC's final order outlining its decision noted agency staff ""offered evidence that this would be the most expensive conventional coal plant of its size, on a dollar-per-kilowatt basis, ever proposed in the United States.""\The order noted the ruling ""does not reflect a Commission policy in opposition to coal-fired or other fossil fuel generation."" But it also outlined commissioners' concerns over carbon emissions, the cost to mitigate them down the road with likely caps on greenhouse gas emissions coming and other perceived shortcomings.\There is no question efforts are under way at the state and federal level to put new carbon emissions in place. But what those limits make look like is still up in the air.\Doyle appointed a task force on global warming in 2007 to propose steps to combat climate change. It laid out interim targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2005 levels by 2014 and 1990 levels by 2022. It also targeted a 75 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2050.\Recommendations\The panel's recommendations, released last summer, included a ""substantial reduction over time in the state's dependence on fossil fuels and, in particular, on coal-fired generation that does not include carbon capture and sequestration technology.""\Carbon capture and sequestration technology is still being tested, and the report noted. The task force report also expressed support for a federal cap and trade program, which would put a limit on emissions that drops over time.\It also encourages the state to continue pursuit of a regional cap and trade program through the Midwest Governors Association.\With some of those details to be worked out, Hulsey said he sees moves in the immediate future toward renewable energy, a focus on efficiency and retooling coal plants to burn natural gas. ""I see the climate for energy efficiency and renewables probably better than ever,"" he said.\Charlie Higley, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board , said there are a number of trends working against coal right now that will make it hard to get a new coal-fired plant built in the near term.\He said growing demands for coal in developing countries like China are likely to push prices higher.\""Any of it is going to make it more expensive in the long run, and that's going to make it difficult for utilities to justify using coal,"" said Higley, whose group opposed the Cassville project.\Alliant spokesman Rob Crain said the decision on the utility's Cassville plant amounted to a ""short-term blow"" to coal's immediate future with the uncertainty over carbon costs and other factors.\The conversation now is focused on the best way to meet the state's energy needs in an affordable manner, and coal remains part of that discussion even if there is some short-term uncertainty over it, he said.\The Cassville project was the only application for a new coal-fired power plant pending before the PSC late last year. But Milwaukee-based We Energies has two coal-fired plants in Oak Creek that are scheduled to come on-line at the end of 2009. They cost $2.3 billion."

Tammy Baldwin received 70 percent of her campaign contributions from outside the 2nd District, while 60 percent came from outside of Wisconsin, according to MAPLight.org.\While Baldwin has no direct control over who contributes, it's fair to assume that, as a general rule, she won't receive a donation from someone who is not going to benefit from her being in office. A small portion of contributions may well come from outside one's home district, but 70 percent?

Spencer Black, I sponsored Safeguard the Guard legislation designed to protect our National Guard from unlawful overseas deployments. \Now that Black is retiring, Ben Manski, national coordinator of the Safeguard the Guard campaign, is running to fill the vacated seat. I am sad to see Black retire, but relieved to see Manski step forward. \I have worked closely with him over the last few years. I trust his instincts and his follow through. I urge Madisonians who care for veterans and military families, and who want to stop these endless wars, to elect Ben Manski as your 77th Assembly District representative. \- State Rep. Michael Fisher, Lincoln, Vt. \Hulsey has backbone to handle Assembly issues \While there are several fine people running to represent the 77th Assembly District, there are three main reasons that I am supporting Brett Hulsey. \First, he's had the strongest overall conservation and environmental record during his tenure on the Dane County Board, as a private business owner and as a leader of a nonprofit environmental organization. \Second, while on the County Board he has shown the ability to work across philosophical divides with other members to accomplish important things for county citizens. \Last, I was impressed that as chairman of the Public Safety and Judiciary Committee, Hulsey stood up for Dane County taxpayers and the needy when attacked by a narrow interest seeking additional funding in tough fiscal times. He did this despite personal attacks against himself and his family. That type of backbone is exactly what is needed in the current legislative atmosphere. \Hulsey will be a fine representative for the district, following in the footsteps of Rep. Spencer Black. \- George Meyer, Madison \Hesselbein is shrewd, courageous and frugal \As an environmental activist, I support Dianne Hesselbein for the 77th Assembly District. \From reviewing her statements and Dane County Board votes and speaking with her, I know she will be as fully committed to the environment as Rep. Spencer Black has been. She is endorsed by Steve Hiniker, executive director of 1,000 Friends of Wisconsin, a respected environmental group. \Her County Board votes have been consistently pro-environment. She was wrongly criticized for a vote against the Ice Age Trail purchase. She voted against buying land on the basis that it was over-priced, then voted for it later, when the sellers came down by half a million dollars. This demonstrated shrewdness, courage and frugality with the public treasury. \Hesselbein calls for Wisconsin to take a more focused, resource-backed role in the manufacture of clean energy hardware here. Such an investment could produce thousands of good jobs in Wisconsin. \Hesselbein served on the Middleton-Cross Plains School Board and is endorsed by the American Federation of Teachers - Wisconsin. She serves on the Dane County Board, is endorsed by many of its members and was elected chairwoman of the Personnel and Finance Committee by the other committee members. She can deliver. \- Lawrence J. Landwehr, Middleton \Support Tranel in 49th Assembly District \Many have been feeling the pinch of what our state government has been doing to us over the last few years. How can they increase spending at the state level when we who pay their salaries cannot? Families cannot increase their spending to rid themselves of debt. \That's a simple fact, one that 49th Assembly District Rep. Phil Garthwaite doesn't understand. He voted to increase our taxes by $5 billion and upped state spending last year. This from the man who states on his website: ""I look forward to earning your vote so that I can keep working for lower taxes ..."" \It's time for change back to basic, fundamental, fiscal solutions. That change is Travis Tranel. \I voted for Tranel in the 2008 election because I know and trust him. He is a hard-working individual who stands behind his commitments. He believes in lower taxes, which means more money for taxpayers to invest in local economies, funding for our local schools or in more jobs for our local businesses. I trust Tranel to help us accomplish these goals in Madison. \We can't afford politicians who say one thing when they campaign and then vote the opposite. Vote for accountability in politics. Vote Travis Tranel. \- Roger Scholbrock, Potosi"
54,"Dear Editor: John McCain is accusing Barack Obama of class warfare? The Republican Party has been engaged in class warfare for the last 30 years. It's socialism for the rich. In fact, they'd won the war, till their greed caused the entire economy to collapse.\Every time the Republicans call for tax cut, they are committing class warfare. The rich get the tax cut and everyone else pays. We pay with increased taxes, reduced services, and deficits.\Can someone explain to me why the people who have benefited the most by what our society has to offer, shouldn't be expected to pay the most?\Now the Republicans are afraid. Very, very afraid. Afraid that someone will rewrite the rules, and they won't be able to play the games they've been playing.\In the 1860s Herbert Spencer took Darwin's theory of evolution, twisted and turned it till he came up with social Darwinism to give the robber barons of the 1800s the cloak of respectability. One hundred years later Milton Friedman took economic theory and twisted and turned it. Told everyone greed was good and regulation was bad. Since then we've had the savings and loan crisis of the 1990s, the crooks at Enron, World Com, and Tyco and others, and now we have the complete collapse of the banking system.\It's time to take the game away from the rich, the deregulators and the Republicans, and give the game to those that rewrite the rules to help the many, not the few.\John Hallinan Stoughton\Criticisms of Bishop Morlino justified\Dear Editor: It didn't surprise me that there is a group of Catholics writing a rebuttal to the recent criticisms of Bishop Morlino. This is America - freedom of speech - but I think the criticism is just. When one thinks about our previous bishops (O'Connor, O'Donnell, Wirz and Bullock) there was never this controversy over the bishops' actions!\The other bishops didn't fire lesbians and gays (like in Verona). Isn't the Golden Rule to love thy neighbor? They paid all their debts up front, not like this bishop did with a recent survey company. The priests never had to form a group before for their own protection and support.\Former bishops never dreamed of spending $70 million to build a new church, and the economy was much better then, too.\Sally Dreher Madison\School funding shortfall not result of fiscal irresponsibility\Dear Editor: Thanks are due to the Cap Times editorial board for endorsing the school funding referendum on the ballot on Nov. 4. The financial crisis facing our public schools does NOT stem from fiscal irresponsibility at the Madison Metropolitan School District, despite what some say. Our school officials and School Board have the unenviable task of trying to shoehorn all the educational programs they are mandated to provide into a state budget cap that does not keep pace with inflation.\This winter, heating costs are inevitably going to put additional burdens on these already trimmed-to-the-bone budgets. Because of state law, the only way schools can come up with enough money to meet minimum educational goals is through referendums. And bake sales.\Karen Bassler Madison\Terms suggest justice system values material objects over humans\Dear Editor: I was appalled reading the article in the Cap Times (Oct. 15) entitled ""A victim twice over?"" Given the extensive beating to Shadayra Kilfoy-Flores, it appears that burglary carries a longer prison term (maximum 10 years) than ""substantial beating"" (maximum 18 months).\I am wondering if the newspaper got this information correctly, because as it was written, material things appear to have greater value than human beings.\If this is so, could it explain the ""substantial batteries"" that are now taking place in Madison?\I was reminded of my years as the executive director of the Rape Crisis Center in Santa Fe, N.M., where, at first, the woman after undergoing battery and rape was put on the stand in the court room and became a ""victim twice over."" But that was over 35 years ago. No improvement in the justice system in 35 years???\Shelbee Matis Madison\Economic crisis sinks McCain campaign strategy\Dear Editor: Those Sarah Palin rap song lyrics - sung by Amy Poehler on ""Saturday Night Live"" - encourage crowd participation and crystallize the McCain/Palin campaign strategy: Define Barack Obama to the American people. Besides William Ayers, Sen. McCain has used words and phrases like ""celebrity,"" ""naive,"" ""risky,"" ""not ready to lead,"" ""elitist"" and ""socialist"" to define Sen. Obama.\Personal attacks are not working because Americans are focusing on the serious challenges that face our country.\America's economy has lost 2.2 million jobs since September 2007. About 2.4 million new home foreclosures were filed between January - August 2008. Pension funds and retirement accounts have lost a trillion dollars in value for the year that ended June 30. Jim Cramer (Host of MSNBC's ""Mad Money"") has advised ""Today"" show viewers to withdraw all money from the stock market if that money is needed in the next five years. General Motors has announced that it will close four assembly plants (including plants located in Janesville and Dayton, Ohio). And because of the liquidity crisis, WHEDA - a Wisconsin agency that works with local lenders to offer below-market interest rates to first-time home buyers who have low and moderate incomes - has suspended its mortgage lending program.\Instead of articulating a compelling argument to convince voters that he's best prepared to lead Americans through these economic challenges, John McCain has chosen to change the subject. ""If we keep talking about the economic crisis, we're going to lose,"" said a top McCain campaign strategist earlier this month.\Country first?\Michael Ross La Crosse\Greater regulation needed to aid environment\Dear Editor: Global warming and its effects are producing climatic changes, which are in turn resulting in irreversible ecological changes. To properly address global warming, we need to make several large-scale changes in our current society. To make the necessary changes, we need intensive government regulation.\It is apparent that the use of oil as our primary source of energy is not sustainable, and will not support our ever increasing energy demands. We need to make large investments in research and development of renewable energy.\The government needs to strongly regulate greenhouse gas emissions. At the moment, the most viable way to do this is to enforce a cap and trade system, which is likely to be effective because it provides incentives for reducing carbon emissions.\The government and the general public need to make a collaborative effort to make fundamental changes in our society. Society today is dominated by overconsumption and wastefulness. This way of life is unsustainable, and is having detrimental effects on the environment and the economy as well.\Today, we find ourselves at a critical point where we are experiencing the consequences of our actions, and are also beginning to recognize the underlying causes of such. We have to make a choice: act now before it's too late or continue to suffer the consequences. We must learn from our past mistakes so we can create a more sustainable, environmentally conscious society - a society that will allow future generations to thrive.\Meghan Fox Madison\Governor should support enforcement of Clean Air Act\Dear Editor: It would be great if we could wave a wand and have clean air and water but without enforcing regulations, clean air and water will not happen. There are always explanations and excuses and reasons why it can't happen now. We have been hearing them for years. Let's stop with the games. Gov. Doyle should not ask enforcement agencies to ignore our violations of the Clean Air Act.\Kate Blumenthal Madison\Consider environment when casting vote\Dear Editor: The scientific proof confirming ongoing climate change due to global warming has been present in the scientific community for decades, and yet the general public continues to willfully ignore the overwhelming evidence. This trade of responsibility and future destruction for current convenience cannot continue if we wish for our future generations to succeed.\If individuals refuse to take action on their own, it is time for our government to step in to ensure the devastating effects of global warming do not continue to escalate.\With the presidential electron approaching, citizens have the potential to largely influence future energy policies of this country. Fortunately, both candidates have a history of acknowledging the need to take charge of the situation.\At first glance, the candidates both appear to support the fight against climate change. However, if you probe further, you will find that inconsistencies with past voting history and current declarations are evident.\It's important to educate yourself with the details of each candidate's policy before making a decision. Climate change due to global warming needs our urgent attention, and the next president of the United States will have to make challenging decisions regarding this problem. Make sure you know what you're voting for in November.\Alyssa Ralph Madison\10/25/2008 7:21 am"
55,"Is global warming a threat that requires strong regulatory measures to reduce man's impact on the environment?\Bad news for people in northern latitudes\As I read the two Forum columns regarding global warming last Sunday, I was disappointed with William Balgord's assessment of global warming.\We experienced record-breaking snowfalls in Madison, unprecedented snowfall in Baghdad and rare snowfall in places like Jerusalem because our planet is fighting back. It has to do with the phenomena called albedo, relating to the white color of snow and the polar caps deflecting solar heat outside the atmosphere. Because an area melted around Greenland, the extra precipitation is the planet compensating for the lost albedo.\The real danger behind this physiological planetary ""healing"" is that it threatens 80 percent of the people who live north of the latitude of state of Illinois, all around the globe.\Previous ice ages have formed as the result of abrupt climate change. It began with extensive snowfall in the north and south latitudes that didn't melt in summer, creating glaciers. The problem now is that we have generated greenhouse gas accumulations only equaled 650,000 years ago, when we didn't have billions of people living in areas that were once under ice.\Before this sudden climate change occurs, we will continue to warm the planet unless we change our way of life. Weather patterns will continue to intensify until we reach the threshold that will trigger the next ice age.\Can we prevent or delay this? Yes, if we can create and maintain an unprecedented number of jobs by implementing renewable energy policies.\- Luis C. Gomez, Madison\Bush connections exacerbate problem\The Bush family has background in the oil business and close ties to the Saudi Royal family, central to OPEC. The administration's war with Iraq became unstoppable following Saddam's statement that he would sell the world all the oil it wanted at a price one-third that of OPEC.\When Bush took office, oil was selling for under $25 a gallon. Today, it sells for more than $135 a gallon. We have no idea what the Iraqis will do with their oil when we leave, and no idea when we will leave Iraq.\Americans have been subtly terrorized into thinking they need gas-guzzling SUVs to be stylishly ""safe"" on our roads. Oil companies enjoy both tax breaks and record-breaking profits, while the American economy plummets due to the skyrocketing cost of anything dependent on oil.\The overwhelming majority of the world's scientists agree that the burning of fossil fuels and widespread deforestation are contributing to climate change, yet the Bush administration has consistently resisted action, saying the issue needs more study. Letters appear in newspapers and magazines saying that electric cars are ""impractical,"" and wind turbines ""ugly.""\My question to former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan: Is this all just ""coincidence?""\- Boyd Williamson, Reedsburg\Writer should leave science to scientists\Questions of science are best addressed by scientists. The existence of global warming, and our contribution to it, are questions of science. Our response is up to us.\Forum columnist William Balgord attempts to deny the former, rather than address the latter. But that was just the first mistake.\The first few paragraphs imply that local weather variations disprove global warming. ""Hey, it snowed! That proves global warming is a myth!"" He then implies that one year's drop in temperature disproves long-term global warming.\Then he cites a conference attended by ""more than 500"" - at which only 19 identified themselves as scientists of any kind. The conference was organized by a right-wing think tank known for denying the harm of cigarette smoke.\The Wisconsin State Journal owes its readers a reasoned debate.\Andy Thomas-Cramer, Madison\Our poor decisions made flooding worse\Instead of creating yet another layer of (ineffective) bureaucracy, I would suggest that we all become better stewards of our planet.\How? Start by eliminating building in flood plains, ending the draining of wetlands and avoiding planting in river bottoms, to name just a few ways.\Flooding has always occurred and it will continue to occur. However, by continuing our irresponsible practices, we feel the effects of such patterns of nature in an alarming, devastating manner.\And then we demand that the ""government do something about it.""\- Jan Krahenbuhl, South Wayne\Obama, Doyle will look for solutions\As Forum columnist Keith Reopelle of Clean Wisconsin said in last Sunday's column, we're already seeing the dramatic effects of climate change with floods, droughts, blizzards, heat waves and violent cold snaps becoming the norm rather than the exception.\With even the Republican candidate for president acknowledging that climate change is a threat, perhaps we can stop debating and finally move toward legislative solutions. We need politicians and regulatory agencies, at the state and national levels, to keep corporate polluters in check.\On the national stage, Sen. Barack Obama has proposed a strong cap-and-trade system that will reduce corporate pollutants, in contrast to Sen. John McCain's confused approach to the issue. Our state politicians should follow Obama's example by speeding the formation of a strong regional cap-and-trade system.\The Midwestern Governors Association, chaired by Gov. Jim Doyle, signed the Greenhouse Gas Accord in 2007, a step in the right direction, but only a first step. Wisconsin citizens must take the lead in fighting climate change.\- Aaron Bibb, Madison\Mundane reasons for flooding found, too\I found Forum columnist Keith Reopelle's piece dull and baseless. Nowhere in the article did he link a proven study with our recent flooding. I would argue that damage caused by the flooding happens because: There is too much precipitation over one area over a period of time. It's happened before, but it was probably in the form of snow. Meteorologists used to explain the unusual weather patterns with terms like shifts in wind patterns, cut-off lows, effect from the Great Lakes, etc. Now the universal and dismissive answer is global warming.\We populate previously flooded (but not known) or flood-prone areas. How does settling in low-lying areas adjacent to rivers equal climate change?\Our infrastructure fails. Some dams and levees were either abandoned or being upgraded. Some structures were designed to handle a certain amount of water. Along comes a 1,000-year precipitation event, and the laws of physics take over.\There you have it - three solid reasons why flooding occurs. It's not ""climate change"" - it's our complex relationship with natural events that is the cause.\Yes, renewable energy is the holy grail we all seek for residential and commercial use. Maybe next time we should give up our sandbags and shovels, plug in our electric cars and watch the rivers rise. Come on, Clean Wisconsin - if you're going to beat the drum for clean energy, don't use the folks of Lake Delton and Pardeeville as your drumstick.\- Peter J. Murray, Waunakee\Implement regulation and education now\There is no longer any doubt in the scientific community that man's contribution to climate change is absolutely real. Government's involvement in seeking to solve the problems we face is important to the effort. Education and possible regulation are areas where government can contribute to the battle.\- Bob Jome, Manitowoc\Utilities: pick best, not cheapest, way\Ideally everyone should be interested in reducing greenhouse gases that cause global warming. But without government action, utilities insist on the most ""cost-effective"" method of producing electrical energy.\As a result, We Energies is building old technology coal-fired plants in Oak Creek, and Alliant Energy is planning to build a coal-fired plant in Cassville.\True costs of coal-fired plants never include all of the external issues related to pollution. They include illness and related medical bills, acid precipitation, effects of mountaintop removal with accompanying water pollution, effects on recreation such as activity limits during ozone alerts, limits on eating fish because of mercury and so on.\If all these issues were added to the costs of burning coal for electrical generation, it would be more expensive than nearly any other methods of producing energy.\An energy alternative that should be thoroughly investigated is the use of thorium for clean heat and electrical generation.\- Wayne Stroessner, Random Lake, past president, Wisconsin Interfaith Climate and Energy Campaign\Check possibility of electronic pollution\Can computers, cell phones and other electrical gadgets contribute to the contamination of the atmosphere? Perhaps we pollute the atmosphere more than ever through technology. Think about skyscraper buildings, radio, TV and cell phone towers and even wind turbines that dot the landscape.\Water vapor is stored in clouds, but when clouds are overpowered by moisture, storms develop. Perhaps stray electricity in the air stimulated by metal towers results in horrendous lightening, thunder storms and destructive tornadic and straight line winds.\Why not consider man-made contamination of the atmosphere by electronics as well as that produced by automobile and other engines?\- Jane Fogo, Richland Center\Think before boarding global warming train\Your question implicitly assumes that mankind's activity plays a meaningful role in climate, of which I am skeptical. Generally speaking, when the American people hear the term ""global warming,"" they understand this to mean man-made global warming.\I wish the American people would step back and objectively seek the truth on this subject because too much is riding on it, both politically and economically. America has been passing laws related to man's impact on global warming that will impact our economy and freedoms, all of which may be based on questionable or bad science.\Watch and compare videos like ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and ""The Great Global Warming Swindle."" Dig deeper, listening and reading about the scientific facts on all sides of this issue. Questioning the motives of the media, scientists, politicians and businesses that have a stake in this issue. Question the assumptions that the computerized climate models are based on.\Over the last decade or so, the man-made global warming premise seems to have become a speeding train that keeps gaining momentum, making it decreasingly likely that legislatures will be publicly skeptical. I'm concerned about the effect the potential train wreck will have on our country if we don't slow down and make sure the destination really makes sense.\- Curt Williams, Verona"
56,"At his first press conference as president-elect, Barack Obama acknowledged that economic problems may slow his ability to deliver on campaign promises.\But he also said we ""cannot afford to wait"" on key concerns like clean energy. Access to affordable energy is one of the pillars of our economy and major investments in energy efficiency and clean, renewable electricity will stimulate economic growth and create jobs across the country.\This plan, heralded by some as a ""Green New Deal,"" will get millions of Americans who have lost their jobs back to work, lower energy costs for families struggling to make ends meet, and put the United States back in the leadership role on efforts to clean up the environment and address global warming.\President-elect Obama can inspire innovation from the U.S. energy industry by making it clear that his administration will do everything in its power to lower global warming pollution.\As a first step, the Obama administration must declare carbon dioxide a pollutant and work with Congress to pass a strong cap-and-trade policy that ensures polluters pay the American people for using our atmosphere as their private landfill.\To help boost economic growth and support industry, a Green New Deal would deploy contractors to renovate businesses, homes, and schools with the latest energy-efficient appliances and systems.\It would help automakers retool their factories to make modern, efficient cars, like plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. And it would put in place the necessary policies to unleash manufacturing and installment of wind turbines, solar panels, and upgraded transmission systems across the country, developing a clean, renewable, and smart electric grid for the 21st century.\The Green New Deal won't just provide us with new technologies - such a plan will also directly improve American livelihood by creating jobs and lowering energy costs for the average household.\To achieve its goals, the public-private partnership would put millions of Americans to work renovating homes, making cars, and building and installing appliances, wind turbines and solar panels.\Owning the most efficient vehicles and appliances will reduce the amount that Americans spend on daily transportation, electricity, and heat.\With decreased demand, energy prices could decrease along with our dependence on foreign oil. A smart grid powered by renewable energy like wind power - which already is less expensive over its lifetime than coal or nuclear - will carry these benefits into a cleaner future for our children.\The Green New Deal would be a significant shift from business as usual on energy policy. But the status quo clearly isn't helping the economy or the environment.\Our state can't absorb more job losses like when the auto industry shut down the GM plant in Janesville. Our economy isn't sustainable if we don't address global warming and increasing extreme weather events such as this summer's floods.\With the Green New Deal, President-elect Obama can help create family-sustaining jobs, lower energy costs, and stimulate economic growth. That is change we need. We cannot afford to wait."
57,"It is wonderful to read recent news articles stating negotiations between labor and management are proceeding in good faith and that state, county and city officials have offered every available incentive to keep Mercury Marine in Fond du Lac.\This economy has created an environment requiring all stakeholders to reassess marketing programs, contractual obligations, labor needs and many other variables.\However, the ultimate determination of Mercury's success will be the customer. Why do customers purchase Mercury motors over other brands? What effect will much higher gasoline prices or environmental regulations have on future sales?\Mercury customers are dealers or end users. Marine dealers are small businesspeople who take pride in the products they sell; they depend on the ability of the manufacturer to work with their local salespeople and mechanics.\As owner of the Ramada Plaza for six years, I was blessed with the opportunity to meet dealers from all over the world who traveled to Fond du Lac for meetings, plant tours and networking. The Aussies and Irish not only have wonderful accents, but enjoy tasting our local Wisconsin beers.\These dealers and Mercury marketing people share many ideas after the business day ends. Dealers choose to represent Mercury Marine because they are proud of the product that is designed, tested and ultimately built for their customers. They are impressed by and confident in the people and facilities here, knowing that after they return home from these meetings, Fond du Lac headquarters personnel continue to assist them.\Mercury boat motors have built a brand name based on decades of performance and dependability. However, diminished sales in this slow economy have created excess manufacturing capacity and slashed jobs.\Please speak out against recent cap and trade legislation being proposed in Washington and discussed in Madison. Such legislation would devastate manufacturers and large energy consumers. Higher costs mean higher prices and fewer sales to a shrinking customer base.\If you truly support local jobs and wish to see manufacturing remain in the United States, let your representatives and regulators know that we need to elevate human concerns over environmental extremism. The customer base for Mercury can only be increased if boaters are allowed access to our lakes and rivers, paying reasonable fees for permits and moderate prices for gasoline.\A balanced approach to the environment, which promotes human issues like good-paying manufacturing jobs, is needed to expand the number of consumers willing to buy quality Mercury Marine products.\Economist Paul Zane Pilzner states: ""To create a new business that makes money and, more significantly, employs others, and most significantly, gives a product to a customer that improves their life, is our greatest challenge, our greatest opportunity and the greatest gift -- far greater than any charity that we can give our fellow person.""\Mercury's dealers and customers trust Fond du Lac's quality work force and products. Don't take anything for granted. In these challenging times, encourage give and take on all sides to ensure a better future for Mercury.\After all, we are primarily talking about recreational boating. So let's all have more fun!\Ron Schmitz of Fond du Lac is the former owner of the Ramada Plaza Hotel and a financial representative for more than 30 years."
58,"Oops, no sooner were the electrons flying over the Internet last week on our carbon dioxide column (see ""Carbon dioxide cap will change investment playing field"") than the bill was shot down because some states would suffer ""undue hardship."" At least that's what 10 U.S. senators said in a letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., Friday as the main reason they couldn't support the Climate Security Act of 2008.\The bill would have set caps on carbon dioxide emissions and then the government would have sold allotments to those industries that emit carbon dioxide. While few expected the bill to become instant law, the failure of the bill to pass cloture to override a veto (cloture is a procedural move to end debate and move for immediate vote), meant the bill's supporters had no choice but to pull the bill from the floor. What does this mean for investors? Quite a lot.\First, it means that the federal government will move more slowly to avert the growth of carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, it will mean the market will have to tackle the problem through its price mechanism.\Second, the scope of the federal government's efforts to reduce carbon dioxide could also change. In other words, the ""tax"" on carbon dioxide - via the legislation - will be more contentious than previously anticipated. According to the letter the senators sent to Reid, ""the Lieberman-Warner bill has the potential to raise over $7 trillion."" That's quite a sum of money and that's why investors need to see how the bill eventually works out. It will not only affect our natural environment, but it will significantly jostle the investment landscape as well.\After last Friday's column, I received an interesting e-mail from Rick Terrien, the founder of Madison-based Business Diligence, LLC, an Internet-based company that helps entrepreneurs get started in business. Unlike some environmentalists who think only government intervention can reduce carbon dixoide emissions, Rick thinks we're entering, ""a renaissance age of entrepreneurship,"" that will greatly influence how we transform from a carbon dioxide-based economy to an alternative energy-based economy. I think Rick is on to something.\Along those lines, let me suggest one of the newest mutual funds to address what Rick is talking about, the DWS Climate Change Fund (WRMAX $9.93). This fund came to the market last September and is managed by Deutsche Asset Management. Deutsche may not be a household word to local investors, but the asset manager is a member of German-based financial giant Deutsche Bank Group that has 78,275 employees, operates in 76 countries, and has assets of more than $3.5 trillion.\First, Deutsche Asset Management is no newcomer to this climate change idea. Since 2006, it's invested more than $9 billion is what they call climate change investment strategies. Second, the fund is quite different than many of the other environmental funds that specialize in alternative energy like solar, wind, or biomass fuels. The DWS Climate Change Fund is built on the thesis that climate change will involve a major restructuring of our entire industrial base. We'll need to rethink and retool how we manufacture goods, how we transport the goods (and ourselves), how we harness new alternative energy sources, grow crops friendly to the environment, better manage our forests, secure adequate water supplies, and overall, help the populace maintain living and health standards during this transformation.\To achieve these diverse ends, Deutsche has identified a wide range of global companies that some investors might not readily associate with such ends. Domestic companies like Johnson Controls, Emerson Electric, and United Technologies, and foreign industrial companies like Schneider Electric (France), Solarworld (Germany), Gamesa Coporacion Tecnologica (Spain), and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (Spain), just to name a few.\The fund is currently selling at $9.93, down 7 cents from its inception price of $10 last September. Now some investors may be disappointed because the fund has not kept pace with some of the alternative energy funds. They shouldn't be because this fund isn't an energy fund. It's more like a big cap global stock fund designed to meet the challenges - and opportunities - that will confront us as the effects of global warming force us to convert from our existing fossil fuel based-economy to an eco-friendly-based economy.\I know many environmentalists are fretting about how petulant and shortsighted many of our political leaders are about global warming. The cap and trade bill, in particular, showed how regional interests can sway even the most ardent supporters of global warming legislation. But they should take solace that free-market forces - namely higher energy prices - are creating incentives to reverse global warming's impact on our world economy. The DWS Climate Fund invests in companies that have these incentives.\Ray Unger is chairman of Forward Investment Advisors in Madison. He can be reached at 833-9400."
59,"Press-Gazette Washington Bureau lbivins@greenbaypressgazette.com\WASHINGTON -- The record-setting heat during the summer of 1988 could become the norm in Wisconsin if steps aren't taken to curb emissions that cause global warming, according to a new report.\Hotter summers and increased flooding caused by heavier rainfall are among the extreme consequences the Union of Concerned Scientists found in a study of the impact of climate change on the Badger State.\Wisconsin also would experience long droughts, more smog-filled days, a possible increase in crop-destroying pests and up to a two-foot drop in the Great Lakes water levels.\The Wisconsin report is part of an ongoing effort by the advocacy group to examine how climate change would affect different regions.\The combined emissions in those states are double the output in the United Kingdom and would make the Midwest the world's fourth largest polluter if it were a nation, the report said.\Already, changes in the Midwest climate are taking root.\""Over the past 50 years, we've seen higher average annual temperatures, more frequent downpours, longer growing seasons and fewer cold snaps,"" said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University and a co-author of the report.\The Union of Concerned Scientists is a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit group of scientists and citizens that advocate for the environment. Its latest report is based on research and new data consistent with a study released in June by a consortium of 13 federal agencies.\The report assesses the impact of global warming on Wisconsin using two scenarios: one based on nothing being done to lower emissions, the other based on lower emissions resulting from an increased use of clean energy sources.

60,"After repeatedly raising the specter of doing something meaningful to combat climate change, the Obama administration has unveiled ambitious plans to cut carbon emissions from power plants by nearly one-third over the next 15 years. But whether that will actually occur is anyone's guess. There are many variables and there are bound to be roadblocks -- and lawsuits.\But several things are perfectly clear. For starters, the United States should be leading by example, cutting all types of emissions that foul the air and water and jeopardize both the environment and people's health. What's more, the administration has great leeway, under the Clean Air Act, to take definitive steps.\The administration's plans, in fact, give the states considerable flexibility in terms of achieving the goal. But a substantial amount of the heavy lifting would have to be done after President Barack Obama leaves office, so, like many environmental and energy policies we have seen pitched over the last few decades, this one is subject to change.\Nevertheless, Obama's intentions are not just laudable, they are critically important. The administration hopes to see other countries agree to curb carbon emissions, but the United States is not exactly in a position to talk at this point. The United States creates about 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases.\Following the administration's announcement, China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, did say it would set a cap on its emissions by 2016. Promises are nice, but they are no substitute for a legally binding agreement covering all nations. A preponderance of evidence from climatologists has shown global warming exists -- and that humans are contributing to the problem via these emissions. Melting glaciers, changing weather patterns and warmer temperatures all have been documented. But, as a world leader, the United States has been far too slow to react, to make the necessary policy changes to combat the problem, including putting a smarter energy strategy in place.\Wind, solar and other renewable energy projects all should be supported but so should conservation efforts and incentives. But a sharp, broad policy also means allowing natural gas deposits to be unearthed and nuclear power to be increased in appropriate areas, strategies that many environmental groups refuse to accept as necessary.\Other excellent models are available, and New York is participating in one. New York has joined more than a half-dozen states to set up a market-based trading plan -- commonly called cap-and-trade -- that allows plants to buy or sell certain emission allowances as long as overall goals are being met. New York's efforts, in part, are why many environmentalists and policymakers are upbeat about the Empire State achieving the goal set forth by the Obama administration.\Realistically, no single strategy will or should be employed to curb emissions. But setting benchmarks and hitting them are imperative, for both people and the environment.\-- Poughkeepsie Journal, New York"

63,"Unions focus on worker safety\In regard to ""Masonry students build skills"" in the March 24 Daily Tribune, the article talks about teaching apprentices who work for contractors who belong to the American Builders and Contractors Association, or ABC.\The majority of these contractors who belong to this association are nonunion contractors. Fred Cordy is the teacher of the apprenticeship class. He is also a master mason for Ted Zvolena, who owns a nonunion masonry company. As the article states, Cordy would watch and show the students what they did wrong. However, the picture indicates that the student who is doing the demolition on the wall, with a sledgehammer, is not wearing any eye protection whatsoever. OSHA regulation 1926.102 requires eye and/or face protection when doing work that could be a hazard to your eyes and/or face.\I sure am glad that when I took my OSHA 10+ safety class with Laborers' Local Union 1407 they stressed eye and/or face protection. It is good to know that the unions' apprenticeship programs address safety as a very important issue. Do you think if the nonunion contractors took safety into consideration, like your union contractors do, the bidding of construction jobs would be more competitive? With Workers Memorial Day coming up on April 28 with the motto ""Good jobs, safe jobs, protect workers now,"" it makes you feel good that your unions are looking out for your health, safety and well-being at all times.\Maybe the American Builders and Contractors Association should get a union master mason to teach their apprentices how to work safe at all times, even in class.\DALE INGEBRIGTSEN\Wisconsin Rapids\Smoke ban not business killer\I am writing in response to the article ""Officials consider ban on smoking"" printed in the April 12 issue of the Daily Tribune. I would like to point out that there is not one single scientific study that has found an adverse economic effect of smoke-free ordinances. This finding is after literally hundreds of studies conducted in a wide variety of communities around the country.\One study done close to home, the Dane County Economic Study of Smoke-Free Restaurants, reveals no loss of revenue with more than 800 restaurants in Dane County. Madison has been smoke-free for nine years. Thus far, the Wisconsin Restaurant Association has not produced examples of businesses devastated by the Madison ordinance. Having one or two business owners from a community speculate on the effects of a smoke-free ban is not credible.\People go to restaurants to eat, not to smoke. They choose restaurants that provide good food, good service and a sanitary environment. Suggesting that someone would drive somewhere else to avoid a non-smoking environment is pure speculation. However, if you do believe that this will happen, then you also should believe that the 75 percent of people who do not smoke also would be driving around looking to dine in nonsmoking establishments.\Also, tobacco control advocates like myself are pro-business. I have lived in this community for nearly 35 years, and I plan on staying here. I want Wisconsin Rapids businesses to thrive, not to perish.\What the community of Wisconsin Rapids needs to focus on is this: an ordinance is a reasonable and commonsense solution to a public health problem and we all can benefit from adopting one.\DANITA CARLSON\Tobacco prevention specialist\Wood County Health Department\Wisconsin Rapids\Cut mercury, not deals\The United States banned the use of leaded gasoline due to a severe threat to public health after a lengthy debate reminiscent of the battle being fought today against mercury contamination. During that time, the gasoline industry worked hard to delay the ban on lead, much as the coal industry is trying hard to avoid stringent mercury reductions today.\Instead of using the available technology to comply with the Clean Air Act and reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent by 2008, the Bush administration proposes a ""cap and trade"" policy, effectively allowing coal-burning power plants to continue to pollute and threaten the health of America's citizens, especially its children.\Mercury contamination is a huge concern in Wisconsin, reflected by the fact that the Department of Natural Resources has issued warnings against consuming fish from any of our lakes or rivers. It is time for the administration to heed medical advice instead of the coal industry.\KATHERINE MOLTER\Madison"
64,"Wisconsin would get 25 percent of its power from renewable sources by the end of 2025, cut greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, and break its longstanding dependence on coal-fired power plants under proposed climate change legislation made public Thursday.\But critics warned the plan could come at a cost to residential and industrial energy users, who would likely foot the bill for the billions of dollars in facility and infrastructure improvements such ambitious targets would require.\Ahead of his trip next week to the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, Gov. Jim Doyle said the legislation would boost Wisconsin's future by changing the state's status as an energy importer.\""It is an enormous economic opportunity for us,"" Doyle said in a conference call Friday. ""We do not have coal. We do not have gas. We do not have petroleum. Every dollar we spend on fuel that comes from those sources of energy is a dollar that leaves the state of Wisconsin.""\The measure, billed as the Clean Energy Jobs Act, is based on recommendations by the Governor's Task Force on Global Warming. Drafted by Reps. Spencer Black, D-Madison, and Jim Soletski, D-Green Bay, and Sens. Mark Miller, D-Monona, and Jeff Plale, D-South Milwaukee, the bill would:\* Increase the amount of all electric energy consumed from renewable sources in the state from about 5 percent now to 10 percent by the end of 2013, 20 percent by the end of 2020, and 25 percent by the end of 2025.\* Reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane by 2014 to the same levels as 2005. By 2022, it would require emissions be 22 percent less than emissions in 2005 and 75 percent less by 2050.\* Reduce the state's energy consumption by 1 percent in 2011, 1.5 percent in 2013, and 2 percent in 2015 and each year after that.\The bill does not propose a state or regional cap-and-trade system similar to proposals being debated before Congress.\High infrastructure costs\Assembly Speaker Mike Sheridan, D-Janesville, and Senate Majority Leader Russ Decker, D-Weston, haven't yet weighed in on the legislation, which has not yet been introduced.\But a spokesman for the state's largest users of electricity said manufacturers had ""some very deep concerns"" about the bill.\Todd Stuart, executive director of the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, said his member companies were already struggling to keep assembly-line jobs in the state and couldn't afford large long-term hikes in their utility bills. ""Every new cost is a burden,"" he said.\In a report by The Beacon Hill Institute of Boston for the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, both conservative think tanks, the authors found that the cost of meeting the state's proposed renewable energy mandate through 2025 would be $16.2 billion - enough to run all of state government for half a year.\To get the estimate, the Institute projected the cost of building wind farms and electric plants that burn biofuels and then subtracted the savings that would be gained by not building conventional power plants.\Doing nothing also costly?\But Wisconsin may also face serious costs to its economy and its environment if it fails to act, according to a letter sent to the state's congressional delegation this week by dozens of state scientists.\The letter said rising temperatures could lead to summer droughts as well as intense rainfalls that could harm state farms and infrastructure. Trout could disappear from local streams like Black Earth Creek and winter sports and tourism essential to state businesses could partially melt away, the scientists wrote.\""Doing nothing is not a viable option for Wisconsin,"" the group wrote.\Black said the bill would create ""tens of thousands"" of jobs by cutting down on the $20 billion a year it sends out of the state through spending on fossil fuels.\Dan Kohler, executive director of Wisconsin Environment, said Wisconsin's forests, farms and manufacturing base makes the state well-positioned to thrive economically through green jobs and renewable energy businesses, such as wind or biomass energy companies.\""I am hopeful that this legislation can reduce Wisconsin's dependence on fossil fuels,"" he said.\Economist David Ward, president of NorthStar Economics in Madison, said he was skeptical the bill would create jobs in a state that is suffering from 8.4 percent unemployment. Wisconsin has the highest share of jobs in the country in manufacturing, a sector that would be heavily affected if energy prices rise, he noted.\""I don't care how you slice it, (factories use) energy and a lot of energy,"" Ward said.\- Contact Mary Spicuzza at mspi cuzza@madison.com or 608-252-6122; contact Jason Stein at jstein@madison.com or 608-252-6129.\Credit: By MARY SPICUZZA and JASON STEIN Wisconsin State Journal"
65," When it comes to global warming, the Bush administration puts its faith in volunteerism and new energy technologies to scale back America's mountain of heat-trapping gases.\ Government studies say the results are at best uncertain, but one thing is not: Each year, the mountain of ""greenhouse"" gases emitted by the United States gets bigger.\ While the rest of the developed world requires - but doesn't always achieve - mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide and other emissions, the nation adding the most gases to the atmosphere is deadlocked in a debate over how to deal with it.\ Individual states, meanwhile, are taking the lead.\ Voluntary programs emphasized by President Bush since 2002 are claimed to be sparing the atmosphere 300 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, or 4 percent of U.S. emissions.\ But the government doesn't know - and often can't verify - whether the reductions reported by 230 U.S. companies are real.\ ""It's difficult to prove,"" said Paul McArdle, who manages the Energy Department's voluntary reporting system. ""It's my sense that some of these are real reductions.""\ What's more, McArdle acknowledged, companies can increase their emissions overall but still claim cutbacks by counting as reductions such steps as replacing old lighting, using more efficient vehicles or planting trees.\ Monitoring inexact\ In a review last April, Congress' Government Accountability Office questioned Washington's ability to monitor these voluntary efforts. ""Determining the reductions attributable to each program will be challenging,"" it said.\ In one program with measurable results, it estimated companies have reduced emissions by no more than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution. Total U.S. emissions - now more than 7 billion tons a year - still are projected to rise 14 percent from 2002 to 2012.\ Carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the biggest of the greenhouse gases, so called because they create a heat-trapping blanket when released into the atmosphere. Others are methane, nitrous oxide and synthetic gases.\ The atmosphere holds more carbon dioxide now than it has for hundreds of thousands of years, and the Earth's surface warmed an average 1 degree over the past century.\ As a first step, the White House talks of reducing the ""intensity"" of U.S. carbon pollution - not shrinking emissions overall, but reducing the carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic growth.\ ""Our objective is to significantly slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and, as the science justifies, stop it and then reverse it,"" said James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ""We're making good progress. It's reasonably ambitious, but it still provides for reasonable human welfare.""\ Shortly after taking office, President Bush rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which requires 36 industrial nations to cut global warming gases by 2012 by an average 5 percent below 1990 levels.\ He argued that cutting the U.S. share to below 6 billion tons a year, as the treaty would have required, would have cost 5 million U.S. jobs. He objected, too, that such high-polluting developing nations as China and India were not required to reduce emissions.\ Progress, or failure\ Some members of Congress agree with the gradualist Bush approach, while others do not, Republicans among them.\ ""Everybody's talking about it. What the American people want is for somebody to start doing something about it,"" complained Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., House Science Committee chairman.\ ""If we can't make a relatively simple change in (automobile) mileage regulations - a change to an existing regulation that doesn't even require new technology and that would have numerous benefits aside from the climate implications - then what does that say about our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?"" Boehlert said. ""It certainly doesn't say anything good.""\ Instead, the United States is spending $3 billion each year researching technologies to cut global warming and $2 billion on climate research. In a program called the Asia-Pacific Partnership, Bush also is working with Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea - producers of half the world's greenhouse gases - to attract private money for cleaner energy technologies.\ Connaughton calls that joint effort a major breakthrough. Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, calls it an ""excuse for further delay.""\ Bioenergy promoted\ Bush envisions using more hydrogen-powered vehicles, electricity from renewable energy sources and clean coal technology.\ The Energy Department's technology program has helped build 34,000 new energy-efficient homes and it plans to create ""bioenergy"" research centers and to advance research into hydrogen fuel and fusion energy. Its director, Stephen Eule, promises breakthroughs in the coming decades.\ Scientists say climate disruptions may occur before that, however, and critics in Congress and elsewhere say the government effort is too slow and needs refocusing.\ The plan ""appears stalled near the starting line,"" said Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who leads a House subcommittee overseeing the program. A review in May by the Energy Department's own research lab in Oak Ridge, Tenn., said the program focuses too much on work that can lead to ""only incremental improvements."" It called for more emphasis on ""exploratory, out-of-the-box concepts.""\ ""There is a need for more high-risk but high-payoff research,"" the review concluded.\ A new government economic analysis sees markets in combination with research as the way to go.\ The Congressional Budget Office report last month said any cost- effective U.S. policy on global warming must put a price on carbon - via an emissions tax or a ""cap and trade"" system of buying and selling emissions allowances among companies, as in Europe.\ ""Setting a current price for carbon emissions and announcing planned future carbon prices not only would induce firms and households to change their behavior but also would increase their demand for technologies that would reduce emissions,"" CBO researchers said.\ California dreaming?\ States aren't waiting for Washington.\ On Sept. 28, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation imposing a first-in-the-nation emissions cap on utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020. An earlier California law ordered 30 percent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. And Schwarzenegger and British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans this summer to work toward a possible joint emissions-trading market.\ Such a market pact is close to becoming reality among eight Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, which plan to impose caps on power plant emissions and encourage trading of allowances among utilities. Twenty-eight states in all have drawn up plans to combat warming, with some - notably Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico and North Carolina - also working toward possible mandatory limits on gases. Ten states plan to enact California's auto rule, if it survives a current court challenge.\ Some businesses want national caps now on carbon emissions, believing them inevitable. ""It is very difficult to have a product that is regulated significantly differently from state to state,"" said Bill Gerwing, environmental policy director for the oil company BP America.\ Continuing doubt\ Contributing to Washington's impasse is skepticism in some quarters about whether global warming is even a problem.\ The Senate Environment chairman, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., likens concerns about the Earth warming to Chicken Little saying the sky is falling.\ ""Global warming is an alarmism. It's a type of a hoax,"" said Inhofe. ""The reality is that a cap on carbon is a cap on the economy, through the rationing of energy.""\ Similar thinking pervades the House, Boehlert said. ""The scientific consensus has simply not pierced through the ideological barriers,"" he said.\ Former Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., who in 1988 led the first major legislative attempt to curb greenhouse gases, said next month's congressional elections could provide the ""most important push"" in the debate.\ In her current job helping the Environmental Protection Agency recruit companies to cut carbon, she finds more shareholders viewing climate change as a top concern, she said.\ ""You've got the push of shareholders and eventually the pull of Congress moving America,"" Schneider said. ""We just need a new Congress.""\ Elements of the Kyoto Protocol\ GASES: Seeks to control emissions of six heat-trapping gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.\ TARGETS: Assigns numerical targets for reducing or limiting emissions, compared with 1990 benchmark, for 36 industrialized countries among 140 nations that ratified pact. The United States hasn't ratified.\ TRADING: Allows emissions trading among the 36 countries. Industrial plants that emit less than allotted can sell resulting ""credits"" to those that exceed their allowances.\ JOINT IMPLEMENTATION: Allows nation to earn credits for financing emissions-reduction projects in another country subject to Kyoto controls.\ CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM: Allows country to earn credits via emission-reduction projects in developing nations, which are not obliged to cut emissions."
66,"For more than a decade, customers at Madison Gas & Electric have voted with their pocketbooks for cleaner energy.\Under the voluntary ""Green Power Tomorrow"" program, more than 12,000 MGE customers - nearly 10 percent of its total customer base - pay on average a premium of about $6 per month to get their electricity from such nonpolluting sources as wind.\""It's been a very reasonable way to reduce our carbon footprint,"" says Tom Yager, 37, a stay-at-home father of two who lives in Seminole Forest. ""It's also helped us track how much electricity we're using and find ways to cut back.""\MGE's program has been so successful, in fact, that the company was recently honored by the U.S. Department of Energy with its Utility Green Power Program of the Year Award.\But the bigger question facing all utility customers across Wisconsin is whether they are willing to pay more for their electricity - by some accounts 30 percent more - in the name of saving the planet. Proposed federal rules aimed at curbing such greenhouse gas emissions as carbon dioxide (CO2) would fall most heavily on such states as Wisconsin that rely on fossil fuels to generate most of their electricity.\Despite some progress in developing renewable sources of electicity like wind and biomass, coal burning remains the single largest source of air pollution in Wisconsin, accounting for some 35 percent of the state's total greenhouse gas emissions. By trapping heat in the atmosphere, these gases contribute to the warming of the planet, which has climate experts warning of melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels and violent storms.\The U.S. House of Representatives in June narrowly passed a bill to cap carbon emissions from power plants and eventually charge utility companies and their customers for exceeding them. The U.S. Senate is now working on a similar measure that could end up on the desk of President Barack Obama, who campaigned on the promise of addressing global climate change.\Under either the House or Senate version, Wisconsin loses, says Roy Thilly, who chaired Gov. Jim Doyle's Global Warming Task Force that last year presented a list of recommendations for addressing climate change on a statewide basis.\""What they're talking about now in Washington is a huge wealth transfer from the coal-dependent states to the coasts,"" says Thilly, CEO of Sun Prairie-based Wisconsin Public Power Inc., an electric-buying cooperative that serves 50 municipal utilities across the region and would face price pressure under carbon limits.\One dire warning from the National Association of Manufacturers says the federal global warming legislation in the House could cost Wisconsin more than 50,000 jobs because of higher energy prices and the cost of complying with required emissions cuts.\""From what I've seen none of this looks good for Wisconsin,"" says Scott Manley, who heads environmental programs for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state's largest business lobbying group. ""As those costs increase, it puts us increasingly at a disadvantage with other states or countries.""\And Wisconsin's electric rates, once among the lowest in the nation, have been steadily climbing as the state has scrambled to build cleaner power plants and expand its transmission system following near blackouts in 1996 and 1997.\Whether any climate change legislation actually makes it way out of the Senate and onto President Obama's desk remains to be seen. Stories over the past week suggest a bill could be stalled until next year or later.\Still, the dilemma for Wisconsin is how to transition into the future without breaking the bank. The state's two dozen ""baseload"" coal-fired power plants still supply the bulk of the electricity for homes, farms, businesses and factories. They can't simply be shut down or quickly replaced by less-polluting sources.\""Climate change needs to be addressed but it needs to be done in a way that mitigates costs for consumers,"" says Thilly.\If Wisconsin is eventually penalized under any carbon ""cap and trade"" system, it may only have itself to blame. Despite a lot of talk on the clean energy front over the past two decades, Wisconsin still depends on coal, oil or natural gas to generate two-thirds of its home-grown electric supply.\Figures from the state Public Service Commission show that 17 percent of electric sales in June 2009 came from renewable sources. But much of that was imported from outside the state, including Minnesota, the Midwest's leading wind producer.\Three new coal-fired power plants (two at Oak Creek and another in Wausau) are just beginning to come on-line. With a combined generating capacity of some 1,700 megawatts - enough electricity to power more than 1 million households - these plants dwarf any efforts to date on wind-, solar- or biofuel-generated electricity. The much-publicized Bent Tree Wind Farm in southern Minnesota that was just approved to serve customers of Madison-based Alliant Energy, for instance, would produce up to 200 megawatts of electricity under the most ideal wind conditions.\""I'm afraid we'll be paying for the mistake of investing in coal for a long time,"" says state Rep. Spencer Black, D-Madison.\To spur the state to change course, Black is helping to draft a ""Clean Energy Jobs Act"" he thinks will jump-start the state economy, improve the environment and create thousands of new jobs in the emerging energy field. Much of the bill is based on the recommendations of the Global Warming Task Force, which completed its work last year.\Wisconsin already has set a target of having utilities get a combined 10 percent of their electric sales from renewable sources by 2015, a goal that appears within reach. MGE and WPPI are already near or above their renewable energy targets, according to the state Public Service Commission.\The Clean Energy Jobs Act would accelerate that agenda, raising the renewable mandate to 25 percent by 2025. It also sets a goal of reducing Wisconsin greenhouse gas emissions 22 percent by 2022 and improving energy conservation by 2 percent annually.\""This bill not only makes sense for our environment, it makes sense for our economy,"" says Black, who chairs the Assembly Natural Resources Committee. ""We send over $20 billion a year out of our state's economy to purchase fossil fuels. That's an incredible drain on our prosperity.""\But the energy bill, which Black predicts will be the most hotly debated piece of legislation in the winter session at the Capitol, is already generating opposition even before it's been introduced.\Rep. Phil Montgomery, R-Green Bay, who served on the Global Warming Task Force, questions whether the bill is attempting to go too far too fast.\Montgomery was a supporter of the state's 10 percent by 2015 renewable goal but says 25 percent by 2025 might be unreasonable for utilities and businesses.\""There's a cost that's going to go with this, and the economic ramifications are scary,"" he told the Daily Reporter, a Milwaukee-based building trades news service, last week. ""People keep talking about how this is going to be a jobs creator. Well, show me the numbers.""\The Global Warming Task Force report did not include estimates on how many jobs its recommendations would create, although supporters say the state, with its manufacturing capacity, is poised to become a leader in the energy field whether by building wind towers or installing solar panels.\At the same time, a report in June from the Pew Charitable Trusts says Wisconsin is actually losing clean energy jobs at a rate of 0.6 percent per year compared with a 1.4 percent growth rate in Minnesota.\And with the state economy already struggling with manufacturing job losses, WMC's Manley is concerned that additional mandates or tougher limits on emissions will further hamstring business efforts. He estimates it could cost $15 billion to reach the 25 percent renewable goal within the next 15 years.\""The fact is, these things are not free, they are tremendously expensive,"" he says.\WMC has even come out with a survey showing that while Wisconsin residents are concerned about global warming and clean energy, most aren't ready to pay more to address it. The survey of likely voters found that 73 percent are opposed to any increased fees on utility bills to pay for energy conservation. Those polled were, by a 3-1 margin, also against paying as little as $25 a month to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\But clean energy advocates say this is exactly the time to be pushing energy alternatives.\They point to a competing survey from the Forest County Potawatomi showing widespread support for reductions in greenhouse gases like CO2. The poll found support for climate change legislation crossing party lines, with 53 percent of Republicans, 67 percent of independents and 87 percent of Democrats favoring action at the state level.\Michael Vickerman, executive director of Renew Wisconsin, thinks the state should set ambitious goals and send a signal it's serious about wind, solar and other clean energy alternatives.\""Even if we reach 10 percent (renewables) by 2015 it doesn't mean you just stop there,"" he says.\To that end, Gov. Doyle last month signed legislation to allow uniform rules for the development of small wind farms. Vickerman calls it the most significant piece of clean energy legislation ever passed in Wisconsin, crediting WMC for helping to make it happen. ""They really helped us line up Republican votes, otherwise I don't think it would have passed,"" says Vickerman.\The new law requires the PSC to issue standardized rules for the entire state. Local units of government would then apply these standards as they consider small wind farms of under 100 megawatts.\Vickerman is optimistic that wind power will continue to gain support in the state. He says a project to watch is the proposed Glacier Hills wind project in Columbia County from We Energies that would add 90 turbines producing up to 162 megawatts of electricity.\While Wisconsin doesn't have the ideal landscape for wind power as does Minnesota, Vickerman says that's no reason to stand pat.\""Our wind resources are robust enough,"" he says. ""If we were fully committed, we could accommodate another 1,000 megawatts.""\Jennifer Feyerherm, director of the Clean Energy Campaign for the Madison office of the Sierra Club, thinks capturing energy from the sun has tremendous potential in Wisconsin. She notes that Germany has been installing solar power at the rate of 3 megawatts of electricity a day.\In contrast, the entire state of Wisconsin currently produces just 1 megawatt from solar power - enough electricity to power 600 households. But Feyerherm says Wisconsin could do better, given its climate. ""Wisconsin's solar exposure is much more than Germany's.""\The Sierra Club has also been working to reduce coal burning in the state. It filed a federal lawsuit alleging pollution violations at UW-Madison's Charter Street heating plant, prompting Gov. Doyle to order the end of coal burning at three state power plants in Madison. The Charter Street Plant is being converted to burn wood chips and other biomass material.\There has been other progress on the biomass front, with We Energies pursuing a 50-megawatt plant in central Wisconsin that could burn wood chips, switchgrass or other plant materials. And Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy is converting its Bay Front Power Plant in Ashland to use waste wood as its primary source of fuel.\Coal has been the fuel of choice in Wisconsin since electric service began in the state during the late 19th century. It was cheap, plentiful and easy to store - even if it had to be transported in railroad cars.\""We should not be ashamed that we used coal to get the state where it is,"" says Eric Callisto, chairman of the state Public Service Commission.\The PSC, a three-member regulatory panel appointed by the governor, took what many considered a monumental step a year ago when it unanimously rejected a proposal from Alliant Energy for a new 300-megawatt coal-fired power plant near Cassville. Alliant had pitched the facility as the next generation of cleaner coal plants since it would also have burned switchgrass, a renewable biofuel. But the PSC didn't buy it.\""It was largely a coal plant with a biomass veneer,"" says Callisto, an attorney appointed by Doyle to head the commission in May 2008.\While coal has proven less expensive, helping to keep Wisconsin utility rates low until recently, these cost advantages disappear once carbon caps or emission taxes are figured into the equation.\With 39 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually, Wisconsin ranks 20th in the country, according to the latest figures from the U.S. Energy Information Association. That compares to a western state like Washington, for example, which has a million more residents than Wisconsin but emits just a third of the CO2 because much of its power comes from carbon-neutral hydroelectric dams.\Callisto is hopeful that any climate change legislation coming down the pike will give Wisconsin and other coal states time to transition into cleaner sources of electricity. Some of that includes converting existing coal plants to cleaner-burning natural gas, what MGE is doing with its Blount Street power plant.\But Callisto says the state's energy future will be a mix of sources that could include nuclear power.\""It's not going to be just one thing,"" he says. ""We need to enhance our renewable portfolio, do more on conservation and relax our moratorium on nuclear.""\Wisconsin currently has two nuclear generating facilities, at Point Beach and Kewaunee, which combined produce about 1,600 megawatts of electricity. But in the wake of the Three Mile Island scare in the late 1970s, the state declared a moratorium on any new nuclear plants.\Unlike coal, nuclear energy produces no greenhouse gas emissions and could prove a better cost option for ratepayers in such states as Wisconsin that have no coal or gas reserves. Advances in nuclear technology in the past 20 years have also significantly reduced the amount of spent fuel that must be stored.\The Clean Energy Jobs Act championed by Rep. Black will likely include some easing of the nuclear moratorium but it's unclear if it would lift the ban entirely. Some Democrats have said they won't support lifting the ban until a long-term waste solution is reached.\State Rep. Mike Huebsch, R-West Salem, and two other Republicans in the Legislature plan to introduce a stand-alone bill to end Wisconsin's ban on new nuclear power plants. Huebsch has proposed similar measures in past sessions but never garnered enough support, even when Republicans controlled the Assembly.\Even if Wisconsin did lift its ban, nuclear plants are expensive to build and would likely face opposition from environmental groups. It could take a decade or more to even get a nuclear plant on the drawing board given the slow pace of the approval process.\That leaves energy conservation as perhaps the most affordable and most immediate option for shrinking the state's carbon footprint. A report from the Energy Center of Wisconsin released in August suggests the state could cut its collective electric bill by $900 million annually simply through improvements in energy efficiency. It says conservation could reduce energy use statewide by 1.6 percent each year. The savings both in electricity and in natural gas could generate between 7,000 and 9,000 net jobs in the state, the report says.\Susan Stratton, executive director of the Energy Center, says energy conservation has the added benefit of compounding over time.\""Each year that we invest in efficiency programs, the dollars saved continue to accrue, economic development and job opportunities grow, and greenhouse gas emissions drop further,"" she says.\MGE Green Power customer Yager has already taken steps to make his home more energy-efficient. He invested in a new blower fan for the family's furnace after seeing how much electricity it was drawing.\""You normally don't think about things like that but the little stuff all adds up,"" he says.\mivey@madison.com\Credit: By Mike Ivey"

If necessity is the mother of invention, comfort and immediate self-interest are its disablers. Hence, the mantra by opponents that cap and trade and a shift to renewables will cost jobs and economic recovery. In fact, energy independence and producing the technology and wares to get a cleaner environment could have the opposite effect in the long term. China is going green. Us? Still frozen by fear for our comfort and immediate profits. Shortsighted is an understatement.

68,"I've been a Democrat for as long as I can remember. This year, I won't be voting for any Democrats at the federal level. And if President Barack Obama were running for re-election right now, I can't say I'd vote for him either.\In 2008, then-Sen. Obama said a lot of things, especially about change and hope. I wanted to believe, and I still want to believe. He pushed a health care reform plan that guaranteed affordable health care for all Americans. Instead, we got a bill that nibbles at the edges, helps a few people, but fundamentally doesn't change a thing.\He told us Internet neutrality would be a priority in his first year. Now we learn the FCC is beginning to bend to the demands of Internet providers. He said he favored a market-based cap-and-trade system to help clean up the environment. It doesn't look like that's coming anytime soon. And these are the highlights.\While he promised a phased withdrawal from Iraq, we got a simple rebranding of forces remaining in the country. Combat troops are still there and combat operations are continuing, just under a new identity. He called for a repeal of the Patriot Act in 2003, voted to reauthorize it in 2006, and recently supported legislation to grant immunity to corporations that cooperated with the warrantless surveillance programs.\He promised that the Guantanamo Bay prison would close within a year, but it's still open. He said he opposed torture, but continues to authorize extraordinary rendition. And he has refused to investigate the allegations of the use of torture by the Bush administration.

69,"Clean energy has the potential to be big business for Wisconsin as well as easier on the Earth.\Tucked away in news about layoffs and the economic crisis last month was Energy Composites Corp.'s announcement that it plans to build a new wind turbine blade manufacturing plant in Wisconsin Rapids. The plant is expected to employ at least 400 people, welcome news in a county where plant closings have eliminated more than 600 jobs in the past year.\Both Congress and the Wisconsin Legislature are currently crafting measures designed to encourage clean, renewable energy and to discourage more traditional sources, such as coal and oil. Some of the ideas they have forwarded are simple common sense, others not so much.\In recent visits from U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin and Wisconsin Environment director Dan Kohler to the Green Bay Press-Gazette, we heard that the state and federal initiatives both aim to generate more electricity from renewable sources, possibly with a mandate of 25 percent by 2025. Both also aim to set higher standards for energy efficiency. These are laudable goals, and Wisconsin can play a major role in reaching them, with companies like Energy Composites in the mix.\Baldwin would prefer that nuclear energy not be part of the federal bill, but for a reason we find reassuring. With a large chunk of Northeastern Wisconsin's electricity generated at nuclear power plants, some environmentalists' hostility toward that option is disconcerting. Baldwin's sense is that adding nuclear to the clean energy bill would create a controversy that could threaten its passage, but she added she believes nuclear will go forward.\""How do you get (significant greenhouse gas reductions) without nuclear?"" she said when she met with the Press-Gazette editorial board.\We're not as impressed with the idea of a cap-and-trade system, which would set a ceiling on pollution and allow companies that exceed those levels to ""buy"" the right to higher toxic emissions from companies that don't pollute as much. It sounds like a costly shell game.\With coal producing more than 60 percent of the nation's electricity, we like Baldwin's idea of funding research and development into areas like carbon capture and sequestering techniques. Coal remains one of the United States' most abundant natural resources, and finding cleaner ways to utilize it seems a wise course.\Kohler noted that Minnesota and Illinois have already passed laws aiming to get 25 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2025, so Wisconsin has some catching up to do. But, he also said, ""Wisconsin has the capacity, through our abundance of natural resources and strong manufacturing and agricultural base, to be a regional and national leader"" in this area.\The desire to breathe clean air is bipartisan. Well-crafted clean energy legislation can be a great thing for the Badger State."
70,"
The Bush administration has started talking a better, if not yet good, game on climate change. But it's still a step behind on what's needed, which is action. The good news is that a proposal in Congress would finally get the United States to take that first real step.
\
Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) and John Warner (R-Va.) have introduced legislation that would set reasonable goals of reducing the nation's carbon emissions while putting in place measures to protect the economy. The bill is a good start toward addressing what science generally regards as the great global challenge of this century. The bill deserves to become law.
\
The bill sets a goal of reducing emissions from the power, industrial and transportation fuel sectors by 15% in 2020 and 70% by 2050 compared with 2005 emissions levels. Targeting those sectors is important because they account for about 75% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The bill achieves these goals through a cap-and-trade system that has worked well in the fight against acid rain and that would provide incentives for investment and innovation in emission-reduction technologies, according to the National Environmental Trust. The system would set a mandatory limit on carbon dioxide emissions for the targeted sectors and would provide a market-based mechanism for the buying and selling of pollution credits.
\
Furthermore, the system would use the money earned from the auction of pollution allowances to protect low-income consumers from higher energy costs, would help states with the transition to cleaner energy and would invest in new technologies and help workers in today's energy companies learn the skills they're going to need to meet the nation's future energy needs.
\
The bill - America's Climate Security Act - could probably use some tweaking, but as Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said in an article in Environment and Energy Daily, ""We have the framework here. Every single issue anybody can raise about global warming has been raised and addressed on this bill, giving us a perfect place to start.""
\
Supporters hope to move the bill through Congress quickly. Given the urgency of the issue and the do-nothing attitude that the Bush administration has held for so long, that's only reasonable.

He calls it ""the greatest assault to freedom in my lifetime"" and says it's government-run health care that's too expensive. He supports repealing the law and replacing it with proposals on insurance portability, malpractice and tort reform, mandate reduction and the ability to sell insurance across state lines. While he opposes the health reform law, he does support a safety net for those with pre-existing conditions. He favors better technology to root out Medicaid and Medicare fraud.\On the economic stimulus:\Johnson opposes the stimulus, saying it hasn't worked to create new jobs and has added greatly to the federal budget deficit. He said a better stimulus for the business community would have been to make the Bush tax cuts permanent, lessening uncertainty.\On taxes:\Johnson favors making permanent the Bush tax cuts, saying it would lead to increased federal revenue.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The writer is addressing the question, Can President-elect Obama make good on his pledge to slash carbon-dioxide emissions 80 percent by mid-century?
\
President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to cut America's carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050--a goal that most of the world's scientists believe is vital to avoid catastrophic global climate change.
\
In a recent video message to a U.S. Governors' Conference on global warming headed by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Obama assured the governors of both parties that his administration will ""engage vigorously"" in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and confirmed that stopping climate change will be among his administration's highest priorities.
\
That goal will involve considerable sacrifice, but it is achievable. Using the ""bully pulpit"" of the White House, Obama will be able to move Americans to make the lifestyle changes necessary to reduce drastically their currently oversized carbon footprint to a trimmer, energy-efficient size by mid-century.
\
With the Congress on his side, our eloquent new president will be able to follow through on the promises he made to the governors. His aggressive plan to put the United States in the avant garde of global environmental leaders already has the support of key congressional committee leadership, including the new incoming chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
\
Obama's plan, which will rely on a free-market oriented federal carbon cap and trade system, also foresees a cut in carbon emissions from U.S.-manufactured cars by 5 percent in 2015 and by 10 percent in 2020.
\
He likely will have the powerful leverage of a multibillion dollar federal bailout to force Detroit's Big Three automakers to comply with his goals. The U.S. carmakers--who once stoutly resisted eco-friendly advances--realize the guaranteed loans and other aid flowing from Washington depend on switching most of their production to electric, hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles.
\
The president-elect also told the governors that he will spend $15 billion a year to ""catalyze a clean energy future"" that will see a shift to solar, wind and new generation bio-fuels while also relying on clean coal and safe nuclear power.
\
That commitment, along with a pledge to create 5 million ""green jobs"" in America--jobs that cannot be outsourced and will pay acceptable salaries--should see Obama move steadily toward his goal of an 80 percent slash in carbon emissions by the half-century mark.
\
After eight years of the Bush administration discounting the threat of a rapidly warming planet, Obama is keenly aware that far too much valuable time already has been wasted.
\
""Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all,"" he told the governors. ""Delay is no longer an option; denial is no longer an acceptable response. The stakes are too high; the consequences too serious. Stopping climate change won't be easy, and it won't happen overnight.""
\
Obama's words are exactly the message a 21st century American president should be sending to his citizens, to all levels of government and to leaders of private industry. It is a ringing declaration of world unity that leaders of other nations have not heard during the last eight years of the Bush and Cheney misadministration.
\
His vow to ""make America greener and end the tyranny of oil"" has been applauded around the globe and eases the way for meaningful U.S. participation at the U.N. summit on the environment next year in Copenhagen.
\
Obama's inspiring words are exactly what all who participate in reversing the pending catastrophe of climate change must hear and heed to save our Earth and make it inhabitable for its 6.3 billion humans and future generations.
\
Far from a mission impossible, it should be considered a quest that is sacrosanct. If we are unsuccessful, our small planet almost surely will wither and die.

75,"The 8th Congressional District race pits Democratic three-term incumbent Steve Kagen of Appleton against Republican challenger Reid Ribble, a former roofing company owner from De Pere, in the Nov. 2 election. Here are Reid Ribble's positions on a variety of issues, based oncampaign websites, interviews, debates and news reports.\On reducing the federal budget deficit:\Ribble said the government needs to eliminate duplication of services, as well as waste and fraud. He said ""draconian changes"" won't be required to reduce the deficit. He supports regulatory reform to reduce uncertainty for businesses, which will help grow revenue. He said he's aiming for a balanced budget by 2015.\On health care reform:\Ribble opposes the federal health care reform law, saying it should be defunded. While he supports the provision that allows those under 26 to remain on their parents' insurance plans, he advocates for tort reform, the ability to sell insurance across state lines and ""decoupling"" health care from employment. Instead, families would buy coverage on their own.\On the economic stimulus:\Ribble opposes the stimulus, saying it did little to create jobs or improve the economy. He opposes government bailouts, saying failing businesses should ""suffer the consequences of their actions.""\On taxes:\Ribble favors extending the Bush tax cuts. He says the tax system is too complex, saying a single rate would be better. He said the Fair Tax plan, which would replace the income tax with a consumptive sales tax, is an ""intriguing idea.""\On Iraq and Afghanistan:\Ribble said he thinks the war in Afghanistan is winnable but the effort needs more support from the Obama administration and not a timetable for withdrawal.\On immigration reform:\Ribble supports stronger borders, as well as having illegal immigrants pay a fine and get back in line for legal immigration, but after returning to their home country, be allowed to continue to work here while they await citizenship. He also favors fixing the legal immigration process.\On energy and environment issues:\Ribble favors expanding the nation's energy portfolio, including clean coal technology, nuclear power, domestic oil production and natural gas, as well as renewable energy sources. He opposes cap-and-trade legislation, saying it would hurt Wisconsin manufacturers. He has referred to the Department of Energy as a ""train wreck.""\On education:\Ribble supports allowing states, local schools and parents to decide how to educate kids, without federal mandates.\On Social Security:\Ribble said the current system is unsustainable and supports changes that would ""personalize"" the system so people would receive the money they put in, with interest. He opposes using Social Security money for other programs.\On job creation:\Ribble said regulation reform is needed, and perhaps a temporary moratorium on new regulations, to reduce businesses' uncertainty about the government. He favors lower taxes that benefit businesses."
76,"On Tuesday, Jan. 12, the Fitchburg City Council will make a once-in-a-century decision: Shall it borrow against future energy savings to install geothermal heating and cooling in its new library building?\The building is otherwise designed for a 100-year service life. The decision must be made now, however, whether to install a 20th or 21st century heating and cooling plant. The conventional system burns natural gas for heating and uses electricity to power air conditioning, while the geothermal system uses electric heat pump technology to cool the building (and warm the earth under the parking lot) in the summer and warm the building with the heat stored underground in the winter. Both systems use electricity for moving air and controlling dampers. Unfortunately, the two systems require different building designs.\Unlike the solar panels planned for future installation on the roof, geothermal heating and cooling cannot be added later at a reasonable price - the retrofit would be triple the cost of new construction. Natural gas is appealingly cheap this winter, but the price fluctuates from year to year. Electricity, on the other hand, is only going to become more expensive as worldwide climate protection efforts such as cap-and-trade or a carbon tax kick in.\The geothermal system would add about a half million dollars to the cost of the building, an investment that can be recovered in energy savings in 20-25 years. For the remaining life of the building, energy savings in the range of $100,000 a year (at current rates) would accrue to taxpayers.\The savings would become even more significant if, as expected, a future investment is made in solar panels. Delaying solar panels makes sense. Photovoltaic panels are becoming more cost effective each year because of better technology and economies of scale, and the cost to retrofit is slight.\Some members of the City Council are concerned that by installing a geothermal system, they would be breaking a promise not to spend more than $10 million on the library building. This oversimplifies a complex issue. The library referendum authorized bonding for the building, but did not tie the council's hands to do the right thing for taxpayers and for the environment. The city should finance the geothermal system separately and internally, repaying its fund balance with energy savings.\In addition to reducing the cost for the building over its life, Fitchburg has committed to do its part to protect our climate from changes that could lead to untold damage to coastal cities, agriculture, and natural ecosystems. Using small amounts of electricity, which can be generated from the sun or wind, rather than fossil natural gas for heating and cooling is part of that commitment.\City leaders should take the long-term view on decisions of this type. Unlike a private developer, we know the city will still own and operate this building as a library 25 and 100 years from now, so we are sure to capture the future savings. The fiscally responsible position is to find a way to finance the geothermal system now, for decades of future savings. Isn't it nice when that's also the environmentally responsible thing to do?\Steve Arnold is a Fitchburg alderman.\Posted in Column on Monday, January 11, 2010 1:00 pm Updated: 1:10 pm\Credit: Steve Arnold Fitchburg alderman"
77,"In a recent sharp-edged editorial, USA Today compared climate-science deniers to ""birthers,"" who continue to dispute President Obama's citizenship.\There's one big difference though: ""Birthers"" are running on fumes these days, but climate deniers are firmly entrenched in positions of power. \Some of them are from Wisconsin - notably Ron Johnson, Wisconsin's junior U.S. senator. \Some conservation groups have been told to remove the words ""climate change"" from their materials, so as not to offend possible donors. Instead, they talk in code. Meanwhile, Gov. Scott Walker has moved quickly to put the kibosh on a variety of promising green energy initiatives across the state. \All of this adds up to an imperfect storm, and deniers will continue to do what they do best: deny even the possibility that the world's best scientists might be right. \The latest piece of solid science they'll deny comes from this nation's pre-eminent scientific advisory group, the National Research Council arm of the National Academy of Sciences. As requested by Congress, it issued a report called ""America's Climate Choices."" USA Today called the findings ""straightforward and unequivocal."" They include the following: \""Climate change is occurring, is very likely caused primarily by human activities, and poses significant risks to humans and the environment."" \Among those risks are more intense and frequent heat waves, threats to coastal communities from rising sea levels, and greater drying of the arid Southwest. Look out, Lake Michigan. \The report suggests a number of strategies to mitigate the impacts, including investing in clean-energy technology (not in Wisconsin), looking for ways to adapt to climate change (not in Wisconsin), and putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions (not anywhere in the U.S.). The last, a cap-and-trade system of using market forces to reduce pollution, was hatched in the George W. Bush administration. But it has been trashed by deniers in subsequent years. \The National Research Council is known for careful analysis and oftentimes conservative findings. But the deniers will cover their eyes and ears as the report talks of melting ice caps, shifting agricultural patterns, droughts and wildfires. \Instead, as USA Today says, the national Republican Party's ""rejectionist stance is unrivaled among major political parties, including conservative ones, around the warming planet."" \The deniers will also feint and dodge in the wake of USA Today's dismantling of statistician Edward Wegman's work, which they have frequently cited. The newspaper reported that a statistics journal retracted Wegman's federally funded study following complaints of plagiarism and use of unreliable sources. \Climate deniers are right about one thing: Acting alone won't solve anything. But the U.S., which consumes a huge share of the world's energy supply, needs to be among the worldwide leaders. Not much chance, it seems. \There are all sorts of practical reasons to act on the findings of groups like the National Research Council. If weather extremes are truly the ""new normal,"" scientists and risk analysts point out that isolated shocks will have broad impacts. Storms that knock out transportation and communications systems in one location can affect people thousands of miles away. Cell phone dead zones, anyone? \What about aging sewer systems in our major cities that are being overwhelmed by frequent heavy rain? What about the costs to homeowners and local businesses left to deal with the failing infrastructure? \If the National Research Council is right, we'll be dealing with those questions for a long time. \Bill Berry of Stevens Point writes a semimonthly column for The Capital Times.\billnick@charter.net\Credit: Bill Berry"
78,"The global spotlight on climate change this month put the topic of reducing greenhouse gas emissions briefly on the front burner, but cooled quickly after a temporary agreement was reached in Copenhagen.\Additional information\(Links will open in a new window)\* Special section: Read how climate change affects you and find other stories, Tweets and blogs on the subject.\* Special section: More stories and columns on the environment, plus a daily tip\It's an issue that's vital to a region like ours, which relies heavily on manufacturing. But letting it simmer for now may be a wise step. Here's why.\While the 193-nation summit produced an interim accord to reduce greenhouse gases (in addition to some cost-sharing mechanisms and attempts to ease possible impacts of climate change around the globe), it lacked the total buy-in needed to make it a legally binding action plan.\In this country, that type of buy-in and commitment is also missing from efforts to get an energy bill passed. The Senate had been preparing to take up its version of the bill in the spring, but already there is talk of postponement until after the mid-term elections next year. Some Senate Democrats -- nervous about possible fallout from their party's push for health-care reform and what it might cost them at the ballot box -- prefer to switch the agenda back to jobs and economy.\A more sound reason to delay a vote is that Democrats and Republicans are still far apart on the cap-and-trade issue, which is an integral part of both versions of the energy bill.\In June, the House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act by a slim margin. The bill would limit heat-trapping pollution from factories, refineries, power plants and other emitters and would allow them to trade pollution permits, or allowances, with each other. Over time the cap would tighten, driving up the price of emissions and theoretically pressuring major polluters to seek cleaner alternatives to energy. The bill passed 219-212 with 44 Democrats opposing it.\Getting a similar bill to pass in the Senate, where political and regional divisions cut even deeper, would prove challenging.\Just two weeks ago, the global climate change talks gave an opening for Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to try to link the Senate bill to the international stage. Kerry is one of the architects of the Senate climate legislation, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. But even Kerry was vague about what Americans could expect from the bill.\""I can't tell you the method or the means or amount by which we might price carbon,"" Kerry told The New York Times. ""We haven't resolved that issue yet. Some people want a carbon tax. Some want a trading mechanism. Some believe in an arbitrary set of reduction targets and let the economy work its way through it. There are several different proposals floating around.""\That's all the more reason for Kerry's bi-partisan group to take time to find the right proposal.\If the December climate-change negotiations in Copenhagen taught us anything, it's that common ground -- how ever narrow -- must be reached on key targets before a workable solution can be hammered out.\Our View\Issue: Climate change"

U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wausau, voted in favor of the legislation.\""This country cannot afford to continue to ship hundreds of billions of dollars abroad to areas like the Middle East because of our dependence on foreign energy sources,"" Obey said in a news release. ""We have to create the incentives and make the investments that will change that dependence over time. The economic recovery package that we passed in February was the first step in achieving that, and this is the second.""\Some aren't happy about the legislation, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and by 80 percent near the end of the century. The proposal would allow companies that release a lot of carbon dioxide into the air to purchase what are called ""carbon offsets"" from various sources.\""I've heard it will make energy costs skyrocket,"" said Kelly Thompson, 38, Wisconsin Rapids. ""I don't think now is the time to allow the cost of electricity and heat to rise. Too many people are struggling.""\A report from the Congressional Budget Office, dated May 7, 2009, predicted that companies affected by the legislation would pass expenses on to consumers.

80,"The 8th Congressional District race pits Democratic three-term incumbent Steve Kagen of Appleton against Republican challenger Reid Ribble, a former roofing company owner from De Pere, in the Nov. 2 election. Here are Steve Kagen's positions on a variety of issues, based oncampaign websites, interviews, debates and news reports.\On reducing the federal budget deficit:\Kagen favors pay-as-you-go legislation that requires any spending is offset by spending cuts in another area. He said getting people back to work will produce revenue to fill the deficit. And he favors cuts in discretionary federal spending.\On health care reform:\Kagen voted for the health care reform law and touts its provisions that ensure coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, remove lifetime benefits caps and fill the Medicare Part D ""donut hole."" He favors stronger actions to find Medicare fraud and greater transparency measures in health care costs. He advocates for moving away from fee-for-service health care pricing, in favor of fee-for-outcome pricing.\On the economic stimulus:\Kagen voted for the stimulus, saying it was needed to save and create jobs and boost the economy, noting the tax cuts that were part of the package. He said it's the role of government to stimulate the economy when none exists. He voted against TARP, the Wall Street bailout and the auto industry bailout.\On taxes:\Kagen touts tax cuts that have helped the middle class. He said the tax code needs to be simplified so all individuals and corporations pay their fair share. He supports renewing the Bush tax cuts for families with incomes of less than $250,000.\On Iraq and Afghanistan:\Kagen said the problems that exist in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan don't have military solutions. He said our economy can't sustain our military action in Afghanistan, especially as progress is so slow. He advocates for a change in policy, focusing on Pakistan.\On immigration reform:\Kagen favors tighter border security, enforcing immigration laws at the site of employment. He opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants and for those who hire them. He said those who are here illegally should have to pay a fine and go to the back of the line for legal immigration.\On energy and environment issues:\Kagen supports drilling for new oil in the U.S., investing in and providing tax credits for renewable energy and added efforts to prevent oil-price manipulation. He voted for the cap-and-trade bill that passed the House, saying he chose to support it after making sure provisions were added to protect Wisconsin manufacturers.\On education:\Kagen favors investing in public education and opposes voucher plans for private schools. He supports stronger standards and higher expectations for schools, based on measurable outcomes.\On Social Security:\Kagen said he wouldn't vote to privatize or personalize Social Security, or use Social Security funds to reduce the deficit.\On job creation:\Kagen supports incentives for small businesses to hire more, including legislation that would give tax credits to expand payrolls in the next two years."
81,"With the dramatic elimination of Osama bin Laden came an important psychological boost to the American people. There is a collective sense that there's nothing we cannot do if we set our minds to it.\Along with that boost came an important upswing in President Obama's approval ratings. At 51 percent approval rating in his 10th quarter as president, he is a full 7 percentage points ahead of Ronald Reagan's approval rating in his 10th quarter. With that upswing comes the responsibility to use his recharged political capital to tackle our greatest national (and international) threat -- climate change -- and to take advantage of this opportunity to fuel a new green economy.\Clearly feeling optimistic, President Obama made an important speech about our energy future. Clean energy, he said, will help us out-compete and out-innovate the rest of the world. ""Clean-energy jobs are the jobs of the future. I don't want other countries to win the competition for these technologies and jobs. I want America to win that competition. I want America to win the future.""\So do we. That's why the president needs to use his replenished political capital and increased approval ratings to push Congress for comprehensive climate and energy legislation that holds oil companies accountable and reduces our dependence on oil while protecting the environment.\We need a National Climate Act implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The president should propose a stringent carbon tax or an economy-wide cap-and-trade program with stringent timetables over several decades. If Congress again fails to act, then use the EPA's rulemaking authority that the Supreme Court verified in 2007. Inaction is not an option.\We must implement a comprehensive clean-energy plan for high-quality jobs, economic growth, cleaner air, water and food, and for the reduced dependence on foreign oil that will come as a result. The sooner we pass such legislation, the sooner we build a thriving green economy -- and have the jobs and economic growth that will come with that thriving green economy.\Just over a year ago we had one of the world's largest oil spills in a region that a few years before had been torn apart by a catastrophic hurricane. During this past year we have seen the resounding defeat of climate legislation; a major turnover in Congress; the rise and now dominance of China in what had been our solar market to lose; the rise in credibility of climate deniers; an increase in extraordinary weather events; multiple countries experiencing the hottest year on record; and an unthinkable nuclear accident caused by a tsunami. Take the Mississippi River's recent flooding and ravaging the residential areas around it; and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to Greenland coincided with a new report that revealed the ice cap is melting at devastatingly high levels -- much higher than earlier anticipated.\America is a ""can do"" nation with the persistence, tenacity and talent to succeed. It's time for the Administration and Congress to join the American people with the same kind of persistence, tenacity and talent to work to gain America's freedom from oil, regain our technological supremacy, and protect our natural resources.\Neither our economy nor our planet can afford any more delays.\About the authors:"

Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. Well spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of Obamacare, financial reform and a near trillion-dollar stimulus that will significantly transform the country. But spent nonetheless. There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural.
\
That's why, as I suggested last week, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next two and a half years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress next January.
\
Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda.
\
That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses. It is still possible for the gaffe-happy Republicans to blow it. When the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee publicly apologizes to the corporation that unleashed the worst oil spill in American history, you know the Republicans are capable of just about anything.
\
But assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-on reforms are dead. Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring). They could then vote for anything -- including measures they today shun as the midterms approach and their seats are threatened -- because they would have nothing to lose. They would be unemployed. And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.
\
As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are already looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session. Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes, and climate-change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.
\
Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden. Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission, which conveniently reports by Dec. 1. And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress -- but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.
\
It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply. To pass in a lame-duck session major legislation so unpopular that Democrats had no chance of passing it in regular session -- after major Democratic losses signifying a withdrawal of the mandate implicitly granted in 2008 -- would be an egregious violation of elementary democratic norms.
\
Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through a health-care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber -- something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.
\
How then to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress? Bring the issue up now -- applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day. Every current member should be publicly asked: In the event you lose in November -- a remote and deeply deplorable eventuality, but still not inconceivable -- do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?
\
The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow. Call me naive, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.

84,"Oshkosh businessman and Republican Senate hopeful Ron Johnson said he would not oppose pre-emptive military strikes on nations posing a threat to the United States.\Johnson, who owns plastics manufacturer Pacur LLC, said nation building of the sort the United States undertook in Iraq is ""in general, something to avoid"" except when the country is under threat.\He further said he would not be against strikes against a nation such as Somalia, a haven for terrorists and pirates, provided strengthened intelligence networks can prove there is merit for such a strike. He said improved intelligence gathering and communication between the CIA and FBI are needed to keep the fight against Islamic terrorists off American soil.\""I'd much rather fight them over there than on the streets of America,"" Johnson said.\Johnson's approach to fighting terrorism and preserving domestic security came out during an hour-plus interview Thursday morning with The Northwestern's editorial board. The discussion also covered common themes of Johnson's campaign -- his staunch opposition to the Democratic health care reform law, his desire to oust career politicians from their positions in government and his stance that the federal bailout of the financial sector and last year's stimulus package exacerbated the recession.\""I believe we need to reverse course really quickly,"" Johnson said.\Johnson took aim, as he has many times, at ""career politicians,"" which he defined as an elected official who only has known public service. He said they're both Republican and Democrat and a lot of them need to give up their political ""fiefdoms"" to make way for different perspectives.\""We're at a very serious point in time and we need a different perspective,"" Johnson said. ""We won't get to 100 percent of that perspective, though it'd be nice. I think we do need term limits. I think we've poisoned our politics.""\Johnson said his opponent, incumbent Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., needs to leave government and work in the private sector to gain an understanding of the impact federal rules and regulations have had on the nation's business climate.\""He (Feingold) has no idea what it's like to live under the rules and regulations he's been approving,"" Johnson said. ""As someone who's been creating jobs for 31 years, I want to take my body of experience to our nation's capitol.""\Echoing his comments that job losses attributed to moving production overseas is necessary, ""creative destruction,"" Johnson said the free trade agreements many people blame for the disappearance of family-supporting jobs do offer benefits to American businesses. He said exporters such as Pacur and the state's $12 billion agriculture industry benefit from the new markets free trade agreements have opened up. But he said government's role in economic matters needs to shrink.\He said the federal government needs to end excessive regulation of industry, curb taxation, cease unnecessary mandates, reign in spending to reduce the multi-trillion dollar federal debt and take a more limited role in commerce if the United States wants to remain competitive with China and other industrializing nations.\""Protectionism would harm many businesses in Wisconsin,"" Johnson said. ""We need to create an attractive environment for business investment.""\But when asked for two or three federal regulations, excluding health care reform, he found particularly onerous to business owners and entrepreneurs, Johnson returned to his call for lower taxes, the repeal of health care reform, concerns about cap and trade legislation and that financial reform passed earlier this year did not address the root problems of the recession.\""(Health care reform) is going to be a nightmare,"" Johnson said.\Jeff Bollier: (920) 426-6688 or jbollier@thenorthwestern.com."

He purchased his Prius just a few months after Al Gore pulled up to a presidential campaign rally in Madison with an entourage of gas-guzzling SUVs.\ Cowles is a poster boy for Republican environmentalism - something the Al Gores of the world ought to celebrate and encourage, rather than ignore or undermine.\ Cowles said Friday he hasn't seen Al Gore's documentary about global warming, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" though he's anxious to.\ I told him the movie delivers an important and powerful message. It's undeniably a rallying point for reforming America's wasteful and dangerous energy policies.\ Yet the documentary's self-congratulation and partisan sneer wore on me.\ Al Gore was the star. Mother Earth was a mere supporting actress.\ Gore and the Democrats were the world's last hope. President Bush, his daddy and their Republican cronies were evil polluters.\ The partisan melodrama might rally the Democratic base. But it's the wrong strategy for solving the problem of too much carbon dioxide spewing into the atmosphere. As Cowles' example shows, environmentalists come in all political stripes. Antagonizing half of the electorate that voted for Bush isn't going to help the cause.\ Gore told Congress last week that global warming should not be partisan or political issue.\ I hope he means it.\ Plenty of independent and credible scientists acknowledge that Gore's movie was exaggerated if not alarmist. Yet the big-picture thrust of Gore's message is vital and based on scientific consensus.\ And it's probably true that, if not for Al Gore, I wouldn't even be writing this column.\ We do have to become more efficient with the energy we use. We do have to become smarter and develop cleaner energy. And we need more buy in from everyone.\ ""If you tune into talk radio, they're savaging global warming,"" Cowles said. ""And they're savaging it because it's Al Gore.""\ Cowles is convinced that humans are contributing to a rise in global temperatures. But he's not a doomsayer. He's optimistic technology and the human spirit can prevail.\ Even if you don't believe that global warming is a serious threat, you have to acknowledge that America's dependency on Mideast oil is a big problem, Cowles says.\ Our cars and trucks burn more gas than 20 years ago, Cowles says, and oil imports have increased.\ The cost of gas is sure to rise as China, India, Russia and other nations consume more, he predicts.\ ""More straws are in the same malted milk,"" Cowles said. ""You've got more competition for a limited pot of oil. They're not discovering as much.""\ Cowles was a key supporter of a renewable energy bill that cleared the Legislature under Republican control last year. Cowles has tried to stop his colleagues - Democrats and Republicans - from raiding conservation money citizens pay through their utility bills. He helped pass important wetlands laws.\ Cowles also is considering supporting a state bill creating a cap- and-trade system for carbon dioxide emissions, similar to California's. Yet he wonders if a multi-state effort on the East Coast might be the better model. He notes that GOP presidential candidate John McCain has a bill on global warming and supports higher fuel efficiency standards.\ The Democrats still own the environmental issue, and deservedly so. But for the good of the environment, the Democrats ought to encourage in an honest way more Republicans to join the cause."

Julie Lassa, D-Stevens Point, or real estate broker Don Raihala of Superior in the Nov. 2 general election.\The following candidates' views were compiled from recent Gannett Central Wisconsin Media interviews and the candidates' respective websites and news releases and were edited for space and clarity.\Improving the economy\Duffy: The first thing I want to do is send back any unspent TARP money and any unspent stimulus money to pay back our $13 trillion deficit. I think we have to work on removing uncertainty from the marketplace. Rescinding all unobligated stimulus funds would save up to $266 billion.\Bailouts are only providing more uncertainty, not the stability we need. Like stimulus funds, bailout money is going to government jobs instead of small businesses.\Mielke: What we are seeing is the result of Congress messing with the free market. If there were a plan, which could ease the potential damage this is causing, I would consider voting for it. Presently, the solution they are trying to put through deserves a ""no"" vote. An unhealthy environment cannot be stimulated.\Sustainable energy\Duffy: Cap and trade is a jobs killer. The Obama administration already admitted that this bill could cost American families up to $1,700 a year with higher electric bills and more expensive products. We have to be responsible about taxing our businesses and families, which cannot afford this -- especially during these challenging economic times.\Mielke: I am opposed to taxing energy, industry and business. When we burden them with bureaucracy, we push them to other countries. I am a firm believer that competition is the best way to keep prices down. I also am in favor of growing other energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydrogen, hydroelectric and any other viable options available now or in the future.\Overseas trade,\manufacturing policies\Duffy: It's important that we make sure that America is competitive. We are competitive when we have a competition. If we start to build barriers around America, it's harder to export our products.\I don't believe in tariffs, unless it is determined other countries are illegally dumping their products into this country. I do believe that in America, we can compete with anyone in the world in this global marketplace.\Mielke: We cannot continue to send our jobs and industry outside our borders. We must work to encourage companies to remain within the United States. America cannot survive if we continue to export our jobs and industry to other nations.

87,"Gannett Wisconsin Media\Oshkosh businessman and Republican Senate hopeful Ron Johnson said he would not oppose pre-emptive military strikes on nations that pose a threat to the United States.\Johnson, who owns plastics manufacturer Pacur LLC, said nation building of the sort the United States undertook in Iraq is ""in general, something to avoid"" except when the country is under threat.\He further said he would not be against strikes against a nation such as Somalia, a haven for terrorists and pirates, provided strengthened intelligence networks can prove there is merit for such a strike. He said improved intelligence gathering and communication between the CIA and FBI are needed to keep the fight against Islamic terrorists off American soil.\""I'd much rather fight them over there than on the streets of America,"" Johnson said.\Johnson's approach to fighting terrorism and preserving domestic security came out during an hour-plus interview Thursday morning with The Oshkosh Northwestern's editorial board. The discussion also covered common themes of Johnson's campaign -- his staunch opposition to the Democratic health care reform law, his desire to oust career politicians from their positions in government and his stance that the federal bailout of the financial sector and last year's stimulus package exacerbated the recession.\""I believe we need to reverse course really quickly,"" Johnson said.\Johnson took aim as he has many times at ""career politicians,"" which he defined as an elected official who has only known public service. He said they're both Republican and Democrat and that a lot of them need to give up their political ""fiefdoms"" to make way for different perspectives.\""We're at a very serious point in time and we need a different perspective,"" Johnson said. ""We won't get to 100 percent of that perspective, though it'd be nice. I think we do need term limits. I think we've poisoned our politics.""\Johnson said his opponent, incumbent Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., needs to leave government and work in the private sector to gain an understanding of the impact federal rules and regulations have had on the nation's business climate.\""He (Feingold) has no idea what it's like to live under the rules and regulations he's been approving,"" Johnson said. ""As someone who's been creating jobs for 31 years, I want to take my body of experience to our nation's capitol.""\Echoing his comments that job losses attributed to moving production overseas is necessary, ""creative destruction,"" Johnson said the free trade agreements many people blame for the disappearance of family-supporting jobs do offer benefits to American businesses. He said exporters such as Pacur and the state's $12 billion agriculture industry benefit from the new markets free trade agreements have opened up. But he said government's role in economic matters needs to shrink.\He said the federal government needs to end excessive regulation of industry, curb taxation, cease unnecessary mandates, reign in spending to reduce the multi-trillion dollar federal debt and take a more limited role in commerce if the United States wants to remain competitive with China and other industrializing nations.\""Protectionism would harm many businesses in Wisconsin,"" Johnson said. ""We need to create an attractive environment for business investment.""\But when asked for two or three federal regulations, excluding health care reform, he found particularly onerous to business owners and entrepreneurs, Johnson returned to his call for lower taxes, the repeal of health care reform, concerns about cap and trade legislation and that financial reform passed earlier this year did not address the root problems of the recession.\""(Health care reform) is going to be a nightmare,"" Johnson said.\-- Jeff Bollier: (920) 426-6688 or jbollier@thenorthwestern.com.\Johnson on the issues\-- On immigration: ""We have to stem the tide of illegal immigration and that begins with securing our borders. ... But businesses have to have some way to verify the status of their workers without fearing punishment.""\-- On The Patriot Act: ""I wish we didn't have it. ... But we are under attack from Islamic terrorists. ... Most view it as a threat to civil liberties, but sometimes you need that.

The making of a 'problem'
\
By AMY RIDENOUR
\
Saturday, January 11, 2003
\
It's a peculiar and pervasive phenomenon in the nation's capital: Invent a major problem where none exists, then propose a complicated and costly solution, create yet another bureaucratic fiefdom and hand out scads of federal grant money and patronage positions.
\
That's apparently what Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) have in mind with their new legislation to install a cap-and-trade system for controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Their bill essentially was drafted by the eco-activist Pew Center on Global Climate Change and several multinational conglomerates, including British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell. It would establish mandatory emissions limits for carbon dioxide and set up an exorbitantly expensive Rube Goldberg apparatus that would allow companies to buy or sell permits to emit carbon dioxide.
\
It is the sort of plan for which Enron used to lobby.
\
Ostensibly, the idea is to force U.S. companies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, which environmentalists believe will raise the Earth's temperature, perhaps by 8 to 10 degrees by the end of this century, and supposedly trigger catastrophic flooding and cracked-earth drought.
\
Yet the vast majority of U.S. scientists who specialize in climate studies believe the fear-mongers are wrong.
\
The U.N. Panel on Climate Change, which is often cited by environmentalists, bases its projections on worst-case scenarios from two flawed computer models, each of which significantly contradicts the other when it comes to the impact of global warming on specific geographical areas.
\
What is known is that the Earth's temperature has increased by about 1 degree over the last 120 years, but even that may be misleading. Satellites show a slight cooling in the lower atmosphere over the last two decades. As the 19th century very likely was the coolest of the last millennium, a slight warming since then is actually a positive development.
\
The Earth has gone through repeated cycles of gradual warming and cooling for millions of years. This isn't likely to change under orders from the U.S. Senate.
\
While the McCain-Lieberman proposal would not mandate the draconian 30% cutbacks in energy use required by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that most environmental groups favor, it would put a major hit on U.S. economic growth. Their bill would require all major industries to significantly reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which would cost tens of billions of dollars and likely result in thousands of layoffs.
\
An economic stimulus plan it isn't. The Bush administration acted wisely in 2001 when it rejected ratifying the Kyoto treaty. President Bush and his science advisers believe further study of climate change is needed, but they are promoting economic incentives that encourage voluntary reduction of emissions.
\
They also support further research into climate change, such as that under way at Stanford University's new Global Climate and Energy Project. The project is a 10-year collaboration between academia and the private sector to find the clean energy alternatives that will allow reductions in man-made greenhouse emissions without damage to the economy.
\
Stanford has been supported by $225 million in grants from ExxonMobil, General Electric and Schlumberger and E.On, the European energy distributor. The selection of Franklin M. Orr Jr., dean of Stanford's respected School of Earth Sciences, to head the new project apparently has guaranteed its independence to the satisfaction of most mainstream environmental groups.
\
In the meantime, all eyes are on McCain and Lieberman -- which, doubtless, is the way they want it. Expecting opposition from other senators, they've bypassed the Environment and Public Works Committee that normally would have jurisdiction over their bill and set up an early leadership test for new Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.).
\
With the United States about to go to war in the Middle East, Frist should strip McCain of jurisdiction over ill-advised legislation aimed at fixing something that doesn't appear to be broken.
\
Until sound science actually demonstrates that global warming is a problem -- and proves it is caused by man-made emissions -- Congress shouldn't do what McCain and Lieberman ask and risk pushing a frail economic recovery into a major relapse.

90,"On reducing the federal budget deficit:\Feingold's Control Spending Now Act includes these proposals for reducing the deficit: Giving the president line-item veto powers, strengthening pay-as-you-go requirements for spending, ending the TARP bailout, ending corporate subsidies in a number of areas, reforming and reducing farm subsidies, cutting spending on outdated programs, negotiating lower Medicare prescription drug prices and eliminating budget earmarks.\On health care reform:\Feingold voted for the health care reform law, citing the elimination of a lifetime benefits cap, coverage for those with pre-existing conditions and allowing those under age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance plans. He supports allowing the importation of prescription drugs, giving the government the power to negotiate prescription drug prices for Medicare, increasing federal funding for medical research (including embryonic stem cells) and increasing funding for dental care for the poor and uninsured.\On the economic stimulus:\Feingold voted in favor of the stimulus package. He said it was a ""necessary and one-time"" plan that has created jobs and will continue to work, noting not all of the money has been spent yet.\On taxes:\Feingold opposes continuing the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest population, but wants to continue them for those in other income levels. He favors tax credits for businesses that increase jobs, hours or workers' pay.\On Iraq and Afghanistan:\Feingold opposed the war in Iraq but supported the war against al-Qaida in Afghanistan. He was the first senator to call for a flexible timeline for withdrawal from Iraq and later did the same for a withdrawal from Afghanistan. He stresses that the fight against al-Qaida and terrorism isn't focused in those nations, but that we should be watching other terrorist-friendly nations, as well. He said that diplomacy, government reform and infrastructure development may be more important in Afghanistan than more troops. He opposed President Obama's decision to send troops there.\On free trade:\Feingold voted against NAFTA, CAFTA, GATT, Fast Track and most favored nation status for China, saying they are unbalanced against our nation's workers. He wants the U.S. to have the ability to renegotiate trade agreements. He has introduced legislation that would set a number of standards for future trade agreements, and has introduced legislation that he said would make it harder for the government to buy overseas goods.\On immigration reform:\Feingold wants reform to include better border security and more enforcement against employers who hire illegal immigrants. He said illegal immigrants should have to pay a fine, get a temporary work permit, return to their home country and get in line as a legal immigrant.\On energy and environment issues:\Feingold said he trusts the conclusion of the scientific community that global warming exists and has some man-made causes. He opposed the cap-and-trade legislation that passed the House because he said it was too harmful to states like Wisconsin that are reliant on the coal industry. He supports increasing benchmarks for electricity and fuel coming from renewable energy sources. He's against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\On education:\Feingold supports increased federal funding for local schools. He wants education decisions to be made at the state and local level, so he opposes the federal No Child Left Behind law. He wants to change NCLB to improve the quality of standardized tests and give states more flexibility in making assessments.\On Social Security:\Feingold opposes privatization of Social Security and opposes using Social Security Trust Fund money for spending programs or tax cuts. He supports creating a commission to explore solvency issues and favors raising the income cap on Social Security taxes and raising the retirement age, with exceptions for some careers.\On job creation:\Feingold favors a job tax credit for businesses that hire new employees, expand work hours or raise workers pay. He supports increased funding for small-business innovation research and federal grants for school districts to partner with local businesses to help prepare student for jobs in growing industries."
91,"The so-called ""American Clean Energy and Security Act,"" which was approved last Thursday on a 33-25 vote by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is a bad bill.\Yes, we know that it was approved overwhelmingly by Democrats on the committee, including Madison's Tammy Baldwin.\Yes, we know that Baldwin and many of those who voted ""yes"" are sincerely committed to addressing climate change in a thoughtful manner.\Yes, we know that it is sometimes necessary to compromise in order to achieve progress on environmental issues.\But this legislation is too compromised.\Despite efforts to forge a responsible measure, the bill as it passed the Energy and Commerce Committee is little more than a giveaway to big business.\If it is enacted by the full Congress, it would enrich the companies that created the current climate crisis while doing far too little to address the problem.\Specifically, the misnamed Clean Energy and Security Act:\* Sets targets for reducing pollution that are far weaker than science says is necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change.\* Establishes goals that are far less ambitious than what is achievable with already existing technology.\* Undermines those targets and goals by including massive loopholes that could allow industries that produce the most pollution to avoid real emission reductions until 2027.\* Provides free allowances and direct subsidies to polluting industries in a manner that would slow renewable energy development.\* Locks in a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants.\* Fails to provide relief and support to consumers.\* Removes the president's authority to address global warming pollution using laws that are already on the books.\That's a damning condemnation.\Who is making it? The most unbought and unbossed environmental and consumer groups in the country, including:\* Greenpeace USA\* Friends of the Earth\* Public Citizen\* Citizen Power\* The Center for Biological Diversity\* Coal Moratorium Now\* TURN - The Utility Reform Network\* A broad coalition of state environmental protection and consumer groups from across the United States.\""While a week of debate failed to adequately strengthen protections for consumers, communities and the climate in this bill, it erased all doubt of who will benefit most from it: big business,"" the groups said after the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is chaired by California Democrat Henry Waxman, approved the measure.\""Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, the decision-making process was co-opted by oil and coal lobbyists determined to sustain our addiction to dirty fossil fuels, even as the country stands ready to rebuild our economy and clean up the environment with real clean energy. The resulting bill reflects the triumph of politics over science, and the triumph of industry influence over the public interest,"" the groups continue. ""Regrettably, we cannot support this legislation unless and until it is substantially strengthened. The lives and livelihoods of 7 billion people worldwide will be affected by America's response to the climate crisis. The response embodied in today's bill is not only inadequate, it is counterproductive.""\It was not just Waxman who sought to make the bill better.\Baldwin, who is closely allied with the chairman, tried.\Baldwin was the chief author of several provisions in the base bill, including a section that establishes a greenhouse gas registry. The registry would guarantee reliable emissions information with accurate measurements, consistent reporting and a publicly available database of our emission levels. That's a valuable addition to the bill that, as Baldwin notes, addresses a major fault of the European Union's cap and trade system.\Additionally, Baldwin proposed a plan for voluntary labeling programs, one aimed at conserving water and the other at disclosing the carbon content of products. This smart, consumer-friendly initiative is designed to give environmentally conscious Americans more information about what they can do to use less water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And it's encouraging that Baldwin's amendment was approved with broad bipartisan support, on a 34-21 vote.\But registries and voluntary labeling programs, while valuable, are not sufficient to offset the dramatic giveaways to big business that are contained in this poorly conceived and even more poorly crafted piece of legislation.\We understand the desire to ""take what you can get,"" and we recognize that some sincere and serious environmental groups such as the League of Conservation Voters back the bill. But the arguments for the measure simply do not match the arguments against it.\Baldwin should have cast a progressive ""no"" vote on the bill.\That would have put her in a lonely position.\The 25 opponents of the measure on the committee - 21 Republicans and four Democrats from Southern and Western states - were unwilling to make even a compromised commitment to addressing climate change.\By voting ""no"" as a committed environmentalist, Baldwin could have highlighted the need to improve this measure before it is enacted.\Now the struggle goes to the Senate, where, if the bill is not significantly improved, it will not merit support from Wisconsin Democrats Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl.\As Greenpeace USA, Friends of the Earth, Public Citizen and other environmental and consumer groups correctly argue: ""The international community cannot solve global warming without real leadership from the United States.""\The United States needs to craft what serious environmentalists describe as ""a real, science-based response to the challenge of global warming.""\The American Clean Energy and Security Act, as it is currently worded, is not that response."

Have you ever wondered what the world would be like without scientists? Ask the Republican Party. It lives in such a world. Republicans have been so successful in driving out of their party anyone who endeavors in scientific inquiry that pretty soon there won't be anyone left who can distinguish a periodic table from a kitchen table.
\
It is no wonder the Republican throngs showing up to disrupt town hall meetings on health care reform are so gullible, willing to believe absurd claims like the coming of ""death panels."" Their party is nearly devoid of neuroscientists, astrophysicists, marine biologists or any other scientific professional who would insist on intellectual rigor, objective evidence and sound reasoning as the basis for public policy development.
\
The people left don't have that kind of discipline and don't expect it from their leaders. They are willing to believe anything some right-wing demagogue with a cable show or pulpit tells them, no matter how outlandish.
\
Since the Sonia Sotomayor nomination, we've been hearing about the GOP's Hispanic deficit. Only 26 percent of registered Latino voters say they identify with or lean toward the Republican Party. But that's a full house compared with scientists. Only 12 percent of scientists in a poll released last month by the Pew Research Center say they are Republican or lean toward the GOP, while fully 81 percent of scientists say they are Democrats or lean Democratic.
\
But what worries me is not the shrunken relevancy of the GOP, a party in which 56 percent of its members oppose funding of embryonic stem cell research, only 30 percent say Earth is warming mostly due to human activity, and 39 percent believe humans have always existed on Earth in their present form. It is that this nation's future depends upon people who don't think that way and the Republican Party is closing the door to them.
\
Every hope we have to invent our way out of this economic malaise and create enough Information Age jobs to maintain a stable and prosperous middle class sits on the shoulders of people who understand and practice the scientific method. Every hope we have of advancing human understanding of the physical universe, and bettering our lives in it, is tied to professionals now represented by only one of our nation's two major political parties, while the other party attempts to obstruct them.
\
Global warming is a prime example.
\
Earth is under siege by CO2 emissions to a point that the Pentagon is warning that our national security is at risk if climate change is not arrested. All Americans and politicians should be united for collective action. Yet George W. Bush spent essentially his entire presidency ignoring and suppressing scientists' concerns.
\
Even today, with the effects of global warming evident, Republicans in Congress are trying to bury the cap-and-trade energy bill, the nation's first attempt (albeit not strong enough) to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Their alternative is to offer nothing.
\
Why are they so blind to the looming crisis? Because to embrace what scientists are saying about global warming would give political liberals a win, something the GOP leadership is not wont to do. Republicans build their political careers disdaining ""elitists"" with a good education, complex charts and empirical data. They see it to their political advantage to rally people to distrust science.
\
That means our nation is only likely to advance to meet the heady scientific challenges of the future, on health and the environment--advancements that translate directly into economic progress and rising living standards--if Democrats remain in power with substantial majorities.
\
But if the nation's economic situation doesn't turn around soon, a GOP resurgence could very well come. Then scientists will once again be on the defensive against a Republican Party that left them behind in favor of the Tea Party crowd, the birthers, and the people who shout at town halls that government better keep its hands off their Medicare.
\
Theirs is a world without scientists, and scary doesn't begin to describe it.

93,"The official U.S. unemployment rate of 10.2 percent is the worst in a quarter century.\The real unemployment rate of 17.5 percent - the Department of Labor figure that includes the long-term unemployed and under-employed - is edging toward Depression-era levels.\In several regions - Michigan, parts of Ohio and Indiana, stretches of New England and the rural South, historically depressed urban areas - the jobless figures are so acute that they have become the definitional social, economic and political concern.\These numbers are bad. And they are likely to get worse - potentially much worse, if we experience a so-called ""W"" recession, in which the economy takes another deep dip.\How much worse, and for how long, will determine the extent to which concerns about joblessness will determine the outcome of the 2010 elections and set the course for the remainder of the Obama administration.\That political reality makes President Obama's White House summit on jobs on Thursday the seminal event of a week that may well be the most newsworthy of his young administration.\Yes, joblessness is a bigger deal than Afghanistan.\Yes, joblessness is a bigger deal than health care.\Yes, joblessness is a bigger deal than the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen and the cap-and-trade fight.\It is a bigger deal, even, than Tiger Woods.\Don't read these words wrong. Afghanistan, health care and climate change matter. (Tiger Woods, not so much.) These challenges may pose more profound long-term threats and have more serious consequences than transitory joblessness numbers.\But if unemployment keeps rising - if it gets to 12, 13, 14 percent officially, and over 20 percent unofficially - it will be the only issue for the great masses of Americans who will tip the country's political balance in a direction that either empowers or disempowers the Obama administration when it comes to addressing fundamental social, environmental and foreign policy concerns.\In other words: It's still the economy, stupid.\So what should we hope for from the jobs summit? Something real, not tinkering around the edges, and not a reprise of the tepid stimulus initiative.\The intervention must be dramatic.\There are a lot of plans out there, some warmed-over versions of approaches that have failed in the past (more tax cuts for the rich), some visionary proposals for a transformational 21st century (groundbreaking green jobs initiatives).\The AFL-CIO has developed a smart proposal that focuses on job creation and retention as well as steps to aid those out of work. The labor federation is pressing to: ""1. Extend the lifeline for jobless workers. Unless Congress acts now, supplemental unemployment benefits, additional food assistance and expansion of COBRA health care benefits will expire at the end of the year. They must be extended for another 12 months to protect working families from bankruptcy, home foreclosure and loss of health care. Extending benefits also will boost personal spending and create jobs throughout the economy.\""2. Rebuild America's schools, roads and energy systems. America still has at least $3 trillion in unmet infrastructure needs. We should put people to work to fix our nation's broken-down school buildings and invest in transportation, green technology, energy efficiency and more.\""3. Increase aid to state and local governments to maintain vital services. State and local governments and school districts have a $178 billion budget shortfall this year alone - while the recession creates greater need for their services. States and communities must get help to maintain critical frontline services, prevent massive job cuts and avoid deep damage to education just when our children need it most.\""4. Fund jobs in our communities. While workers go without jobs, important work is left undone in our communities. We should put people to work restoring our environment, providing child care and tutoring, cleaning up abandoned houses and more. These are not replacements for existing public jobs. They must pay competitive wages and should target distressed communities.\""5. Put TARP funds to work for Main Street. The bank bailout helped Wall Street, not Main Street. We should put some of the billions of dollars in leftover Troubled Asset Relief Program funds to work creating jobs by enabling community banks to lend money to small- and medium-size businesses. If small businesses can get credit, they will create jobs.""\Jobs summiteers would also be wise to consider smart ideas presented by Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., to establish tax incentives for job creation and by Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., to increase federal support for ""work-share"" programs that provide incentives to companies to keep workers on the job.\And the summit should definitely consider two additional items - restructuring the auto industry bailout to prevent plant closures in the U.S. and a new approach to international trade that addresses outsourcing of jobs and the country's gaping trade deficit. As it happens, a smart initiative on trade, the Trade Reform, Accountability, Development, and Employment Act, was introduced this week in the Senate by Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown and has more than 125 supporters in the House.\""We want trade and we want more of it. But, we need a new direction,"" explains Brown. ""Done wrong, trade sends our jobs overseas. Done right, trade can foster new business and job growth at home, and can lift up workers in developing nations.""\Brown's right. Addressing unemployment requires a multifaceted response. Job creation is important.

94,"
A federal appeals court Friday sided with Wisconsin and 14 other states in ruling against the Bush administration's approach to reducing emissions of fish-contaminating mercury emitted by coal-fired power plants.
\
The decision is a green light for Wisconsin regulators to push ahead with their own plan to cut mercury emissions from power plants by 90%.
\
""What we see under the decision is that ultimately the court is saying that (the Bush administration rule) didn't go far enough, from a public health standpoint,"" said Matt Frank, secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources. ""This is very important decision, and we are very pleased that the court has taken this decision.""
\
It's unclear how much it would cost state utilities to comply with such a mandate, but the impact would be significant in a state that relies heavily on coal plants to make electricity. We Energies has estimated it would cost $50 million to $200 million to comply with the federal rule vacated by Friday's ruling.
\
Mercury pollution is a key concern because after it is released from smokestacks, it falls on water and converts to a more toxic form and accumulates in fish. Wisconsin has fish-consumption advisories that recommend people limit consumption of fish caught in state lakes.
\
""Mercury pollution is an incredible public health threat, and it's literally ruining people's ability in the state of Wisconsin to enjoy their lakes,"" said Dan Kohler, director of Wisconsin Environment, a group affiliated with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

Representatives of Wisconsin electric utilities said Friday that they were concerned that the court ruling leaves regulations in flux, and that it doesn't give them a clear road map of how to proceed.
\
""We and other utilities are looking at a state of uncertainty about what the eventual regulations will be, what will it be that we need to achieve, and by when,"" said Brian Manthey, a We Energies spokesman.
\
""We're pretty firmly stuck in limbo,"" agreed Rob Crain, spokesman for Madison-based Alliant Energy Corp.
\
In its decision, the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia said the Environmental Protection Agency's attempt to change the way mercury pollution would be regulated failed to follow Clean Air Act requirements. The EPA rule had sought a 70% reduction in mercury emissions from power plants by 2018.
\
The EPA's ""explanation deploys the logic of the Queen of Hearts, substituting EPA's desires for the plain text"" of the Clean Air Act itself, the appeals court ruling says.
\
Wisconsin joined several other states in suing the EPA over the rule in 2005. At the time, Gov. Jim Doyle said the federal rules didn't go far enough. Those standards, Doyle said, could lead to more mercury-contaminated fish in Wisconsin waterways.
\
That could dampen the public's appetite for catching fish, and anglers might shy away from a sport that is estimated to generate $2 billion yearly in Wisconsin, which a few years ago ranked sixth nationally in revenue generated from fishing.
\
Wisconsin's fish-consumption advisories urge pregnant and breastfeeding women, women planning to become pregnant and children younger than 15 to avoid eating certain fish, such as musky and swordfish, and to eat walleye, catfish and other game fish only once a month.
\
In 2000, the National Research Council estimated that 60,000 newborns a year are at risk of learning disabilities because of mercury their mothers absorbed during pregnancy. In recent years, the EPA and U.S. Food and Drug Administration have issued warnings to pregnant women and nursing mothers about the mercury risks from eating too much fish.
\
In Wisconsin, coal plants are the second-biggest source of mercury emissions after ERCO Worldwide, a Port Edwards chemical manufacturer that uses mercury in its production process.
\
That plant announced last summer that it will spend $95 million by 2009 to eliminate mercury from its process, reducing the state's emissions of mercury by about 28%.
\
Eric Uram, conservation chair with the Sierra Club's John Muir chapter, said the court ruling would result in a Clinton administration era directive taking effect. That directive gives the states power to apply more stringent air pollution standards for each power plant that comes up for renewal, he said.
\
Scott Manley, environmental policy director at Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, disagreed. That immediate requirement would be invoked only if the EPA doesn't respond to Friday's ruling with a new mercury rule, and EPA is required by the appeals court to issue a new rule, he said.
\
But conservation groups applauded the ruling and the DNR's decision to move forward with the tougher rule.
\
The DNR, Frank said, has been negotiating with environmentalists, business groups and the utilities over specifics of the rule -- for example, when the 90% reduction needs to be implemented.
\
Frank said he hopes to bring the revised rule back to the seven-member Natural Resources Board this spring and then get more input at public hearings.
\
Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce has expressed concern that Wisconsin's economy could become less competitive if regulations adding more cost to utilities will be borne by Wisconsin companies, making them less competitive.
\
A study conducted for the state's utilities said the added cost of a Wisconsin mercury rule being considered last year would have been $41 million to $57 million a year.
\
Uram said that amounts to less than a dollar a month for electricity customers. State residents have indicated in public opinion surveys that they would pay more to see mercury pollution curbed, he added.
\
A key concern for Wisconsin and environmental groups that sued the Bush administration was its call for a cap-and-trade scheme that would allow dirty power plants to release a lot of mercury by buying credits from cleaner-burning power plants.

95,"The most rigidly conservative members of the Republican National Committee are circulating a proposal to establish a purity test for the party's candidates.\If the test is adopted, the party would withhold money from any contender who disagreed with conservative principles on more than two of 10 essential issues identified by the right-wingers.\""The problem is that conservatives have lost trust in the Republican Party that we will govern as conservatives,"" argues James Bopp Jr., an RNC member from Indiana who has spearheaded the purity test push.\Earlier this year, Bopp and his compatriots pressured RNC Chair Michael Steele to declare President Obama to be a ""socialist."" The conservative crusaders were rebuffed then, but if they win approval for their purity test at the committee's winter meeting in January, the party will officially declare: ""Republican solidarity in opposition to Obama's socialist agenda is necessary to preserve the security of our country, our economic and political freedoms, and our way of life.""\With Orwellian irony, Bopp and his buddies have labeled their proposal ""Reagan's unity principle for support of candidates."" The relevant portion of the resolution reads: ""WHEREAS, the Republican National Committee shares President Ronald Reagan's belief that the Republican Party should espouse conservative principles and public policies and welcome persons of diverse views; and ""WHEREAS, the Republican National Committee desires to implement President Reagan's Unity Principle for Support of Candidates; and ""WHEREAS, in addition to supporting candidates, the Republican National Committee provides financial support for Republican state and local parties for party building and federal election activities, which benefits all candidates and is not affected by this resolution; ""THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Republican National Committee identifies 10 key public policy positions for the 2010 election cycle, which the Republican National Committee expects its public officials and candidates to support: ""1. We support smaller government, smaller national debt, lower deficits and lower taxes by opposing bills like Obama's 'stimulus' bill.\""2. We support market-based health care reform and oppose Obama-style government-run health care.\""3. We support market-based energy reforms by opposing cap and trade legislation.\""4. We support workers' right to secret ballot by opposing card check.\""5. We support legal immigration and assimilation into American society by opposing amnesty for illegal immigrants.\""6. We support victory in Iraq and Afghanistan by supporting military-recommended troop surges.\""7. We support containment of Iran and North Korea, particularly effective action to eliminate their nuclear weapons threat.\""8. We support retention of the Defense of Marriage Act.\""9. We support protecting the lives of vulnerable persons by opposing health care rationing, denial of health care and government funding of abortion.\""10. We support the right to keep and bear arms by opposing government restrictions on gun ownership; and be further ""RESOLVED, that a candidate who disagrees with three or more of the above stated public policy positions of the Republican National Committee, as identified by the voting record, public statements and/or signed questionnaire of the candidate, shall not be eligible for financial support and endorsement by the Republican National Committee.""\So here's a question: Applying the standard established in the resolution - review of the candidate's official record, public statements and answers to questions - would Ronald Reagan pass the purity test? Let's see: 1. Deficit spending soared during Reagan's presidency. Strike one.\2. As governor of California, Reagan oversaw the development of Medi-Cal, the nation's largest Medicaid program, expanding it to cover long-term care and developing massive new managed care systems. Strike two.\3. As governor of California, Reagan established the Air Resources Board to battle California's smog problems and supported aggressive government intervention where the market had failed to protect the environment. As president, Reagan signed more wilderness protection laws - which restrict private-sector exploitation of natural resources - than any president in history. Strike three.\4. Reagan was a former union president who campaigned against the Taft-Hartley Act and other restrictions of the right of unions to organize. Strike four.\5. Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which granted amnesty to most undocumented workers who could prove they had been in the country continuously for the previous five years. After he finished his presidency, Reagan continued to speak out forcefully for immigration rights. Strike five.\6. After the 1983 bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut, Reagan was urged by some to surge more troops into the region. Instead, he ordered the Marines to begin withdrawal from Lebanon. Strike six.\7. Reagan acknowledged that during his presidency, the U.S. sold weapons to Iran. Strike seven.\8. Reagan was the first president to invite an openly gay couple to spend the night in the White House, and he famously argued that gays and lesbians should not be discriminated against in a 1978 television advertising campaign. Strike eight.\9. Shortly after his inauguration as governor of California, Reagan signed into law the most liberal abortion statute of its day. Strike nine.\10. Here's Reagan, in 1991, on gun control: ""I support the Brady Bill, and I urge the Congress to enact it without further delay."" Strike 10.\Of course it is true that Reagan, like John Kerry, was for some ideas before he was against them. Reasonable people might debate the proper point at which to try to pin down Reagan.\But no reasonable person can suggest that Ronald Reagan would have met the eight-out-of-10 test the RNC right-wingers seek to apply - especially on hot-button issues such as gun control, gay rights and immigration.\Indeed, one of the favorites of the RNC's extreme conservatives, Florida U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio, recently declared that Reagan was wrong to support amnesty for undocumented immigrants.\And it is probably worth noting that, when Reagan was seeking the Republican nomination in 1980, conservatives Phil Crane and John Connolly suggested that ""the Gipper"" was an amiable fellow but just not pure enough. Crane positioned himself that year as a pure conservative alternative to Reagan.\Crane, the purist, won 1.8 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary and exited stage right.\John Nichols is the associate editor of The Capital Times. jnichols@madison.com\Credit: John Nichols"

STATE BUDGET
\
Too much waste
\
As employees of the Department of Corrections, my co-workers and I see money being wasted on a grand scale on a regular basis. We're talking millions of dollars. We have contacted our state legislators and the legislative committees on corrections about all the money being wasted in the DOC, and it has fallen on deaf ears.
\
The furloughs of state employees across the board is an example of wrongheaded state policy. The furlough applies to all state employees, but no one seems to understand that certain jobs in the state need to be filled 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I work in a housing unit where 240 convicted felons reside. We cannot just lock the prison doors and stay home for a couple of days. If I do not show up for work, my job still needs to be filled. Chances are, it will be filled by paying someone overtime. Spread that across 200 employees at my institution and across the other prisons in the state. In the DOC, this plan will end up costing the state more money -- not saving it!
\
In an effort to be ""fair and equitable"" with the implementation of furloughs, state government is doing a disservice to taxpayers. Looks good on paper, but in reality, it's a stupid idea. Real money -- lots of it -- can be saved, but this is definitely not the way. We have attempted to point out waste to administrators and legislators and the governor himself, to no avail.
\
Taxpayers of Wisconsin, how can you stand for this?

State legislation will be important, too
\
Part of me is really glad that there was a Sunday Symposium on cap-and-trade in the July 5 Crossroads section, and the other part is concerned about why people are only discussing a national bill.
\
I interned in Washington, D.C., earlier this summer, and I saw firsthand how federal legislation and policy is created there; legislators do the best they can to address the needs of all states. Right now, the Wisconsin Legislature is poised to draft the strong Clean Energy Economy bill that is the best for our state.
\
Wisconsin is different from other states -- a lot better, in my mind -- and if we take only what's handed down the pipeline, we will not see enough done to address our unique state, made great by its abundance of natural resources and proximity to the Great Lakes.
\
We should start talking about what we can do here, in the state Legislature, to make sure we are ready for the future. Please urge your state legislators to support a strong Clean Energy Economy bill that works for Wisconsin.

FORECLOSURES
\
Irresponsible banks
\
I read Cary Spivak's July 12 article on banks not taking title to foreclosed properties with interest and dismay (""Lenders abandoning foreclosed properties""). Why kick a family out of the house if you are not going to take possession and resell it?
\
But oddly, banks that do take possession might not be much better. My daughter and I discovered this as she was looking at houses in Bay View. There was a darling home near Hide House, and, as we went inside, my daughter wondered how much the bank would go down because it had been foreclosed on. The broker she is working with told her, ""You can't negotiate with banks. They have a set price, and they won't go down."" Plus, she added, they don't bother to return phone calls to brokers or respond to offers to purchase until prodded. They are simply absentee owners with no interest in selling or renting.
\
I discovered this personally when I called about a house on S. 9th St. I used the number of the mortgage company on the foreclosure sign. The company never called me back.
\
Perhaps these properties are a write-off at tax time? If so, that write-off should require that lending institutions show that they are, in good faith, trying to sell them. If this were required, banks would be rushing to hire people whose sole purpose is to get these properties to new owners as quickly as possible.

MPS
\
Accountability is key
\
I read with great interest the July 12 Journal Sentinel editorial ""Tony Evers must be a change agent for MPS,"" which took up three quarters of a page, telling State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers what he must do to change Milwaukee Public Schools. I also read the eight Advisory Hits concerning the same subject from members of the Editorial Board's Reader Advisory Committee.
\
One brief sentence in the editorial stated what I find to be the most pressing issue facing MPS and better results. Only two of the eight advisory members mentioned something similar.
\
The entire focus on responsibility and accountability must lie on the student to learn and, by extension, the parent(s). Without that, the way the system works now, a child must be passed to the next grade without knowing the subject matter (except for fourth and eighth grades) if the parent says so. A child deemed in need of special education by professionals cannot be ""labeled"" as such, should the parent not approve, thus leaving the child to struggle in a regular classroom. Children can be moved forward without having basic skills.
\
The schools are doing their jobs, the teachers are doing their jobs and now it is up to students and families to take responsibility for learning and be accountable for their action or inaction. Without this commitment, whatever Evers does is guaranteed to fail.

97,"The Coachella Valley is getting five hydrogen-powered buses to serve low-income communities -- and the largest hydrogen fueling station of its kind in the country.\SunLine Transit Agency's new zero-emission buses will run from Indio to Mecca and Oasis, passing through parts of the eastern Coachella Valley where childhood asthma is unusually common and ozone pollution from cars, trucks and industry far exceeds state averages. The hydrogen that fuels those buses with be generated by a process that uses electricity, some of which will come from solar panels, to split water molecules.\The upgrades are being funded by $12.5 million from California's cap-and-trade program, which requires oil refiners, power plants and other climate polluters to pay a fee for the greenhouse gases they emit. The Federal Transit Administration is pitching in with $2.75 million, and SunLine will chip in $5.2 million of its own.\SunLine is already a leader in hydrogen fuel cell technology -- the Coachella Valley transit authority started using hydrogen a decade ago, and currently runs five hydrogen-powered buses out of just 21 in the state. Fuel cell cars use oxygen to strip hydrogen atoms of their electrons, generating electricity and creating only water as a byproduct.\""A hydrogen bus is just an electric bus, it just doesn't have to be plugged in,"" Lauren Skiver, SunLine's chief executive, said in an interview. ""It's kind of like a hybrid car, but you're using an even cleaner fuel than gasoline to generate the electricity.""\Hydrogen cars, trucks and buses have been slow to take off, at least compared to plug-in vehicles. As of October, there were just 925 fuel cell vehicles registered in California, according to the state's Air Resources Board. By comparison, more than 250,000 plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles had been sold in California by November, according to the Plug-In Electric Vehicle Collaborative, a public-private partnership.\High costs are one of the reasons fuel cell cars aren't more popular. The Toyota Mirai, for instance, leases for $349 per month, with the Honda Clarity going for $369. But the lack of charging infrastructure is a bigger hurdle. According to the California Fuel Cell Partnership, which is funded by government agencies and car companies, there are just 27 retail fueling stations for passenger vehicles, mostly clustered in the Los Angeles Basin and the Bay Area. None of the hydrogen stations are in the Coachella Valley.\""You need stations to sell vehicles,"" said Nico Bouwkamp, technical program manager at the California Fuel Cell Partnership.\Another two dozen stations are funded and under development, according to a January report from the Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission. In 2013, state legislators passed a law calling for the development of 100 publicly accessible fueling stations, and directing the energy commission to spend up to $20 million annually to fund their construction. The report projects that goal will be met in 2024.\It costs between $2.4 and $2.8 million to build the average fueling station, the report estimates. Fuel cell advocates are hopeful that once 100 facilities are operational, private investors will be more willing to fund additional infrastructure, Bouwkamp said.\Gov. Jerry Brown has set a goal of putting 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles on California's roads by 2025 in an effort to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that are primarily responsible for climate change. While hydrogen cars face obstacles, they also have some advantages over plug-in electric vehicles. For instance, they currently have longer ranges: Toyota's Mirai can run 312 miles on a full tank, compared to 238 miles on a full change for the plug-in electric Chevrolet Bolt. Hydrogen vehicle drivers can also fill their tanks at traditional fueling stations, just like they're accustomed to doing with gasoline-powered cars -- and they don't have to wait hours for the vehicles to charge.\Still, the technology has its critics -- including Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric automaker Tesla Motors. At a conference in 2015, Musk called hydrogen fuel cells ""extremely silly,"" since they use energy far less efficiently than traditional electric cars.\""If you're going to pick an energy storage mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,"" Musk said at the time.\State officials say the $12.5 million grant to SunLine should help bring down the costs of fuel cell buses.\""The first generation of these buses were very expensive. Now they're less expensive, but they're still on the more expensive side if you compare them to a diesel or natural gas bus,"" said Peter Christensen, an official at the California Air Resources Board, which awarded the grant to SunLine after a competitive solicitation process.\Bouwkamp said it's important that Sunline's five new hydrogen-powered buses will be supplied by New Flyer, the largest manufacturer of transit buses in North America.\""They've never taken the lead on building those. Now they have a group internally working on fuel cell buses,"" Bouwkamp said. ""Now everyone can start working on cost reduction in a significant way.""\Another company, Hydrogenics, will build SunLine an ""electrolyzer,"" which produces hydrogen by using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms. State officials say it will be the country's largest electrolyzer.\That device will replace the ""steam reformer"" SunLine uses to produce hydrogen, which strips hydrogen molecules from natural gas.\Right now, 95 percent of the hydrogen produced in the United States comes from steam reformation, according to the federal Department of Energy -- and from a climate standpoint, that's a problem. While fuel cell cars produce no tailpipe emissions regardless of where their hydrogen comes from, steam reformation produces planet-warming carbon dioxide as a byproduct. When those emissions are taken into account, hydrogen-powered cars still pollute the climate, although less than traditional cars do.\Producing hydrogen via electrolysis, if widely adopted, would help solve that problem. Cost is the main obstacle: Electrolysis is more expensive than steam reformation.\And electrolysis isn't a perfect solution. Most electricity is still generated by burning fossil fuels, which spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But that problem is easier to solve. California already gets more than a quarter of its electricity from climate-friendly sources like solar and wind, and state law calls for 50 percent clean energy by 2030. Lawmakers are considering a bill that would raise the mandate to 100 percent by 2050.\Sammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun.

When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, global warming was a slow-moving environmental problem that was easy to ignore. Now it is a ticking time bomb that President-elect Barack Obama can't avoid.
\
Since Clinton's inauguration, summer Arctic sea ice has lost the equivalent of Alaska, California and Texas. The 10 hottest years on record have occurred since Clinton's second inauguration. Global warming is accelerating. Time is close to running out, and Obama knows it.
\
""The time for delay is over; the time for denial is over,"" he said on Tuesday after meeting with former Vice President Al Gore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on global warming. ""We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now that this is a matter of urgency and national security and it has to be dealt with in a serious way.""
\
But there are powerful political and economic realities that must be quickly overcome for Obama to succeed. Despite the urgency he expresses, it's not at all clear that he and Congress will agree on an approach during a worldwide financial crisis in time to meet some of the more crucial deadlines.
\
Obama is pushing changes in the way Americans use energy, and produce greenhouse gases, as part of what will be a massive economic stimulus. He called it an opportunity ""to re-power America.""
\
After years of inaction on global warming, 2009 might be different. Obama replaces a president who opposed mandatory cuts of greenhouse gas pollution and it appears he will have a willing Congress. Also, next year, diplomats will try to agree on a major new international treaty to curb the gases that promote global warming.
\
""We need to start in January making significant changes,"" Gore said in a recent telephone interview with The Associated Press. ""This year coming up is the most important opportunity the world has ever had to make progress in really solving the climate crisis.""
\
Scientists are increasingly anxious, talking more often and more urgently about exceeding ""tipping points.""
\
""We're out of time,"" Stanford University biologist Terry Root said. ""Things are going extinct.""
\
U.S. emissions have increased by 20 percent since 1992. China has more than doubled its carbon dioxide pollution in that time. World carbon dioxide emissions have grown faster than scientists' worst-case scenarios. Methane, the next most potent greenhouse gas, suddenly is on the rise again and scientists fear that vast amounts of the trapped gas will escape from thawing Arctic permafrost.
\
The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has already pushed past what some scientists say is the safe level.
\
In the early 1990s, many scientists figured that the world was about a century away from a truly dangerous amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, said Mike MacCracken, who was a top climate scientist in the Clinton administration. But as they studied the greenhouse effect further, scientists realized that harmful changes kick in at far lower levels of carbon dioxide than they thought. Now some scientists, but not all, say the safe carbon dioxide level for Earth is about 10 percent below what it is now.
\
Gore called the situation ""the equivalent of a five-alarm fire that has to be addressed immediately.""
\
Scientists fear that what's happening with Arctic ice melt will be amplified so that ominous sea level rise will occur sooner than they expected. They predict Arctic waters could be ice-free in summers, perhaps by 2013, decades earlier than they thought only a few years ago.
\
In December 2009, diplomats are charged with forging a new treaty replacing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which set limits on greenhouse gases, and which the United States didn't ratify. This time European officials have high expectations for the U.S. to take the lead. But many experts don't see Congress passing a climate bill in time because of pressing economic and war issues.
\
""The reality is, it may take more than the first year to get it all done,"" Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said recently.
\
Complicating everything is the worldwide financial meltdown. Frank Maisano, a Washington energy specialist and spokesman who represents coal-fired utilities and refineries, sees the poor economy as ""a huge factor"" that could stop everything. That's because global warming efforts are aimed at restricting coal power, which is cheap. That would likely mean higher utility bills and more damage to ailing economies that depend on coal production, he said.
\
Obama is stacking his Cabinet and inner circle with advocates who have pushed for deep mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas pollution and even with government officials who have achieved results at the local level.
\
The President-elect has said that one of the first things he will do when he gets to Washington is grant California and other states permission to control car tailpipe emissions, something the Bush administration denied.
\
And though congressional action may take time, the incoming Congress will be more inclined to act on global warming. In the House, liberal California Democrat Henry Waxman's unseating of Michigan Rep. John Dingell -- a staunch defender of Detroit automakers -- as head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a sign that global warming will be on the fast track.
\
Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., vowed to push two global warming bills starting in January: one to promote energy efficiency as an economic stimulus and the other to create a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utilities. ""The time is now,"" she wrote in a Dec. 8 letter to Obama.
\
Mother Nature, of course, is oblivious to the federal government's machinations. Ironically, 2008 is on pace to be a slightly cooler year in a steadily rising temperature trend line. Experts say it's thanks to a La Nina weather variation. While skeptics are already using it as evidence of some kind of cooling trend, it actually illustrates how fast the world is warming.
\
The average global temperature in 2008 is likely to wind up slightly under 57.9 degrees Fahrenheit, about a tenth of a degree cooler than last year. When Clinton was inaugurated, 57.9 easily would have been the warmest year on record. Now, that temperature would qualify as the ninth warmest year.

99,"If you listened closely, you might have detected a hint of optimism in the conversations among the dairy farmers and dairy suppliers attending the two-day annual business conference of the Wisconsin Dairy Business Association (DBA).\The 10-year-old statewide organization of dairy professionals is devoted to leading the growth and modernization of the state's dairy farms, furthering the image of the dairy industry and helping the public understand the economic value of dairying to Wisconsin.\Some of the later arriving visitors - many of them multi-generational dairy families - who had traveled from as far away as Grantsburg in northwest Wisconsin and Mosinee in north central Wisconsin wondered about the dozen or so pickets holding signs and standing in front of the Concourse Hotel.\The sign carriers' issues ranged from a desire to drink raw milk bought directly from a dairy farm to not wanting an Illinois contractor to build a large dairy farm in Vernon County, as was somewhat vaguely proposed a year ago.\Most of the seminar attendees did not know picketers were outside. Several farmers who had driven a long distance to get to the seminar concluded that ""there's always someone protesting something - like at World Dairy Expo - on our infrequent trips to Madison.""\Although the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is a major environmental rule maker and rule enforcer and is a big factor in all dairy farm expansions or new building projects, DNR Secretary Matthew Frank did his best to create an atmosphere of trust with the farm audience.\He said it was important to have state agencies talk to each other when dealing with dairy expansions - something that is not always done, which leaves the dairy producer in a state of confusion.\""Wisconsin is a place for many kinds of farms that comply with all the correct environmental aspects,"" Frank said. ""Some think this is mutually exclusive. It's not and we want to keep ag land in agriculture for a year and a hundred years.""\Frank said that on the national scene the Environmental Protection Agency is going to become more active in coming months and that ""they should look to Wisconsin for an example of how to proceed.""\""I have concern that you (dairy farmers) have to work with so many agencies and regulations,"" he said, ""Our goal (the DNR) is to protect the environment, not make regulations.""\He applauded the DBA and its president Jerry Meissner, Chili dairy producer, for its cooperation with the DNR - a strong relationship he wanted to continue.\""What Will We Do To Thrive after 2009"" was a discussion that many of the dairy producers eagerly awaited in light of the horrible economics of the past year that they still are facing.\A producer panel made up of Brian Larson, Cottonwood Dairy, South Wayne; Ben Peterson, Four Cubs Farm, Grantsburg; and Gordon Speirs, Shiloh Dairy, Brillion, did their best to outline their efforts to remain viable during the continuing period of low milk prices.\Each told of cost cutting measures they had taken ranging from lowering feed losses in bunker silo storage to modifying their dairy rations without cutting milk production to working more closely with outside nutrition and financial consultants.\Larson and Peterson said they've had success in using the futures market to achieve milk pricing gains. Speirs admitted that he might not have the personality to do well in the futures arena. And each producer told of ""leaving money on the table"" in past years when they had contracted a good milk price (at the time) only to have the price later zoom above their contracted price.\All three said they never entertained thoughts of getting out of dairying even in light of the major financial losses they suffered. Peterson said in retrospect he would have been better off financially to shut the cows off for six months and vacation in Hawaii.\Although these are among the top dairy operations in Wisconsin, their owners had no strong recommendations on ""How to thrive after 2009.""\""I know what I should have done yesterday but I am not sure what I should do tomorrow,"" Speirs said.\The discussion again showed that each Wisconsin dairy farm faces challenges differently and farmers are ingenious in their ability to survive tough times.\Other subjects discussed at the conference included: - Immigration reform. Three experts who work closely with the issue concluded that they couldn't be pro or con on the issue because there is no proposal being offered on the national scene.\- Cap and trade, which was called a ""bad program for Wisconsin,"" by Stephan Moore of the Wall Street Journal. ""It's an energy program that will tax manufacturing and agriculture,"" he added, ""and Wisconsin, because of it's big agriculture economy, will be the third hardest hit state.""\- Interest rates. Moore also predicted an increase in interest rates to the 4.5 percent to 6 percent range in the coming year. This was not a surprising revelation to the audience as a number of speakers and producers had forecast an interest rate jump earlier in the seminar.\- Food production was called ""a noble pursuit,"" by Charlie Arnot of The Center for Food Integrity. ""Today's successful farmer must have a 'social license' to meet the expectations of many consumers. They don't care how much you know about producing food until they know how much you care - and how much you care must be consistent with their social expectations.""\Arnot said most consumers trust farmers but they are not sure that some modern farming methods are farming as they look back to the little red barn with a few cows that they remember from their childhood.\The 10-year-old DBA has members that milk from 20 to 4,000 cows who consider themselves in the food production business long term and are willing to help determine their future through legislation, information and action.\The organization has a history of nonpartisan political activities and heard 2010 Republican gubernatorial candidates Scott Walker and Mark Neumann present their views, while Democrat Tom Barrett was unable to attend.\The group will be active in next year's state elections.\A common theme expressed from the speakers and from the 300 attendees in hall conversations centered around how dairy farming has changed from grandpa's day, and while the 20 cows on 80 acres of land might have provided a family living then, it won't work today. Nor could the burgeoning world population be fed under that system.\But the desire to farm is unchanged and Wisconsin's family dairy farmers will continue to provide and feed.\We're lucky!\John F.

100,"It's hard to miss U.S. Senate candidate Dave Westlake in a crowd.\During a rally against gay marriage in July at the state Capitol, he and the other 50 or so people attending the ""Summer for Marriage"" tour were surrounded by several hundred counter-protesters - some waving massive rainbow flags, wearing wedding dresses or holding brightly colored signs. \But there was Westlake, on the other side of the yellow police tape, almost glowing in a blaze orange button-up shirt. It's become the signature color of his unusual campaign, which is staffed by volunteers and funded in part by sales of his blaze orange T-shirts declaring, ""I am Dave Westlake.""The Republican Senate hopeful says he chose the classic hunting color as part of a pledge to be visible to the people of Wisconsin. \""If politicians who are in Washington voting for things that we don't want them to vote for had to wear blaze orange when they came back here, they couldn't hide,"" Westlake said. ""We could find them and hold them accountable.""Westlake, 36, got into the Senate race more than a year ago. A small-business owner from Watertown, he's been running his printer ink and toner business while logging what he says have been more than 70,000 miles on the campaign trail. From bars to coffee shops, tea parties to parades, he has relied on a low-budget, grass-roots approach to spread his conservative message, saying people want a change from politics as usual. \But can Westlake, who had just $1,952 in his campaign coffers at the end of June, beat millionaire businessman Ron Johnson, who has big money and the endorsement of the state GOP behind him, to win the Republican nomination in September? \I am not Ron Johnson \Like Johnson, Westlake has never before run for public office. Both men are animated in their opposition to the new federal health care law, oppose tax increases and support smaller government. But Westlake winces at the mention of news articles that have described the two as similar candidates. \Westlake, who was born in Beaver Dam and raised on a farm between there and Watertown, said he decided to run for Senate out of a commitment to ""duty, honor, country"" - principles he studied at West Point. \""I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution years ago when I graduated from West Point,"" he said. ""And that oath is not just something that was a part-time commitment for me."" \He refers to the Constitution frequently, speaking eagerly of his commitment to the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the 10th Amendment's guarantee of states' rights. \While Johnson has been regarded as the establishment candidate by some tea party groups, Westlake has won their praise - and their straw polls, although sometimes those have involved just a couple of dozen respondents. \""He will not budge on matters and principles,"" Kim Simac, founder of the Northwoods Patriots and president of Republican Women of the  North, said when she introduced Westlake at the state Republican convention in Milwaukee this spring. ""This is why people are drawn to Dave, because he actually tells you what he believes.""Kirsten Lombard of the Wisconsin 9/12 Project knocked Johnson after he cancelled a meeting with her group but praised Westlake for his knowledge of the Constitution and his willingness to talk about his views. \""Dave has made himself incredibly accessible,"" Lombard said. ""We did two vetting sessions with him."" \On a shoestring \Westlake and his wife, Amy, moved back to Wisconsin from Illinois in 2003. He's been running his business, High IQ, since 2006 and said the economic downturn and what he's witnessed as a small-business owner have made him concerned about where the country is going. \""About 75 percent of my clients have lost their businesses,"" Westlake said. ""And so I see this dramatic toll the economy has taken on the people that I do business with.""He said he decided to run for Russ Feingold's U.S. Senate seat because his passion is for politics on the federal level, and he believes ""the greatest need for leadership is in the U.S. Senate right now.""But statewide campaigns don't come cheap. Westlake and his volunteers have relied on social media such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, as well as word of mouth. Johnson and his team of 30 paid staffers have already produced multiple television commercials and brought in big-money campaign contributions. \Lombard said Westlake's low-budget campaign shows his commitment to limited spending. \""It's true that Dave has run his campaign on a shoestring,"" she said. ""But the voters look at it as how he will spend their money in office."" \The long shot \Westlake may have wowed many tea partiers, but it's unclear how much of an impression he's made on the party regulars who will be voting in the Sept. 14 primary - or whether most people even know his name. \""Westlake is an extreme long-shot candidate given the extreme backing of the party (for Johnson) and the disparity of resources between them,"" UW-Madison political science professor Charles Franklin said. \But Westlake said ""money has never been an effective tool"" against Feingold, and argued ""a strong message and a strong candidate"" is needed to beat the longtime incumbent. \Even if he manages an upset and beats Johnson in the primary, Franklin predicts Westlake's views - which he describes as ""outside the mainstream of modern conservatism"" - will make it difficult for him to compete in the general election. \Westlake, for example, would outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. Franklin said general public opinion ""supports life and health (of the mother) in incest cases at least.""""I think Westlake is taking positions that are much harder to defend,"" Franklin said. \AT A GLANCE | DAVE WESTLAKE \Age: 36 \Family: Married to Amy Westlake.

The most efficient, low-cost, long-term solution requires three fundamental components: tort and/or malpractice reform, allowing individuals to shop for insurance coverage that fits their needs - across state lines if necessary - and allowing insurance companies to specialize in specific risk pools to effectively address pre-existing conditions.' \On immigration reform \'Ultimately what we need is to eliminate the incentives to come here illegally. So that goes two ways. Our government is giving so many incentives to come here illegally ... but then we also don't punish those who knowingly hire (illegal immigrants) and just keep them hidden.'

101,"Expanding Boys & Girls Clubs helps community\I'm dismayed by the negative reactions to the proposed closing of a single block of South Locust Street to enable the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Fox Valley to expand to accommodate the needs of the children in our community.\Any child, regardless of race, religion, or financial means, is eligible to join the Club. During the school year, there are supervised homework sessions. There are also many programs that promote character and leadership development, health and life skills, education and career development, and the arts. All of these programs are available during the summer as well.\It's important to also understand that play is actually an integral part of a child's development and necessary for developing social skills. While it's true children do play while at the center, they're doing so in a safe, supervised environment.\In a city as large as Appleton, it's crucial for the community to have a safe place available for our children, especially in light of the current economy, when parents often must work, and many children over the age of 12 must be left home alone.\This is often when children can get into terrible situations that shatter their lives, their families' lives, and can severely limit the opportunities available for them in the future.\It's been said that ""it takes a village to raise a child"" and, in our fractured modern society, in which extended family is no longer within walking distance, there isn't generally ""a village"" to offer support to parents and children anymore.\The Boys & Girls Clubs do offer such support, and it's important that we, as part of the ""village,"" in turn support the expansion of this vital resource in our community. Let's make the well-being of this community's children our first priority. In the long run, we will all benefit.\Kim Daniel,\Appleton\Criticism of column about race unjustified\Although some people do not agree with all that Ron Dunlap said in his March 17 column, some of the subsequent comments it engendered are well off the mark. Dunlap's column has been criticized because it alluded to the ""black community"" and our country's long history of racism.\Dunlap has been accused of identifying with a community based on race and has, in effect, been called a ""racist"" for doing so. Moreover, he has been accused of suggesting that some Americans who are white are threatened by African-Americans.\I think those who criticize Dunlap's ideas have demonstrated they neither identify nor empathize with the concerns of a minority that remains sensitive to the historical fact that they have suffered discrimination since being introduced to the United States, and still do face discrimination in parts of the country today.\We all identify with certain communities based on ethnic, religious, professional and racial composition. It's perfectly normal for Dunlap to identify with other black people and to be sensitive to being black himself because of our country's history of fearing and distrusting minorities.\I, a white person, don't feel threatened by Dunlap's inherent concern about racial attitudes. After all, the Ku Klux Klan and other racist ""communities"" don't hide their distrust and fear of ethnic and racial minorities.\Finally, to fault Dunlap for being a successful professional in a white-dominated educational system to which he has made significant contributions is unfair.\Ron Dunlap has not refused to allow others to think of him as an individual by hiding inside his race. Instead, his sensitivity to minorities has enabled him to act as an advocate for all students in a society that has historically not provided equal opportunity to all of its minority citizens.\Gary McGoey,\Appleton\Stimulus spending will leave us in worse shape\Our Washington politicians are going to borrow tons of money because we're in a financial crisis. What are they going to do with this money? Well, they're going to give a lot of it away to the rich crooks who caused this mess in the first place. Then they're going to give a lot of it away to state politicians who helped cause this mess. Then they're going to give a lot of it away to local politicians who also helped cause this mess.\What are these crooks and politicians going to do with our money? The crooks won't tell us where a lot of the money went, but they're going to pay themselves huge bonuses.\What are the politicians going to do? According a Post-Crescent story on the Appleton Area School District's stimulus money, ""50 percent of the special education funding will go for new programming and additional services,"" which means this one-time money will become new taxes in the future.\And, according to The Post-Crescent, ""Wisconsin health officials hope to expand their efforts to protect the state's children against preventable diseases with nearly $4 million in economic stimulus money from the federal government.\Additionally, Wisconsin will get more than $30 million ""to expand the availability of child care for needy families."" This also means that this one-time money will become new taxes in the future. There's nothing more to say.\Tim Crowe,\Appleton\Obama budget plans leading to socialism\Let me see now if I have this right. President Obama is proposing a budget for next fiscal year of $3.6 trillion. (A trillion is followed by 12 zeros). Already enacted is the $787 billion stimulus bill in February. This has been followed by the recently signed $410 billion Omnibus Appropriation Act, which might better be called ""Congress' Re-election Bill."" This is a reversal of various campaign promises by the president to scour the budget and root out all earmarks.\If the $3.6 trillion proposed budget is enacted, it will increase the federal deficit by $1.8 trillion. This would more than double the current national debt, adding more to that debt than have all of the previous presidents combined.\Lurking in the future are two proposals. One is $600 billion in higher energy taxes through a cap-and-trade system on carbon emissions. The second is a $630 billion fund to expand a government-run health care program through higher taxation. Yet to come is a remake of Social Security. Beware, senior citizens.\This is all part of President Obama's plan to redistribute wealth in this country, as he promised while campaigning. He would also add new and expanded ""tax credits"" (actually welfare) to the 49 percent of voters who pay no federal income taxes, to be paid for by raising taxes on the 51 percent of voters who do pay taxes.\His repeated statements to increase taxes only on those making $250,000 or more is disingenuous because of his proposal to lift the current payroll tax cap of $106,800, to increase top income rates to 39.6 percent and to increase taxes on capital gains and dividends, plus interest income, to 20 percent.\All of this raises a question: Are we faced with galloping inflation and creeping socialism?\David Coons,\Neenah\Winnebago board faces Family Care decision\The Winnebago County Board faces its toughest decision in a decade at its meeting at 6 p.m. Tuesday on the fourth floor of the county courthouse in Oshkosh.\Should Winnebago County deliver Family Care in partnership with Fond du Lac and Manitowoc counties, creating a new level of government organization, called the Lakeland Long Term Care District?\Family Care is Wisconsin's future delivery system for long-term care of the frail elderly and developmentally disabled under a managed care arrangement, promising to eliminate waiting lists for services.\Supervisors have never been informed about the not-for-profit coalition ""private"" system adopted by 12 counties between here and Milwaukee and selected by Calumet, Outagamie and Waupaca as their model.\The Human Services board and department have done extensive planning on the recommended governmental ""public"" model since September 2008 as evidenced by the Lakeland LTC District minutes available at the Winnebago County Web site.\Last Thursday, the Health and Human Services board voted 5-3 to advance the resolution.

102,"ENCOURAGING: It has been a long time since I've been able to have any confidence in our president. Oh, what a relief it is. Finally, somebody who thinks before (and while) he speaks, somebody with the energy and the intellect to tackle more than one issue at a time, someone who has the support of an inclusive, broad-based party. We are starting to move in the right direction -- on energy policy, on the environment, on health care, on foreign policy, on getting back to the values that have made us a great country -- back to real family values. As he's starting to correct the economic mess we're in, he's also planning for the long range -- using the same programs to do both. I don't believe in giving grades after the first few yards of an eight-year marathon, but, so far, I am greatly encouraged by what I see.\Andy Wegner,\Winneconne\WHERE'S THE CHANGE? On economic matters, sadly, Obama has continued the failed policies of his predecessor. The large financial institutions and their ""leaders"" should not be feeding at the public trough. Economic stimulus should be going to public works, small business and individuals. More lenient bankruptcy laws and usury laws are required, but Obama has not been aggressive enough to push Congress for those reforms. On foreign affairs, I hope that we aren't bogged down in Afghanistan for many years. I hope that my grandson isn't asked to fight a war in Asia. Obama ran as the ""change"" guy. I'd like to see more change. One thing that would help is to send more nominations for sub-Cabinet posts to the Senate. Too many posts are vacant or still held by Bush appointees.\Richard Tanzer,\Neenah\WARY: My job as an American citizen is to support my president, regardless of my feelings. That being said, I'm learning to develop a taste for vodka, potatoes and borscht, as I lament the death of capitalism in this country as we know it.\Chad Nehring,\Allouez\IN CHARGE: What's 100 days except news media hype? We need to give the man some time, especially considering what he inherited. If I have to give an opinion at this point, it's that I'm impressed that he's taking action. He's made it clear that he's in charge and that he has managed to control what is potentially his worst enemy, the Democratic-controlled Congress, particularly Nancy Pelosi.\Keith Murie,\Iola\RIGHT DIRECTION: The United States is a big ship, and it can't turn on a dime. This is why the president's approach has been characterized by a combination of commitment and caution. He clearly is serious about confronting the economic crisis, getting disentangled from Iraq, restoring respect for America among allied nations, and finally providing affordable health care, but he realizes that in American politics, fundamental changes can't be forced but have to be built by consensus. The necessity for garnering support for his programs from as many mainstream political players as possible, and the need to reassure the country that he's not the dangerous radical his opponents have portrayed him as, mean that he has to move slowly on all these fronts. But he's moving in the right direction. My judgment: too early for results, but a good start; let's see where we are in a year.\Jon Corelis,\Appleton\EXTREME: Let's look at his accomplishments. First, $10,000,000,000,000 debt for our great-grandchildren. The only cuts are from the military. He took control of banks, AIG and the auto industry and wants to nationalize health care more. Tax hikes on small businesses (backbone of country). Tax rebates for those not paying taxes (welfare). Reduced charitable tax deductions. Billions for ""cap and trade"" global warming hoax. Taxpayer funding of abortions and embryonic stem cells. Release of top-secret documents to our enemies. He took a world tour apologizing for America. He bows to the king of Saudi Arabia, sits and listens to an hour rant against America without walking out and yucks it up with Hugo Chavez. He talks about disarming America while North Korea fires missiles and is going to ""talk"" with Iran. He is a far left, radical socialist but, boy, can he give a speech (if his teleprompter doesn't break).\Marion Koepke,\Center\SCARY: The biggest surprise of the past 100 days has been realizing I'm actually nostalgic for Bill and Hillary. I expected the worst after Barack Obama was elected, but I wasn't prepared for the speed with which he would promote abortion worldwide, increase our debt, dismantle national security policies and undertake a major restructuring of our economy. I also never dreamed he would gut the program training and certifying airline pilots to carry handguns to thwart terrorist takeover attempts. The first 100 days of his presidency have made me very scared for what else he will come up with in the next 1,360.\Jane Cops,\Kaukauna\CLEANING UP: When I think of one of the 12 tasks expected of Hercules, that being to clean out the Aegean Stables, Obama's 100 days have been equally daunting. When Hercules shoveled the ""animal fertilizer"" out, another took its place. So Hercules redirected a river to flow through the stable to clean it. Perhaps Obama needs to redirect the Potomac to flow through Washington, D.C., to cleanse the ""fertilizer"" left by the ""compassionate conservatives."" I advocated prior to the November elections that if Obama won, he needed to open all the windows, air out the chambers, scrub everything down and disinfect. Only then could he begin to restore our government and our nation. I believe he's trying to do that in spite of the efforts of the ""compassionate conservatives"" to shovel more ""fertilizer"" into the stables.\Kenneth Navine,\Appleton\TOO EARLY:\Really, it's only been 100 days? An awful lot has been packed into that short period of time. President Obama campaigned on a platform of change, and he's certainly living up to that promise. It's too early to tell whether or not his policies will do the good work he envisions, but our future may depend on his success. It's high time we all put the divisiveness of partisanship aside and worked together. My major concern, like millions of others, is how our grandchildren will fare under the huge debt being generated.\Ron Colling,\Little Chute\HOPE FOR BEST: I pray to God every night that what the president is doing will bring back the economy of the country, but I'm scared to death.\Jean M. Haese,\Menasha\FINE JOB: The actions of Franklin Roosevelt began the 100-day tradition, yet he wished the ""100 days"" could be exorcised from commonplace. Barack Obama, thus far, has done a fine job and more power to him. On the turn, tomorrow we could be faced with nuclear war against North Korea and the first hundred days would be meaningless. Somehow I don't think the swine, I mean the H1N1 flu, will be his greatest adversary. Bush enjoyed a moderate 2,400 hours and a few hundred to follow until 9-11 and all the tumbling, juggling and lying in accompaniment. I can say fervently that at least President Obama knows how to speak the English language fluently with passion and promise. On the contrary, I can't judge his potential worth without full knowledge of the future. If I had to, I would say that the mood lighting is rising in these dimly lit times.\Ben Fucik,\Appleton\LITTLE IMPROVEMENT: Like a typical lawyer, Obama talks a lot about the problems of this nation, but has done very little to improve them. He has made grandiose declarations about how he's going to hire only the most honest and ethical people for his Cabinet, yet he appoints tax cheats and other types of liars, then says they're the only people who can do the job the way he wants. Mr. Obama says one thing and does another. It's no wonder the stock markets are so erratic. His performance as president the last 100 days is that of a typical lawyer, simply unbelievable.\Larry Smith,\Neenah\CONCERNING: I did not vote for President Obama primarily because of his position on a number of issues and serious concerns about his judgment. The situation with our economy and the generally favorable attention he receives from the media has drawn attention away from the total lack of needed bipartisanship in Congress. His stimulus package was twice the size it needed to be. It did not receive the line-by-line review he promised. His proposed budget is the extreme in deficit spending. I believe he has unnecessarily demeaned our image in the world. His more accommodating approach with our adversaries has proved ineffective. His actions on right-to-life issues have largely been ignored. He believes that waterboarding was torture but has personally supported partial-birth abortion. This apparently is not an issue to many but, in my mind, it's the true measure of both our country and our president.\Paul Breitbach,\Kaukauna\SINCERE EFFORT: I did not vote for President Obama. However, I'm a pragmatist, not an ideologue. The more successful Obama is, the better off I will be. I believe he's sincerely trying to follow what he thinks is the best course for our nation, both domestically and in foreign policy. We cannot ""do nothing."" We cannot debate what to do for the next two years. We must act. Because of the psychology involved, the mere fact that he's trying is vitally important. FDR said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" In these uncertain times, panic must be avoided. We do not have to agree with President Obama on his course of action. But it is in our country's best interests if it works.\Richard Marsh,\Appleton"
103,"What a beautiful article by Steven Griffith (Jan. 9) explaining how climate change and cold spells are not inconsistent. As a high school science teacher, Griffith has a gift for conveying scientific information and logical thought.\Now, if a high school economics teacher would write an article explaining why carbon taxes are the most efficient and inexpensive way to reduce emissions, your readers would understand that a national carbon tax is so much better than EPA regulations. Regulations only affect some segments of the economy, and do not affect foreign countries. Carbon taxation affects the entire economy equitably and, with border adjustments, prevents U.S. businesses from being at a disadvantage competing with foreign businesses.\A U.S. carbon tax would also induce foreign countries to adopt their own carbon tax in order to avoid paying U.S. carbon taxes. Furthermore, although carbon taxes force prices to increase, the taxes can be rebated to the public, alleviating the hardship of price increases. Regulations also force prices up, but do not offer rebates to individuals. Businesses want Congress to take action on climate change. Roughly 700 have signed a declaration urging U.S. climate action because business needs a stable environment in which to function (stable water supply, stable weather to protect outdoor workers, stable sea level to protect coastal infrastructure, stable power supply).\Businesses do not want to face a different climate change policy in each state, they prefer one national policy.They prefer a gradually rising revenue-neutral carbon tax with border adjustments because it is predictable, easy to administer, and leaves them the freedom to decide how to adapt (instead of having regulations imposed on them).

104,"The voices of the majority of the world's climate scientists have now been joined by the voices of business and government leaders.\George Shultz, secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan, helped negotiate the most effective global climate treaty ever -- the Montreal Accord. He continues to work for what he sees as improvements to national, economic and environmental security by addressing the growing threat of global climate chang.\Most recently, he has joined Henry Paulson, treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and other ex-government officials from both parties and businessmen in commissioning a far-reaching study called the Risky Business Project.\The project report presents a picture of what may happen to the nation's economy in a world of unchecked global warming and makes an urgent plea for bipartisan action.\This report echoes an op-ed written by Paulson, who said, ""We're staring down a climate bubble that poses enormous risks to both our environment and economy. The warning signs are clear and growing more urgent as the risks go unchecked.""\While the Risky Business Report and Paulson's comment warn of great damage to the economy and the enormous costs -- hidden and visible -- of doing nothing, they also clearly acknowledge the physical damage of rising oceans, drought, wild fires, flooding and other climate damages that have become, are becoming, and will become increasingly frequent. These are among the hidden costs of carbon pollution that are unintended and unpriced that affect society.\From Hurricane Sandy's devastating blow to the Northeast to the protracted drought that hit the Midwest corn belt, natural catastrophes across the United States pounded insurers last year, generating $35 billion in privately insured property losses, $11 billion more than the average over the last decade.\Most insurers, including the reinsurance companies that bear much of the ultimate risk in the industry, have little time for the arguments heard in some right-wing circles that climate change isn't happening, and are quite comfortable with the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the main culprit of global warming.\Paulson advocates for a fee-and-dividend approach to carbon dioxide emissions as a way to change behavior of individuals and businesses toward alternative energy sources.\The fee-and-dividend approach is known as Pigovian ""taxation."" Not really a tax, it's a gradually increasing fee reflecting the carbon content of fossil fuels. It creates a revenue stream generated from something that was formerly a problem. Business incentives are created to reduce carbon, all without heavy handed legislation.\The fee is borne by the producer, who will pass it on to the consumer via pricing. It becomes ""revenue neutral"" by returning its revenue in the form of lump-sum rebates to each buyer, in monthly checks.\This would soften the blow for consumers, while preserving the incentive to explore other alternative energy sources.\This form of taxation isn't new, and plenty of countries have had taxes that could be described as Pigovian.\Government, political, economic and literary figures including Schultz, Paulson, Thomas Friedman, Alan Greenspan, Larry Summers, Joseph Stiglitz, Charles Krauthammer, Paul Volcker, Arthur Laffer and a majority of economists endorse this approach.\The wisdom, value and practicality of a fee-and-dividend solution have been confirmed by an internationally acclaimed microeconomic modeling company, REMI.\The following are highlights of the national level results of the REMI study in 2025:\Two million more jobs under the F&D carbon tax than in the baseline.\A 33 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from baseline conditions.\Thirteen thousand premature deaths saved from improvements in air quality.\The F&D rebates return nearly $400 billion in rebates to households.\Gross domestic product increases between $80 billion and $90 billion.\The problems ahead for the world's climate and economy are becoming clearer and more urgent. These warnings, often in opposition to political-party ideology, should heighten our sense of urgency, not create an excuse for weak denial excuses or conspiracy theories.\Contact your legislator and demand action, not politics.\-- Howard Brown is a Neenah resident.

106,"In measuring growing worldwide carbon dioxide levels, we've also determined that the overwhelming majority of this gas comes from burning fossil fuels. Every ton of carbon that's extracted and burned puts 3.67 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. This amounts to more than 30 billion metric tons of CO2 added to the atmosphere each year. That's more than 9,000 pounds for every person on Earth.\While minor amounts of CO2 are absorbed into ocean or are consumed by plants in photosynthesis, the vast majority is left to accumulate in the atmosphere at increasing rates.\If you add a pulse of extra CO2 into the atmosphere, only about half of it will be gone from the air a century later.

107,"For Post-Crescent Media\In measuring growing worldwide carbon dioxide levels, we've also determined that the overwhelming majority of this gas comes from burning fossil fuels. Every ton of carbon that's extracted and burned puts 3.67 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. This amounts to more than 30 billion metric tons of CO2 added to the atmosphere each year. That's more than 9,000 pounds for every person on Earth.\While minor amounts of CO2 are absorbed into ocean or are consumed by plants in photosynthesis, the vast majority is left to accumulate in the atmosphere at increasing rates.\If you add a pulse of extra CO2 into the atmosphere, only about half of it will be gone from the air a century later.

I'm not an advocate for climate change! I want to stop it from continuing to damage our environment.\Rubow seems not to understand how the carbon dioxide released by burning coal and oil can bring about both droughts and floods (which we've always had). Because of global warming, in dry climates such as California and Arizona, droughts are getting more severe and, because warm air holds more water than cold air does, floods, in other areas, are also more severe.\Rubow is wrong when he says that scientists contend the world is getting warmer and cooler simultaneously. Scientists say that the world is getting warmer. ""It has been the hottest May ever, says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The world's average surface temperature was 0.74 degrees Celsius above its 20th century average,"" according to a June article in The Economist.\Economists of all stripes agree that if you want less of anything, tax it. If you want to burn less carbon, tax it.

109,"Electric vehicles are among the most promising of green technologies, offering cleaner air and lower greenhouse gas emissions than those produced with gasoline-powered vehicles.\But they face consumer resistance in many parts of the country, especially because of the relatively low range of miles they can travel between charges. Federal and state tax credits are one way to help advance the technology and build consumer confidence.\These incentives differ from those applied previously to hybrid vehicles. The new tax credits - up to $7,500 is available in federal incentives, and up to $5,000 in state credits can be claimed in some places - are only available for newly purchased, fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. The amount of the credit depends on the battery size, and it is phased out as sales increase. That is, the credit is designed to push a new technology, not to permanently subsidize electric cars.\Some complain the tax credits are unnecessary because they benefit affluent buyers who can afford costly electric vehicles. This may be true for buyers of the Tesla Model S or the BMW i8, but the credit also is available for less expensive models, such as the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt and Ford Focus Electric. Others object to the seemingly high value of the tax credits. Yet studies have shown that an even larger tax credit might be necessary to make up for the higher cost of electric vehicles, especially with gasoline's current low price.\Sales of electric vehicles have been rising but remain low, registering at about 10,000 per month compared to the 1.4 million conventional cars and light trucks sold in the same time. So electric vehicles constitute less than 1 percent of the market. If we want that to grow, with the benefits of reduced air pollution, improved public health and lower greenhouse gas emissions, we need to continue the credits or offer comparable incentives.\Why should government favor one technology over another through economic incentives? The idea is to foster a transition to greener energy sources.\That's also the reason to encourage many new transportation technologies. A combination of cleaner cars and better mass transit could have a major impact on urban air quality.\Yes, the electricity that runs electric vehicles may come from power plants fired by coal and natural gas, but those generating facilities typically are not located in urban cores. And as a greater percentage of electricity is produced from wind and solar energy, and as coal-fired power plants are phased out or cleaned up, the overall contribution to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions should come down.\Consider also that we rely overwhelmingly, about 83 percent, on fossil fuels as our energy source today, and those fuels remain heavily subsidized. There is no completely free market here.\As one example, the federal gasoline tax has not been increased since 1993 even though it now fails to generate sufficient revenue to pay for highway maintenance. States also are reluctant to raise the gas tax. Yet continued low gas taxes are another subsidy for drivers of conventional vehicles.\A carbon tax could stimulate market forces to promote many different green technologies, including electric vehicles. However, at the moment, it lacks sufficient political and public support. Until that environment changes, keeping the electric vehicle tax credit makes sense.\Credit: MICHAEL E.

110,"In 2010 and again in 2012, the Obama administration negotiated agreements with auto companies on new fuel economy standards.\Passenger vehicles were to get an average of 34.5 miles per gallon by the model year 2016 and 54.5 mpg by 2025. The rules also set greenhouse gas emission limits for cars, trucks and SUVs.\Anyone who has driven a newer vehicle cannot help but notice the improved fuel economy. It represents the biggest jump in federal efficiency standards since their introduction in 1975. Yet the value of the rules could be greatly diminished if consumers maintain their current preference for SUVs and light trucks over cars.\Presumably, buyers' decisions reflect low gasoline prices as well as an improving economy. And why should buyers change given minimal incentives to choose more efficient vehicles'\Adopting a carbon tax or raising gas taxes to pay for much needed highways could provide a big incentive to conserve fuel.\That said, are the new fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission rules a good deal for us'\Yes, they are, though analysts differ in how they estimate the impacts. To get the fullest picture, we should include both direct financial gain from improved fuel economy and indirect benefits related to climate change and improved air quality.\The direct financial gain for new car buyers depends on the cost of gasoline and the anticipated rise in the cost of new vehicles attributable to the higher fuel economy standards.\We don't know the latter precisely. Much depends on how auto companies alter vehicle designs and which technologies they employ.\In its most recent analysis, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the buyer of a 2016 car will save $3,000 over its lifetime. The anticipated savings are even greater for a 2025 car, about $10,000.\In short, the EPA says the new standards generate far more savings to consumers than they will cost. These estimates are for those paying cash for a car, but substantial savings exist for those who finance a vehicle, too.\What about indirect benefits of the rules? Improved fuel economy also translates into gains in public health, reduction in the risk of climate change, and improved energy security.\All of these benefits are substantial, particularly the public health impacts for those suffering from lung diseases such as asthma - 23 million people, or over 7 percent of the population.\The agencies' regulatory impact analysis for the 2016 model year standards puts the monetized or measurable benefits at nearly five times the costs, or $240 billion in benefits compared to $52 billion in costs. The benefits for the 2017 through 2025 model years are about three times the anticipated costs.\Thirteen major automakers supported the initiative to develop a consistent nationwide standard and create regulatory certainty going forward. In addition, the agencies continue to work with auto companies on many details of how the rules will be applied.\We are well on our way to a far brighter future in vehicle efficiency. We should recognize the enormous value of the new standards and strongly encourage automakers to do even better in developing new transportation technologies.\Credit: MICHAEL E.

President Barack Obama's campaign promise to explore new sources of renewable energy is one element of his budget that is nonnegotiable, say administration officials.
\
While Obama is willing to work with Congress on some portions of his $3.6 trillion budget proposal, his energy plan is not subject to the standard wheeling and dealing between the administration and lawmakers, aides indicated this past weekend.
\
Standing firm on his energy agenda, Obama planned to make the case Monday for a budget proposal that invests billions in research designed to reduce climate change and guarantees loans for companies that develop clean energy technologies. Obama has tied his first budget proposal as president to a renewable energy program to help the United States move toward energy independence.
\
In a fact sheet released Monday, the White House said Obama's meeting with clean energy entrepreneurs and leaders of the research community will outline an energy program that draws on the administration's $787 billion stimulus package for $39 billion at the Department of Energy and $20 billion in tax incentives for clean energy.
\
It also disclosed that his 10-year budget proposal contains spending of nearly $75 billion to make permanent existing tax cuts for energy research and experimentation.
\
""What we do expect and what we are going to stand very firm on -- because this president, this vice president have made this clear -- that there are these priorities that brought them to the dance here: energy reform, health care reform, education, all done in the context of a budget that cuts the deficit in half over our first term,"" said Jared Bernstein, economics adviser to Vice President Joe Biden
\
Obama and his aides plan an aggressive effort for the president's $3.6 trillion budget that contains many of his campaign promises. He plans to speak about the energy portion of his budget, highlighting research and development in clean energy. He also will focus on how part of the $787 billion economic stimulus package already is working to create much-needed jobs.
\
Obama plans to follow that with a prime-time news conference on Tuesday. The president is back in campaign mode as he pushes for a budget proposal that, so far, has faced opposition from members of both parties.
\
Democrats worry the plan inflates deficit spending; the Congressional Budget Office estimates Obama's budget would generate $9.3 trillion in red ink over the next decade. Republicans say it would impose massive tax increases, including on polluters; Washington could raise billions from companies that use unclean fuels, what GOP leaders called a carbon tax.
\
Obama said the country must provide incentives for so-called green businesses.
\
""I realize there are those who say these plans are too ambitious to enact,"" Obama said in his weekly video and Internet message. ""To that I say that the challenges we face are too large to ignore. I didn't come here to pass on our problems to the next president or the next generation. I came here to solve them.""

112,"Address balance between local and state government\The State Journal editorial board should include the pressing need to restore the balance between state and local governments on its 2014 agenda. \For the past decade, local control has been seriously eroded by a series of preemptive new state laws - promulgated by Republicans and Democrats alike, depending on the bill. \While these bills have been promoted as creating less regulation and improved ""uniformity,"" they typically have gone too far, stripping local officials of having meaningful roles in issues that profoundly impact their communities. One size does not always fit all. \There is great diversity among Wisconsin communities. Local governments, not big government, are best to properly address the concerns of their citizens in the most efficient manner. \Why engage in Smart Growth planning if the state then takes away the ability of local governments to effectively implement such planning? \- Alan Harvey, Windsor \Retain focus on redistricting, lowering emissions \It is good to give some thought to what are the most important issues facing us each year. You are doing a great job on the redistricting issue - at some point legislators have to give it a fair hearing. \I also think the public still needs more information on climate impacts. With this cold winter, my dad said to me, ""Where is global warming when you want it?"" What we have is climate disruption. \I wish more people understood weaker jet streams, stalled storms and other climate impacts are associated with a warming planet. I am scared about the effects we will see on agriculture and health. \- Anne Waymouth, Madison \United States must take lead in cutting emissions \I was pleased to read that the Wisconsin State Journal editorial board listed the reduction of carbon emissions as an important goal for 2013. Achieving this goal will become increasingly urgent with every passing year, and you have shown yourselves to be ahead of the curve on this issue. \Few people realize that at our current rate of emission, Wisconsin's climate will look like present-day Arkansas within our children's lifetimes. \Some shrug and respond, ""If we don't keep spewing greenhouse gasses, countries like China will, so what's the point?"" The point is that putting our own house in order will put us in a far better position from which to pressure other countries to do likewise. \Historically, the United States has been the largest greenhouse gas emitter, so it is only fitting that we take the lead in turning the tide. \Through initiatives such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax, we can make more sustainable energy choices to assure our children a livable future. Thanks to the State Journal editorial board for addressing this issue, and I hope they will continue to do so in 2014. \- Carl Whiting, Madison \Pressure federal government to reduce emissions \Thank you for making lower carbon emissions a priority for your 2013 editorial board agenda. Addressing climate change should be a primary concern for next year as well. \We're starting to see the effects of climate change in Wisconsin, from record low levels in Lake Michigan to damage to our crops from extreme weather. Though emissions fell during the past year, we still have a long way to go to achieve the reductions we need to stabilize our climate. \The federal government must lead us as a nation in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. This won't happen unless a strong base of support, including institutions such as the State Journal, favors putting a true price on fossil fuels to foster growth of renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and thus lower emissions. \We can all promote lower carbon emissions by making choices to reduce fossil fuel use. We can also contact our legislators to ask them take action to lower carbon emissions. \- Laura Green, Madison \Support a revenue-neutral carbon tax in 2014 \Thank you for supporting carbon dioxide reduction in your editorial agenda. Global warming is a real danger, not only to the environment but to our economy, through rising sea levels, storms and agricultural losses. \Please also support a revenue-neutral carbon tax as the best way to achieve necessary reductions. Economists agree that raising the price of fossil fuels is the best way to lower emissions. \Other energy sources will become more competitive, and the market will pick the winners. This will also create more jobs than fossil fuels, and help us become energy independent. \If all the revenues go back to the people, equally per capita, two-thirds of them will come out even or ahead, with only the biggest consumers paying more. \Border price adjustments are also needed to ensure that imports from countries without a comparable carbon tax will not disadvantage U.S. producers. \China, for example, could choose between having its own carbon tax or having us tax what we import, according to the emissions caused by the production of the goods. This would encourage other countries to tax carbon emissions, which could make the difference for our children's future. \- Glen Ecklund, Madison \Stick with lower emissions, clean lakes, redistricting \This month, I retired after a 30-year career with a national trade association. I did so, in part, to spend more time focused on the issue of climate change. \This means taking on the challenge of limiting carbon build-up in the atmosphere, one of the issues in the State Journal's 2013 editorial agenda. \Along with clean lakes and fair political maps, I urge you to retain lower carbon emissions as a priority in 2014. \The other reason I retired is to spend more time with my granddaughters. Along with our good times, I hope my efforts at climate repair will help create a stable future for them and for children worldwide. \Thank you for championing issues that don't yield to quick solutions, but which are critical to our quality of life - or to life itself. \- Jeremiah Cahill, Madison \Lowering carbon emissions should be top priority \Lowering carbon emissions should continue to be at the top of all of our priority lists for 2014. The United States should be a stronger leader in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and responding to this increasing global threat than it has demonstrated so far. The world expects that of us. \Our government needs to provide financial incentives to individuals and families who rely less on fossil fuels, compared to typical Americans today. \This would show the rest of the world we can put less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and Earth's oceans, and also save money on infrastructure, provide low income people another source of income and lesson our overall environmental footprint. \Preferably, our government could do this without raising fuel taxes. \But our local municipalities and businesses would also need to chip in by creating more sustainable, self-contained neighborhoods. \Visit www.allthingsenvironmental.wordpress.com and see ""Conserve NOW"" for more information. \- Michael T. Neuman, Madison \Keep lower emissions goal to counter ALEC \Thank you for last Sunday's editorial, ""Progress and pitfalls for our 2013 agenda."" I hadn't realized lowering carbon emissions was on your agenda, but I strongly support that goal. \As you point out, the United States has taken some steps in the right direction, but Wisconsin continues to rely far too much on dirty coal. \Our children and grandchildren will pay a price for that, as will people in other states and nations. \I commend you for your call for ""other incentives for cleaner fuel and energy production."" I hope by next year you'll have greater progress to report on this vital issue. \A December article in The Guardian reveals the American Legislative Exchange Council plans to promote legislation penalizing ""free rider"" homeowners who install solar panels and weakening state clean energy regulations. I hope you'll be writing about that legislation's defeat in 2014. \- Dan Dieterich, Stevens Point \Keep focus on carbon emissions in 2014 \In response to last Sunday's ""Progress and pitfalls for 2013,"" thank you for the great job you did regarding the lower carbon emissions focus of 2013. \Unfortunately, climate change and carbon emissions are not topics that can be checked off as completed in one year's time. For that reason, carbon emissions and/or climate change should remain a focus for 2014. \At this stage, it is important to raise awareness in the public and to keep the discussion going. \There is a lot of information on the near-term impacts of climate change, specifically on Wisconsin. One, the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts report, could be used to inform state residents. \Keeping this a focus for 2014 would help build demand for action by our representatives in Washington to seriously begin addressing and mitigating climate change affects for our children and grandchildren. \- Tom Umhoefer, Stoughton"
113,"Every presidential candidate is talking tough about ending America's dependence on foreign oil.\But none of them is giving nuclear power - a proven, reliable and carbon-free energy source - the attention it deserves.\Democrat Hillary Clinton, in typical fashion, is both for and against nuclear power. She says she has ""no preconceived opposition"" to it yet expresses vague concern about safety.\Similarly, her rival Barack Obama won't rule out any energy option but insists he's ""not a nuclear proponent.""\On the Republican side, both John McCain and Mitt Romney support expanding nuclear power on paper but have so far failed to make it a campaign priority.\No matter their reasons for downplaying this vital issue, the candidates are making a big mistake. America must meet its energy needs while simultaneously inflicting the least amount of damage on the environment. To accomplish this, nuclear power is this country's best bet.\Every energy source has its downside. Coal and oil contribute to global warming and perpetuate America's dangerous obsession with the Middle East. Wind and solar technologies are far from being cost-effective. Ethanol requires large amounts of land and energy for production and has increased crop prices. Hydroelectricity can destroy fish and wildlife.\The problem with nuclear power is the radioactive waste that must be stored safely. But this is hardly the environmental boogeyman so often portrayed. Technology is making it easier to safely contain and recycle waste. And any environmental threat from nuclear waste is localized, rather than spread indiscriminately throughout the air or water like carbon-based pollutants.\Nuclear opponents regularly emphasize doomsday scenarios in which harmful radiation is released - either by accident or because of terrorism - killing thousands and irreparably damaging the environment. In reality, this is highly unlikely. Even the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union was the result of human error and lax oversight. Furthermore, the plant is a relic by today's standards.\Plant designs are getting safer all the time. Waste is stored in multi-layered steel casks capable of withstanding any plausible accident or attack. And new, post-9/11 security measures are meant to protect against proliferation and terrorism at nuclear plants.\In fact, a growing number of environmentalists, including former Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore, now advocate for more nuclear plants. They're enthusiastic because of nuclear's potential to stave off global warming and bring about American energy independence.\Currently, nuclear plants are more expensive to build than coal plants. However, a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system, coupled with the recent Supreme Court ruling that carbon dioxide must be regulated as a pollutant, will soon make fossil fuel production more expensive - and nuclear power more attractive.\Wisconsin has essentially banned the construction of new nuclear plants for nearly 30 years. Even so, Wisconsin receives about 20 percent of its electricity from three in-state nuclear plants. France, which gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, has some of the cleanest air in the industrialized world and some of the cheapest electricity costs. That should be a huge incentive to consider nuclear power as an alternative energy source in this state and throughout the country.\Unfortunately, our presidential candidates are content to stick with focus group-tested rhetoric and environmental buzzwords. Instead, they should be talking about the obvious benefits of nuclear power. What have they got to lose?\Nothing. Except, of course, our addiction to foreign oil."

Originally designed as a chapter for Stevens Point, the group began with about 10 members and since has grown to a regional group with about 50 members representing Portage, Marathon, Lincoln and Clark counties.\Dieterich said the organization has seen particular growth in Wisconsin over the past two years. He said the Central Wisconsin chapter was one of several that started in 2012, and today, Wisconsin has 11 chapters across the state.\""It was primarily Madison and Milwaukee up to (early 2012), but we've seen a lot of growth as more people learn about the group,"" said Dieterich, 68, of Hull, who is a retired English professor from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. ""At some point, we'd love to be able to have enough interest to have as many chapters locally as we can.""\Grossnickle, 63, of the Marathon County town of Knowlton, is professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin Marathon County; he said members are encouraged to contact members of Congress to ask for their support of climate-change legislation, CCL. The primary focus of CCL is support for a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under the idea, a fee would be assessed on fossil fuels with their origin -- a Pennsylvania coal mine, for example, or port of entry into the United States for Middle East oil. The fee would start at $15 per ton of carbon, would be raised $10 to $15 per ton annually by Congress, and would eventually mean renewable energy would be less expensive than fossil fuels.\Grossnickle said 100 percent of the revenues from the carbon tax would be returned to consumers, which will help protect them from price increases by fossil fuel industries.\""The plan is revenue-neutral, so we believe there's room for support from Republicans and Democrats,"" Grossnickle said. ""It helps level the playing field for renewable energy, and allows people to make choices that will benefit the environment.""\To learn more\The Central Wisconsin Chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby holds meetings the first Saturday of every month.

115,"Should the president's proposed $10 tax be added to each barrel of oil to fund high-speed rail and other transportation improvements'\""Generally I think it's a good idea, but a $10 tax on oil may not be the best way to cut the consumption of oil and fund transportation projects. If the president wants to affect climate change, I think some sort of carbon tax idea would get private enterprise looking at future ways to reduce carbon pollution and get a more efficient and effective infrastructure.""\Bruce Meredith, retired attorney, Madison\""I don't pay gas taxes because I don't own a vehicle, but ultimately I see it as a good idea. It would discourage demand for gasoline, which would prompt industry to invest in different methods of producing energy. Also, I see it is necessary to invest in high-speed rail to discourage investment in airlines, which are increasingly looking financially insolvent.""\Justin Cox, software technician, Madison\""I think for the future of our world we need to find alternative fuel choices. If that tax increase would deter people from buying bigger cars that use more gas and to look at other means of transportation, then I think it's a good idea.""\Carrie Astin, business owner, Madison\""I kind of like the idea of more people using trains and other mass transit. We're behind Europe in using trains, which are more fuel-efficient than cars. If the government can encourage people to take the trains I would favor it. I'm not too happy with increasing the price of gas, but you don't get something for nothing.""\Sandra Granroth, retired data processor, Fitchburg\""I'm not normally in favor of higher taxes but I think the price of oil needs to reflect the true cost of using it. People should realize and pay for the cost to the environment caused by oil when they pay for gas. Gas prices are way too low when considering the pollution created. Low gas prices mean people buy bigger, more polluting vehicles and that's not good in the long run. The government needs to encourage fuel efficiency for the good of everyone.""\Daniel Bjerre, software support/development, Middleton\Credit: BY KEVIN MURPHY , Special to The Capital Times"
116,"Debates needed tougher questions\The debates for governor of Wisconsin were virtually worthless. \""If elected, will you serve your full term?"" Really? Where were the tough questions? We pretty much know where Gov. Scott Walker stands on the important issues. But, what about Mary Burke? \They should have asked: \Given a negative budget of $3.6 billion from the Doyle administration, what would Burke have done to balance the budget? \Does Burke plan to repeal Act 10? \Will Burke bring Trek Bicycle and jobs back to Wisconsin? \Were parts of her copied jobs plan copied from the Doyle plan? \These are questions that should be answered. \President Barack Obama was asked the easy questions, too. When Election Day came, we only knew he was a community organizer and would be the first black president. \We need to know more about Burke other than being rich and that she would be our first woman governor. Answers, please. \- James Suchomel, Deforest \Walker has been good steward of state \Under Gov. Scott Walker, Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent as 8,400 private sector jobs were created last month. \When Mary Burke was Gov. Jim Doyle's secretary of Commerce, her predecessor, Cory Nettles, referred to Burke in an email as a ""disaster."" \Burke supports raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. But a study commissioned by the Wisconsin Restaurant Association found that ""increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would eliminate 16,500 jobs - over half of which are jobs held by women. The bulk of the job losses would be concentrated among individuals with a high school degree or less."" \Walker's good stewardship and good policies are paying off. We can't afford Burke's failed policies. \- Keith Bach, Janesville \Burke will bring people back together \""A house divided against itself cannot stand."" - Abraham Lincoln, June 16, 1858. \""The first step is, we're going to deal with collective bargaining for all public employee unions, because you use divide and conquer."" - Scott Walker, Jan. 18, 2011, a few weeks after he was sworn in as Wisconsin governor. \""It's going to be difficult work, but it means bringing people together."" - Mary Burke, October 17, 2014, at a gubernatorial debate in Milwaukee. \Abraham Lincoln and Mary Burke are right, and Gov. Scott Walker is wrong. \Bringing people together makes our country and state stronger. Wisconsin's ""house"" has been divided for four years. It needs to end with this election. That's why on Nov. 4, I will stand with Lincoln and Burke. \- John Finkler, Middleton \Cates has integrity in 51st District race \You may have received a flier from the American Federation for Children attacking Dick Cates, candidate for the 51st Assembly District. The sole agenda of this group is to expand school vouchers to all private schools in Wisconsin. \Dick Cates opposes this expansion because he believes in the public school system. Cates opponent, Todd Novak, has been heavily influenced by the AFC and will be obligated to vote for the expansion of vouchers. We think that is a poor way to conduct an election, with outside groups having heavy agendas, paying the bills. \As an experienced farmer and conservation award winner, Cates knows the strength of a rural economy is in the hard work of its citizen farmers. \We support Cates because he is a man of integrity. The issues Cates cares about - public education, a strong economy and a clean environment - are paramount. \Electing one person to the state Assembly won't solve all of our problems, but Cates' courage, forthrightness and common sense would bring civility and vision to our state. \- Chris and Chuck Wellington, Monroe \Carbon tax is solution to climate change \Thank you for the column ""Ask the Weather Guys: Is human activity to blame for climate change?"" \It's good the press is getting the science out on this critical issue. It's terrible some politicians, such as U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, have taken an anti-science attitude about it. What they need to be doing is working on solutions, such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax. \Studies suggest solving global warming is better for the economy than letting warming continue. One study, by Regional Economic Modeling, Inc., found that a slowly increasing carbon tax, rebated 100 percent to households, would create millions of jobs, increase personal wealth, and save hundreds of thousands of lives through decreased pollution. Carbon-dioxide emissions would be cut in half over 20 years - far better than most proposals. \Border adjustments, similar to tariffs, would make sure domestic producers can compete fairly with foreign producers that don't have carbon taxes. This would encourage other countries to have their own carbon tax, rather than watching us tax imports from them. \- Glen Ecklund, Madison \Honor veterans by voting this fall \We see a lot of messages trying to give our veterans the credit they deserve, and one of the best ways we can appreciate what they do is to vote. \They put their life on the line to give us the freedom to elect our government.

117,"Editor's note: The deadline for submitting letters to the editor about the Nov. 6 election has passed. These are the final letters that will be published prior to the election.\Election Day is coming soon and I can't help but think of all the good people who choose not to vote. I assume these good people would not give up on democracy. We love our country, our freedom, our economic system. Living in a democracy and not voting is like living in a capitalist society and not buying a thing. Hard to imagine, isn't it?\Even people who care deeply about our country and what threatens it seem to take a pass on Election Day. Only about 50 percent of people who care about our environment actually vote. Climate change and global warming are our country's greatest threats.\According to a 2018 paper by World Bank senior research economist Govinda R. Timilsina, ""Although carbon tax has been in practice for over the last 28 years in some countries ... it is gaining international attention more recently, particularly after the 2015 Paris Accord. Politicians who were reluctant to consider carbon tax due to potential resistance from the consumers or adverse implications to their voter base, started to take the challenge of discussing carbon tax and ultimately introducing it.""\Big business gets it. USA TODAY reported on Oct. 10, 2018 that General Motors plans to use wind power to build trucks and SUVs. More examples are available.\The biggest thing an individual can do to mitigate climate change is vote. Let's not elect those candidates who don't get it.\Barb Dorzweiler,\Appleton\I would like to express my support for Mike Rohrkaste, incumbent, in the 55th Assembly, running for re-election this year. He has accomplished some very important items that not only benefit Wisconsin but also veterans. My husband was in the Naval Reserves, so this is near and dear to my heart.\Mike was able to get AB 811 signed into law that allocated $6.8 million to Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. to develop talent attraction and retention initiatives to address the workforce shortage in the state. Part of the monies include $1.9 million for a campaign to attract veterans to Wisconsin who are transitioning to civilian life. Included in the campaign are ads in publications targeting veterans as well as social media posts. A new military occupation code search tool was also implemented on the state Department of Workforce Development's jobs website for veterans to help match veterans skills to job openings.\Mike and I worked together at Oshkosh Corp. for more than 10 years. Mike was the chief human resource officer and I was the vice president of corporate human resources. One of our main priorities was attraction and retention of talent while working in human resources. Mike was extremely creative in bringing talent to Oshkosh and developing the talent to ensure Oshkosh Corp. had a competitive advantage. I am confident that Mike will continue to do the same for veterans throughout Wisconsin. Mike has my vote again this November.\Tracey Rymer,\Neenah\A person's deeds, convictions and history are more important to me than their words. That's why I'm supporting Glenn Grothman for Congress.\He has a solid record of working for the people of Wisconsin. He reads and thinks independently. He'll disagree with his party or you and is ready to forthrightly defend and explain his position.\I respect honesty. Unlike many in office, he's available and works to stay connected with constituents. You'd think he has a double since he's all over the district. Glenn supports fully funding the wall. No surprise that thousands want to come into our country when our rich welfare benefits exceed middle class income in the majority of 196 countries around the world.\We're not safer with dangerous narcotics flowing across our borders. Voting is a right for US citizens. Working to curb opioid abuse, he introduced legislation to restrict the number of prescription pills for the first seven days before larger refills are possible.\Most important, he won't vote for an ACA replacement bill that doesn't cover pre-existing conditions. He voted for HR1628 ""Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions."" Glenn supports no changes to Medicare or Social Security age requirements.\Vote for Glenn, a man of and for the people.\Ruth Streck,\Neenah\Tony Evers knows how to govern. His life experiences and his time as Wisconsin's superintendent of public instruction are proof. He is an intelligent, long-term thinker, not a short-term strategist. He cares about the future of Wisconsin, not about being a career politician.\As governor, Scott Walker cut the Child Income Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Homestead Tax Credit. Now, in an election year, he wants to buy your vote by restoring some of these cuts and promising more tax credits. Can you say ""pandering?""\At the same time, Walker continues to increase spending for certain pet projects, aka corporate welfare. All while our schools are underfunded and our roads are deteriorating. Giving out election year tax credits is not going to solve these problems.\The point is, Walker cannot govern. Tax credits and rebates are not an effective governing strategy. The $100 child tax rebate won't even put a dent in what Walker's inability to govern has cost you in car repairs. Walker is only thinking about the next election, not the future of Wisconsin.\Tony Evers joins with the majority of Wisconsin citizens who care about public schools and about fixing the transportation problem. That is why we need Tony Evers as the next governor of Wisconsin.\Vote Tony Evers for governor and Mandela Barnes for lt. governor.\Mary Shimek,\Menasha\In the early 1970s, my parents operated a 200-acre dairy farm. They believed in financial responsibility, balanced budgeting, and borrowing within reason for improvements such as a tractor purchase. My parents believed that when I became an adult, I should not be obligated to take over the farm due to huge loans, respecting my right to determine my financial future.\When I see Roger Roth in an advertisement with his children I cringe. He is not allowing his or the other children in this state to make their own future financial decisions. Instead, he is building up debt and obligations for future generations to pay in the disguise of lower taxes.\I use the 441/10/41 interchange. Because I use it, I am willing to pay increased gasoline taxes at the pump to pay for it. Instead, Roger Roth and Scott Walker borrowed $500 million to complete the project, saddling our children and grandchildren to pay off this loan, plus interest, in their future.\Roth's children, and your children and grandchildren, will be paying Foxconn, a foreign corporation, $4.5 billion dollars over 25 years with no guarantees of future jobs or even a future. This Vegas style investing of taxpayer dollars is not a worthy gamble, and not worthy of taking money from the wallets of future generations.\Roth even took $250 million from the UW System to build a Bucks arena.\Our children deserve better than Roger Roth economics. We owe it to future generations to vote for Lee Snodgrass.\Garth Zimmermann,\Menasha\On April 3, 61 percent of Wisconsinites voted resoundingly to oppose a constitutional referendum to eliminate the office of state treasurer, thus maintaining that office in Wisconsin state government.\Sarah Godlweski was a spark plug in the bipartisan effort that successfully fought that ill-conceived and dangerous constitutional referendum. Sarah is the only state treasurer candidate that supported that effort.\With her financial background and experience, Sarah is committed to restoring the duties and responsibilities of the state treasurer's office that have been transferred to the executive branch of state government. Particularly, she is committed to being our state's financial watchdog.\I believe Sarah Godlewski is the right candidate to work with the state legislature and governor to return the watchdog responsibilities and financial duties of the state treasurer as intended by the framers of our state constitution.\Join me in voting for the qualified candidate for state treasurer on Nov. 6: Sarah Godlewski. This particular election is not a matter of partisanship or political party; it's about voting for the best candidate qualified to serve Wisconsin's financial interests. I should know, I served in that office once myself.\Jack Voight,\Appleton\From stories of Greek mythology to the ""Star Wars"" films to re-runs of the ""Rockford Files."" I grew up idolizing heroes. One of my favorites is Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan in ""A Clear and Present Danger"" (based on the novel by Tom Clancy).\In the film Jack Ryan isn't trying to save the world. Nor is he out for revenge or saving some damsel in distress. No, he is out to protect something intangible and simple, yet profoundly important — the truth. When the president and members of his NSA conduct an illegal war, Ryan finds out and risks his career, reputation and life to bring the truth to light. I remember thinking as a teenager, ""Who would do that sort of thing? What type of person would risk so much for something so simple?""\So when the most powerful man in the country tells more than 2,000 lies in two years; attacks the free press virtually daily calling legitimate journalism ""fake news;"" instructs people at a rally that what they are ""seeing"" and ""reading"" is ""not what's happening"" while inciting violence at those same rallies; that is when the president becomes a clear and present danger to the truth itself. And when his GOP allows him to continually violate the truth, that is when American citizens must stand up and protect it ourselves.\How can we defend the truth? Support journalists. And vote blue. Truth needs a protector. You can play that role.\Tim Feldmann,\Appleton\In 1861 the Southern Confederate States declared themselves independent. They mistakenly expected that England, the major military might of the age, would support their cause. Why? Because the English textile industry depended upon their cotton.\Southern cotton provided more then half of the industry's raw material. But they, the plantation owners, underestimated the English's moral conviction. They, the English, had declared their opposition to slavery some years before.\They considered slavery to be immoral, inhuman and destructive to social justice. So when confronted with the choice between supporting the Confederacy and destroying their textile industry, they chose to take the economic hit, and refused to support the South.\Had they made that decision with their pocket book, the South would almost certainly won the Civil War. Our country, and the world, would certainly be a different place than what we know.\Today, our country is faced with that same question. Do we condemn the Saudis for the brutal murder of an American resident, and risk a loss of billions of dollars worth of sales, or do we take the high ground and prove ourselves to be the English equal? The world, many of whom know history better than our own president and are more moral, are watching.\Jerry Hennes,\Kaukauna\I'm fed up with having to vote for the lesser of two evils every time we have an election. We have one major political party that seems interested in expanding the government into every nook and cranny of our lives. And when the other major political party comes into power, it shows no interest in rolling back the intrusive government programs imposed by the first party.\In short, the Democrats inaugurate and the Republicans consolidate. As one politician once candidly put it, ""There's not a dime's worth of difference between the Republicans and the Democrats.""\Fortunately, there is a political party out there that defends the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Appropriately, it's called the Constitution Party.\The Constitution Party of Wisconsin is running candidates for state attorney general (Terry Larson) and state treasurer (Andrew Zuelke). You can learn more about them at the CPoW website, constitutionpartyofwisconsin.com.\Some say that a vote for a third-party candidate is a wasted vote. Wrong. Competition is good, and there is no other way to end the present political monopoly of our two-party system. Don't hesitate to vote according to your convictions. If you don't vote for what you truly believe in, then you'll never get what you really want.\Brian Farmer,\Appleton\Tony Evers is a true public servant. As a family man and lifelong educator, he has always put the needs of others first. He is a thoughtful, intelligent and ethical leader. Tony Evers is not in this race to set himself up for a presidential run. He is in this race to serve the people of Wisconsin, to ensure that our state and our children have bright futures.\Scott Walker's negative attack ads are filling the airwaves. Instead of running on his record, Walker has resorted to distortion and spin. As the king of special interest money, he ironically attempts to label his opponent bought by special interests. Our democracy depends on leaders who act with integrity. This is not it.\So, what is Walker's record? Public schools are hurting. Roads are deteriorating. Corporate special interests are prioritized over the health of Wisconsin's environment and our citizens. Democracy is under attack. Extreme gerrymandering. Coordination between candidates and dark money groups has been legalized in Wisconsin, the only state in the country, earning our state coverage in the PBS special Dark Money. That is Scott Walker's legacy.\Wisconsin deserves a governor who believes in government ""of, by and for the people."" Tony Evers supports non-partisan redistricting and automatic voter registration. Both would make government more responsive to the people. Isn't that how it should be? Enough with ""divide and conquer.""\Vote for Tony Evers for governor and Mandela Barnes for lieutenant governor.\Carol Lenz,\Appleton\This November I hope and pray that the millions of women that Donald Trump insulted during the 2016 campaign get out and vote.\I'd like to see a blue wave sweep across the country. Then we can cut this bigoted, racist, arrogant, narcissistic, autocratic, five-deferment draft dodger off at the knees.\Get out and vote, ladies. Grab 'em by the ""midterms.""\Ron Nachtwey,\Black Creek\With Japan recently conducting war games in the South China Sea, China exponentially increasing its naval expenditures, and American hegemony, particularly naval supremacy, waning, Wisconsin needs a senator who ascertains the consequences of these threats to American primacy.\Fox six years, Tammy Baldwin opposed funding increases for military personnel, while simultaneously voting to expand the undeclared and unconstitutional wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\Leah Vukmir, on the contrary, is committed to bringing American service members home from conflict; ensuring that America has a naval capable to defending all four oceans; and restoring dominance in the South China Sea.\The South China Sea is a major hub for commerce, relied upon by innumerable nations, particularly the United States, for import and export of commercial goods. As Japan, Britain, and France have conducted war games and/or sent ships into the region to curtail Chinese influence, America has dramatically reduced its naval operations in the South China Sea.\Now, more than ever, it is imperative that Americans reject liberal internationalism — and embrace Taftian non-interventionism, a doctrine espoused by Leah Vukmir. For these reasons, American needs Leah Vukmir in the senate. Leah is a proven conservative who will defend our military and champion the Constitution.\Christopher Schaefer,\Kimberly\As a baby boomer nearing my 68th birthday, I'm reminded of a time in America when honesty, integrity and the strength of one's character actually meant something.\Be it at home, on the job, at school, your elected officials at every level of government, those qualities were not only expected but demanded by ""we"" the people.\As you vote Nov. 6, keep those qualities in mind.\Rather than vote political party, cast a vote for honesty, integrity and the strength of one's character. God bless the United States of America.\Patrick J. Nagan,\Appleton\State Senator Roth learned from Appleton Mayor Hanna and Grand Chute Town Chair Schowalter to promote a Dark Stores bill. He killed his own bill and refused to allow another Dark Stores bill for a floor vote since the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce lobby opposes it. It is now shelved in a ""study committee.""\He told people here he would promote our Regional Transit Authority. It is needed to provide public transportation between Fox Valley cities so people without cars or licenses can get to work. He refused to support it in Madison.\He arranged to spend tax money to defend the Republicans' gerrymandered unfair district lines.\He approved the Republican plan to support FoxConn with $3 billion.\He voted the Republican Party line 98 percent of the time in the last two years.\He has money to buy TV ads because the Wisconsin Realtors Association gave his campaign $208,000. He supported a bill to allow builders the ability to drain wetlands, which the Realtors Association promoted.\You haven't yet seen TV ads for State Senate candidate Lee Snodgrass because she doesn't have a large corporate donation. Thus she also doesn't owe influence to a large corporation or lobby association. She will be free to represent us in Madison, not the big money interests.\Lee Snodgrass is the only candidate for State Senate in District 19 who will be an independent voice in Madison.\Paul Nulton,\Grand Chute\As a native of Wisconsin, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and a veteran who entered service from Milwaukee many years ago, I have often heard from outsiders that Wisconsin had a great reputation for being an innovative state with open and honest government, a great educational system and a leader in conservation and in protecting the environment. That is why I am voting for a new governor and legislative candidates who offer more than the current, hackneyed incumbents who have turned Wisconsin backwards.\In the last eight years, Wisconsin's educational system has suffered, the prestige of a great university has been diminished, we now spend more money on prisons than on education, our highway infrastructure is in terrible disrepair, our reputation as a leader in conservation has sadly been tarnished, our enviable political system has given way to secrecy and corruption, a network of social services that once helped the needy now seeks to stigmatize and punish them, and we bribe wealthy corporations, with public money, to stay here.\In eight years in office, Scott Walker has attempted to advance the idea that jobs in the private sector will make Wisconsin better, yet Walker himself has collected paychecks only from government offices for 26 consecutive years.\Four years ago, his re-election served as an immediate springboard for an embarrassing and futile attempt to run for president. It's time for new leadership and time for leaders who will push Wisconsin, not their own political careers, forward.\Gary McGoey,\Appleton\I would like to encourage voters to consider Andrew Zuelke for state treasurer.\It's not as easy to obtain information on the candidates in the lower profile races. Zuelke has executive experience, as state chairman of the Constitution Party. He campaigned for this office back in 2014 on a platform of saving it and strengthening it. He said then, that stripping this office of its duties, then claiming it's a ""do nothing"" office was wrong.\If legislators could have ended treasurer, they wouldn't have stopped there. They want to consolidate powers in the hands of un-elected bureaucrats. Zuelke is against crony capitalism and corporate welfare.\Public monies, our hard-earned tax dollars, should be for public uses only. Private businesses should fund their own developments themselves.\If you want a true constitutional alternative, instead of having the same two parties with all the special interest groups both are beholden to, now is your chance.\For more details, visit wisconsintreasurerdefender.wordpress.com.\Remember: Vote for Andrew Zuelke for state treasurer.\Mark Gabriel,\Appleton\The Grand Old Party is dead and gone. You can't deny seeing the ugliness of Republican party politics. I'm angry and hurt they resort to lies and personal attacks funded by super-PACs and then try to suppress votes to win elections after gerrymandering their way into office. Their campaign practices and unwillingness to debate the issues prove they aren't even honorable opponents.\I mourned the last honorable Republican, John McCain, in anticipatory grief of my father's death only days later at the age of 86. He had been a lifelong Republican Party member who quit when the party nominated Trump. He died in great fear for the downfall of our nation because of the recklessness of the GOP.\With Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court, the ruling party now controls all three branches of the government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Republican Party and their dark money donors are hell-bent on removing the last remaining checks and balances for our democracy: a free press and an informed and educated citizenry who vote.\I'm casting my ballot for Democrats down the entire ticket this Nov. 6 and I encourage you to do so, too.\Jill Dianne Swenson,\Appleton"
118,"Lawmaker's 'ag-gag' bill is dangerous\After reading Sunday's article ""Legislator plans 'ag-gag' bill,"" I must speak up and let the public know what a dangerous piece of legislation this is. \As a member of The Humane Society of the United States' Wisconsin Agriculture Council, I am committed to better animal welfare and care of the environment. We all need to make food choices with a conscience. We must be able to check that the animal products we consume arrive on our plates through a process that treats the animals with proper care and is environmentally sensitive. \The bill being considered will block us from knowing what is happening in the industrial agricultural facilities where the majority of the meats, dairy and eggs are processed. The factory meat and dairy industry would like everyone to think its animals are happily grazing in open fields. This is far from the truth, and the owners of those massive facilities do not want the public to see what is really happening. \This bill wants to protect the animal abusers, criminalize the people who speak for them, and keep you in the dark. Don't let this happen. Call your legislators now and ask them to oppose this bill. \- Rhonda Carrell, Wisconsin Rapids \Carbon tax would be game changer \Game-changing legislation is now being studied by Congress to address the crucial problem of climate change. \A revenue-neutral carbon tax would shift some of the overall tax burden on Americans to carbon polluters (such as the coal and oil industries) providing a strong, market-based incentive to lower carbon pollution in the United States. \Without raising the overall tax burden on Americans by a single dollar, Congress could implement a simple tax that would allow the free market (not politicians) to select cost-effective carbon reducing initiatives throughout the country. Benefits from a carbon tax could include energy efficiency, displacing coal with renewable energy and natural gas, as well as generally displacing gasoline-guzzling cars with hybrid vehicles and ultimately with all-electric vehicles. \As long as the tax incentive is significant, these market-based carbon reducing projects would create millions of jobs and take the first real step by the U.S. government to avoid the environmental disasters predicted by scientists if climate change remains unchecked. This simple, revenue-neutral carbon tax would revolutionize the way energy is used in the United States and ultimately throughout the world. \- Conrad Anderson, Mount Horeb \Walker turns UW into trade school \Because of the governor's recent actions, UW will cease to be one of the great research universities and change its mission. \Opening soon: The Trade Schools of Wisconsin, featuring classes for all occupations, as long as they don't involve research, abstract thinking or any study that isn't immediately ""practical."" Because of budget cuts, the various schools are up for sale to the highest bidders. \- Nancy Rathke, Madison \Trade deal is bad for middle class \The Trans-Pacific Partnership is the worst trade deal you've ever heard of. It's referred to as ""NAFTA on steroids."" This is a bad deal for every American. \This trade deal will continue to send jobs outside U.S. borders. It will undermine wages by forcing Americans to compete with workers in countries where the average wage is much lower. \It endangers our health by allowing unregulated food production. It allows secret trade tribunals to challenge and override U.S. laws, including labor and environmental protections. It could erode important safeguards designed to prevent future financial crises and will devastate the middle class, plain and simple. \This deal cannot be allowed to go forward as is. Congress needs to understand Americans want to be put back to work. Jobs need to stay here in our country. It's time to bring back the middle class and make the words ""Made In America"" mean something again. It's going to take a huge effort by everyone to stop this trade deal in its present form. \- Lynn Ketchum, Madison \Walker's quest for power hurts heritage \As a military retiree, I was brought up on the idea that it is not the system that corrupts, but it is the people in the system that corrupt. Gov. Scott Walker's budget again proves the point. \His dream for absolute power at the expense of everything that is special to the people of Wisconsin is not surprising. \What is surprising is that those who voted for him didn't see this coming, and they are still defending him. \Let's hope the Legislature takes back the reigns and gets Wisconsin on track to preserve our heritage and all that it stands for. \- Joan Arnold, Madison"
119,"Revenue-neutral carbon tax can't wait\Thanks for running professor Michael E. Kraft's guest column in Sunday's newspaper, ""UN report should end climate debate."" I agree we should do more to mitigate the negative effects of climate change.\I also agree the best way to do so would be with a carbon tax that returned all revenue to American households. It would ease the transition to clean energy, promote efficiency, create millions of jobs and increase gross domestic product.\Some worry a carbon tax would put America at a competitive disadvantage with other countries such as China and India. But if we had border adjustments, it would induce them to enact their own carbon taxes so they could keep the money instead of giving it to us.\Really, we can't afford to wait. The longer we do, the more expensive the transition will be. Fortunately, a revenue-neutral carbon tax would be a win-win for the economy and for the environment.\- Steve Lewis, Fitchburg\Obama scandals led to GOP victory\The voters inside and outside of Wisconsin have spoken -- and not because the Republicans outspent the Democrats. In many of the states where the Democrats were at risk of losing, according to their polling, they poured more money than the Republicans into the media sink-holes to prevent the inevitable from happening.\This mid-term election was a referendum on the job President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democrats have done.\Despite avoiding having Obama campaign for them, some decent officials lost their jobs because of him. It was very difficult to run away from his scandals and controversies, such as in the Internal Revenue Service, Veterans Affairs medical care and the Benghazi lies, as confirmed by his former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in his recently published book.\- John Anderson, Merrimac\Thank Obama for lower gas prices\On May 19, 2009, President Barack Obama created new CAFE standards for increasing fuel efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lowering the price of gas.\These new fuel efficiency laws started taking effect in 2012 and increase every year since then, showing a improvement in gas prices.\Gas in Wisconsin is below $3 a gallon for the first time in years, and it looks like it will continue to drop.\I have to give credit were credit is due.\So thanks to the Obama administration for being strict on the auto markets and getting this done in a timely fashion.\Without it we would have had to wait until 2020 for any change.\- Robby E. Ree, Stoughton\Drug tests would be a distraction\I can't say I'm surprised that our Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, have decided to place drug testing of those receiving public benefits at the top of their legislative agenda.\Rather than focusing on economic policies that would help move people off benefits, they want to humiliate the needy by implying they are drug-using freeloaders.\I am not suggesting there is no one receiving benefits who has a drug problem.\But I view this legislative priority as part of Walker's broader ""divide and conquer"" strategy that encourages others to think of people in need as morally unworthy.\Moreover, according to the State Journal's news report, this legislative priority will likely involve ongoing litigation with the federal government over the constitutionality of drug testing as a condition of receiving benefits.\I guess this is the type of distraction we can expect, thanks to Gov. Walker's potential presidential campaign.\- Ron Berger, McFarland\Republicans operate on 'truthiness'\More than anything else, last week's election proved the power of ""truthiness"" over reality. Stephen Colbert created the word ""truthiness"" and defined it as: the acceptance as fact information that one wants to believe, rather than concepts or facts that are known to be true.\The Republican Party is wrong about nearly all the major issues, but it has managed to convince voters otherwise. The GOP's economic policies crashed the world's economy, and the austerity they prescribed to aid in the recovery has been a failure in Europe. They refuse to acknowledge pollution is causing global climate change in spite of mountains of evidence. Whether it be poverty, illness or rape, the Republicans are more likely to blame the victim than the actual cause. They still insist the Affordable Care Act will cause higher health care costs and reduce the number people getting health care.\Instead of offering advice to the president on how he should now work with politicians who operate on ""truthiness,"" perhaps the news media should focus on their role in perpetuating this dysfunctional system.\- John Hallinan, Stoughton\Democrats defeated, not progressives\While Democrats got beaten in the midterms as expected, the progressive voters did not.\Five states raised their minimum wage by referendum, and some others even passed legalization of marijuana. Several of the new elected officials are young, female, black, Latino or gay. The people have spoken, and the country is clearly moving to the left.\Though Wisconsin still lags on social and economic issues, it will catch up with the rest of the nation because the Republican Party is becoming obsolete.\I view the recent elections as a success. I don't care what color chairs lawmakers sit in as long as this country continues to move forward.\- Darrell Moyer, Cambridge"
120,"Welcome back, students! Move-in days at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point started Thursday, and the familiar circus of students and their parents toting furniture, milk crates and electronics up to the residence halls was in full effect here.\It will make for some temporary traffic snarls around the university, but we always enjoy the energy that comes from the infusion each fall of hundreds of new students. So, welcome to all who've moved in already or who will be returning this weekend. We're glad you're here.\Group fights climate change on local level\Climate change is a big, difficult issue, in part because the way we're used to thinking about it is as if there is always necessarily a tension between economic growth and doing something to address the issue.\There is something to that understanding, but it is not always such a simple, zero-sum choice -- grow the economy or address climate change.\The Central Wisconsin Chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby, a newly formed group of activists in Stevens Point, argues that we can clean up our air and grow our economy at the same time by shifting incentives toward clean energy. And the group, headed by Ned Grossnickle and Dan Dieterich, argues that a carbon tax would help to move the U.S. economy toward renewable energy that would be less expensive and less polluting than fossil fuels -- but that would still employ lots of people.\Whether or not you agree with the idea of a carbon tax, the Citizens Climate Lobby is doing something important: They're getting people involved. Members of the group, which spoke recently with the Stevens Point Journal Media Editorial Board, have traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby their elected leaders with carefully calibrated, politically astute messages intended to nudge even those members of Congress who might not be inclined in their direction to soften their stances on whether we ought to be concerned about climate change.\The group's goal, Dieterich and Grossnickle said, is to build political capital for making policy changes that would benefit the environment. We're glad to see citizens getting involved. For more information, call Dieterich at 715-344-1063 or visit www.citizensclimatelobby.org.\Parlez-vous English,\Rep. Jacque?\We are not the first to observe that the guy who is proposing that Wisconsin make English its official language has a suspiciously foreign-sounding name. State Rep. Andre Jacque, R-De Pere, announced plans this week to reintroduce the English-only bill, which would require all state and local government documents to be written in English.\We're well aware that English is the de facto official language of Wisconsin, and in fact we strongly agree that new immigrants should attempt to learn the language. It's important when that's what the great majority of people here speak.\But not so long ago, Wisconsin was populated by German and Scandavian farmers, French fur traders in from the U.P. -- and the languages spoken here reflected that. One hundred years ago, ""English only"" would have been seen as an anti-German initiative. These days we'd observe that even those irascible, self-segregated German immigrants seem to have managed to assimilate.\There's no reason to think today's immigrants will be any different. An ""English only"" bill would only serve to needlessly exclude."
121,"Failure to set energy goals already costly\Thank you for last Sunday's State Journal editorial, ""State needs ambitious clean energy goal."" \Do we need such a goal? Do birds fly? Detractors whine about the unbearable cost of achieving a sustainable energy economy, but they clearly have not factored in the already unbearable economic, social and environmental cost of the status quo. \We must consider more than our utility bills. We must consider nature's rapidly increasing bills for water, food, storms, fires, droughts, floods, dying and rising oceans, epidemics, likely species extinction and impoverished quality of human life. \Yes, we need an ambitious clean energy goal. \? Carol Steinhart, Madison\Climate models can't predict present, much less future \Last Sunday's State Journal editorial citing the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was selective. \The IPCC report showed little significant warming in the last dozen years or so, and that most of the computer climate models are running way too hot. \These models can't predict the present, much less the future. To quote Bjorn Lomborg, former director of the Environmental Assessment Institute in Copenhagen, in the latest issue of Project Syndicate, ""We ought never to have entertained the notion that the world's greatest challenge could be to reduce temperature rises in our generation by a fraction of a degree."" \The Legislature need do nothing. \In stark contrast, David Archibald, in his new book, ""Twilight of Abundance,"" foresees a worse fate because our food and energy supplies could collapse. A review of his book would serve your readers well. \? Dexter B. Northrop, Fitchburg\Engage students in producing energy for schools \Wisconsin must be proactive about green energy. It's a way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and a wise investment in our future. Wisconsin's goal should be to include our schools and students. \My school has used green energy to help students learn the skills the world requires. They have researched and completed multiple solar projects. Using solar energy means a long-term reduction in cost to operate our school. Once the panels are paid for, the energy keeps coming. It is proactive and creates a powerful learning experience for students. \The Wisconsin Legislature should help schools meet ambitious goals for producing their own power. Students can lead projects, find ways for their schools to do the work and reduce their costs. Students are an untapped resource ? their drive makes amazing things happen. \Our Legislature should help fund schools so all districts can generate 10 percent of their power. While green energy is great, students leading and creating it is too positive an outcome not to invest in. \? Scott Anderson, math and physics instructor, Juda Public School\All nations must practice stewardship of Earth \The problem of global climate change is the most pressing issue today. Other matters are irrelevant if the world's climate renders the planet uninhabitable. \My religious tradition understands God gave us custody over this planet, and this comes with responsibilities. As humans, we should take stewardship very seriously. \Last Sunday's State Journal editorial identified ""lack of political will"" as a stumbling block. Bravo! Another would be denial of climate science. Most researchers have concluded climate change is caused by humans and will have seriously negative consequences. \A third stumbling block consists of our apparent unwillingness to concern ourselves with the loss of human life due to weather and climate anomalies. Why do some not accept these as realities over which to be concerned? \Wisconsin, our nation, and every country ? industrialized or not ? must act to bring more renewables online. Only then will we plant good seeds to be harvested successfully by the next generation. \? Rabbi Jonathan Biatch, Madison\Proving our efforts will help is a hard sell \Global warming should worry those who live near the oceans as well as the rest of us due to the potential economic issues it would influence. Then there are the humanitarian catastrophes that could happen worldwide. Wouldn't it be wonderful to be able to stop it? \The problem is we do not know what, if any, adjustments we could make to have any measurable impact on the outcome. To expect us to work hard and increase our expenses to cut down on emissions is a hard sell. \The United States has lost countless jobs to countries that produce goods cheaper than we can. To make that production cost gap even larger will cost us all, especially the poor. \To change our ways, we must have facts to convince us this issue is paramount, not just ""scientists say."" The climate is so complex that it's hard to believe anyone can predict what is going to happen. \Doing something we hope will make a difference should be a hard sell. \? Farrel Smith, McFarland\Scientists disagree on seriousness of issue \President Barack Obama relies on what so-called experts have told him. He declares climate change and global warming to be a fact: ""The debate is settled."" \But a true scientist knows issues are often revised as new information is revealed. In regard to global warming, they don't have consistent records over past centuries. They rely on computer models. \Journalist Cal Thomas recently wrote in a column titled ""Chicken Little ?Science'"" that some scientists have withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change because they believe some panel members only offer opinions that agree with the consensus and may earn them federal or foundation handouts. \German meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls says the rise in sea level has ""slowed down significantly."" There has been neither a dramatic rise, nor an acceleration. \And Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post stated if climate science is settled, as claimed by Obama, why do predictions keep changing? \? Walt Hannan, Livingston\Once a leader, Wisconsin now lags in clean energy \Wisconsin spends more than $12 billion annually to import fossil fuels. Our money is supporting economic opportunity elsewhere when it could be creating jobs for Wisconsin families. \Clean energy is a clear solution for public health, the environment and the economy. Last Sunday's editorial was right to call for legislative action and a more ambitious plan. \A decade ago a bipartisan effort made Wisconsin a renewable energy leader. Our utilities quickly got on pace to meet the current Renewable Portfolio Standards goal of 10 percent renewable energy by 2015. \Since then, other states have adopted more aggressive standards. Wisconsin today ranks last among the 29 states with renewable portfolio standards. \It's time to turn this around. We already have the studies showing states with higher clean energy standards have lower electricity rates. What we need most is the visionary leadership to create a roadmap for aggressive clean energy development that will move Wisconsin forward. \? Keith Reopelle, senior policy director, Clean Wisconsin\Energy conservation still cheaper than green energy \I appreciate last Sunday's editorial on clean energy, but your editorial board is thinking with its heart and not its head. \Instead of creating more energy, we should be focusing on using less. \I work with energy-efficient lighting, and for every dollar spent on saving a kilowatt, $10 would have to be spent on creating one with green energy. \The conservation of energy is already underway. It continues to evolve at a much lower cost than the creation of green energy. \Gov. Scott Walker is thinking with his head: Save the energy, it is more costeffective. I know everybody wants green energy, but right now that is thinking with your heart. \Have patience, we will get there. In the meantime, buy an LED light bulb. \? Rodney Heller, Cottage Grove, Energy Performance Lighting\End our dependence on foreign energy \The people of Wisconsin should make comprehensive clean energy goals their top priority through renewable energy resources, such as biomass, geothermal, hydro, solar and wind power. Scientific evidence supporting the reality of global warming is sufficient. \Some things blocking progress include the inability of some people to see beyond their political beliefs. Some falsely assume near-record snow and cold in the Midwest is the only yardstick they need to judge what's happening around the world. \The worst are those who continue to profit from the use of fossil fuels. Through their greed and lack of concern for others, they may promote misinformation that detracts from progress toward renewable energy. \At least consider the legacy we could leave for future generations: clean air and water, a more stable environment, and thwarting the ability of one nation to bully others by withholding or charging outrageous prices for fuel. \Most importantly, we could stop sending American soldiers to die due to our dependence on foreign energy. \? David J. Bue, Beloit\Make conservation a bipartisan issue again \Jonah Goldberg's Wednesday column, ""Obama's Keystone pipeline trap,"" shows a lack of scientific understanding about climate change and ocean acidification. \He fails to understand these two issues are both symptoms of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. \As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports document, the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide have caused increasing levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in our oceans, which acidifies the water. \But I agree with Goldberg that ""conservation used to be a fairly bipartisan affair,"" and I'm hopeful it can be again. \Reducing carbon emissions on a national and global scale will require bold policy action and should be bipartisan. A revenue-neutral carbon tax and dividend is a market-based policy solution that appeals to both liberals and conservatives. \This policy would tax emissions and return the revenue to taxpayers on a percapita basis, giving every individual and company an incentive to reduce emissions. \? Kevin Coleman, Madison\Wisconsin could save by producing own energy \As part of an organization that's advocated for renewable energy since 1991, we couldn't agree more with last Sunday's editorial. \Renewable energy technologies have advanced markedly since 1991. The top 11 wind energy-producing states have seen their electricity prices decrease over the last five years, while Wisconsin's increased by over 10 percent. \That's right ? investment in wind energy saves money. \The cost of solar electricity has dropped by half in the past five years, and 99 percent over the past 40 years. Wisconsin has tremendous biomass resources that should be harnessed to increase the value of our dairy, forest and food industries while protecting our water and air. \We send around $12 billion a year out of state for energy when we could generate a lot more of our own. Better energy policies will create jobs, bring investment to Wisconsin, and help us catch up with Iowa and Minnesota, which get 25 percent and 15 percent of their electricity, respectively, from renewable energy. Yet they pay less than we do. \? Tyler Huebner, executive director, RENEW Wisconsin\Not too late to try a revenue-neutral carbon tax \We should accept the best evidence, the best analysis, the best thinking by the best experts in the field summarized in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. \To recap, human-caused climate change, anthropogenic global warming, people-produced climate disruption ? whatever you want to call it ? is really happening, is serious, and we can still do something about it. \Fortunately it's not too late to act, according to the experts behind the just released IPCC ""Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change."" \We should not waste time denying this reality or ignoring the opportunity the United States has to take the lead. We should adopt a revenue neutral carbon tax, a widely praised policy intervention, to help shift the global economy from greenhouse gas producing fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. \? Kermit Hovey, Middleton\Clean energy industry essential to state economy \Wisconsin does not produce one barrel of oil, one ton of coal or one cubic foot of natural gas. Clean energy policy is crucial to our economy. \Production of wind, solar, biomass and as yet undiscovered energy sources will provide a great number and variety of jobs in installation, manufacturing and research. \Wisconsin voters need to elect a governor and Legislature that will support the longterm growth of our clean energy industry. \This should include a law allowing clean energy companies to install solar panels on customers' properties at low cost, with customers paying for them through their electric bills. Tax credits should be made permanent for energy conservation and clean energy system installation. \The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. and the Wisconsin Venture Capital Fund should support the clean energy industry. \Farmers have been harvesting solar energy in the form of corn, soybeans, wheat, cranberries and carrots for years. Let's harvest even more in the form of electricity in the future. \? Bill Dagnon, Baraboo\Politics may trump climate and energy issues \Last Sunday's editorial was both heartening and sad. \Recognizing our climate change crisis, pushing for renewable energy and setting goals are critical first steps. \With the current makeup of state government, it's impossible to believe any real legislation will come forward. The party in control doesn't seem to believe in climate change and will be reluctant to vote against the financial interests of their biggest contributors. \Wisconsin could do more with the right people in place, but much of our energy policy needs to be driven at the federal level. Both U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, sound like climate change deniers, so we'll see no leadership from them. \I hope this is an issue in the upcoming elections, but I have no doubt the deniers will fill the airways with propaganda to confuse the public. I hope the State Journal includes the public positions of the candidates on this issue in endorsement consideration. \? Dave Topp, Middleton\Need political, spiritual and social will to sustain world \We have the scientific knowledge, the economic power and the natural resources. All we need is the will to set and achieve a clean energy goal for Wisconsin. \You can stimulate political will by engaging our leaders in dialogue about what is important to us. \Spiritual will can help set energy goals. Powerful sermons, prayerful demonstrations and meditation can channel God's creative power. Pray to sustain this beautiful world. \Actively support social will by volunteering to help save fish, polar bears, birds, trees ? whatever is your passion. Use social media ? it works for people, it can work for Wisconsin. \If these actions are not enough, join your neighbors and friends in good will to discuss how climate change will affect your lives. \Finally, repeat the following pledge each time you witness the beauty of nature: I will work actively to set ambitious, clean energy goals for Wisconsin and the world. \?

122,"By Srijan Sen\Wendell Harris Sr. Photo provided by Wendell Harris Sr. Five seats on the Milwaukee Board of School Directors were up for general election on April 7, 2015. Last night, challenger Wendell Harris Sr., 66, defeated incumbent Jeff Spence, 54, by a significant margin. The two contenders last met eight years ago, but Spence has been has been on the School Board since 1999.\Retired after 30 years at A.O. Smith where he held various positions including crane operator, Mr. Harris has been active member of the NAACP since.\His top priority is to maintain local control of Milwaukee Public School (MPS) system, despite legislative efforts to expand charter schools via a state-run board, potentially imposing additional sanctions on struggling schools.\Mr. Harris, a newcomer on the Board of School Directors, attributes this electoral success to a clear indication by Milwaukee residents taking a stand against Gov. Walker's charter school policy. An ardent supporter of strengthening the MPS system, Mr. Harris does not aim to undermine charter and voucher schools already in existence, but doesn't want any new ones either.\""The people spoke to me yesterday,"" said Mr. Harris. ""It was loud and clear.""\The incumbent candidate Jeff Spence is the director of agency services at Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewerage District and has served on the board for 16 years, having served two terms as president.\In a pre-election interview with the Shepherd Express, Mr. Spence expressed interest in improving education outcomes for young people, but acknowledged that MPS has a long way to go in achieving those goals.\He supports the Common Core standards, which MPS is working to implement, and wanted to ensure that parents could easily access student performance of voucher and public schools.\""When I look at Common Core, I see it as we're trying to give young people a sense of what we expect them to attain from an educational perspective as they mature through the K-12 system,""\Mr. Spence told the Shepherd Express. Mr. Spence was not available to comment for this story.\Amongst the various issues associated with MPS, exorbitantly high suspension of Black, American Indian and Latino students is of immediate concern.\According to a 2015 report published by The Civil Rights Project at UCLA, Wisconsin ranked in the top 20 districts for highest suspension rates of Latino and American Indian students, but was not the state top 20 districts for overall suspension rate.\Additionally, the study found Milwaukee Public Schools had the highest overall K-8 suspension rate among districts with K-8 enrollments of at least 3,000, and a minimum of 100 black, Latino and white students.\There have also been key personnel changes in the last year with the appointment of Dr. Darienne Driver as the new superintendent of Milwaukee Public Schools in October 2014.\After serving as interim superintendent for three months, Driver became the district's first permanent female superintendent replacing Dr. Gregory Thornton, who left the district in July 2014 to serve the Baltimore City Public School System.\But Mr. Harris is unshaken by the political turmoil over education happening in Madison.\Strongly committed to furthering goals of public education, he is looking forward to working with the community.\Making an effort to increase public engagement in matters of the district's public education policy, Mr. Harris is hoping to set up a system of community meetings where residents can share grievances and learn more about the MPS strategy to tackle tough situations.\""I want to ensure that children are receptive to education and have a safe environment in which to learn,"" said Mr. Harris.\He points to state funding cuts targeted at public schools as a grave threat to the prospect of a well rounded education.\However, Mr. Harris plans to keep pushing towards progress irrespective of state support advocating for alternative funding sources.\Citing Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee's ""Let's Move Forward"" plan that proposes major carbon tax and fees on the state's industrial polluters, Mr. Harris said he would redirect the money towards public education.\He also hopes this model can be implemented beyond public schools and into public colleges.\The market-based carbon pollution charge is set to generate $7 billion over 12 years according to Gov. Inslee.\As someone who spends much of his time now volunteering at Transition High School, Mr. Harris is excited for his debut in the role of a legislative leader overlooking education policy in Milwaukee's district 2.\""I really appreciate everyone that came out to support the cause of public education,"" said Mr. Harris.

123," It's become painfully obvious that the oil-addicted United States must take action to stop global warming - and equally obvious that sensible energy action will have to come from Congress, business and the American people. Piecemeal approaches won't work. What we need - and quickly - are market-based incentives to make it attractive to stop emitting the carbon that causes global warming.\ The longer we wait to take action on global warming, the more it will cost us in the long run. So it makes sense to adopt a tax on carbon emissions now. The trick is to design a ""global cooling tax"" that a majority of Americans will want to pay. We propose a tax that will hit energy hogs hardest. But under our scheme, you would be able to invest your tax dollars directly in clean technologies that would lower your energy bills.\ What can we do to stop drastic climate change while we wait for viable alternative sources of energy?\ We can reduce carbon emissions by installing scrubbers on power plants, switching to hybrid and then plug-in hybrid cars, planting trees, and building wind farms and energy-efficient buildings. By many estimates, a tax of about 27 cents for each gallon of fuel consumed and $30 per ton of carbon dioxide from electricity generated would be enough to move from an economy in which pollution is essentially rewarded to one that rewards clean technologies. This amounts to about $180 billion a year, less than 1 percent of the $17 trillion U.S. economy.\ Our carbon tax proposal is based on the principle that every consumer of fossil-fuel energy should have to pay the price of getting rid of the carbon generated by burning it. So the owner of a Hummer who drives it 10,000 miles a year would pay $200 a year, and a Prius driver would pay $50.\ The carbon tax also would be imposed on gas or oil to heat homes. But energy sources that don't generate carbon (such as wind, solar and other renewable resources) would not be taxed.\ Voters on the American political left might be content to stop there and let the federal government spend the tax proceeds. Voters on the right would likely object on grounds that taxes are already too high, that market solutions to the energy problem are preferable, or that government investment in clean-energy technologies will only spawn inefficient bureaucracies. But because taxes are a third rail of U.S. politics - touch it and you die - politicians might never get around to making us pay for the solutions we all know we need.\ The alternative is to place the authority to spend the tax money directly in the hands of the people. This approach would make a carbon tax more palatable, equitable and efficient. The average American would pay roughly $555 a year for all of the carbon used in his gasoline, electricity and home heating.\ But instead of going to the Treasury, the tax money would be credited into individual ""energy savings accounts."" Each taxpayer could decide how best to spend it to reduce carbon emissions. You could use your $555 toward installing solar panels on your roof, cutting your electricity bill to zero. Or you could direct your tax money to a charity that plants fast-growing trees at the equator, or to a private company that would suck up the carbon in the atmosphere and sequester it under the ocean floor. You could pool your ""cooling tax"" money with neighbors and build a windmill to supply your own electricity.\ Any plan that produces energy without emitting carbon, or gets rid of carbon in the atmosphere, would qualify.\ *\ If you don't want to be bothered with this scheme, or if you believe the federal government is the best ""decider"" for how to solve global warming, you could do nothing. The Treasury would put unallocated funds to work tackling global warming as it deemed best. Poor people could apply for tax rebates, so that the tax would not be regressive.\ The results would be transformative. The U.S. would no longer be a net generator of greenhouse gases. Instead, its companies would lead in creating new markets in environmentally sound technologies funded by the investment choices of Americans. It's in our national interest to invest in our energy future - and within our power to innovate our way out of this crisis.\ Garrett Gruener is a venture capitalist and the founder of Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com). Daniel Kammen is co-director of the Berkeley Institute of the Environment at the University of California, Berkeley."
124,"Carbon tax would be good for the Earth\Thanks for running two views on a carbon tax in last Sunday's State Journal.\A carbon tax would indeed have many benefits, especially if all revenue were returned equally to American households. It would spur clean-energy innovation and implementation. It would put money in people's pockets and create jobs. It would decrease the number of premature deaths due to air pollution. And last but not least, it would quickly lower greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the dangers of human-induced climate change.\It's hard to understand the thinking of people who resist doing anything about climate change. Sure, it would decrease the profits of fossil fuel companies, but their days are numbered anyway. The reality of increasing global temperatures, disappearing arctic ice, rising seas, unpredictable weather and dying species is destroying the myth of unfettered economic growth.\As time goes by, more and more people are seeing this, even members of conservative think tanks.\Steve Lewis, Fitchburg\This Earth Day work on local pollution\With Earth Day upon us, it's time to focus on cleaning up our local environment. Here on Madison's East Side we have plenty of vexing problems to tackle and challenges for our local leaders.\Over 10 years ago, we lost our whistle ban and ugly train horns began blasting at all hours. I challenge Madison Ald. Marsha Rummel to pause handing out TIF loans to developers, and begin beautifying our neighborhoods by completing planned quiet zones.\We recently learned of another round of PCB water and soil contamination caused by Madison-Kipp and a lack of city oversight. I challenge Madison Mayor Paul Soglin to reverse his pro-pollution stance and help us stop Madison-Kipp from poisoning our kids.\A few years ago, my neighborhood association met with Dane County Executive Joe Parisi to present ideas for reducing the noise impacts of the county airport.\He responded by flying in a lawyer to make it clear that the airport has no obligation or intention of reducing its impacts on city neighborhoods. I challenge Parisi to use the airport's unlimited budget to reduce the number of airliners and fighter jets which rattle our homes.\Here's hoping that this Earth Day our leaders begin addressing local challenges.\Steven Klafka, Madison\Technology hurts human connections\We are all human, but our society does not value the human person as it should.\We sit and ask ourselves why our world is falling into disrepair and why we cannot respect each other. We should really be asking what we can do to change this.\In this internet age, it is now more important than ever to connect the way we were meant to.\Our phone is only a means to simulate that real connection. We pass each other and say nothing at all. We live, but are we truly conscious? There is no substitute for a lover's touch or a hug from a friend. We all need this to survive, but we wonder why others suffer from loneliness and sadness.\It seems to me that we could answer our own questions if we only tried.\I want to challenge our communities to really think about what they want. Do they want to spend a lot of money on a little box for temporary stimulation, or do they want to actually go out and get the connections that don't cost a dime'\It's an important question.\Samuel Ludke, Wisconsin Rapids\What is Supreme Court smoking'\Every stoner in the state should welcome the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision on the auspicious date of April 20, when the virtues of cannabis are celebrated around the world.\For those who were too wasted to pay attention, let me explain. The court rejected a petition by 54 retired judges asking these high dudes and dudettes to tighten up rules that spell out when they must get off a case due to a conflict of interest. Like, say, if somebody who appears before you in court paid to put you on the bench in the first place.\Naturally, some law experts and other snowflakes are whining that this as an assault on democracy, a cowardly kowtowing to special interests which impugns the integrity of the court, yada yada yada. We can expect more of this drivel in the near future.\But according to Justice Rebecca Bradley, the petition ""violates the oath that each of us took when we took our office."" I think that says that honest politicians who are paid off must stay paid off, so get over it.\I don't know what our Supreme Court justices were smoking, but it should be as legal as the bribery that bought them.\Bob Israel, Madison"

Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, a multinational blueprint for limiting the rise of global temperatures. \In the absence of government leadership, the responsibility for addressing the problem will largely fall on private sector businesses, which are responsible for 70 percent of global economic activity, said Jessy Servi Ortiz, incoming director of the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council. ""We need leadership like we've never needed it before,"" Servi Ortiz told a recent gathering of business representatives. ""You're the leaders.""\Risk and revenue \While politicians debate the reality of a warming climate, scientists are warning of catastrophic impacts if no action is taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions. \A recent report by 13 federal agencies said damage related to climate change could reduce U.S. economic output by up to 10 percent by the end of this century. \In an increasingly global economy, businesses are already noticing. Rising sea levels, drought and increasingly intense storms and wildfires threaten assets and supply chains. \Almost no business is immune from the impacts of climate change, Servi Ortiz said. \And many corporations are anticipating there will eventually be a price for carbon emissions, which Flint argues should take the form of a carbon tax.\Good for the bottom line \Corporations have also learned that sustainability can bolster profit. \""Sustainability is the right thing to do, and it is good for business,"" said Tim Wiora, CEO of the Wisconsin Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a nonprofit consulting company that has helped 154 businesses save about $20 million through sustainability practices while saving some 85 million kilowatt-hours of electricity use and 193 million gallons of water use. \Those same businesses generated $22 million in new revenue from green products. \Since 2010, Wisconsin-based Kohler Co. has cut energy use by 20 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by 24 percent while cutting waste by more than half. The company aims to eliminate its direct greenhouse gas emissions while also producing products that conserve water and energy. \Kohler sustainability director Rob Zimmerman said there are no trade-offs involved: cutting waste benefits the environment, customers and the company. \""We're not doing this as a political statement,"" Zimmerman said. ""We're doing this because it's good business."" \For companies such as Milwaukee- based Johnson Controls, sustainability is a revenue engine. \""It's actually a megatrend,"" said Clay Nesler, vice president of global sustainability and regulatory affairs for the company's building technologies division. Nesler said his company is working on $1.5 billion worth of sustainable building projects that will cut carbon emissions, including a Hawaii college that is on track to be the nation's first campus completely powered with renewable energy. \""We're getting some pretty big impacts,"" he said.\Public pressure \Corporations are also responding to public pressure as customers, employees and investors put increasing value on sustainability. \""It's an expectation,"" said Tom Eggert, who started the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council in 2007. ""More and more customers, especially millennials, are interested in the footprint of products."" \Public utilities responding to customer and investor pressure as well as the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy are leading the charge. \Alliant Energy, which serves nearly 1 million customers in Wisconsin and Iowa, has pledged to eliminate 80 percent of its carbon emissions by 2050. Earlier this month, Minnesota-based Xcel Energy announced plans to be carbon-free by mid-century. \""They're not doing that because the federal government or anyone else has put a gun to their head,"" said Bill Davis, executive director of the Sierra Club's Wisconsin chapter. ""They're doing that because they're business people and they see the way things are going.""\?A long way to go' \Despite the efforts of some, the business sector has a long way to go. \Energy companies continue to profit from fossil fuels. U.S. oil and gas production are at an all time high, and even with the shift to renewable energy, electricity producers continue to burn more than 600 million tons of coal each year. \Davis points out that even with 80 percent reduction, utilities will still be pumping out a lot of carbon dioxide. \Reynolds acknowledges there are limitations to what he can do with existing technology. There's not yet a viable alternative to diesel trucks for long-distance routes, although Reynolds said his newer trucks have doubled their fuel efficiency to 6 mpg. \""We are not sustainable,"" he said. ""We are a company that wants to be sustainable. We have a long way to go.""\?All hands on deck' \Despite the private-sector leadership, business leaders say there's still a role for government to play. \""I don't think we can let government off the hook,"" Zimmerman said. ""Regulations drive innovation. Good ones do."" \Don Ferber of the grassroots climate group Madison 350 said the federal government should be taking the lead. \But even in the absence of federal and state action, cities and counties can play a big role. For example, Ferber said, the pending loss of Boulder, Colorado, which is in the process of terminating Xcel's utility franchise, may have pushed the utility to make bolder moves. \Flint said a carbon tax would be more effective than regulation. \""Companies frequently prefer the simplicity of a carbon tax,"" he said. ""For a corporation the climate tax creates a market, and they know how to respond to markets."" \Davis, of the Sierra Club, said while it's good that companies are taking action, government regulations and assistance could speed up the timelines. \""This is kind of an allhands- on deck situation,"" Davis said. \Nesler isn't holding his breath. \""It ain't going to come from Washington,"" he said. ""We're going to address this bottoms up more than waiting for our state Legislature or certainly the federal government.""

126,"EDITOR: When is enough enough? Wisconsin utilities are again proposing rate hikes. Wisconsin Public Service Corp. wants to increase the fixed monthly electrical rate from $10.40 to $25. The Public Service Commission is expected to decide by the end of the year. We, as consumers, can't wait that long for them to decide. Now is the time to tell them this rate hike is uncalled for.\If you dig into this a little deeper, you will see that WPS's parent company, Integrys Energy Group, is in the process of being bought out by Wisconsin Energy Corp. for $9.1 billion dollars. WEC says it intends to continue raising its annual dividend by 7 percent to 8 percent and expects to increase its dividend further after the deal is completed.\So is this new proposed rate hike designed to bring back the lost revenue from those who have or are planning to remove themselves from the grid due to the high cost of electricity? Or is this rate hike a way to keep the shareholders of both companies happy? I was told once that shareholder interest is the first interest to be taken into consideration before all others.\I find it disgusting, in a time where wages are stagnant and individuals are forced to decide where each penny has to go, that the clamp is squeezing ever so tighter. I'm reliant on the electric and gas that WPS provides. I pay the fixed rate on the electric and the fixed rate on natural gas, even when I don't use it. I even pay for those individuals who can't afford their WPS bill.\If they say that increased competition helps bring down the price because the consumer has multiple choices/services to choose from, maybe now is the time to bring some competition into the area. If we can't get the competition, then let the Public Service Commission know enough is enough and have them deny this rate hike.\Cash Cooke,\Plover\Don't trust Walker\EDITOR: A recent letter complimented Gov. Scott Walker for fighting to keep Skyward Inc. in Wisconsin. Am I in an alternate universe? Walker and the Republicans passed legislation which created a single- provider system and then gave the contract for Wisconsin to a company not from Wisconsin. It took efforts from a lot of people in Wisconsin and I'm guessing mostly Democrats rather than Republicans (who passed it in the first place) to get that changed and keep Skyward here.\It is appalling to me to see Walker and supporters trying to rewrite history to make themselves look better.\Walker also said ""absolutely"" he should be held to his promise to create 250,000 jobs during his term.\Since he missed that by more than half, now he doesn't think it is important. Now Walker is politically plagiarizing by taking credit for 125 jobs created at Curt Manufacturing Company which were created from grants given by the Gov. Jim Doyle administration. Walker took credit for them. When asked by the media if there were 125 additional jobs beyond those created by Doyle's administration, the answer was no. They were the only jobs. He just took the credit. I bet he includes them in his total.\He was going to balance the budget, but now it looks like we're facing a $1.8 billion deficit. The state is broke!\Remember that? Broke again.\I don't trust Walker.\That is why I will be voting for Mary Burke and Democrats. I ask you to, too.\Veronica Grunniwaldt,\Custer\Walker's hard work paid off\EDITOR: I am sending this letter in support of Gov. Scott Walker.\Walker eliminated the state's $3.6 billion budget deficit without raising taxes. This saved taxpayers approximately $3 billion. While doing this, he has helped our schools and school programs tremendously.\Walker has cut taxes by about $2 billion for families and businesses since taking office. He is the first Wisconsin governor to save the state this much money in such a short period of time. More than 100,00 jobs have been created because of him. If you research his facts in comparison to other governors in the past, Walker's numbers are unbeatable and there is no comparison.\Walker represents what a true patriotic American stands for. His hard work has paid off. I admire his morals and values, family is what it is all about. He is a man of integrity. I stand behind Scott Walker.\Judy Nitschke,\Mosinee\Turn the music down, SPASH\EDITOR: Boom boom, thump bump boom. Have you been by the Stevens Point Area Senior High School campus lately? Yeah, some coach decided that a great way to teach respect for others was to blast loud music during football practices. Those closest to the fields are being treated, daily, to it. Perhaps the coaches thought the elderly residents living behind the fields needed to brush up on their music. I'm sure they are receiving a very thorough and quite startling education from the likes of Ghostface Killah and Wiz Kallifah.\Those living further away just have their windows and heads rattled with low-frequency vibrations. Turn it up, coach; I can't quite catch your concert from the Stevens Point Sculpture Park.\Laura Mundschau,\Stevens Point\Enact revenue neutral carbon tax now\EDITOR: George W.

These fees are rebated, in the form of a dividend for each American. The total value of the dividends paid must equal 100 percent of the carbon fees collected, making it revenue neutral.

127,"EDITOR: On Feb. 23, 2017, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld the Clark County Circuit Court's decision from November 2015 to deny all relief and dismiss all claims in\Clark County Sheriff Gregory Herrick's lawsuit filed against Clark County and individual Clark County Board Supervisors related to the sheriff's authority and the county budget.\The Court of Appeals found that Sheriff Herrick's claims were moot and not ripe for judicial review as the Clark County Board of Supervisors took action on April 22, 2015, to allow Sheriff Herrick to use Clark County's truck to fulfill his duties and to sell squad cars. Further, the Court of Appeals found there was no merit to any alleged violations of Sheriff Herrick's constitutional rights. The Court of Appeals specifically declined to decide the contours and extent of the sheriff's authority in relation to the county budget.\The Clark County Board of Supervisors, whose members are elected and has constitutional authority, is committed to providing resources for fiscally responsible law enforcement services in Clark County. The county sincerely hopes less expensive forums are used for future points of administrative contention in Clark County.\Jacob C. Brunette,\Corporation Counsel for Clark County\Support bi-partisan carbon tax plan\EDITOR: There is good news. A group of conservative leaders, working together, have formed the Climate Leadership Council. Included in this group are three former Treasury secretaries -- Henry Paulson, George Schultz and James Baker III. Their plan is simple, conservative, supports a free market and limits government. It calls for a tax on carbon starting at $40 per ton, which rises over time. In addition, border adjustment tariffs would be applied on carbon imports coming into the country.\All proceeds from this tax are to be equitably returned to households quarterly, via the Social Security Administration. Those of us who limit our carbon usage would come out ahead of those who wish to spend more for carbon-based products. It's a win for the pocket book and for the environment.\Our new Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, even thinks a carbon tax is a good idea. Please join in encouraging Sens. Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin as well as Congressman Sean Duffy to support this bi-partisan plan. It's about time for some good news.\Barb Gillespie,\Marshfield\Bill has far-reaching impact on education\EDITOR: Parents and grandparents take notice. There is a bill, H.R.610, coming up in the House that would include the repeal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. We need our representative to vote no on H.R.610. Here's why.\If this bill passes it would eliminate provisions that provide equal opportunity in education for your children. ESEA covers programs for struggling learners, students in poverty, AP classes, ESL programs, rural education, school safety, and monitoring and compliance with federal accountability for these programs. In special education, ESEA ensures access to general education curriculum, accommodations on assessments (larger print, more time), use of principles of ""Universal Design for Learning"" in materials and instruction that gives access to appropriate curriculum.\ESEA also requires the writing of Title I grants for federal funds to help schools improve programs dealing with poverty, bullying, harassment and more.\It would also abolish the Nutritional Act of 2012, which provides nutritional standards and funding to states for in-school breakfast and lunch programs.\Your child benefits from these programs (if only by eating school lunches). You should be concerned. As we in Wisconsin have no representative on the Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education Committee, please call Rep. Sean Duffy at 202-225-3365 or locally at 715-298-9344 or send an email, write or visit his local office. Tell him to vote no on H.R.610.\James R. Schneider,\Wausau"

129,"Don't blame police for racial disparities\Thanks to the Madison Police Department and Chief Mike Koval for their ongoing efforts to make Madison a safe place to live and be productive.\It's disgraceful that the Young Black and Gifted Coalition blames the police department for racial disparities. This group seems desperate to bring national issues to Madison. Madison is not the place for this behavior. Until the Young Black and Gifted Coalition takes to the front lines of places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Chicago, they will be fake revolutionaries seeking attention.\Issues with racial disparities in Madison can be solved, but not by this approach. Causing friction is not the way. It makes matters worse. Madison's racial disparities can be solved systematically and strategically.\The Young Black and Gifted Coalition says they want ""opportunities for self-determination."" Self-determination is determined by self, not by the Madison Police Department.\Disparities exist in Madison because the ""black community"" doesn't exist. To have community, there must be common unity. What Madison has is a population of black individuals fending for themselves, without compassion and love for self or one another.\Gain knowledge of self and become responsible for your own outcomes. No more blame game. Look within.\Koval is a class act. Never mind the critics.\- Ezi Adesi, Madison\It's time for a tax on carbon\I read with interest Charles Krauthammer's column proposing a hefty revenue-neutral tax on gasoline in last Friday's State Journal.\Many recent polls show the majority of Americans think climate change is a serious problem that must be addressed. A majority of elected officials probably think so, too, if you count those who are afraid to admit it.\The only way to stem the acceleration of climate change is to make fossil fuels too expensive to burn. Actually, they are already too expensive but we are paying only a fraction of their cost directly. So some kind of carbon tax seems like the only solution to the problem.\The global hunger for coal and petroleum is too huge and the fossil fuel industry is too wealthy, greedy, short-sighted and powerful for change to happen in any other way.\Krauthammer's proposal addresses a major contributor to carbon pollution: Gasolinepowered vehicles. But a tax on carbon at its source would cover all sources of carbon pollution. A well-designed carbon tax would benefit the economy, the environment, the climate and public health. And the time for it is now.\- Carol Steinhart, Madison\Consensus on warming might be wrong\Wisconsin has been covered with glaciers several times. The glaciers advanced and then retreated.\Guess what happened between the glacier periods: global warming. That is the reason the glaciers could retreat. So, yes, the Earth is getting warmer. The question is really: What degree, if any, is caused by human actions?\Various scientists have prepared computer programs to predict the weather 100 years from now. To do this, they had to make many different assumptions. As an engineer, I have used computer programs to predict costs of construction, flow of money and future costs. Changing one or two assumptions can make a world of difference in the final analysis.\The consensus opinion is that human action is the cause of global warming. Three-thousand years ago, the consensus opinion was that the sun revolved around the Earth. Two-thousand years ago, the consensus was that the Earth was flat.\Yes, take steps to reduce air pollution. But, remember, India and China spew more pollution into the atmosphere than the United States. Any extreme action taken to reduce ""global warming"" must be a concerted effort by all nations. Alone, we will be sweeping back the tide.\- Stephen J. Kapitan, Madison\Madison needs more than technology jobs\Madison news media is giving lots of coverage to the growth of Epic, and rightly so. Dane County is very fortunate to have the growth this company is providing.\But let's not put all of our eggs in one basket. In the long run, diversified economic growth will provide employment stability and a better mixture of job opportunities and pay ranges.\Although Epic provides many high paying technology positions, it does not provide many ""blue collar"" jobs. Those jobs are needed to address Dane County's growing number of residents who are earning below the poverty level or are unemployed.\Madison has never had a significant manufacturing presence to provide ""blue collar"" jobs. Gisholt left years ago. Oscar Mayer employment is down from its peak. Unions have played a role in this decline as competition has moved jobs to non-union shops and right-to-work states. But support from city officials to entice new manufacturing companies or those already located here has always been poor.\It is time to stop thinking manufacturing does not fit Madison's image and achieve the advantages of a more balanced economic model.\- Doyle Wilke, Madison"
130,"EDITOR: Once upon a time there was a country that thought of itself as the leader of the free world. People all over the world looked at it as the ideal. It had actually written into its laws such radical concepts as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom from religious persecution, the right of a speedy trial where you would be judged by a jury of your peers, the right to not be discriminated against for any reason, and a whole host of other liberating guarantees that the rest of the world could only dream about.\Many workers around the world looked at that nation's labor movement as the ideal, and attempted to emulate it in every way, achieving a living wage, solid health and dental benefits, vacations and holidays enough to enjoy life, and a retirement plan that provided them with a comfortable time after a lifetime of work.\That country provided the backbone of a defense for the free world that joined in a common philosophy of how to govern free people.\Now, the rest of the world trembles wondering where it went to, what caused it to disappear, and ask how did the citizens of that country allow it to slip out of their hands, because they know that without it, all that is good and fine and worth hoping for, will vanish as those less than honorable take advantage of the void.\Mark Holbrook,\Wisconsin Rapids\Support bi-partisan carbon tax plan\EDITOR: There is good news.

King of Oshkosh responded to questions ranging from how they want the coronavirus pandemic handled to police reform during the event, which was held at Oshkosh City Hall.\Coronavirus precautions prevented the forum from being held in front of an audience, but it was livestreamed online and broadcast on WOCT 101.9 FM and will be rebroadcast several times before the Aug. 11 primary.\The Sixth Congressional District includes Sheboygan, Fond du Lac, Ozaukee, Manitowoc, Waushara, Green Lake, Marquette and Columbia counties, as well as parts of Dodge, Winnebago and Milwaukee counties.\Asked what their priorities would be if elected, Boor, who has experience managing wind energy projects, listed renewable energy first.\Wind and solar farms promote onshore manufacturing and jobs, Boor said.\His other priorities are decriminalizing marijuana and expanding high-speed internet into rural parts of the country.\King said she'd focus on health care reform, securing affordable prescriptions and universal coverage.\King noted that several counties in Wisconsin don't have an OB-GYN and said access to those professionals would be part of her focus in a new system.\In her opening statement, King referenced her background as a practicing attorney for 20 years, the last seven of which she has represented hospital providers and patients against health insurance companies and government payers like the Veterans Administration and Medicare.\Beardsley's first priority focused on the environment and climate change. He said he supports the Green New Deal and a carbon tax and dividend plan, and would work toward net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. He also supports reentering the Paris Climate Accord.\""It is a global issue, so I think it's very important that we lead as a nation,"" Beardsley said.\His other priorities would include health care and elections reform.\Beardsley is an IT consultant and said the district is ready for something new.\Grothman was first elected in 2014 and is on his third term in Congress.\In response to a question about what the most pressing issue is facing the district, Boor and King's answers focused on the COVID-19 pandemic.\Boor said the main concern he's heard from potential constituents about he pandemic is whether kids are going back to school in the fall and what parents or guardians will do for child care.\The federal government needs to keep pushing for a vaccine, Boor said, and needs to communicate clearly.\King pointed to the recession, unemployment rate and the pandemic. The federal government needs to rebuild people's confidence in public health, King said, and balance health and safety with an open economy.\King also said the next stimulus package should include funding for education.\Beardsley said the most pressing issue is supporting the agriculture and manufacturing industries, providing them with relief and incentivizing transitions to sustainable technologies through federal grants.\Beardsley also said a carbon tax would provide more opportunities for rural communities, which would benefit from new technologies like wind turbines.\On ICE policy, Boor said ICE's practices should be evaluated through a lens of compassion, and people trying to cross the border should be detained and sent back to their countries in some way, but ran out of time during his answer.\King said ICE's current enforcement is an overreach and detention isn't a cost-effective solution.\Beardsley called ICE's policies inhumane and said he supports a deportation freeze, but also supports detaining people, giving them due process and a clear path to citizenship.\""It's almost Holocaust level stuff,"" Beardsley said of people being kept in cages in detention camps.\Amid the national outcry to remove symbols and monuments tied to the country's past, candidates were asked how they would balance preserving the nation's history while addressing racism and prejudice.\Beardsley said addressing racism always comes first, that he's in favor of getting rid of Columbus Day and associated statues. It's a symbol that's causing harm to people, Beardsley said, and if it's making them uncomfortable or they feel unsafe, ""It's all about putting those people first.""\Boor said he also supports removing Columbus Day, but also replacing it with Juneteenth. More explanation on both the good and the bad parts of history is needed, said Boor.\King called the nation's history complicated and said there isn't enough funding for education on Indigenous cultures.\To deal with systematic racism, ""we need to look at all of our systems with a wide brush,"" King said.\Ultimately, the people making decisions need to change, King said, and more needs to be done to encourage people from diverse backgrounds to run for office.\""It has to do with changing the faces in the seats,"" King added.\Asked about Congress' role in addressing police issues, Boor blamed partisan bickering for people losing faith in the system.\""With too many politicians just sticking to party lines and talking points, it degrades the caliber of the entire society,"" Boor said.\King said the burden has fallen on police officers ""to become the only mechanism that we still properly fund to engage society.""\Balance in the rest of the public structures needs to be restored through funding other areas of the system, like schools, social workers and mental health resources, King said.\Beardsley called for improved transparency and shifting the mentality away from ""us vs. them"" through the demilitarization of the police.

136,"Natural gas is OK, but only as a ?bridge fuel'\Regarding last Sunday's editorial on natural gas as a bridge fuel, I agree with the concept ? but with ""bridge fuel"" being the key operative word.\Anything that can be done to reduce burning carbon is crucial at this point. While we are converting coal plants to natural gas, we must be building more renewable energies, and thinking out of the box to end the use of fossil fuels.\Investing in efficiency improvements is a far more cost-effective way to reduce energy use, so any money spent in this area will go very far.\Fracking of natural gas is also fraught with potential problems down the road, so what we do must be done very carefully.\? Tom Umhoefer, Stoughton\Support production of renewable natural gas\Natural gas is an important and clean energy resource.\Promoting natural gas paves the way for greater use of renewable energy in the form of biogas. Technology to upgrade biogas to the same energy content as natural gas can be used by generators of biogas, such as landfills or wastewater treatment plants, to produce renewable natural gas.\Renewable natural gas can be used for compressed natural gas vehicle fuel, or substituted for natural gas in any application. Renewable natural gas reduces greenhouse gas emissions and involves no extraction of fossil fuels.\Unfortunately, barriers exist for getting renewable natural gas into utility pipelines. And most of renewable fuel incentives go to ethanol, which diverts food into energy and is used as an additive to gasoline.\Compressed natural gas is a direct replacement for diesel fuel or gasoline with lower carbon dioxide and particulate emissions than petroleum-based fuels. Conversion of vehicles to compressed natural gas should be encouraged and production of new vehicles that run on this should be promoted.\Renewable natural gas should be recognized and funded. Biogas resources are available now and more can be developed to produce clean, renewable energy in our local communities and nationwide.\? Jay Kemp, Madison\It's too late to focus on an iffy ?bridge fuel'\It's tempting, especially in coal-burning Wisconsin, to welcome natural gas as the bridge to reducing carbon emissions to safe levels. Yet I see three reasons not to be lulled by this fuel choice.\First is the ""if extracted safely""caveat for fracking. So far, the industry has fallen far short of this safety goal, so further investment risks our health and our environment.\Second, why do we think natural gas won't become as entrenched as oil or coal?\Third, it's just too late. We need to focus all our intellectual, technical, political and financial resources on developing sustainable energies now.\Haven't the weather events of the past year and 2014 given us abundant evidence that climate disruption is already here? It's too late for bridges.\? Karen Carlson, Madison\Focus on renewable energy such as solar, wind, biomass\We should not depend on lessening emissions from fossil fuels including coal, oil and natural gas to relieve us from problems causing climate change.\In the combustion of fossil fuels in engines or burners, carbon is converted to energy and waste to carbon dioxide. Our root problem has developed from carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere and remaining there as a greenhouse gas over the long term.\Natural gas is mainly methane. If methane is leaked and migrates to the atmosphere, it could be worse as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\We must use more renewable fuel. Energy from solar and wind does not emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Energy from fuel cells may use hydrogen as a fuel and produce wastes, mainly water.\Energy from biomass may be converted to fuel for use in gasoline, diesel or aviation engines. Ethanol or biodiesel from corn or soybeans would result in atmospheric carbon dioxide that would only be retained until new crops remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\Another possible approach would be to make drop-in fuels that are like petroleum gasoline, diesel and jet fuels. An even better solution would be to use a non-food biomass source such as wood.\? John I. Zerbe, Madison\Carbon tax will push us across the ?bridge'\""Bridge"" is the key word in last Sunday's editorial, ""A solid bridge to cleaner energy.""\Natural gas is, indeed, a cleaner fuel than coal and oil. It is abundant in the United States and, for now, relatively cheap. But it still produces greenhouse gases and contributes to global warming.\While Wisconsin and the nation have reduced their carbon emissions over the past decade in part by converting power plants, buildings and vehicles to natural gas, we need much deeper cuts to avert potentially catastrophic climate change. Switching to natural gas alone won't be enough.\A federal tax on carbon ? the dirtier the fuel, the higher the tax ? would help us cross the ""bridge"" afforded by natural gas.\It would create new market incentives to conserve and develop ever cleaner sources of energy. Passing all of the tax revenue on to consumers as cash dividends would offset higher energy prices during the transition.\Economists say enacting a carbon tax is the simplest, most efficient way to reduce emissions that cause climate change.\? Tom Sinclair, Madison\Compressed natural gas a good green option\Converting vehicles to run on compressed natural gas is an excellent green option for businesses using large quantities of fuel. Reduction in carbon emissions of up to 80 percent can be realized.\The decades of domestic supply in reserves already found will bring cost stability for businesses. As world and domestic economies improve, demand for fossil fuels will only increase costs at home.\There are now public compressed natural gas stations across Dane County that eliminate the decades-long problem of where to get fuel.\Our company has converted 22 of our fleet of 145 vehicles already, and intend to have 80 converted in two years to take advantage of the lower costs and volatility of compressed natural gas.\We also convert vehicles for others, and have done 15 vehicles for businesses that are projecting the same petroleum cost increases.\In short, compressed natural gas is a cheap, green option for those who want to eliminate the seasonal and yearly spikes in their fuel expenses. That it helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil and slows climate change are added bonuses that should make converting an easy choice for businesses and consumers alike.\? Mark Barnes, Madison, president and CEO, Barnes Inc.\Subbing natural gas for coal is bridge to nowhere\The best way to keep carbon emissions going down is not by substituting natural gas for coal. It's by reducing energy demand. Conservation and increasing energy efficiency are the low-hanging fruit as we bridge to cleaner energy.\A federal price on carbon emissions would spur conservation and energy efficiency while holding carbon fuels accountable for the real damage they cause.\Unfortunately, substituting natural gas for coal is a bridge to nowhere. The math doesn't work.\First, the emissions advantage from burning natural gas instead of coal is overestimated. Last Sunday's editorial suggests natural gas emits only about a third as much carbon dioxide as coal. According the Environmental Protection Agency website, ""compared to the average air emissions from coal-fired generation, natural gas produces half as much carbon dioxide.""\Second, however much of Wisconsin's 14 percent emissions reductions can be attributed to substituting natural gas for coal, it ignores ""fugitive"" methane emissions from natural gas extraction and pipeline leaks, a subject of intense scrutiny.\New, independent studies gathering actual field data indicate when methane leakage is factored in, total greenhouse-gas emissions from natural gas may be worse than coal (http://onforb.es/1nRAdmS).\? Dick Smith, Madison\Natural gas production estimates too optimistic\Thanks to the State Journal editorial board for making the reduction of greenhouse gases a priority and for endorsing an ""all of the above"" approach to our energy future and combating climate change.\But consider the limits and vulnerability of natural gas production. There are limits on the rate of its daily flow and especially its current low price.\Our optimistic Energy Information Agency has predicted a huge increase in shale gas production, but because of declines in other production, it projects only a modest annual increase in total gas output. This is hardly enough to replace major shares of electric generation and motor fuel.\And energy experts led by oil analyst Arthur Berman have raised doubts about the shale gas boom. Shale wells produce a lot of their output in a short two years, which requires a furious pace of well drilling to maintain production.\Moreover, at current prices, the four major shale companies have lost much of their cash flow over the last five years.\In Wisconsin we will have to pursue much more of the ""rest of the above"" to meet the energy-climate game, such as transforming our petroleum-hungry car and truck transportation system.\? David Knuti, Madison\?Conservation' missing from energy discussion\Burning more fossil fuel for our evergrowing energy needs, even supposedly ""cleaner"" natural gas (as opposed to dirtier coal and petroleum products), may still be a dangerous alternative. So is our unsustainable energy-based economy.\Those routes will likely not allow us to avoid the worst effects that continued global warming is likely to bring.\Because of our procrastination in weaning off fossil fuels, even after scientific studies warned of potentially grave consequences to our planet's habitability, we can ill afford to go on with business as usual and more dependence on natural gas.\More energy conservation is needed. This means driving less, flying less and using less energy in our homes, work places, churches and other buildings?\More positive financial incentives, and not just for low-income people, are needed to achieve an economy that remains sustainable into the future.\? Michael Neuman, Madison\Use of fuel cells is worth investigating\I agree natural gas is one bridge to a cleaner energy future. However, I do not agree putting future land and water resources at risk to obtain natural gas is a prudent way to proceed.\Besides energy conservation that includes LED light bulb advances and thermostat adjustments, fuel cells are making advancements. Fuel cells efficiently use various fuels without combustion.\Fuel cells can efficiently operate with a variety of fuel sources such as natural gas, methane and biogas. They can even use water via using electrolysis supplied by solar or wind energy for the hydrogen needed to operate.\Dane County uses biogas from its landfill to generate electricity. Many nationwide wastewater treatment facilities, public and private, use fuel cells to fix operational challenges.\Fuel cell buses operate in the Palm Springs, Calif., area, and fuel cell vehicles are making advances, too.\Is Dane County up to date on fuel cell operations? Could Dane County adopt a fuel cell operation?\? Steve Books, Mount Horeb\Natural gas vehicle a pleasure to own\We purchased a 2012 Honda Civic that runs on compressed natural gas in April 2013 from Zimbrick Honda.\When doing research, we found Honda Civics to be safe and reliable, with good resale values. Zimbrick had to be certified by Honda before they could sell or service these cars.\It requires more attention to decide when and where to refuel because there are not as many compressed natural gas stations. Living in Janesville and working in Madison, I get compressed natural gas at Speedway near South Towne Mall and at Kwik Trip on the south side of Janesville.\Compressed natural gas is also available in Rockford, Milwaukee and Dubuque, Iowa, so we have taken some day trips with the car ? and it only costs about $10 to fill up.\With more than 19,000 miles driven so far, we've found the car to be quiet, fun to drive and a pleasure to own. It's a terrific car for us!\? Dave and Nadine Rohr, Janesville\Natural gas use just more dependence on fossil fuels\Far from being a ""bridge to a cleaner energy future,"" natural gas is a sinkhole to increasing dependence on fossil fuels.\Last Sunday's editorial failed to mention methane (natural gas) is a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timescale. A 2013 study found that the nation's half-million natural gas wells collectively emit billions of pounds of methane per year.\Some of this leakage ends up in local air and water supplies, poisoning residents. Fracking has been exempted from many provisions of the Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and other environmental laws. The industry is consuming western Wisconsin's hills at an alarming rate. The dust from frac sand mining is a silicosis hazard, and mining has divided many communities. This is why 49 Wisconsin groups signed on to a resolution calling for a halt to frac sand mining.\We absolutely need to develop clean energy alternatives to coal and nuclear. But the real solution is redistribution of current fossil fuel subsidies to energy efficiency programs, community-scale wind and solar power, and improved mass transit. \?

We haven't forgotten the lesson he taught us with Earth Day: When our elected officials don't perform, we must push them.\Nelson learned to love and respect the natural world while growing up in Clear Lake, Wis. He chose a political career and became a U.S. senator in 1963.\When he arrived in Washington, our environment was hurting. Rivers and streams reeked with industrial pollutants and sewage. Smog from tailpipes and smokestacks choked major cities. Wildlife species faced extinction from pesticides.\Nelson tried for years in vain to focus the president and Congress on these problems. Then he had an idea. ""Teach-ins"" had rallied students to press for change on the Vietnam War. Why not organize a nationwide ""teach-in"" on the environment?\Nelson assembled a team to make it happen. They chose April 22, 1970, and called it Earth Day. Nelson encouraged locally planned activities to involve the most people. The idea spread like wildfire. When April 22 arrived, millions of Americans participated in teach-ins, cleanups and countless other actions.\It didn't take long for politicians to wake up.\President Richard Nixon and members of Congress from both parties soon rushed to support laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and tough revisions of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.\Today our rivers and streams are cleaner, our air is safer to breathe, once-endangered species like bald eagles and wolves have rebounded, and precious natural areas like Wisconsin's Apostle Islands National Lakeshore are protected.\We still have environmental problems, of course. None is more challenging than climate change. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned again this month that human-caused global warming is intensifying storms and heat waves, melting polar ice, raising sea levels, and acidifying the world's oceans ? and the worst is yet to come.\We must shift our nation away from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives. The Obama administration has taken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But only Congress can tackle the problem head-on, and Congress has refused to act.\An attempt to pass significant legislation five years ago failed. Harvard's Theda Skocpol concluded that a lack of grass-roots support was to blame.\Enter the Citizens Climate Lobby. Its members believe that a revenue-neutral carbon tax on fossil fuels is our best hope for meaningful action. This nonpartisan group is building political support from the ground up. CCL has more than 170 chapters in the U.S. and Canada and is growing rapidly.\Wisconsin alone has nine CCL chapters, the newest launched this month in Bayfield County. In June, about 50 Wisconsin climate advocates will join hundreds more from around the country in Washington to lobby every member of Congress. When hundreds of constituents come knocking on the doors of congressional offices as a large, well-organized, respectful and persistent team, the Hill starts to buzz. Together they will urge their senators and representatives to get serious about climate change.\Today's political gridlock shouldn't deter us. The 1960s were rife with partisan rancor, yet Earth Day harnessed citizen concern and forced the nation's leaders to act. We can and must bring the same citizen power to bear in solving our climate crisis. If Gaylord Nelson were still alive, he would say we don't have a moment to lose.\Credit: MADELEINE PARA , national program director for Citizens Climate Lobby and Madison resident"
138,"We are judged by how we treat others\I got on a Metro Transit bus recently on my second night back to work after gall bladder surgery. As soon as I sat down, a man across the aisle started a 20-minute loud, disturbing monologue.\I had my ear buds in listening to music and was able to dismiss him for most of the ride. After a while, I realized his anger was directed at me.\He was trying to condemn me in the name of God because I am a transgender person. I am a devout Christian and I would not be provoked by this man.\He was making a number of fellow riders uncomfortable, but no one had the emotional strength to stand up to his forceful hatred. He pointed at me and mocked me a few times.\He was trying to use biblical logic, but God doesn't speak in terms of hate and ostracism. The criteria for the last judgment isn't about adhering to socially or personally sanctioned preferred behavior. It is based on how we treat the people around us.\Do we act out of love? In a parable in Matthew 25 Jesus said, ""Whatever you did unto the least of these you did unto me."" I would venture that transgender individuals are some of the least respected and least understood members of society.\? Rhiannon Tibbetts, Madison\Apply Winston Churchill's wisdom to climate change\I was heartened to hear President Barack Obama say in his State of the Union speech ""the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact,"" and ""When our children's children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did.""\We won't be able to say that if we increase fossil fuel energy production.\As Winston Churchill said in 1936, ""The era of procrastination, of halfmeasures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.""\The consequences then led to the horrors of World War II. The consequences of unabated global warming are leading to water scarcity, lower crop yields, desertification, disease and disastrous floods.\Obama must do all he can to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but both he and Congress must also enact legislation to cut fossil fuel use and escalate clean renewables. We can do this with a revenue neutral carbon tax. We just need our leaders to have the courage and foresight of Churchill.\? Margaret Welke, Madison\Cartoon didn't represent the typical farmer\As a retired small farmer and follower of Phil Hands' editorial cartoons, I found Saturday's caricature of a farmer disgusting, demeaning and misleading.\My wife and I have four sons who are small farmers. They do not subsist on handouts. The very large farmers, and especially absentee landlords, get huge subsidies and, believe me, they don't chew hay and drive tractors.\? David Batker, Brooklyn\Some in Schultz's district are shedding tears of joy\Letters with Waunakee and Madison addresses praised state Sen. Dale Schultz, R-Richland Center. Those are the people he tried to please with his worries over worn out iron mines.\Nary a mention has been made of his family's interest in education. His wife is a school district administrator. He should excuse himself from votes that affect his spouse's means of making a living. It's called a conflict of interest. The ""right"" people such as Schultz and his Democratic friends never worry about such matters.\On the other hand, people such as Gov. Scott Walker and other Republicans can be sandbagged by opponents and accused of political games. Actual constituents of Sen. Schultz know both parties are probably guilty of playing those games.\While people in Madison and other liberal hot spots shed tears of woe, we in the Senate district Schultz has abandoned for several years are shedding tears of joy. May we get someone who will represent the district's interests, including job formation and tax reform and reduction. And education reforms that produce students with degrees empowering them to earn a living above the minimum wage, not doomed to live on it like our Democratic brethren seem to think we commoners should do.\? Verne Siverling, Reedsburg\Schultz battled ?go along to get along' environment\I can only surmise why Sen. Dale Schultz, R-Richland Center, will not seek re-election. Perhaps it's because his good friends, Sens. Bob Jauch and Tim Cullen, are retiring.\Or the political atmosphere in the Capitol has changed, and his independent political style is out-of-sync with the Republican Party. Maybe it's because going to work in a ""go along to get along"" legislative environment has become a steep uphill battle.\Current Republican control allows for little or no debate or compromise. As a legislator, you're either ""all in"" or ""all out,"" and all Republicans except for Schultz have succumbed to this political reality. Schultz would not sell out the people of Wisconsin and the 17th District to big money interests. He would not blindly follow party bosses, or ""rubber stamp"" legislation.\For these and other reasons, he will be missed in the Legislature. I only wish I could have voted for him again.\? Robert L. Bellman, Richland Center"
139,"Police vehicle distracts from real needs\Dear Editor: Madison's Police Department is now prepared for warfare with their new mine-resistant ambush protection vehicle or MRAP. According to Madison stats, the likelihood of anyone in Madison encountering a situation that would honestly justify having this military vehicle is next to never.\Are we really that scary?\The truth is, whenever anyone requests more police training for de-escalating mental health crises, stronger collaboration with mental health services, lapel cameras, mental health restoration and ongoing screening for police officers, most departments statewide respond with complaints of budgetary constraints.\While it's true that our tax dollars have already paid for these military vehicles, how many more tax dollars will be spent annually on training and on maintaining these vehicles?\How much training time will be taken away from the most common issues and spent on this vehicle for the less than 1 percent chance that it will be needed? How many of our tax dollars will be spent on training around the use of this vehicle before the early warning system that flags troubled officers is fixed?\Why wasn't the Madison community consulted prior to the acceptance of this vehicle? When will we too have a say in how ""community policing"" is defined?\Today, it's more probable that a Madison officer will win the lottery than have to use a MRAP. Perhaps they are planning to win the lottery first so they can pay for the use and maintenance of this inappropriate machine.\Amelia Royko Maurer, Madison\Burke will take us back ? to good Wisconsin values\Dear Editor: Our governor is running for re-election, and he warns us that his likely opponent, Mary Burke, would take Wisconsin backward. What a frightening thought!\Does he mean that Burke would take us back to when Wisconsin had one of the best public school systems? Does he mean Burke would take us back to when we had some of the strongest environmental protections? To when the DNR worked to protect our resources rather than marketing them to the highest bidder?\Under Burke would we once again provide supportive services for low-income families? Would we accept federal Medicaid funds for health care for the poor? Would we go back and consider the jobs and income a high-speed train could bring? Would we show leadership by raising the minimum wage to $10?\This Mary Burke who would take us backward has been endorsed by the Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters. Perhaps they believe she will take us back to the legacy of Gaylord Nelson and Aldo Leopold, a legacy of a land ethic that guides decisions about land use with an eye to the future and to the long-term health of living communities.\Would we go back to the days when taxes were not a dirty word, a time when we realized our taxes brought us services we really needed?\Would Mary Burke take us back to caring for our neighbors instead of just for ourselves?\If so, maybe backward is the new forward and it's back to the future for our state!\Mimi Wuest , Reedsburg \Voter ID question response enlightening\Dear Editor: The Cap Times' ""Quick Question"" regarding Wisconsin's voter ID law provided interesting responses. Of the five respondents, four appeared to be professional, or white-collar types, and claimed the law was unconstitutional, and that they did not support voter ID. The one respondent who supports voter ID was a blue-collar type, and a minority. Yes, a minority that the guilt-ridden liberals claim would be alienated by voter ID.\Norm Sannes , Madison \U.S. economy rigged against all except top 1%\Dear Editor: A letter to the editor praising Paul Ryan for speaking truth about inner city males not learning to value the culture of work and Mitt Romney for saying that 47 percent of the electorate were living off the government failed to take into account how the U.S. economy is rigged against many citizens with job insecurity, discrimination and low wages.\Since 1979, the income of the top 1 percent grew 281 percent, while middle-class wages remained flat. The top 10 percent control 76.7 percent of the country's wealth, leaving just 23.3 percent for the bottom 90 percent to share.\In 1965, CEOs earned 20 times what their workers earned, but in 2012 CEOs earned 273 times their workers' wages. The minimum wage hasn't been increased for seven years. If it had kept up to the rate of inflation, it would be nearly $11 an hour now.\The U.S. has the greatest inequality of income and wealth in our history. African-Americans are not the only citizens who have lost ground due to the Bush recession ? almost all citizens, except for the 1 percent, have lost ground.\David Knutzen , Waunakee \Consider these prayers for government meetings\Dear Editor: In light of the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allows government bodies to open sessions with prayers from specific belief systems, I wish to share the chaplain's prayer from the Monty Python movie ""The Meaning of Life"": ""O Lord, ooh, you are so big, so absolutely huge. Gosh, we are all just absolutely impressed down here, I can tell you. Forgive us, Lord, for our dreadful toadying. And barefaced flattery. But you are so strong and, well, just so super. Amen.""\If this is too cute for some, here is an agnostic prayer from Roger Zelazny's book ""Creatures of Light and Darkness"": ""We give whatever thanks are due to Invisible, Hypothetical Deities that might exist but probably don't for whatever they could have done but probably didn't.""\We're all entitled now to join the party. And we always were.\Paula Dent , Madison \Obama himself to blame for bad energy policy\Dear Editor: I am singularly unimpressed with President Obama's refurbishing of the White House solar panels and his praise of solar energy at a Silicon Valley Wal-Mart on May 9. He wants to both have and eat his proverbial cake. He can't blame a ""disinclined Congress"" for his climate-, public health-, and environment-destroying ""all of the above"" energy policy!\Instead of rushing to accelerate production of America's coal and petroleum (much of which is destined for export and will not benefit America in any way), he should use his influence to leave our climate-killing, environment- destroying fossil fuels in the ground, to stop the Keystone pipeline and development of new LNG shipping terminals, and to reward innovation and development of sustainable energy and stop rewarding Big Coal and Big Oil. And yes, he should trumpet the benefits of a revenue-neutral carbon tax such as the one that is successful in British Columbia.\Carol Steinhart , Madison"
140,"Civil War veterans moved past conflict\Because I'm 88 years old, I have done something few living Americans have: I have spoken personally with veterans of the American Civil War.\The occasion was in a St. Louis railroad station in 1938 when my mother and I were travelling. In the station, I met several Union veterans in blue uniforms who were either going to or returning from the 75th reunion encampment at Gettysburg held by the Grand Army of the Republic. I was only 9 at the time, but I recall speaking to a Union veteran who told me he was 99.\Also in the station were a handful of Confederate veterans in gray, since the GAR had invited their Southern counterparts to attend the event.\We are now squabbling over Confederate memorials like statues and graves. The Union soldiers at Appomattox in 1865 got it right when they invited their defeated enemies to share their rations.\We get it wrong 152 years later when we do not even wish to share memories.\F.W. Nagle, Madison\Invest wisely in rebuilding Houston\Of course we should give federal disaster relief money to Texas.\Yes, both Texas senators voted against that money for states hurt by Hurricane Sandy. But the people of Houston shouldn't be made to suffer because of the party politics of a few politicians. When one part of our country needs help, we give it, knowing that our turn may come tomorrow.\This time, let's be smarter. We need to ensure that post-hurricane rebuilding takes the changing weather into account. Let's also be realistic. There are no walls tall enough, or floodgates strong enough that would have saved Texas from this monster storm. We will never be able to keep up if all we do is invent stronger infrastructure. So let's also be proactive.\Hurricane Harvey makes it clear it is well past time for Congress to take their responsibility seriously. We need vigorous national legislation - some kind of carbon tax would be a good start - to help us move away from the fossil fuels that are driving these weather extremes. The longer we put this off, the more difficult and expensive our efforts will be.\Alyson Schmeisser, Lake Mills\Harvey shows need for an active EPA\I listened with great sympathy to the ongoing coverage of the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey. The degree of destruction took my breath away.\But some of what has occurred can and should be averted in the future with sound planning. Paving over vast tracts of wetlands is dangerous and one of the main contributing factors in the flooding seen in recent days. Elected officials need to prioritize increasing these wetlands, yet we still have naysayers who don't believe in global warming.\The Environmental Protection Agency, for which our own climate denier Cathy Stepp will soon be working, has strayed from its mission to protect the environment. It's now focused on ""business-based"" decisions. President Donald Trump has promoted relaxing environmental regulations that not only make sound common sense, but are based on one scientific study after another.\This brings me to President Trump's appointees to the EPA. Director Scott Pruitt, Stepp and their fellow Republicans are determined to dismantle the regulations that protect our environment.\They are truly the foxes guarding the chicken coop. Folks, we are in deep trouble.\Dan Flood, Mount Horeb\Antifa is a threat to our freedoms\The vast majority of people in the United States were shocked and disgusted about the things the white supremacists and neo-Nazi's were saying while they marched in Charlottesville. The mainstream press rightly called these groups out for their hate speech.\Recently, at a Berkeley rally for free speech, another group, ""antifa"" which is short for anti-fascist, started a wicked brawl, physically attacking people who were there to promote free speech.\Let me be clear, these people were not promoting white supremacy or neo-Nazi causes - only our First Amendment right of free speech to say what we want. There has been little news coverage of antifa and their brutal efforts to stop people from expressing opposing viewpoints. Antifa methods amount to anarchy. They feel any means are justified to suppress ideas they don't want to be heard. This is dangerous to our society and the press needs to be balanced in their coverage of all groups, whether right or left, that endanger our way of life and our freedoms.\Antifa is a group that should be feared for their radical and brutal tactics.\Joseph Tripalin, McFarland\Don't let violence get foothold in city\One of the most difficult jobs is being a police officer, and I admire all who choose that vocation.\This year there has been a marked increase in gun violence in Madison for various reasons. Only recently has this been stemmed by law enforcement. The Police Department announced that there would be a crackdown of these people. It seems to have worked.\My question is, why did it take many months to reach this decision'\Whatever the police are doing, I believe they should continue and not let this activity get a foothold in Madison again.\Richard Nawratil, Monona\Simple solutions fix traffic circles\It's not at all surprising to read about the high number of accidents on roundabouts in the Madison area. Additional driver education, increased landscaping and signage will not solve the problem.\The solutions are simple:\Make the vast majority of them single-lane roundabouts. Very few have the traffic volume to require two lanes. Single-lane configurations will eliminate drivers exiting from the inside lane and colliding with outside lane vehicles.\In two-lane configurations, designate the outside lane as the only exit lane and prohibit exiting from the inside lane.\This would eliminate the majority of the collisions.\Elden Harms, Evansville"
141,"A dozen Waunakee dairy farmers trudged through snow drifts on the Crave Brothers Farm near Waterloo on a recent wintry Wisconsin day.\Marty Mulcahy, one of the farmers, even brought along his veterinarian, Ross Mauer.\They were all there to see the farm's manure digester, a relatively new use for an existing technology that is seen as a green way to address the high cost of traditional waste disposal methods while protecting soil, water and air.\One of the byproducts of a digester is a compost-like substance that can be used as bedding for livestock. Mulcahy was concerned whether the bedding would pose a risk to his cows' health, which is why he brought Mauer along.\But Mulcahy was won over.\""Seeing your cows made me think differently,"" he told Charles Crave, one of the brothers who operates the family farm. ""Your cows are really clean.""\""These are some of the cleanest cows I've seen,"" echoed Maurer. Use of a digester, he added, ""might allow my clients and friends to be better stewards of the land.""\The tour of the Crave farm digester, which was installed in February 2007, was organized by Dane County officials who hope local farmers will buy into the idea of sharing use of a community digester, a proposal being pushed by County Executive Kathleen Falk. She put $1.1 million in her new budget for a Waunakee-area digester and identified another possible digester in the Black Earth Creek watershed as a top priority when asking for money from President-elect Barack Obama and Congress as part of the federal stimulus package that is expected to include aid for municipalities.\Local farmers are a bit wary of the proposal, however, since it's not yet clear who would own the Waunakee digester, who would run it, or whether the county would be officially involved.\But no one denies that there has to be a better way of dealing with animal waste - a major source, many say, for much of the runoff and groundwater pollution that contaminates area lakes, streams and, in some cases, wells.\The biggest source of nutrients entering the lakes in the Yahara River watershed is livestock manure, according to the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at UW-Madison.\Moreover, as climate change produces more extreme rain events - the Madison area has had eight 3-inch rainstorms in this decade, up from two heavy rains per decade in the past - more phosphorus-rich soil will be headed into the Yahara lakes, warns Pete Nowak of the Nelson Institute.\According to the state Department of Agriculture, Dane County's 50,000 milk cows produce 120 pounds of manure per cow per day, or 6 million pounds per day. Looking statewide, Wisconsin's 1.25 million milk cows, along with other livestock, produce enough manure to fill Camp Randall daily, according to a 2003 article in the journal Dental Clinics of North America that named animal waste as one source of human resistance to antibiotics.\Manure left in fields deposits nutrients, including phosphorus, in the soil. When mixed with water, that soil can run off into nearby water and cause the growth of the kind of smelly, sometimes toxic algae that has plagued the Lake Mendota watershed. Moreover, huge manure lagoons that hold manure cleared from barns can fill quickly. When they reach capacity, farmers have to transport the excess to distant fields for spreading, often at great expense.\Spreading manure on fields can be especially harmful to the environment when the ground is frozen; under these circumstances the manure can't be absorbed and runs off into nearby streams. That's what happened in 2001 when a manure spill entered Black Earth Creek, killing thousands of trout. The accident got a lot of publicity and helped jumpstart discussions about the link between lake health and manure disposal.\""Blue-green algae is the biggest negative for the lakes, phosphorus is the biggest factor in algal blooms, and phosphorus from livestock is a major factor,"" said Topf Wells, an assistant to Falk. ""This digester would be a huge step for our lakes.""\The digester on the Crave farm is a huge stainless steel above-ground heated tank that uses bacteria to change manure from the farm's 1,000 cows into methane gas that produces enough electricity to power 400 homes; it also produces bedding for cows and fiber for potting mix. Additionally, the digester returns a reduced amount of liquid manure to a lagoon, so the farmers get what they need to fertilize fields.\The digester envisioned by Dane County officials would remove 19,800 metric tons per year of heat-trapping greenhouse gases and produce valuable electricity or natural gas. But it would also go a step beyond the traditional digester process by removing phosphorus. Some parts of Wisconsin are short of phosphorus, but Dane County now has an oversupply.\""We are suggesting a cooperative scale beyond a digester itself that would produce added-value products,"" said Dick Lathrop of the Nelson Institute. ""Liquid waste can be further treated to strip out nitrogen that farmers need so phosphorus could be sold to potato-growing regions in central Wisconsin.""\Environmental leaders say setting up a community manure digester as a pilot project near Waunakee could benefit the rest of the county and the entire state. (Currently there are 22 digesters operating on 17 farms throughout the state that are larger than the typical Dane County farm.) ""If this experiment is successful, if we can work out the engineering and the economic and social aspects, we could have seven or eight digesters in the county to increase the economic viability of farms,"" Nowak said.\But while the Waunakee farmers were impressed by the digester they saw on the Crave farm - which was built and is operated by a private concern, Clear Horizons LLC of Milwaukee - they are worried about the financial implications of a shared digester.\""We need to find a comfort level for the farmers where they feel they can afford it,"" Waunakee farmer Jeff Endres said prior to the tour. ""They have a lot invested right now, and can't take on a risky business proposition.""\According to a feasibility study completed by Strand Associates in 2008, the kind of digester under consideration would cost from $6 million to $13 million to build. That is a bit pricier than the cost of traditional digesters that don't remove phosphorus, but the amount includes the additional potential costs of acquiring land and installing pipes and pumps to move manure. Roads would also have to be improved if trucks are used to haul some of the manure.\The Waunakee farmers recognize that a shared digester would give them the opportunity to take part in something they probably couldn't afford on their own. But several fear county control.\""We don't want county ownership,"" Endres said. ""The government is not as efficient and could put limitations on farmers."" Endres said he could, however, envision the county playing a role in the removal of phosphorus and transfer of manure.\Farmer Dale Helt said it would be best if the farmers owned at least 25 percent of the digester.\""I am very interested in this project, but I don't know if the people of Dane County want tax dollars going toward this,"" said farmer Chuck Ripp.\The Waunakee farmers remain wary, but do see the potential value of a manure digester, for the environment and their bottom lines. ""We don't want to put anything in the lakes,"" said one.\Dane County officials stress the long-term benefits to farmers of the potential facility. It is costly to haul manure long distances and sometimes difficult to find land to spread it on. Plus, if the federal government establishes a carbon tax (a fee on greenhouse gas emissions), farmers could be at greater financial risk.\Moreover, possible sale of byproducts could produce extra income.\""You have to make your life better,"" added Helt. ""No one will do it for you. We're businessmen more than farmers nowadays.""\Dane County has been laying the groundwork for the proposed community digester since 2006, when an advisory committee was appointed. Strand Associates is now writing a detailed plan.\""We are developing a plan for a community centralized manure management facility that would generate renewable fuel, solids that could be used for fertilizer or other purposes such as fiberboard, and water that could be used for irrigation on the farms,"" said Randy Wirtz of Strand Associates.\The county selected farms in the Waunakee area for a possible site after the feasibility study found that the Waunakee farms offered more advantages and better long-term cost-effectiveness than an alternative site near Middleton. The Waunakee farms are closer together so manure could potentially be pumped instead of hauled to the digester.\The farmers would pay for use of the facility, but ownership is yet to be decided - the county could own it, help fund it, or a third party could be involved, according to Wirtz.\""I envision a bidding process, soliciting proposals from third parties that want to own and operate a facility,"" he said. Falk spokesman Wells predicted the same at a recent conference on the Yahara lakes.\Dan Nemke of Clear Horizons said the Milwaukee-based company would like to be involved in the Dane County operation in some way, though it prefers an arrangement like the one it has on the Crave farm, where it owns and manages the digester.\Kevin Connors, director of land and water resources for Dane County, says it is time for farmers to step up to the plate.\""We are trying to strengthen the livestock industry so it can continue to survive in the county, while we protect water quality,"" he said. ""To go to the next step, we need to get a little more commitment from the farmers.""\The dairy barns and milking parlor on the Crave Brothers Farm have slotted floors that sit atop manure channels; with the help of gravity, the manure flows through the channels to a 30,000-gallon collection tank.\From there is it pumped into the digester, where the heated manure is circulated by mixers and ""cooks"" for 30 days, decomposing and releasing biogas, primarily methane, which collects at the top of the tank. The biogas is then pumped to an engine that burns it as fuel, turning a generator that produces power for the digester system, and provides excess power that Clear Horizons sells to We Energies.\The process also produces a more environmentally friendly form of liquid manure that can be used as fertilizer.\Stored in a lagoon until it can be spread on fields, the liquid manure is more accessible to plants than solid manure and adheres more tightly to soil. Waste whey from the Craves' cheesemaking business is also disposed of by mixing it with manure that goes into the digester.\The energy created by the digester heats the farm office and maintenance shop, as well as the digester itself and its control room, pump room, separation room and generator room.\The fibrous byproduct of the digestion process is composted into a substance resembling soil. The Craves buy about half of it for bedding from Clear Horizons, which puts the rest into its Energro Potting Mix.\The system is automated and can be monitored via the Internet from elsewhere. If an engine or pump stops, the problem can generally be corrected by computer, though sometimes a person has to clear an obstruction in the pump or fix something else.\This is the first digester that Clear Horizons has installed and it is profitable. At this point it's doing ""a little better than break-even,"" said Nemke, although the economics are expected to continue to improve as technology develops and energy costs rise.\""We spent the last year and a half learning and improving the operation to make sure what we could expect,"" Nemke said. ""Now we are starting to market the system and would like to build more.""\The company is also doubling the size of the operation on the Crave farm by building a second digester and a larger generator.\""It cost us about $2 million to build the first phase, and the second phase will cost slightly less,"" Nemke said. ""We are looking at an eight to 10-year payback.""\Charles Crave is a satisfied customer.\""We have a good bedding source for cattle as well as reduced odor and a better fertilizer product to apply to the field,"" Crave said. ""We think this is the right thing to do and the right direction for our business.""\aweier@madison.com"
142,"Since Republicans took control of the Senate in January, their actions on climate change have ranged from oblivious to laughable to reckless. Here's a first-quarter recap:\Jan. 21: During a debate on the Keystone XL pipeline, the Senate voted on an amendment stating that the climate is changing and that humans are significantly responsible. Forty-nine Republicans opposed the amendment; only five -- Lamar Alexander of Tennessee,Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois -- voted in favor. In other words, more than 90 percent of the Republican caucus rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus. So much for the ""sense"" of the Senate.\Feb. 26: Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of -- yes -- the Environment and Public Works Committee, carried a lumpy snowball on to the Senate floor. Inhofe, author of ""The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future,"" apparently regarded the presence of snow in Washington in February as evidence that the globe isn't warming. ""Do you know what this is?"" he asked. ""It's a snowball just from outside here. So it's very, very cold out. Very unseasonable."" Never mind that 2014 was the hottest year worldwide since modern record-keeping began, and the eastern U.S. has been an island of cool in a sea of global warmth.\March 3: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urged states to defy the Obama administration's flexible plan to curb carbon pollution from existing power plants, the nation's leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Hold back on the costly process of complying,"" he advised in an op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader. McConnell, playing to his state's large coal industry, followed up with a detailed letter to every governor. The Senate leader howls when he thinks the Obama administration is going beyond the law, as in changing immigration regulations unilaterally, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with heedlessly counseling states to break the rules.\In contrast to the Senate GOP's embarrassing, head-in-the-sand approach to climate change, other prominent Republicans -- hardly environmental extremists but less attached to the fossil-fuel lobby -- are promoting useful ideas that could help the U.S. achieve the 26 percent to 28 percent emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2025 that the Obama administration pledged Tuesday.\Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary in the George W. Bush administration, calls global warming ""a crisis we can't afford to ignore,"" and his institute is funding research and advocating for faster action.\George Shultz, secretary of State during the Reagan administration and a pillar of the GOP establishment, is calling for ""significant and sustained support"" for energy research and development. Like Paulson, Shultz backs a revenue-neutral carbon tax that would level the playing field and prevent the atmosphere from being used as a free waste dump.\This plan would put the U.S. on a path toward lower emissions and provide American leadership going into this year's global climate talks. And what is the likelihood that this Senate will approve such a sensible, market-based policy?\Call it a snowball's chance.\-- USA TODAY"
143,"With the dramatic elimination of Osama bin Laden came an important psychological boost to the American people. There is a collective sense that there's nothing we cannot do if we set our minds to it.\Along with that boost came an important upswing in President Obama's approval ratings. At 51 percent approval rating in his 10th quarter as president, he is a full 7 percentage points ahead of Ronald Reagan's approval rating in his 10th quarter. With that upswing comes the responsibility to use his recharged political capital to tackle our greatest national (and international) threat -- climate change -- and to take advantage of this opportunity to fuel a new green economy.\Clearly feeling optimistic, President Obama made an important speech about our energy future. Clean energy, he said, will help us out-compete and out-innovate the rest of the world. ""Clean-energy jobs are the jobs of the future. I don't want other countries to win the competition for these technologies and jobs. I want America to win that competition. I want America to win the future.""\So do we. That's why the president needs to use his replenished political capital and increased approval ratings to push Congress for comprehensive climate and energy legislation that holds oil companies accountable and reduces our dependence on oil while protecting the environment.\We need a National Climate Act implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The president should propose a stringent carbon tax or an economy-wide cap-and-trade program with stringent timetables over several decades. If Congress again fails to act, then use the EPA's rulemaking authority that the Supreme Court verified in 2007. Inaction is not an option.\We must implement a comprehensive clean-energy plan for high-quality jobs, economic growth, cleaner air, water and food, and for the reduced dependence on foreign oil that will come as a result. The sooner we pass such legislation, the sooner we build a thriving green economy -- and have the jobs and economic growth that will come with that thriving green economy.\Just over a year ago we had one of the world's largest oil spills in a region that a few years before had been torn apart by a catastrophic hurricane. During this past year we have seen the resounding defeat of climate legislation; a major turnover in Congress; the rise and now dominance of China in what had been our solar market to lose; the rise in credibility of climate deniers; an increase in extraordinary weather events; multiple countries experiencing the hottest year on record; and an unthinkable nuclear accident caused by a tsunami. Take the Mississippi River's recent flooding and ravaging the residential areas around it; and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to Greenland coincided with a new report that revealed the ice cap is melting at devastatingly high levels -- much higher than earlier anticipated.\America is a ""can do"" nation with the persistence, tenacity and talent to succeed. It's time for the Administration and Congress to join the American people with the same kind of persistence, tenacity and talent to work to gain America's freedom from oil, regain our technological supremacy, and protect our natural resources.\Neither our economy nor our planet can afford any more delays.\About the authors:"
144,"The global spotlight on climate change this month put the topic of reducing greenhouse gas emissions briefly on the front burner, but cooled quickly after a temporary agreement was reached in Copenhagen.\Additional information\(Links will open in a new window)\* Special section: Read how climate change affects you and find other stories, Tweets and blogs on the subject.\* Special section: More stories and columns on the environment, plus a daily tip\It's an issue that's vital to a region like ours, which relies heavily on manufacturing. But letting it simmer for now may be a wise step. Here's why.\While the 193-nation summit produced an interim accord to reduce greenhouse gases (in addition to some cost-sharing mechanisms and attempts to ease possible impacts of climate change around the globe), it lacked the total buy-in needed to make it a legally binding action plan.\In this country, that type of buy-in and commitment is also missing from efforts to get an energy bill passed. The Senate had been preparing to take up its version of the bill in the spring, but already there is talk of postponement until after the mid-term elections next year. Some Senate Democrats -- nervous about possible fallout from their party's push for health-care reform and what it might cost them at the ballot box -- prefer to switch the agenda back to jobs and economy.\A more sound reason to delay a vote is that Democrats and Republicans are still far apart on the cap-and-trade issue, which is an integral part of both versions of the energy bill.\In June, the House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act by a slim margin. The bill would limit heat-trapping pollution from factories, refineries, power plants and other emitters and would allow them to trade pollution permits, or allowances, with each other. Over time the cap would tighten, driving up the price of emissions and theoretically pressuring major polluters to seek cleaner alternatives to energy. The bill passed 219-212 with 44 Democrats opposing it.\Getting a similar bill to pass in the Senate, where political and regional divisions cut even deeper, would prove challenging.\Just two weeks ago, the global climate change talks gave an opening for Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to try to link the Senate bill to the international stage. Kerry is one of the architects of the Senate climate legislation, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. But even Kerry was vague about what Americans could expect from the bill.\""I can't tell you the method or the means or amount by which we might price carbon,"" Kerry told The New York Times. ""We haven't resolved that issue yet. Some people want a carbon tax. Some want a trading mechanism. Some believe in an arbitrary set of reduction targets and let the economy work its way through it. There are several different proposals floating around.""\That's all the more reason for Kerry's bi-partisan group to take time to find the right proposal.\If the December climate-change negotiations in Copenhagen taught us anything, it's that common ground -- how ever narrow -- must be reached on key targets before a workable solution can be hammered out.\Our View\Issue: Climate change"
145,"On Tuesday, Jan. 12, the Fitchburg City Council will make a once-in-a-century decision: Shall it borrow against future energy savings to install geothermal heating and cooling in its new library building?\The building is otherwise designed for a 100-year service life. The decision must be made now, however, whether to install a 20th or 21st century heating and cooling plant. The conventional system burns natural gas for heating and uses electricity to power air conditioning, while the geothermal system uses electric heat pump technology to cool the building (and warm the earth under the parking lot) in the summer and warm the building with the heat stored underground in the winter. Both systems use electricity for moving air and controlling dampers. Unfortunately, the two systems require different building designs.\Unlike the solar panels planned for future installation on the roof, geothermal heating and cooling cannot be added later at a reasonable price - the retrofit would be triple the cost of new construction. Natural gas is appealingly cheap this winter, but the price fluctuates from year to year. Electricity, on the other hand, is only going to become more expensive as worldwide climate protection efforts such as cap-and-trade or a carbon tax kick in.\The geothermal system would add about a half million dollars to the cost of the building, an investment that can be recovered in energy savings in 20-25 years. For the remaining life of the building, energy savings in the range of $100,000 a year (at current rates) would accrue to taxpayers.\The savings would become even more significant if, as expected, a future investment is made in solar panels. Delaying solar panels makes sense. Photovoltaic panels are becoming more cost effective each year because of better technology and economies of scale, and the cost to retrofit is slight.\Some members of the City Council are concerned that by installing a geothermal system, they would be breaking a promise not to spend more than $10 million on the library building. This oversimplifies a complex issue. The library referendum authorized bonding for the building, but did not tie the council's hands to do the right thing for taxpayers and for the environment. The city should finance the geothermal system separately and internally, repaying its fund balance with energy savings.\In addition to reducing the cost for the building over its life, Fitchburg has committed to do its part to protect our climate from changes that could lead to untold damage to coastal cities, agriculture, and natural ecosystems. Using small amounts of electricity, which can be generated from the sun or wind, rather than fossil natural gas for heating and cooling is part of that commitment.\City leaders should take the long-term view on decisions of this type. Unlike a private developer, we know the city will still own and operate this building as a library 25 and 100 years from now, so we are sure to capture the future savings. The fiscally responsible position is to find a way to finance the geothermal system now, for decades of future savings. Isn't it nice when that's also the environmentally responsible thing to do?\Steve Arnold is a Fitchburg alderman.\Posted in Column on Monday, January 11, 2010 1:00 pm Updated: 1:10 pm\Credit: Steve Arnold Fitchburg alderman"
146,"The savvy team at Mother Jones magazine - the highly regarded print and online investigative reporting enterprise - provides many public services. But we were especially struck with their recent rundown on the stances on climate change adopted by the various and sundry prospects for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. The levels of disengagement and denial are, we think, well summed up by the ratings of the 13 prospects as ""(1) Flat-Earthers, who deny the existence of man-made climate change; (2) Born-Again Flat-Earthers, who do the same, but who had admitted climate change exists back before President Obama took office; (3) Do-Nothings, who sort of admit the reality of climate change but oppose actually taking any steps to prevent it; and (4) Dodgers, who have avoided saying whether they believe climate change is happening, and who also don't want to take any steps to alleviate it.""\Readers should check out the full review at: www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/08/ meet-climate-deniers-whowantbe-president. Of special interest for Wisconsinites are the examinations of Gov. Scott Walker and Congressman Paul Ryan, both of whom give every indication of a feverish determination to mount 2016 candidacies.\In the meantime, however, Walker and Ryan are on the ballot in Wisconsin in 2014. They are seeking re-election in races with Democrats who have taken far more enlightened stances on environmental issues: Mary Burke in the race for governor and Rob Zerban in the race for the 1st District seat, representing southeast Wisconsin in the U.S. House.\We think that the conclusions reached by the Mother Jones analysis are instructive for voters.\The magazine rates Walker as a ""Dodger,"" noting that the governor is ""a favorite of the Koch brothers"" and ""notoriously kissed ass during a call with a prankster pretending to be David Koch.""\""The oil oligarchs like him because he opposes governmental regulations, except for when the regulation stymies clean energy,"" observes Mother Jones writer Ben Adler. ""Walker imposed regulations to keep wind turbines further away from homes and signed a pledge never to pass a carbon tax. He has also raised money for the Heartland Institute, an organization that spreads climate misinformation. But he's never actually said whether he accepts climate science.""\Ryan gets an even worse review. Rated as a ""Flat-Earther,"" the congressman is eviscerated by Mother Jones in an assessment that notes, ""Climate change can be a tough issue for someone who wants to present himself as a wonk, as Ryan so very badly does. To just ignore the science is to risk looking dumb. So, for Ryan, opposition to climate regulation is more about his intense opposition to economic regulation more generally. He constantly asserts that climate regulations, for example, would impose an enormous cost on our economy.""\When Ryan does reference the overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change, however, Mother Jones notes that ""he tries to cast doubt on it, using a combination of phony concern for scientific accuracy and an even phonier regular-Midwestern-guy shtick."" Specifically, the magazine says, the congressman suggests that ""climate change should be a low priority for Wisconsinites because it snows in their state in the winter, writing on one point: 'Unilateral economic restraint in the name of fighting global warming has been a tough sell in our communities, where much of the state is buried under snow.' "" Voters will bring many considerations to the ballot box this fall. Among them should be an awareness of which candidates are serious about climate change and broader environmental issues, and of which are ""Dodgers"" and ""Flat-Earthers.""\Credit: Cap Times editorial"

State regulators approved plans on Friday for We Energies to install new pollution controls at an aging coal-fired power plant in Oak Creek, rejecting calls by environmental and consumer groups to close some or all of the units.
\
The Public Service Commission voted 3-0 to authorize the Milwaukee-based utility to spend $830 million for the equipment -- an expense that will be borne by customers.
\
The utility said it had not yet calculated how the upgrades will affect future rates.
\
Since 2004, when We Energies began to collect funds to build new power plants, the annual electric bill of a typical residential customer has increased 28% to $1,028.
\
The utility is expected to begin work in July installing desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction technology to reduce sulfur dioxide by 80% to 90% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 60% to 70%.
\
Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain and haze, and nitrogen oxides are a key component in ozone pollution.
\
The upgrades will also help We Energies control mercury pollution. The Natural Resources Board voted on Wednesday to cut mercury emissions by 90% as soon as 2015, although the utility is expected to exercise an option that will allow it to delay cuts in mercury.
\
We Energies said it needed the controls to satisfy federal clean air regulations and meet a 2012 deadline of a consent decree in federal court settling charges the company violated air regulations.
\
The four units at the plant generate 1,135 megawatts, or 20% of the utility's electric output.
\
The oldest unit was built in 1959; the newest in 1967.
\
Opponents of the project, such as Madison-based Clean Wisconsin, said improvements in energy efficiency and renewable energy, and moderating electric demand, meant the units were no longer needed.
\
As commissioners sorted through the myriad issues of the case, they agreed that the biggest factor working in We Energies' favor is that the four units are the most efficient coal plants in the state.
\
""It makes no sense to retire any of these when they have a higher efficiency over all coal-fired boilers in the state,"" said Eric Callisto, chairman of the commission.
\
He said installing the controls will provide the utility a bridge to the next generation of power plants that produce less carbon dioxide.
\
Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning coal, is a leading contributor to carbon emissions in the atmosphere.
\
Commissioners said their decision had been complicated by the expectation that restrictions will one day be placed on coal-burning utilities to fight global warming.
\
A carbon tax would make electricity produced at a coal plant more expensive and change the valuations of utility assets.
\
Barry McNulty, a spokesman for We Energies, said the company needed to review the final order, but for now it looked favorably on the decision.
\
Katie Nekola, energy program director for Clean Wisconsin, said the commission needs to set up a schedule to shutter older, inefficient coal plants in the state.
\
""Every day they keep operating, they keep pumping more greenhouse gases into the environment,"" Nekola said.

He has assembled an international coalition of 28 investors who have committed about $2 billion for research and development to combat global warming. \In addition, Gates is urging nations to double their spending on study of low- or no-carbon energy. The leaders of 20 nations, including America, have agreed to participate in the program called Mission Innovation. \""We need an energy miracle,"" Gates said. \He's right. And agreement in Washington on the need to encourage innovation may be closer than it seems. \Republican candidates for president have mostly dismissed the climate challenge in trying to appeal to a narrow group of GOP primary voters who reject mainstream climate science. Congress last week also resisted President Obama's push for a 30 percent reduction by 2030 in carbon emissions at power plants. \Here in Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker and Attorney General Brad Schimel are fighting in court to slow the effort, claiming it's too expensive. They're doing so even though the federal Environmental Protection Agency would put Wisconsin in charge of how it would meet its goals. \Nonetheless, consensus toward action is growing. GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush, for example, says he's concerned about the climate and wants an international agreement to lower emissions. \Moreover, when it comes to investing in research, support is strong. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, rejected a carbon tax during a meeting with the State Journal editorial board this year. Yet he sounded supportive of greater investment in science. \""Why don't we put money into basic research so we can research our way to better, cleaner energy'"" he said. \""This is Madison, Wisconsin. We're good at researching stuff."" \Unfortunately, the House hasn't made a major commitment to up America's game - at least not yet. We hope that changes soon. \Ryan also could help the public better understand its choices by asking the Congressional Budget Office to analyze a fee-and-rebate proposal for carbon, in which carbon is taxed but the revenue goes directly to the American people, rather than the government. That would help spur private-sector innovation. \Surviving on Earth is much easier than making it on Hollywood's Mars. Together, the world needs to science its way to a more stable climate - and do so with greater urgency. America should lead the way.\Credit: Wisconsin State Journal editorial"
152,"This is going to be a column that praises President Barack Obama's new charm offensive with congressional Republicans and suggests some useful background reading for the next get-together. First, though, I've got to get a bit of snark out of the way.\Such as: Isn't this the same Obama who decreed that playing nice with Washington wasn't working, so he'd be taking his case straight to The People? It's a false choice between the two approaches, but this tactical switcheroo is rather dizzying.\And, excuse me, if the White House thinks it's worth the try, couldn't Obama have attempted this a few months ago, before the sequester kicked in?\Still, let's look ahead. It's hard to imagine a breakthrough without intensive presidential involvement, which makes the new outreach so welcome. I know Republican senators, prospective members of Obama's common-sense caucus, who have waited in vain over the last few years for a call from the White House chief of staff, no less the president himself.\Meanwhile, there are a few incipient signs of thaw on the Republican side, indications that Obama's mealtime diplomacy may not be futile. Specifically, several Republican senators -- Arizona's John McCain, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte -- have dared to say that they would -- gasp! -- consider raising revenue.\The senators attach two caveats: Revenue must come through fundamental tax reform (getting rid of loopholes, not raising rates) and be accompanied by reining in entitlement spending.\In theory, both sides agree on these approaches. In practice, the entitlement debate in particular has become mired in unnecessary partisan line-drawing. One side deems as essential proposals that the other has declared anathema.\Two prime examples: turning Medicare into a premium support (scary version, ""voucher"") program, and raising the Medicare eligibility age. Endlessly arguing over those is not likely to accomplish anything in the current environment.\Hence this suggested reading: a new report from the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project, ""15 Ways to Rethink the Federal Budget."" Granted, the Hamilton Project is associated with Democratic policymakers, albeit centrist ones such as its co-founder, Robert Rubin; its animating vision of government is not the same as, say, Paul Ryan's. So proposals such as a carbon tax or value-added tax, however sensible, aren't likely to fly in the current climate.\But the Hamilton report contains several ideas that even Ryan could love -- or, at the very least, that the House Budget Committee chairman shouldn't reject out of hand.\For example, where Ryan proposes giving Medicare beneficiaries a set amount with which to obtain insurance, Michael Chernew of Harvard Medical School and Dana Goldman of the University of Southern California propose giving Medicare providers a set amount to cover beneficiaries.\This ""global payment"" would replace the perverse incentives of the current fee-for-service system -- to bill for as many procedures and services as possible -- with a spur toward efficient, comprehensive care.\This approach exists currently, in the form of the private Medicare Advantage programs that serve about a quarter of beneficiaries (and that, notably, have been a darling of Republicans) and in Accountable Care Organizations being established under Obamacare. Estimated savings: $100 billion over 10 years.\Another idea, from MIT's Jonathan Gruber, would attack Medicare costs from the consumer side. It would deal with the current risk of catastrophic costs by adding an out-of-pocket maximum tied to beneficiaries' incomes so that poorer seniors would face less risk.\But it would also heavily tax seniors' supplemental insurance plans that fail to impose adequate cost-sharing on beneficiaries. Again, this proposal could appeal to both sides: The Obama administration has suggested limiting Medigap policies, and the Ryan approach is all about giving consumers incentive to control costs. Estimated savings: $125 billion over 10 years.\On the tax side, Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute proposes replacing the home mortgage interest deduction with a tax credit worth 15 percent of annual interest on the first $300,000 of a mortgage -- spreading the tax benefits of homeownership more fairly and avoiding subsidizing ever-bigger homes. Estimated savings: $300 billion over 10 years.\Karen Dynan of Brookings proposes changing tax incentives to encourage low- and moderate-income households to save more for retirement and education, while reducing the subsidies for wealthier taxpayers. Estimated savings: $40 billion over 10 years.\The two sides are talking. That's good. Before the next meal, they might take a look at the Hamilton report. It could help the conversation move beyond ""no new taxes"" and ""please pass the salt.""\-- Ruth Marcus: ruthmarcus@\washpost.com"
153,"Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin says a cap-and-trade system - which would limit total greenhouse gas emissions but allow energy users to buy and sell the right to spew out heat-trapping gases - will be the cornerstone of U.S. efforts to halt global warming.\Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says that cap-and-trade is more dangerous than climate change itself.\These two Wisconsin members of the U.S. Congress presented their widely varying views during separate speeches at the Future of Midwest Energy: Coping With Climate Change Conference presented by Wispolitics.com at Monona Terrace on Monday.\Some others at the conference favored a carbon tax or price that would lead to a meaningful reduction in the use of fossil fuels. Some favored more nuclear plants. But most panelists stressed that quick action by Congress is essential.\Aging power plants could be replaced with cleaner, more efficient models, but owners hesitate to spend millions of dollars without knowing federal policy, said Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member Philip Moeller. ""The uncertainty has to be addressed,"" he said.\""We all know that global warming is real and that it's an issue we should take seriously, but we should also approach global warming wisely,"" Sensenbrenner said.\""In Congress, there is clamoring for a legislative solution and some members think they've found one in a cap-and-trade solution.

Companies that are able to keep their emissions under their allocation could sell their savings, or credits, to companies that could not.\The total cap would be reduced over the years to reduce the greenhouse gases that trap heat near the Earth.\The result, according to Sensenbrenner, would be soaring electricity costs and the loss of jobs to China and India or other countries that do not reduce emissions.\""We cannot use the actions - or inactions - of developing nations as an excuse for our behavior,"" Baldwin said, adding that Congress is moving toward cap-and-trade. She also promised that a climate control law will include a provision to encourage developing countries to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\""What is clear is that we are laying the groundwork for the 111th session and our 44th president whom, I believe, will lead the nation toward solutions that reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.\""Whether Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain or even Mike Huckabee is president, with a Democratic Congress climate change will be acknowledged and confronted with mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions.""\Sensenbrenner alleged that cap-and-trade has not reduced carbon emissions in Europe because carbon credits are often awarded there based on emissions reductions in other parts of the world, sometimes for projects that would have occurred anyway.\""Many European nations are simply outsourcing their greenhouse gas reductions to other nations,"" he said. ""The U.K. estimates that two-thirds of its future emission reductions will occur not just outside of the U.K. but outside of the European Union.""\Sensenbrenner contends that the solution to climate change lies in technology, and that the United States should devote its efforts to research and development of technological solutions.\""Significant greenhouse gas reductions will occur only when the technology is readily available and relatively inexpensive,"" he said. ""That includes renewable technologies like wind and solar power. But that should also include proven greenhouse gas-reducing technologies like nuclear power, which supplies about 20 percent of Wisconsin's electricity.""\Baldwin said that extending tax credits and investment tax credits for renewable energy sources is essential, as is reducing subsidies for the oil industry.\She added that state and regional efforts - including those in Wisconsin led by Gov. Jim Doyle that have set timetables for increasing the use of renewable energy - are leading the way toward control of greenhouse gases.\""Our state government, municipalities and schools are taking meaningful steps,"" she said. ""Gaylord Nelson would have been proud. He knew it would be the people, not the politicians, who put the environment on stage.""\aweier@madison.com"
154,"The New York Times' Tom Friedman has been railing for years that we Americans need to stop fighting efforts to wean ourselves from fossil fuels or we'll wind up as a second-rate economic power.\The author of ""The World Is Flat"" and ""Hot, Flat and Crowded"" believes that the economic powers of the future will be the countries that embrace new, green energy and the industries needed to support it.\Instead, every time someone suggests a carbon tax or new incentives to convince businesses to begin shifting to new energy sources, the country practically recoils into the fetal position.\Citing the incredible investment China is making in everything from wind to solar energy, Friedman recently wrote: ""We are either going to put in place a price on carbon and the right regulatory incentives to ensure that America is China's main competitor/partner in the E.T. (Energy Technology) revolution, or we are going to gradually cede this industry to Beijing and the good jobs and energy security that would go with it.""\When we import less oil and invent and export more clean-tech products, Friedman argues, we will send fewer dollars overseas to buy oil and, ""most importantly, diminish the dollars that are sustaining the worst petro-dictators in the world who indirectly fund terrorists and the schools that nurture them.""\The magazine Audubon recently carried a story that demonstrates Friedman's points.\Newton, Iowa, population about 15,000, was the historic headquarters of the iconic washing machine company, Maytag. When it was sold a few years back to Whirlpool, Newton lost a company that once employed as many as 4,000 people. The loss of the remaining 1,800 jobs was a devastating blow to the area's economy just before the Great Recession came along to inflict more pain.\Newton and the state of Iowa didn't give up, however. Realizing that relatively flat Iowa is a good place for wind power, they began pursuing companies that produce components for wind turbines.\The city eventually landed a company called TPI Composites, which is a pioneer in producing blades for the turbines. They took over part of the Maytag factory and hired 400 local people to manufacture the fiberglass-and-resin blades, some as tall as a 15-story building. The company is currently humming along.\As the Audubon article pointed out, ""A slew of new research shows that environment-minded strategies really do produce jobs - and that staying the fossil fuel course could eventually bankrupt us."" That's what Friedman has been preaching.\""China, of course, understands that, which is why it is investing heavily in clean-tech, efficiency and high-speed rail. It sees the future trends and is betting on them,"" he wrote the other day.\But so much of what he and others say is falling on deaf ears as we continue to plod along as if nothing in the world has changed.\Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com Posted in Dave_zweifel on Monday, March 29, 2010 4:55 am Updated: 12:08 pm\Credit: Dave Zweifel"
155,"Make balanced cuts at UW Colleges\As a teacher for 48 years in the University of Wisconsin Colleges, I find the recent article in the State Journal about trimming ""administrators"" distressing. \Slated for trimming are counselors who work face to face with students every day, helping them to cope with learning disabilities, financial aid regulations, scheduling problems and a host of practical difficulties that threaten their academic progress. Also slated for trimming are librarians who now help students navigate the mazes of academic information in the digital age. \On-campus access to the services these professionals provide is critical to the success of many of our students. If the colleges are to fulfill their mission, this access must be maintained, even at the expense of reductions in classroom instruction. \Given the state's budgetary crisis, some trimming must be made in the colleges, but the cuts should be balanced between instructional staff and support staff to preserve the effective, comprehensive personal attention to students which has characterized the colleges since they became an institution in 1964. \- David W. Cole, professor of English, emeritus, University of Wisconsin Colleges, Baraboo \Find alternatives to bigger prisons \The Legislature's Joint Finance Committee accepted the Department of Corrections' request for an additional $5 million to increase the prison population by about 500 people over 2 years. \The $5 million that was suddenly available is money that is desperately needed for our schools, universities and transitional jobs. It is needed for treatment alternatives and diversions. \Proven, safe ways to reduce the prison population exist. The administration can take measures to fix the broken parole system that is keeping hundreds of people in prison longer that the sentencing judge ever envisioned. The administration can also increase efforts to provide alternatives to revocation for people on supervision who have not committed a new crime. \The DOC has not said why it assumes an increase in the inmate population. The proposal to Joint Finance was made with no prior discussion. Any proposal for prison expansion should at least be subject to public scrutiny. \- Judith Gregor, Baraboo \Work to save the bee population \Having recently read an article on the further decline of honey bees, perhaps modern day man and the U.S. Department of Agriculture should be more active and aggressive in saving our bee population from extinction - and the survival of mankind. \Charles Darwin pointed out in 1859 that some important plant species would face extinction if the bumble bee were to disappear. \Rowan Jacobson's book ""Fruitless Fall"" looks into why 30 billion honeybees, representing a quarter of the bees in the Northern Hemisphere, mysteriously vanished by the spring of 2007. \The author paints a sad picture of the colony collapse disorder outcome and what will become of our world if the bee population continues to dwindle. \- Donna Wasley, Madison \Support world leaders on climate change \Global warming is real. Note the impact of weather around the world. More broadly, note that global warming is part of total climate change and, on a broader scale, environmental change. \To gain knowledge of how environmental change is impacting world resources, read Naomi Klein's book ""This Changes Everything."" Klein's book is eye opening when considering what we are doing, beyond global warming, to the availability and quality of the world's resources, including air, vegetation, water, fish, forests, minerals, terrain, animals and the space we live in. \Further improvements in building structures, agricultural and manufacturing processes, health care, transportation, logistics and information systems, are needed to conserve resources. \More must be done to aggressively conserve Earth's resources. You can help by supporting world leaders, such as Pope Francis and President Obama, plus organizations working to sustain life. \- Edward J. Marien, Lodi \Rent governor's mansion to Kochs \Regarding the story that the state may lease buildings elsewhere, I enthusiastically support this idea. Let's start with the governor's mansion in Maple Bluff. \I understand rents are reasonable in the Rhinelander area. So we could rent out the mansion in Maple Bluff to the Koch brothers. They're sure to want to use the vacant property when they visit their state. And we could reduce taxes if we lease the Capitol building to them for gala fundraisers for Gov. Scott Walker. \I say, let's get Wisconsin moving again. \- Steven Spiro, Madison \Global warming will affect the unborn \Thanks to the State Journal for its always timely coverage of the development of the next Wisconsin budget. Since many actions are taking place fast and furious, I am left to conclude that no action will be taken to reduce greenhouse gases, much less adapt to human-caused climate change. \The increased rate of warming should be of great concern to our young people and the unborn, whom Gov. Scott Walker cites as being of particular concern to him. He and the few others who are still in the dark ages on climate change should read the article in Monday's State Journal on Pope Francis' much anticipated teaching document on the environment and climate change. \Wisconsin should be rewarding residents who pollute the least. If the state has to institute a carbon tax to help pay for such positive incentives, then it should. \Raising the speed limit on its highways is the wrong direction, since going 70 mph on the highways burns more gasoline (a fossil fuel) than driving a car at 65 mph. \- Michael Neuman, Madison"
156,"Carbon fee can spur creativity\Thanks for continuing the dialogue looking for solutions to our climate problem. Merrill Matthews' column last Sunday, ""Carbon tax will slow growth, not emissions,"" highlights several issues facing those of us trying to address this.\Among these are the inelasticity of demand for fossil fuels, the inability of today's alternative energy sources to satisfy our thirst, and the failure of experiments conducted to date to correct fossil fuel market inadequacies. Recognizing these challenges is the first step in overcoming them.\Matthews identifies the source of fossil energy inelasticity to be a lack of alternatives. Raising the price of fossil fuels by using a carbon fee catalyzes the development of alternatives already on the drawing boards in major universities (including UW-Madison) and industry. No carbon fee implemented to date has been allowed to grow sufficiently large to create economic incentive for these alternatives to bloom.\Carbon fees implemented with a corresponding dividend to taxpayers and households are expected to result in modest growth in both income and jobs. The evidence from experiments to date in Canada, Europe, South Africa and Japan confirm this projection.\The world's energy and economic future will be much brighter if we create an environment that fosters creativity.\Doug Edwards, Madison\Chief Koval has earned our support\Regarding Thursday's letter to the editor ""Chief deserves legal defense fund,"" I believe the City Council will soon approve reimbursement of Madison Police Chief Mike Koval's legal expenses. but if I'm wrong, I will be among contributors to such a worthwhile endeavor.\Having been a Madison resident since 1951, I've seen the impact of Madison Police Department chiefs on law enforcement practices and witnessed how they put their professional philosophies to work. A few have been good for our city. A couple have been not as good. Chief Koval has been excellent in going forward with the direction put forth by former Chief David Couper and former Chief Nobel Wray.\Chief Koval's administrative direction maximizing staff resources and capabilities has been outstanding.\I believe the Madison Police Department is among the top in our nation. He and the department staff deserve massive commendation, not a modicum of vilification.\Paul H. Kusuda, Madison\New convention is a very bad idea\What makes Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, think they are smarter than James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton or any of the other men who wrote our original Constitution'\I get they want to grab as much political power as they can, but holding a new constitutional convention is a very, very bad idea.\Patricia M. Giesfeldt, Cottage Grove\GOP should let schools raise funds\Wisconsin's K-12 students continue to perform well in the classroom despite a less than education-friendly governor and GOP-controlled Legislature. Wisconsin students consistently rank in the top three nationally for ACT test scores and have one of the lowest dropout rates in the nation.\These achievements are encouraging when you consider Gov. Scott Walker and the Legislature have cut more than $1 billion in state funding for public education in recent budgets. Gov. Walker's current budget proposal includes a $650 million increase in K-12 education funding which, if approved, restores less than 67 percent of education funding he previously stripped out.\This funding deficit has forced many school districts to turn to local referendums to properly fund their public schools.\But the ""know it all"" GOP Legislature, led by Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, has proposed legislation that would make it more difficult for districts to hold a referendum and threatens to cut state educational funds to districts utilizing referendums. Sen. Stroebel said, ""State aid we provide will now be disbursed to other districts that are not doing referenda.""\Sen. Stroebel should get out of the way of responsible Wisconsinites who value their kids' and grandkids' education over conservative ideology.\Bob Vetter, Madison\Work to end solitary confinement\Thanks for publishing the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism's report ""Solitary inmates report despair"" on solitary confinement in Wisconsin adult prisons.\This substantial piece of journalism made for sobering reading on Easter Sunday, but it's essential for all of us to confront the facts about the kinds of torture that our state routinely inflicts on mentally ill prisoners in our names and with our tax money.\As the story makes clear, solitary confinement doesn't actually serve the purpose of ""correcting"" the prisoners' behavior - in fact, it seems to exacerbate whatever tendencies they already have toward anger and violence. It also costs even more than keeping them in ordinary prison cells.\Many other states are taking major steps to eliminate this practice, but Wisconsin lags far behind.\I hope many of your readers will be moved to protest Wisconsin's continued reliance on solitary confinement by writing to the governor and the Legislature, and perhaps joining a prison-reform advocacy group such as Madison Organizing in Strength, Equality and Solidarity (MOSES) or another local affiliate of the statewide religious social justice organization, WISDOM.\Sherry Reames, Madison"
157,"Social programs rely on capitalism \In Thursday's letter to the editor ""We already enjoy benefits of
socialism,"" the writer highlights the benefits of socialism ranging
from public education and an interstate highway system to fire and
police protection and clean water. \We all enjoy these benefits, and our taxes pay for them along with
the Medicare and Social Security safety nets. What the writer and
democratic socialists fail to mention is that without a capitalist
economy providing the fuel, the socialist car will run out of gas,
and we'll be taxed until our ears bleed to pay for our equal share
of goods and services. \ Tragically, socialism also eliminates individualism and consumer
choice, which will convert America from the ""shining city on a
hill"" to a dystopia with citizens trudging endlessly in a hopeless
search for basic necessities. \ Capitalism isn't the enemy. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Black Earth,

Johnson's defense of Trump is weak \ In the Jan. 23 article ""After one day, Johnson's heard enough,""
U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, makes three bogus claims. \
For starters, he says the House should have heard from key
witnesses Senate Democrats now want to call. He doesn't mention
that the White House ordered the witnesses to ignore lawful
subpoenas. \ Sen. Johnson then states that the current impeachment is ""pretty
thin gruel."" Well, the evidence is overwhelming. President Donald
Trump tried to extort a phony investigation from Ukraine in
exchange for military aid. Extortion is not a laughing matter. \ Furthermore, Sen. Johnson says that impeachment ""implies there has
to be some kind of crime based on current law."" \ First, it is a bad reading of the Constitution, because the Framers
could have no idea what modern law would be. Second, abuse of
presidential power may not be unlawful, but it is impeachable. And
third, crimes were indeed committed. It is unlawful to solicit
foreign intervention in our elections. It is unlawful to withhold
congressionally designated military aid, and it's contrary to
international law to shake down another head of state. \ Henry Teloh, Madison\
Sanders' backers should still vote \ The Jan. 21 letter to the editor ""Sanders must be the 2020 nominee""
warned that if Bernie Sanders is not the Democratic nominee for

years."" \ The result, according to the letter writer, will ensure ""our
inexorable slide toward political and environmental breakdown."" I
offer that if Sanders supporters fail to show up and vote in
November that ""inexorable slide"" is on their heads. \ I agree that the reelection of Donald Trump in November would bode
ill for the environment, along with access to health care, respect
for and trust in the United States around the world, racial and
religious tolerance, and Americans' trust in their own public
institutions. The suggestion that millions will boycott the
election, thereby refusing to participate in their own governance
through the electoral process, is a likely guarantee of both those
policy outcomes and that ""political breakdown."" \ A third-grader may take the ball and go home if the third-grader

an adult is something I find no less juvenile, and troubling in the
extreme. \ Dennis Anderson, Madison \
We can help fix climate change \ In response to the Jan. 16 letter to the editor ""Earth's climate is
always changing,"" it is naive to insist that we as individuals
can't do anything to help mitigate climate change. \ The letter implies climate change is not caused by human
activities, when the unprecedented warming of the globe is
definitely driven by human activities - and bad things will happen
if we don't stop it. An overwhelming amount of scientific evidence
supports this point. \ And while as individuals we can't fix the entire world (climate
change is largely driven by corporate interests), we can do many
things that make a small impact: \* Switch to a lower or zero-emission vehicle (or use public
transit). \ * Eat less meat. \ * Take fewer trips. \ * Plant
trees. \ * Buy carbon offsets. \ * Buy green power from Madison Gas
and Electric Co. \ * Lobby your elected officials to pass
legislation (for example, a carbon tax). \ * Vote with your dollars
to encourage retailers to adopt more Earth-friendly policies and
products. \ Panic is not a useful response. Believing you can change things is. \ Emily Lupton-Metrish, Madison \Our economy is ruining the future \ How much are your kids, grandchildren and great-grandchildren worth
to you? How can you possibly judge their value in relation to how
well your investments are doing? It's time for all Americans to be
asking themselves that question. \ Between now and the November election, we are going to be bombarded
with all the blustering claims about how great our economy is. The
stock market is at all-time highs, 401Ks are doing great, and
unemployment is low. But the important statistic is not found in
those figures. What matters is this basic question: at what cost? \ We are adding trillions of dollars of debt for now and for the
foreseeable future. Our planet may be unfit for our descendants to
drink the water, breathe the air or live a full life. Hate crimes
are rising. We are a country that has sold its soul in the name of
what? Jobs? Literally millions of jobs are waiting in the private
and public sector if we get serious about climate change. \ So how much are those kids worth to you? How can you possibly put a

158,"Good luck with goals incurrent political climate\While the goals you outline are admirable, they are unachievable with our current political situation. \* Jobs. Wisconsin is ranked 42 in creating jobs due to its failed jobs policy. Expect more anti-union legislation, and expect salaries and benefits to decline. \* Lower carbon emissions. Not with Gov. Scott Walker, who is aligned with the fossil fuel industry. Perhaps some local initiatives can be achieved, but don't expect state assistance. \* Fair political maps. Neither party has mustered the courage to make a change in the mapping process. The Republicans were so successful this time they don't have any incentive to make a change. \* Clean lakes. Look only at local options. The Republicans have demonstrated they have little interest in the environment. The mining bill could allow polluting Lake Superior and other waters, which is why it was defeated last session. This bill would change the process for all mine permits. \* Graduation rates. The conservative goal is to privatize public education. Graduation rates will decline under budget pressures and unreasonable guidelines from the state. \* Merit selection. The conservatives have benefited greatly from the ability to spend on elections, and this will continue. Neither justices Annette Ziegler nor Michael Gableman have the credentials to serve admirably on the Supreme Court.

The geometric boundaries of many are ridiculous to the extreme. Those boundaries need to be wiped clean. \Arguing about who should be delegated the responsibility for drawing up new boundaries is also ridiculous. A computer should do it. \Feed the computer the population numbers for our various cities, towns, villages and rural districts. Feed in the parameters, such as four-sided, no voter more than ""x"" miles from a polling place, no more than ""x"" number of voters per polling place and so on, and let the computer do its thing. \Our counties and towns do not have bizarre boundaries and neither should our voting districts. The practice of gerrymandering is obscene. It needs to end now. \- Ray Johnson, Evansville \Lowering carbon emissions a worthy goal on many levels \Thanks to the Wisconsin State Journal editorial board for including reducing carbon emissions in their six big goals for 2013. In a year when extreme weather threatened our farmers' livelihoods, Hurricane Sandy caused havoc on the East Coast and politicians refused to discuss climate change in their debates, it is a hopeful sign that the State Journal is committing to covering this issue. \On the national level, I encourage U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan to support a carbon fee and dividend to help level the playing field between fossil fuels and renewables. \On the state level, I urge Gov. Scott Walker and our state legislators to welcome renewable energy companies to Wisconsin to provide jobs, boost our economy and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. \And on an individual level, I encourage us all to lower our consumption of fossil fuels and advocate for laws that will protect our planet. \- Trudi Jenny, Madison \Goals, articles keep climate change in public eye \Thanks for including lowering carbon emissions as one of your ""Six big goals for new year."" And thanks for publishing articles like Saturday's ""Report: Warming changes everyday life."" \Climate change is the most important problem we face. We all need to lower our personal emissions, but we also need effective legislation. After last summer's heat wave, drought, wildfires and record low Arctic sea ice, it's obvious we need to act now for our own survival. \A promising proposal is a steadily-rising carbon tax which would lessen the use of fossil fuels and promote the use of clean, renewable energy. If all revenues were returned to consumers, it would soften the impact. \Thanks again for putting this on your agenda. Maybe if we all do what we can, we can mitigate the worst effects of climate change for our kids. \- Steve Lewis, Fitchburg \We have know-how to address emissions goal \The National Climate Assessment report published in Saturday's State Journal affirms the wisdom of adding the lowering of carbon emissions to the editorial board's 2013 agenda. \Our country cannot continue to ignore the economic, social and environmental damage of events such as this past summer's heat wave and drought and Super Storm Sandy, which will become increasingly common unless we act to significantly reduce fossil fuels use. \We have the technological know-how to power our society with minimal use of greenhouse gas-producing fuels. All that is lacking is the political will. \Ask your legislators to co-sponsor ""fee and dividend"" legislation that would gradually raise the cost of carbon-based fuels at the wellhead. Revenue raised from these fees would be returned to households and/or used to lower the deficit. As a result, alternative energy sources would become increasingly competitive and reduce the need for carbon-based fuels. \James Hansen, a leading climate scientist, recently stated that the need to address climate change has reached emergency status. We can have a significant impact if we act now to keep our country economically and environmentally vibrant. Future generations depend on us. \- Chuck Tennessen, Dodgeville \Long way to go to achieve area clean lakes goal \One of the goals in Sunday's editorial should be a priority for the city of Madison, and that's the clean lake issue. \Year after year sees research and limnological study going nowhere, and money flowing faster than the Yahara River itself. What are the results? We lower water levels, which makes many landings hard to use or unusable.

159,"About these columns\These columns, written by Custer-based Midwest Renewable Energy Association, compare and contrast each presidential candidate's proposals for renewal energy. The MREA promotes renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable living through education and demonstration.\Obama: Federal government should push for renewable sources\Over the past few years, we have seen energy take center stage as a national issue, and it has become a major topic in the presidential campaign. The two presidential candidates agree that global climate change is happening, but the debate centers on what should be done to address it. Below is an overview of some aspects of Democratic Sen. Barack Obama's energy plan:\Offshore drilling\Obama generally opposes opening additional U.S. waters to offshore oil drilling, but says he would consider it as part of a comprehensive energy plan.\What's missing? The offshore drilling issue is complex, with impacts on the economy and environment. It has the potential of releasing methane into the atmosphere, which is about 20 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Allowing additional drilling will not guarantee that oil companies will sell the oil in the U.S. markets, and it may only postpone dealing with peak oil.\Efficiency\Obama supports a 50 percent reduction in energy intensity by 2030. For transportation, he supports raising fuel-economy standards 4 percent, roughly one mile per gallon, each year, and proposes spending $4 billion to help U.S. automakers upgrade their plants to produce more efficient cars and trucks.\What's missing? There is not a detailed plan on how the U.S. would reach this goal of reduction in energy intensity. Energy efficiency in buildings, appliances, vehicles and utilities is the quickest and cheapest way to reduce global warming pollution. In your home, for example, for every dollar you spend on energy efficiency, you'll save three dollars on a renewable energy system.\Emission limits\The candidates agree in principle that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions should be pursued through a federal cap and trade system, but they differ on limits. Obama would require carbon dioxide emissions be cut by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. Polluters would pay for the right to emit greenhouse gases.\What questions remain? Because of the complexity of a cap and trade system, this may take years to implement, which is time the planet cannot afford. Some argue a cap and trade system will add to the volatility of energy prices, will not be as transparent as a federal program such as carbon tax, and according to an article in The Financial Times, may leave room for private market manipulation.\Alternative energy\Obama supports a federal renewable energy standard, which would mandate getting 25 percent of U.S. electricity from renewables by 2025. To help meet this mandate, Obama proposes investing $150 billion over 10 years in renewables, advanced biofuels, efficiency and other clean technology. He proposes federal tax incentives and other inducements to help develop advanced biofuels.\Other power sources\Obama supports ""clean coal"" technology. Obama would consider a ban on new, traditional dirty coal facilities. Obama said the U.S. should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix, but is concerned with safety, storage and the reliance on government subsidies.\What concerns remain? We need to evaluate the realistic options of increasing coal and nuclear power. Consider the impacts of extracting coal from the earth, and other pollutants (such as mercury) that are emitted into our air and water. There are contentions that if the U.S. decided to replace all fossil-fuel-generated electricity with nuclear, there would only be enough economically viable uranium to fuel reactors for only three to four years.\Bottom line\Many of these energy issues are complex, and have no simple solution. They cannot be understood through a 30-second sound bite, or even a 600-word column. We encourage you to research more about national, state and local energy policies, but also learn more about what you can do in your own home or business.\McCain: Supports boost in wind, solar, biomass energy\The presidential candidates -- Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) -- say a lot of the same things about energy and environmental policy. While their goals may sound similar, the candidates would pursue different paths to achieve them. Below is an overview of some aspects of McCain's energy plan:\McCain's policy puts a lot of options on the table, while he generally steers clear of federal incentives or mandates and favors a more market-based approach.\Emission limits\The candidates agree, in principle, that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions should be pursued through a federal cap and trade system, they differ on how much should be limited. McCain supports a cap-and-trade system to cut U.S. emissions 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. He would give away emission credits at the start of his plan, and would phase in auctions of credits.\What questions remain? Because of the complexity of a cap and trade system, this may take years to implement, and some argue creates a non-transparent private program that is not accountable to the public.\Offshore drilling\McCain wants to lift the current federal moratorium on offshore drilling and provide incentives to states permitting offshore exploration. He had opposed new offshore drilling up until June 2008. Both candidates are against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\What's missing? Lifting the federal ban on offshore drilling will bring its own economic and environmental issues. When drilling deep enough, it has the potential of releasing methane, which is about 20 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. It may not do enough to address peak oil. According to McCain on May 28: ""I also have to tell you that, with those resources which would take years to develop, it would only postpone, or temporarily relieve our dependence on fossil fuels.""\Alternative energy\McCain supports increasing the use of renewable energy such as wind, solar and biomass. He has shown reluctance to support mandates or tax incentives, and does not support a national renewable energy standard, which would require utilities to get a certain percentage of electricity from renewables. He supports efforts by state and local governments to create their own standards.\McCain proposes to eliminate mandates, subsidies and price supports for corn ethanol, which he contends prevents the development of market-based solutions.\What's missing? McCain supports renewable energy, but has not offered specific target. Without a detailed plan, or support for the industry, it may be difficult to move the technologies forward.\Efficiency\McCain has offered general support for energy efficiency. He said he would more effectively enforce existing fuel-economy standards. In 2007, McCain said the standards should be raised, but his plan does not offer specific targets.\What's missing? There isn't a detailed plan on how the U.S. would encourage energy efficiency and curb consumption. Energy efficiency is the quickest and cheapest way to reduce global warming pollution.\Other power sources\McCain wouldn't restrict new plants, but believes they should be able to use carbon capture and sequestration technology. He would spend $2 billion a year to help develop clean-coal technologies. McCain recently called for 45 nuclear reactors by 2030, and calls for government support for the nuclear industry.\What questions remain? Policy makers should take time to consider the front-end impacts of coal extraction, and the other pollutants coal plants emit. Nuclear, already heavily subsidized by the federal government, would need more support, and brings its own concerns of energy use, water use and safe storage.\Bottom line\With energy prices rising and a heightened concern about global warming, national policy makers (and the presidential candidates) are under pressure to take action. We encourage you to research the details of the candidates' energy policies, and learn more about what you can do in your own home or business.

160,"Lack of jobs trumps debt as biggest threat\We should always spend money and manage debt carefully. But increases in federal government debt were not the cause of the Great Depression or the recent recession and are not nearly as important as unemployment now. \The policies of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney squandered inherited record surpluses via two expensive wars, tax breaks for the wealthy and allowing the large banks a free hand. \Reversing these polices (neither major party is without blame), maintaining constructive and productive investment in education, health care and infrastructure, and a current version of the Civilian Conservation Corps would do more to reduce unemployment and the federal debt than all the misguided austerity. \- Tom Kriegl, Baraboo \Biggest threat is imbalance in wealth distribution \The imbalance in wealth distribution is a far greater threat to America's future than the national debt. \The U.S. poverty rate is now higher than in other advanced nations. At the other end of the financial spectrum, five of the world's 10 richest individuals are U.S. citizens and the number of billionaires is growing. \A growing national debt is an inherent and visible flaw in our complex monetary system. Exploitation that promotes increasing debt is well covered in the book ""Web of Debt"" by Ellen Brown. \A major problem is the hording of money in offshore investments by those at the top end of the money stream. Government policies that have evolved to protect and encourage the hording of accumulated wealth have led to an expanding gap in living standards. \Money that, if left in circulation, would alleviate problems associated with poverty is instead held in foreign accounts where it is shielded from taxation and serves no purpose in our economy. This creates the need for the government to borrow more money to assure all Americans receive adequate food, clothing and shelter. This feeds the migration of money into the protected pockets of the rich. \We need to revise the tax code and encourage investment in America to discourage the trend toward plutocracy. \- Ron Wolfe, Waunakee \Just interest on our debt would be a windfall \The debt is absolutely the biggest threat to the future of America. Congratulations to the Wisconsin State Journal editorial board for raising this issue. All major newspapers should be doing something similar. \Currently our national debt stands at approximately $16.7 trillion and growing! To put this number into perspective, each American citizen owns an approximate $52,800 share of this debt. \These numbers are alarming. But unless someone calls in our markers, it's easy to perceive them as irrelevant and not critical to our future. However, the interest the United States pays to support this astronomical level of debt is enormous. The interest on debt outstanding in 2012 was nearly $360 billion. \It's time for our elected officials, and the rest of us, to pull our heads out of the sand and begin to address this deplorable situation. What wonderful things could we do with $360 billion that we can't afford to think about now? \- Gary Gundlach, Wauzeka \Focus on debt ignores other important issues \Other problems threaten our future in addition to the national debt. Unfortunately, our leaders are not addressing all the issues. \They believe, for example, that drilling for oil will provide energy independence for the United States. Drilling can't go on forever. Eventually oil production will go into decline. It can also harm the environment as well. \- Larry Rosen, Madison \Hold debt limit, and freeze cuts in budget \I agree with most of last Sunday's editorial about future generations being overburdened by our national debt. \But saying that the current fiscal year's lower deficit is good news is like saying, when the current temperature is 30 degrees below zero, that tomorrow will be good because it will be 20 degrees warmer. \Our deficit will still be nearly twice what it was prior to President Barack Obama's election, and that's if you think the Congressional Budget Office's projection is accurate. \But I disagree with your suggestion that Congress should raise the debt limit, then reform the tax code and reduce entitlement spending. This never happens - Congress and the White House raise the debt limit and keep spending, never working toward programs that will keep our government under the debt limit. \The only way to get Washington to address the issue is to hold the debt limit and elect people who will advocate something serious, like an across-the-board 3 percent cut in the federal budget. Then freeze the federal budget for two or three years. With all the fat in the budget, this is attainable. \Something like this is the only way Washington can show the fiscal sanity required to assure the possibility of prosperity for future generations. Any bets that something like this will not be suggested by Democrats? \- Bill Siems, Windsor \Climate change is greatest threat to our future \Is America's debt the biggest threat to its future? No. \Last Sunday's editorial, ""Stop digging hole for future generations,"" could apply to the carbon debt generated by burning carbon dioxide-releasing fossil fuels at an unsustainable rate. \It also applies to the environmental debt expressed by the disastrous consequences of climate change. The real issue is easing the IOUs of the future so our children and grandchildren aren't stuck in a climate change-caused environmental and ecological hole with no way out decades or less from now. \The consequences of unrestrained human-caused climate change threaten not just America's fiscal and economic health, but everyone's ability to survive - that of ourselves, our children and grandchildren, here and around the world. \We have a chance to implement a win-win plan, a steadily increasing carbon tax on fossil fuels at the point of importation or extraction. First, this would generate a price incentive to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Second, it could generate revenue from taxing what we burn instead of what we earn to help reduce the deficit. \- Kermit M. Hovey Jr., Middleton \Congress didn't listen, now we're almost bankrupt \Kudos to the State Journal editorial board for having the courage in liberal Dane County to suggest that Democrats in Congress make cuts in federal social welfare programs such as Social Security, Medicare and food stamps to put the brakes on the out-of-control federal budget. \Back in the 1970s is when we first heard the pleas of Republicans and some Democrats that a revamp of programs like those and the way they're funded needed to be done or they would eventually bankrupt the country. We are there, thanks to Congress not doing anything about it for the past 30 or more years. \All government social welfare programs - federal and state - have waste and fraud, and keep some folks permanently on the dole. Starting Obamacare is another costly government program we don't need. We will save billions by not implementing it. Kudos to the Republicans in Congress for trying to stop it to get that added financial burden off the backs of our grandchildren and great grandchildren. \Simplifying the tax system is a must to make it fairer, especially for the middle class. How about a flat tax? \- Terry K. Voice, Madison \Eliminate offshore tax havens to boost revenue \Last Sunday's editorial, ""Stop digging hole for future generations,"" states ""fewer loopholes and more fairness should be the goal."" But surely closing tax loopholes and stopping tax haven abuse should be the first step, and its impact on the budget is not monopoly money. \Offshore tax haven abuse costs an estimated $150 billion in federal revenue every year. By using accounting tricks and taking advantage of our inefficient tax code, many U.S.-based multinational corporations make their profits appear to be generated offshore, thereby avoiding paying U.S. taxes.When wealthy individuals and corporations abuse offshore tax havens, Americans and small businesses are forced to shoulder the burden. Every dollar corporations avoid in taxes is balanced by average citizens paying higher taxes and coping with cuts to public programs, not to mention a higher federal deficit. \The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act puts the public before special interests and closes the most deplorable loopholes. As Congress faces the latest round of budget battles, U.S. Sens. Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin should support this bill and stand with the public, not big corporations lobbying to protect their tax breaks. \- Bruce Speight, director, Wisconsin Public Interest Research Group \Nation will fail if it becomes socialist society \Yes, our debt is a huge threat to our survival as a democracy. \We cannot continue to pass unfunded social programs. Obamacare should be scrapped and other social programs must be pared back. \We must not become a socialist society or we will fail. \- Gary W. Sutherland, Brodhead"
161,"
Editor's note: It may be the greatest threat, yet climate change has not yet inspired people to make dramatic changes to lives and lifestyles. Will change be forced upon us?
\
Climate change is the topic of the seventh of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Editorial Board's yearlong series of round-table discussions on the region's quality of life. Last week, the experts told us why we should care and about some possible policy and lifestyle changes ahead. What follows are excerpts from the discussion Tuesday with members of the Editorial Board.
\
Scott Manley: We believe that really the appropriate place for mandatory regulation, if there's going to be any, would be at the federal level of government. . . . I think we run the risk of having state-by-state mandatory regulation that pits states against each other on an unlevel playing field.
\
Ann Beier: The state of California has certainly stepped to the plate. . . . In a perfect world, the federal leadership is essential . . . not just (to) give those mandates, but some market structure - whether it's a carbon tax or the caps that are in place in other jurisdictions.
\
Keith Reopelle: Until (an expanded federal role) happens, state leadership is absolutely critical. And this issue . . . is played out no differently than almost every other major environmental issue, which is that the states are taking the lead. And Wisconsin historically has been a leader. . . .
\
Now I think that Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa are poised to be the next part of the country that really addresses this. And that could very well be what finally pushes the federal government into action.
\
Roy Thilly: The charge of the (governor's global warming) task force, as (with) your discussion here, (is) not to debate the science but to propose specific policies that would reduce Wisconsin's contribution to global warming gas emissions.
\
The timetable the governor gave us was (to) report back by the end of the year. Because of the complications of some of the modeling exercises, wanting to get the numbers right, I suspect it will slip a month, perhaps, from that date, but pretty close to the end of the year we should have a set of specific policy recommendations. . . .
\
Federal legislation, strong legislation, would be desirable, would provide consistency, would address some of the competitive issues, but there clearly is a role for the state, particularly in the absence of federal action.
\
George Stone: The reason the states have taken such an initiative is because of the vacuum. The federal government is actually opposed to increasing the standards. . . . I might say that California's global warming solutions act, which they passed a year ago, was much farther than what the other states have done. It sets as a target a return to 1990 emissions standards by 2020. That will require a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. That's of the order of what is needed. . . . Let us follow.
\
Tia Nelson: There's a whole lot of things we can do as a state that will poise us to not only address the threats that are occurring here but position business and industry to be strong when that federal legislation comes along. The sooner we get to that work, the less it will cost and the more it will benefit the state of Wisconsin.
\
Chris Damm: When you're talking about federal vs. state or private sector in dealing with this problem . . . there's a huge need for research and development funding.
\
And that's going to have to come from the federal government.
\
So not only a technology push (but) . . . some kind of regulatory framework that will get these new technologies that have been developed deployed into the marketplace.
\
Clay Nesler: We certainly see an opportunity for this to stimulate investments in new technology. For instance, at Johnson Controls, we're very interested in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, using lithium-ion to come up with the next generation hybrid.
\
I think there's also tremendous opportunity to take advantage of existing technology. . . . Energy efficiency in commercial buildings, in homes and in vehicles are generally viewed as the lowest cost way of addressing climate change.
\
Stone: (Conservation) has an important role. Forty percent of energy is used in buildings. So conservation and increased energy efficiency can save 50% of that without a great deal of strain. It just needs to become a top priority.
\
Thirty percent of energy is consumed in transportation. That is going to require new technologies. But new technologies are going to expand the economy. They always have, they always will. . . .
\
When we felt it was necessary for us to develop an atomic bomb, we made it the top national priority - put all the best scientists and engineers to work on it, and in four years we did it.
\
When we made a commitment to put men on the moon . . . we put all the resources of this country, the top scientists and engineers to work on the problem, and we did it.
\
John Magnuson: There is no silver bullet, in that this problem will not be solved with an either/or - let's do it this way or let's do it that way. In fact what we have, has become known as the silver buckshot. . . .
\
I don't think we're going to make significant progress on this if we take the tack (that) there is a silver bullet. . . .
\
We've had an increase in energy efficiency over the last 30 or 40 years. But . . . population growth and per capita consumption has wiped that out.
\
And so energy efficiency, while that's a nice sounding term, is also part of it, but none of them (alone) are the final solution.
\
Matt Moroney: I think it comes down to individual decisions made by individual consumers, because we see that a lot in our marketplace, where people are looking at building a home. . . .
\
A couple years ago we forced all of our builders in the Parade of Homes to do the green-build home program. They came back and said, why did you force us to do that, nobody is asking for that. I can tell you now . . . we get calls almost daily about green building technologies.
\
Thilly: There's no one solution but I wouldn't underestimate the importance of conservation and efficiency, particularly in the energy sector in the short term.
\
Also, we need to look at Wisconsin's strengths and weaknesses.
\
We don't have the geology for sequestration, it would appear. Illinois is much better situated in that regard, so that's a problem. We don't have the wind resource of western Minnesota, Iowa and the Dakotas, which is where they're focused. And we don't have any internal fuel sources.
\
So that makes conservation and efficiency, developing our biofuels and biomass potential really important for the state.
\
Nelson: The most important message to hear is there are a multitude of things that we can do. . . . It may only be the 5% solution, or the 4% solution, but the answer's going to be a whole bunch of 5% and 10% solutions. And we're going to have to add them all up and use every tool in the toolbox; every single one.
\
Beier: The city is a consumer just like you are, and so the City of Milwaukee is looking at both our fleets and our buildings. . . . Mayor (Tom) Barrett has directed city departments to reduce energy use by 15% by 2012.
\
We currently purchase about 100,000 kilowatt hours from WE Energies of solar power. (So the city) should diversify our energy portfolio. . . .
\
Our fleets, the same thing. We're moving toward alternative fuels with biodiesel. We're looking at hybrid vehicles. We're downsizing our fleet, which is something consumers can do, is just get rid of that extra car.
\
Nelson: There's a whole bunch of Web sites where a consumer can go and calculate their carbon footprint.
\
While it's not going to . . . be huge, the idea of being carbon neutral . . . creates a sense of awareness. It creates an understanding that our habits of consumption have an ecological and environmental consequence and that there's ways to reduce that impact.
\
Damm: But we have to realize that people who are concerned about the environment aren't going to solve this problem. . . . For instance, our local utility here, WE Energies, has a green-pricing program - an energy for tomorrow program - and it's only 1.5% of their customers (who) have signed up for that. . . .
\
Also, if you look at the top selling vehicles so far in 2007, three of the six top-selling vehicles are pickups. So . . . the government has to play a role in coming up with innovative legislation that makes these technologies favorable from an economic standpoint.
\
Manley: You asked what is the role of industry, and if you're looking at direct emissions, it's about 13% of our greenhouse gas emission.
\
Even if you could cut that in half, which I don't think is feasible without significant economic devastation to some important companies in Wisconsin, you don't get very far.
\
On the other hand, industry consumes about 38% of the electricity that's generated in this state, which makes industry the biggest energy consumer.
\
So I think that industry's role is on the conservation and efficiency side. Since 1970, manufacturers have been able to figure out a way to produce the same amount of GDP using 46% less energy. We've done energy efficiency, and there's more we can do, but we need government to be a partner in that, and not an obstacle. I think you're going to find better results with government being somebody that doles out carrots as opposed to using a stick. . . .
\
If that (stringent emission control standards) is the approach we take right off the bat, . . . I think we're going to give businesses a reason to be somewhere else.
\
Beier: California is still pretty darn competitive in the U.S. economy and the world economy. If you look at their job growth and their population growth and their overall well being, things aren't shutting down in California.
\
Damm: California is serving as a petri dish in carbon regulation, and we can look at their successes and their failures and learn from that. . . .
\
There has to be some federal carbon regulation, and you have to allow the marketplace to work. . . . You allow the marketplace to achieve the most cost effective solution, and I think that's the sort of framework that carbon regulation has to work under.
\
Stone: The states have formed compacts. For example, California took the lead, but now five other western states have joined with California. . . . By forming a regional coalition, you reduce this competition problem. We could form an upper Midwest coalition with Iowa and Minnesota, which are moving quite rapidly on this. . . .
\
But I think the other thing that individuals can do in addition to reducing their own personal footprint it to be politically active. We need to insist that government at every jurisdictional level - city, county, state, federal, even international - take action, and action consists of two things. Setting targets for greenhouse gas reduction, target amounts, and setting timelines for those reductions. Once those are set, then people will figure out all the different ways of doing it.
\
Damm: Energy research in this country is incredibly underfunded. The Department of Energy research budget for fiscal year 2008 - hasn't been appropriated yet - is $1.5 billion. If you put that into perspective, the Department of Defense budget is $623 billion. So even if you multiplied the energy R&D budget by a factor of 10, so $15 billion, that's only 2% of the federal department of defense budget.
\
So we really need to look at the big picture. If you tell me, well, where are you going to come up with that $15 billion? . . . (In) the war in Iraq, we've spent $450 billion. That could fund the whole Department of Energy budget for 20 years.
\
So don't tell me you can't come up with $15 billion for energy research and development.
\
Manley: It's important to kind of take a step back from these regional approaches because I think if you want to enable the business case for voluntary or incentive-based reductions, you need an emission market where there's consistent value - where credits are fungible on a nationwide basis.
\
I think having fractured regional markets where, if I make a reduction, I might have a value in this market, but I don't here, or there's price inconsistencies, it really works against the greater good.
\
Nelson: Scott's right. You need that to have an effective market. But these regional approaches seem to be working and seem to be creating fungible credits.
\
On coal-fired plants.
\
Thilly: The new plants that are being built are much more efficient and cleaner. . . . But the question is what's next. And I don't think any of us know.
\
I suspect . . . the two paths that are out there . . . are clean coal with carbon capture and sequestration or nuclear energy for the base load 24 hours, seven days a week need. And both of those technologies have significant questions - long, long lead times in terms of regulatory approval and construction.
\
I think Wisconsin's going to be in a holding pattern for some period of time, concentrating on energy efficiency, conservation and stretching out when we move to those new technologies. Because I don't see much first-mover advantage in doing that, given the uncertainties, risks and the costs. . . .
\
A lot of the problem (for clean-coal technology) is the research and development issue that's been pointed out. The utility industry has spent very little on research and development, as has the Department of Energy. Part of the problem is, of course, that there's been difficulty recovering those costs and rights. . . .
\
We really need to change the regulatory paradigm that we have so that utilities have incentives to do research and development, to utilize new technologies and to conserve. Asking a business to go out and ask people to buy less of their product is a bit of a challenge.
\
What's at stake if we do nothing?
\
Stone: Well, the consensus of the climate science community - and I will say this is an overwhelming majority of world climate scientists - (is that) there are certain unknown tipping points that cause the earth's climate system to change. . . .
\
We don't know exactly when the climate system's going to switch, so it's called a tipping point. . . . Dr. (James) Hanson (of NASA) and his colleagues advise us that we have a decade at most to make the major changes to stabilize - stop the acceleration of CO2, slow it down and stabilize it.
\
Where we can cut down in the short term is automobile emissions. That can be done relatively rapidly.
\
Look at how the automobile manufacturing changed after the '73 OPEC price increase. We've had small cars . . . and that was done relatively quickly. We can save a lot of energy in buildings right away, maybe 50% of the energy that's used in buildings. So we need short term and longer term strategies, including research and development.
\
Magnuson: Everybody talks about what's happening in the tropical rainforest or in Greenland, and so one of things I've been doing is talking about what's happened in Wisconsin. . . .
\
For example, one of the clearest pieces of evidence for global climate change here is the loss of the ice on our lakes. The proportion of ice cover on the Great Lakes is declining. The ice season on our various lakes is declining.
\
Our snow season, our ski season, our snowmobile season, there's no snow on the ground when the deer hunters go into the woods anymore. Those are changes, and they're costing some people, but they're not catastrophic. . . .
\
There is a group of artists that live in northwestern Wisconsin right now that have a traveling exhibit, which is called ""Paradise Lost."" The notion of that exhibit . . . is that winter is part of our sense of place, the same way that the Great Lakes are part of our sense of place, and that the northern forests are part of our sense of place. That we can go up north and it still exists.
\
That's another reason why we can't do a national thing, because people's sense of place differs. If I grew up in Alabama, I'd have a different sense of place. . . .
\
The climate scenario suggests that those trees will not be able to germinate and that our northern forests will become like our southern forests. . . .
\
If you look historically, or prehistorically, at Great Lakes water levels, they have varied widely and were much, much lower and much, much higher than we have today.
\
The questions is, what's going to happen in the next 30 years? Is water level going to go up and we're going to get shoreline erosion and houses falling in the lakes again, which we had, what, 25 years ago?
\
Or is it going to be the way it is now and continue to go lower?
\
Beier: A number of cities . . . are looking at not just mitigation but adaptation.
\
How do we adapt to a different climate, particularly true in coastal areas where we see the sea level rise in places that have been built and historically no longer can be.
\
Here in Milwaukee we have less infrastructure worries, but one of the things the climate models show is that our storm systems will be more frequent and more severe.
\
What does that mean for summer rain storms? It means maybe we need to think about our storm water system even more. It means that we may have different kinds of heat patterns in the summer that put our population at risk.
\
So (we are) starting to think not just about what can we do to prevent climate change, but how are we as society, as cities, going to adapt to that.
\
Stone: If you're the tourist industry in central and northern Wisconsin, it's extremely important to the economies up there. . . . If you can't make any money from winter sports anymore, then that is a local catastrophe.
\
If you live in New Orleans or South Florida or Bangladesh or some of the islands in the Pacific and in the Indian Ocean, and sea level rises a meter, that's a catastrophe because most of your land is gone.
\
One of the important points here that we need to understand is the feedback mechanism that's involved in climate change. One of the feedbacks in the Great Lakes is when the ice cover diminishes, there's more evaporation of the water, and that's a contributor to lower lake levels. . . .
\
There are economic factors all around the world that are inexplicably interrelated (to) environmental factors. . . .
\
What we do here in the United States isn't going to have a global impact unless we get the world community on board as well, especially the rapidly developing huge countries such as China and India. But we can't get them on board unless we take the leadership. . . . We need to reassume that international role of leadership to address this major global problem. . . .
\
It's Western Europe and the United States that are primarily responsible for the current CO2 levels in the atmosphere. When we do something major and decisive, then we've got the leverage to go to these other countries and get them to do something. When we don't do anything, we have zero leverage and this is truly an international challenge.
\
Nesler: There is an opportunity in parts of the developing world. An analogy might be the telecommunications industry where essentially the developing world has been able to skip a generation. They've gone directly to . . . wireless communications.
\
The opportunity is . . . to take China and India . . . (and persuade them) not to build the same coal plants that we did 50 years ago, (not to) build inefficient buildings but actually have them build green buildings, have them introduce technologies in their vehicles.
\
I think that is a great opportunity for us.
\
It would stimulate the global economy and really have a direct impact on the climate.
\
On Wisconsin's moratorium on building nuclear plants.
\
Manley: We (WMC) believe we should lift the moratorium. . . . If the goal is we're going to do a 60% to 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the overwhelming majority comes through the generation of electricity, even fuel switching from coal to natural gas doesn't get you near to a 60% to 80% level.
\
I think it gets you somewhere in the mid- to high 30s. If you want to get serious about reducing carbon emissions from electric generation in Wisconsin, nuclear has to be part of the solution.
\
Magnuson: I come at this from the environmental side, and you may be surprised at what I have to say.
\
I think nuclear should be back on the table. . . . Coal is not environmentally clean at all. And so, should we have coal on the table? I think if we can have coal on the table, we should have atomic energy on the table.
\
Thilly: If you really are going to have very substantial greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2050, to take an option off the table like nuclear and put all of your eggs in the basket of carbon capture and sequestration is just simply not prudent.
\
We need flexibility.
\
Reopelle: One thing (that's) clear is that there's no way we're going to meet our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets if we build any more conventional pulverized coal (plants) that don't capture the carbon. That's . . . going in the opposite direction.
\
I wouldn't argue with the notion that nuclear needs to be looked at; certainly from a greenhouse gas emission reduction standpoint, it is a better option.
\
It is a fallacy to think that there's no emissions from it, because if you look at the whole process, from cradle to grave, there are actually major greenhouse gas emissions from mining and the other parts of the process for nuclear power, and you have to take that into account.

162,"Imes is executive director for Wisconsin Environmental Initiative. Information: www.wi-ei.org\ The renewed focus on regulatory reform in Wisconsin need not turn into another tired debate over economic growth versus environmental protection. We need not ignite another ""green war"" that will hurt our ability to achieve the healthy business climate and environmental quality every Wisconsinite deserves.\ There is a better way.\ The Dec. 15 Environmental Policy Forum, sponsored by the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative, will bring together leaders from business and industry, state agencies, the Legislature and environmental groups to reach an understanding on the need for both regulatory reform and environmental quality.\ Forum participants will be challenged to look beyond the top- down, prescriptive solutions of the past and to examine innovative strategies and policies that can lead to positive environmental results and a more productive business climate.\ Imagine Wisconsin developing projects that bring business and community stakeholders together, establish environmental goals and measure progress to make resources such as the Milwaukee River, Lake Michigan beaches or Madison's Lake Wingra clean enough for swimming all of the time.\ There are many opportunities to add environmental and economic benefit:\ * Clean energy: State and local energy task forces should consider setting a clean energy standard so that the total amount of new investment in conservation, energy efficiency, renewable technologies, green building and distributed generation would accommodate the projected 2-3 percent growth in energy demand each year.\ Sound unreasonable? A recent market study by Orion Energy Systems shows that more robust energy efficiency initiatives alone could deliver more than 1,500 megawatts of reduced power consumption in Wisconsin. This strategy, coupled with the replacement of old, inefficient power plants with new, vastly more efficient ones, would dramatically reduce air pollution and other effects while providing more jobs and a safe, reliable and affordable energy supply.\ * Green smart growth: Opportunities abound for environmentally focused smart growth and development. One idea is to do ""green"" developments as demonstration projects involving area developers and builders working with regulators from Dane County and the Department of Natural Resources.\ Projects heeding ""green built home"" criteria would receive fast- track regulatory approvals, lower fees and other incentives not available for typical developments. The resulting lower costs and risks would offer real competitive advantage to participating developers.\ Similar opportunities can be extended to Wisconsin's dairy industries to reward innovative use of technology, practice and mindset, and reduce the environmental impacts and conflicts associated with livestock operations.\ * Green tier for business: Wisconsin needs to get cooperation from reluctant industries, DNR staff and environmental groups to try something different to achieve economic and environmental goals. ""Green Tier"" represents the next generation of environmental management with an emphasis on environmental performance, flexible compliance, legal accountability, management and other incentives.\ We can end the ""green wars"" through stakeholder collaboration, setting environmentally focused performance-based goals. By emphasizing flexibility and accountability for environmental and economic outcomes, we can achieve our aspirations for an improved environment and a healthy business climate in Wisconsin."
163,"EDITOR: Even to the untrained eye - unless the ""keeping the lights on"" electric blanket has been pulled over it - failures of the electric grid should be evidence that technology is seriously outdated. The old supply-side solution of stringing more wires such as the Arrowhead-Weston power line and other feeble attempts to make today's technology work better are not the answer. We need to use smarter methods of generation, transmission and delivery coupled with demand-side solutions. But is the electric industry willing to take those steps or are short-term profits running the show?\The Electric Power Research Institute, formed shortly after the blackout of 1965, has long advocated a smaller, smarter grid - one that is not on a collision course with the environment and private property rights; one that stresses demand-side management, renewable energy, distributed generation, conservation and energy-efficiency initiatives. Why is it that in the aftermath of this latest grid failure, it's not EPRI, the industry technological think tank, we hear from but the talking heads from trade organizations like the Edison Electric Institute parading around trying to spin some degree of damage control?\The bigger the grid, the greater the chances of more blackouts like those of 1965, 1977 and this year. Deregulation has spawned the big energy brokers such as Enron, which are shaping this country's energy future through legislation. Deregulation casualties will include conservation, renewable energy, energy efficiency, technology research and development and you, the consumer.\Roger G. Steffen,\Hawkins"

165,"We are awash in media stories about water crises across the United States. Headline-making water supply and allocation challenges formerly thought to belong to the arid Colorado River basin and the booming metropolises of ""the desert empire,"" Texas and other historically dry parts of the country, are now front and center in the East's water-rich regions.\Surface and ground waters cannot meet the burgeoning appetite for this most valuable of our natural resources.\We are witnessing increased political warfare as Atlanta's shrinking water supplies pit Georgia against Alabama and Florida for the shared waters of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system; as New York City competes with neighboring eastern states for Delaware River flows; as upper Midwest states struggle to enact a Great Lakes Compact to protect 20 percent of the world's assets of fresh surface waters from perceived threats from outside the basin. And these crises are now being seen in the context of growing scientific understanding about global warming and climate change.\Wasn't somebody supposed to be looking ahead and making plans to address these enormous challenges? In reality, many people were doing just that.\State and federal water-related agencies, universities, river basin commissions, think tanks and non-governmental organizations have been identifying the problems and manufacturing plans to address them for decades.\While some of the plans lacked comprehensiveness and a sufficiently long-term perspective, they generally outlined actions needed to begin to tackle these problems.\For example, Georgia had exemplary state water planning in the 1970s, with extensive appraisals of their river basins and looming water supply issues.\Here in Wisconsin, we've engaged in comparatively advanced water planning and top-notch research for decades. Building on this knowledge foundation, the 2003 Waters of Wisconsin initiative culminated with a call for developing a comprehensive state water policy to address the array of complex water problems facing ""tomorrow's Wisconsin.""\The real crises involve heightening public demands for action, and finding political leaders committed to advocate for and implement effective plans.\Real solutions to protecting our inland lake heritage, addressing groundwater overexploitation in southeast Wisconsin, and assuring long-range sustainability of our waters require resolving deep distributional and value conflicts. Our political processes have been reluctant and unable to creatively deal with such complicated multi-party disputes.\Political gridlock that stymies tackling emerging problems where the worst consequences are likely decades (and a generation or two of voters) down the road, is clearly not the only problem.\The content of planning for the future needs to change, and quickly. An outdated supply-oriented ideology still dominates - one that treats fresh water as a virtually limitless resource. Every landowner, industry, and developer expects water needs to be met as if they were entitlements.\We need a new approach - demand-side management that uses less water to furnish the same human benefits, through conservation and a dramatic increase in water use efficiency.\Effective demand management programs must integrate consumer behavior, water provision, waste disposal, and energy use, and make the essential connection between growth and land development and water supply and conservation planning. We have many of the tools in hand. It's time to use them.\Finally, we need to move to ecosystem-based planning and management that adapts economic, political and social processes to fit within ecosystem health, instead of the reverse.

No one can seriously argue anymore that global warming isn't happening and that human activity isn't a significant part of the cause. The question now is what to do about it.
\
The summary of the latest report by an international panel of scientists put together by the United Nations says that global warming is a reality and that it is very likely - a 90% probability, the panel says - that human activity in the form of greenhouse gas emissions is making a significant contribution to the warming trend. The full report won't be available until May, but the summary for policymakers recently released makes clear what the final report will say.
\
Yes, there are still serious questions on the details - just how much the average temperature will increase, how high sea levels will rise, how crops and the environment will be affected - but the crux of the matter has been settled.
\
Now, the debate needs to move to policy issues and questions of how to best mitigate the effect. The most important question to ask is not what the world will be like 20 or 30 years from now but what it will be like 100 or 200 years from now if nothing is done.
\
Since it's a global problem, the warming trend requires a global response. There will be winners and losers, and some will bear more of the cost than others. Mitigating global warming won't be easy, and it won't be cheap. But spread the cost as broadly as possible - share the pain - and it should not be unbearable for any single country or people.
\
The basic answer lies in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and reducing the emissions of the fuels when they are used.
\
Everything should be on the table. This includes a new international agreement on global warming, new taxes on oil and on carbon emissions, rewarding conservation, placing caps on emissions, promoting mass transit and the research of alternative fuels and finding safer ways to dispose of nuclear waste. Yes, nuclear power - which emits nothing - can be a part of the solution if the will and a way can be found to deal with the significant problems caused by nuclear waste.
\
So can energy-efficiency and the development of technology that, for example, would allow buildings to use less energy to heat or cool.
\
Internationally, a new agreement is necessary to supplant the ineffective and unpopular Kyoto treaty. That new agreement needs to spell out the responsibilities of each country and set limits on greenhouse gas emissions. And it needs to include China, India and other nations that are rapidly expanding their economies and their use of fossil fuels. Chinese leaders are right when they say that wealthier countries need to take the lead on curbing emissions, but China needs to commit to being part of the solution.
\
Nationally, a federal tax on oil consumption - perhaps in conjunction with a tax on carbon emissions - needs to be considered. Consumers aren't likely to cut back on driving or to buy vehicles that use less gasoline unless consuming gasoline becomes more expensive. Utilities will no doubt pass along the costs of any carbon emissions tax to ratepayers, so perhaps some sort of subsidy could help offset the cost. New investments will have to be made in clean coal technology, but the most significant increase should come in non-fossil fuel alternatives. Right now, that means biomass, wind and solar, but more is needed, and President Bush's initiatives - announced in his State of the Union address - are a step in the right direction.
\
In Wisconsin, Gov. Jim Doyle has taken a bigger step with his call for a state task force on global warming and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Other measures should include a reconsideration of the state's heavy reliance on coal plants. Because of that reliance, Wisconsin's emissions have grown faster than the average of other states, as the first installment in a series of articles on global warming points out in today's Journal Sentinel.
\
That reconsideration should include a very careful look by the state Public Service Commission at last week's proposal by Alliant Energy Corp. of Madison to build a new coal plant in southwestern Wisconsin. The PSC needs to ask just how badly the plant is needed and whether alternatives could meet the need. We Energies, which is building two coal plants in Oak Creek, says it is experimenting with cleaner coal technology at its Pleasant Prairie plant. Such experiments need more of a push.
\
Do state residents really want to place such a heavy reliance on coal when it is likely that they will be paying a greater price for use of that coal, perhaps through a tax on carbon emissions or a cap on those emissions?
\
Consumers also need to start thinking about what they can do to curb their use of fossil fuels. This includes driving less, buying more fuel-efficient cars and energy-saving light bulbs and using the furnace and air conditioner a little less. One family turning down the thermostat may not mean much. But a million families doing so makes a difference.
\
Just what effect global warming will have remains an open question. The U.N. panel offers six scenarios, ranging from an almost negligible effect to far more dire consequences. In most, sea level increases are actually less than earlier predictions.
\
But even if the final result is less serious than some fear, reducing the consumption of fossil fuels will still leave the world a better place with less smog, less small-particle pollution and reduced ozone levels. Doing whatever it takes to mitigate global warming will be worth the effort and will help make the world of 2107 one worth living in.

169," When it comes to global warming, the Bush administration puts its faith in volunteerism and new energy technologies to scale back America's mountain of heat-trapping gases.\ Government studies say the results are at best uncertain, but one thing is not: Each year, the mountain of ""greenhouse"" gases emitted by the United States gets bigger.\ While the rest of the developed world requires - but doesn't always achieve - mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide and other emissions, the nation adding the most gases to the atmosphere is deadlocked in a debate over how to deal with it.\ Individual states, meanwhile, are taking the lead.\ Voluntary programs emphasized by President Bush since 2002 are claimed to be sparing the atmosphere 300 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, or 4 percent of U.S. emissions.\ But the government doesn't know - and often can't verify - whether the reductions reported by 230 U.S. companies are real.\ ""It's difficult to prove,"" said Paul McArdle, who manages the Energy Department's voluntary reporting system. ""It's my sense that some of these are real reductions.""\ What's more, McArdle acknowledged, companies can increase their emissions overall but still claim cutbacks by counting as reductions such steps as replacing old lighting, using more efficient vehicles or planting trees.\ Monitoring inexact\ In a review last April, Congress' Government Accountability Office questioned Washington's ability to monitor these voluntary efforts. ""Determining the reductions attributable to each program will be challenging,"" it said.\ In one program with measurable results, it estimated companies have reduced emissions by no more than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution. Total U.S. emissions - now more than 7 billion tons a year - still are projected to rise 14 percent from 2002 to 2012.\ Carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the biggest of the greenhouse gases, so called because they create a heat-trapping blanket when released into the atmosphere. Others are methane, nitrous oxide and synthetic gases.\ The atmosphere holds more carbon dioxide now than it has for hundreds of thousands of years, and the Earth's surface warmed an average 1 degree over the past century.\ As a first step, the White House talks of reducing the ""intensity"" of U.S. carbon pollution - not shrinking emissions overall, but reducing the carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic growth.\ ""Our objective is to significantly slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and, as the science justifies, stop it and then reverse it,"" said James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ""We're making good progress. It's reasonably ambitious, but it still provides for reasonable human welfare.""\ Shortly after taking office, President Bush rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which requires 36 industrial nations to cut global warming gases by 2012 by an average 5 percent below 1990 levels.\ He argued that cutting the U.S. share to below 6 billion tons a year, as the treaty would have required, would have cost 5 million U.S. jobs. He objected, too, that such high-polluting developing nations as China and India were not required to reduce emissions.\ Progress, or failure\ Some members of Congress agree with the gradualist Bush approach, while others do not, Republicans among them.\ ""Everybody's talking about it. What the American people want is for somebody to start doing something about it,"" complained Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., House Science Committee chairman.\ ""If we can't make a relatively simple change in (automobile) mileage regulations - a change to an existing regulation that doesn't even require new technology and that would have numerous benefits aside from the climate implications - then what does that say about our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?"" Boehlert said. ""It certainly doesn't say anything good.""\ Instead, the United States is spending $3 billion each year researching technologies to cut global warming and $2 billion on climate research. In a program called the Asia-Pacific Partnership, Bush also is working with Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea - producers of half the world's greenhouse gases - to attract private money for cleaner energy technologies.\ Connaughton calls that joint effort a major breakthrough. Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, calls it an ""excuse for further delay.""\ Bioenergy promoted\ Bush envisions using more hydrogen-powered vehicles, electricity from renewable energy sources and clean coal technology.\ The Energy Department's technology program has helped build 34,000 new energy-efficient homes and it plans to create ""bioenergy"" research centers and to advance research into hydrogen fuel and fusion energy. Its director, Stephen Eule, promises breakthroughs in the coming decades.\ Scientists say climate disruptions may occur before that, however, and critics in Congress and elsewhere say the government effort is too slow and needs refocusing.\ The plan ""appears stalled near the starting line,"" said Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who leads a House subcommittee overseeing the program. A review in May by the Energy Department's own research lab in Oak Ridge, Tenn., said the program focuses too much on work that can lead to ""only incremental improvements."" It called for more emphasis on ""exploratory, out-of-the-box concepts.""\ ""There is a need for more high-risk but high-payoff research,"" the review concluded.\ A new government economic analysis sees markets in combination with research as the way to go.\ The Congressional Budget Office report last month said any cost- effective U.S. policy on global warming must put a price on carbon - via an emissions tax or a ""cap and trade"" system of buying and selling emissions allowances among companies, as in Europe.\ ""Setting a current price for carbon emissions and announcing planned future carbon prices not only would induce firms and households to change their behavior but also would increase their demand for technologies that would reduce emissions,"" CBO researchers said.\ California dreaming?\ States aren't waiting for Washington.\ On Sept. 28, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation imposing a first-in-the-nation emissions cap on utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020. An earlier California law ordered 30 percent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. And Schwarzenegger and British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans this summer to work toward a possible joint emissions-trading market.\ Such a market pact is close to becoming reality among eight Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, which plan to impose caps on power plant emissions and encourage trading of allowances among utilities. Twenty-eight states in all have drawn up plans to combat warming, with some - notably Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico and North Carolina - also working toward possible mandatory limits on gases. Ten states plan to enact California's auto rule, if it survives a current court challenge.\ Some businesses want national caps now on carbon emissions, believing them inevitable. ""It is very difficult to have a product that is regulated significantly differently from state to state,"" said Bill Gerwing, environmental policy director for the oil company BP America.\ Continuing doubt\ Contributing to Washington's impasse is skepticism in some quarters about whether global warming is even a problem.\ The Senate Environment chairman, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., likens concerns about the Earth warming to Chicken Little saying the sky is falling.\ ""Global warming is an alarmism. It's a type of a hoax,"" said Inhofe. ""The reality is that a cap on carbon is a cap on the economy, through the rationing of energy.""\ Similar thinking pervades the House, Boehlert said. ""The scientific consensus has simply not pierced through the ideological barriers,"" he said.\ Former Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., who in 1988 led the first major legislative attempt to curb greenhouse gases, said next month's congressional elections could provide the ""most important push"" in the debate.\ In her current job helping the Environmental Protection Agency recruit companies to cut carbon, she finds more shareholders viewing climate change as a top concern, she said.\ ""You've got the push of shareholders and eventually the pull of Congress moving America,"" Schneider said. ""We just need a new Congress.""\ Elements of the Kyoto Protocol\ GASES: Seeks to control emissions of six heat-trapping gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.\ TARGETS: Assigns numerical targets for reducing or limiting emissions, compared with 1990 benchmark, for 36 industrialized countries among 140 nations that ratified pact. The United States hasn't ratified.\ TRADING: Allows emissions trading among the 36 countries. Industrial plants that emit less than allotted can sell resulting ""credits"" to those that exceed their allowances.\ JOINT IMPLEMENTATION: Allows nation to earn credits for financing emissions-reduction projects in another country subject to Kyoto controls.\ CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM: Allows country to earn credits via emission-reduction projects in developing nations, which are not obliged to cut emissions."
170," Jon Foley was a sixth-grader in Bangor, Maine when the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.\ Though he was just 11, Foley says he remembers how it was front- page news for days and how relieved everyone was when disaster was finally averted.\ Today, three decades later, the pro-nuclear crowd would have us believe Three Mile Island was much ado about nothing - after all, nobody died, they like to point out - and that a massive investment in clean nuclear energy is the smartest way out of the global warming mess.\ What they don't like to mention, of course, is that had the accident been a little worse, the consequences could have been similar to Chernobyl in 1986 - with clouds of radiation escaping into the environment, killing thousands of people and causing billions of dollars in property damage.\ Foley, director of the University of Wisconsin Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment, says he tends to believe nuclear experts when they say today's nuclear plants are far safer than those built 30 years ago.\ ""I'm also willing to believe the waste problem could be minimized. Let's give the engineers the benefit of the doubt here,"" he said in an interview last week.\ But for anyone to suggest that nuclear power is the solution to global warming is sadly mistaken, Foley says.\ Indeed, even if the United States launched a major nuclear power building campaign tomorrow, it wouldn't provide more than 10 to 20 percent of our energy needs over the next few decades, he says.\ ""It would also be very expensive. And has anybody figured out how much uranium is out there to mine? And where it is? Or are we going to be running into another limitation like we'll soon have with oil and other resources?""\ Besides, Foley says, ""Even if we all stopped burning gas and oil and coal tomorrow - if we said, 'That's it, we're not burning another gram of that stuff,' an absolutely ridiculous scenario - we'd still be warming for several decades at least. That script's already been written.""\ That's not to say Foley totally opposes the nuclear power option.\ But it's a lot more practical, he argues, to be investing in wind power, combined with a much more aggressive conservation and energy efficiency standard.\ ""That's something we could do right now and would cost far less money,"" he says, adding that he's perplexed that U.S. officials continue to ""pooh pooh"" such a logical and proven alternative - especially since it would have considerable economic benefits as well.\ In addition, Foley says, we need to place a greater emphasis on new clean technologies like coal gasification, where you essentially take raw coal, turn it into a hydrocarbon gas and burn that.\ ""That's a huge leap in efficiency and emissions reduction. And it's already being done in Europe,"" notes Foley, who finds it ""very disturbing"" that Wisconsin continues to build traditional coal- fired power plants that will only exacerbate the problem.\ Still, as daunting as global warming is, Foley remains an optimist.\ He's an optimist, he says, because he believes we've recently turned a corner in the long, contentious global warming debate.\ He thinks Al Gore's documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"" - which raked in $27 million at the box office and has been nominated for an Oscar - has convinced a lot of skeptics that global warming is real. Even more important, he says, was the report earlier this month by an international group of climate change experts that concluded for the first time that global warming is ""unequivocal"" and that it's ""very likely"" that human activity is the chief reason temperatures having been rising since 1950.\ ""It wasn't news to me, of course,"" Foley says. ""But to get the world's scientists to go through everything they could and look under every stone for any other possible explanations and still come up with such a powerful statement is pretty amazing.""\ What it means, Foley suggests, is that while we're in for a rough 30 to 40 years, if we take action now we can still head off the catastrophic scenarios that threaten our kids and grandkids.\ Keep in mind ""we're trying to steer a huge ship here,"" he says. ""I mean, we're talking about changing the whole energy infrastructure of the world. But if in the next 10 years we start to level off our energy use and begin to slowly reduce our greenhouse gases, we've got a chance.""\ The big question, Foley says, is do we really care about future generations?\ Because even if we act now, ""the results may not be evident for another 50 years,"" he says. ""That's what's so hard about it.""\ E-mail: rzaleski@madison.com"
171,"Rib Mountain house has contemporary feel while recycling, reusing building products\By Nick Sargent\Wausau Daily Heraldnsargentwdhprint.com\There's absolutely no way you can tell, but you can go ahead and try.\Drive through the streets of the Flameflower subdivision in Rib Mountain and try to pick out the ""green home"" - undoubtedly the most energy-efficient house on the cul-de-sac and probably the only one with countertops made from recycled paper.\But if you're looking for a dome or a Brady Bunch-esque home covered in solar panels, you're going to keep driving.\The fact is the first certified Green Built Home in the Wausau area fits right in with the rest of the contemporary abodes nestled in the woodsy neighborhood. The only clue to its location would be if you saw project manager Tim Schwartz pull up to the site - on his bicycle.\For Tim, 33, his wife, Tanya Schwartz, 34, and their business partner Jeff Tobin, 49, the green-centric construction firm Eco-Peak is about more than just filling a business niche. The Schwartzes and Tobin are committed environmentalists and conservationists, and their company builds only homes that meet the strict Green Built Home certification.\That's doesn't mean green home owners have to trade style for substance, however. The Rib Mountain home - Eco-Peak's first project - also meets the strict standards most new houses are subject to in area developments.\But when most people think green home, Tanya Schwartz said they inevitably seem to think of the futuristic designs of the 1970s environmental housing market.\""That's a big part of it,"" she said. ""People think they are made out of beer bottles and plastic milk jugs.""\But this single-story home with a walkout has a contemporary feel. The maple doorway and the earth-tone exterior stand out because it's a quaint new home, not because of the materials that were used.\As more people learn that today's green home look like any other house on the block, the buying public might be more receptive to seeking them out, said Tee Daly, a Realtor with Realty Executives of Wausau.\""People haven't been asking (for green homes) - not a single person asks,"" she said. When she learned about the design of Eco-Peak's house, she was more receptive to the idea and thinks the public might follow suit. ""If it looks like every other (house). It's something people might consider.""\According to the Green Built Home organization, the green home movement has been building momentum in Wisconsin over the last five years. Officials are predicting they will certify more than 1,000 homes this year.\Despite its growing popularity, the Eco-Peak crew doesn't see the concept appealing to a broader audience. They will be very happy to build about six homes a year, Jim Schwartz said.\It's likely the general public's indifferent attitude to most environmental issues, not the building costs that will keep the homes from reaching a mainstream audience, he said.\Green homes aren't necessarily more expensive than standard new homes - natural fiber floors, recycled countertops and energy-efficient windows cost more than standard products, but green choices aren't more expensive than the high-end materials most of their potential clients likely would want anyway.\The builders also point out that there are cost savings on the homes. To be certified as a Green Built Home, a home also must be certified by Energy Star, which holds buildings to a high energy-efficiency standard.\Energy-efficient windows are certainly a big part of that, but crews also take great care in their work to make sure there are no drafts in the house. They keep as many trees in the lot as possible to provide shade for the house to cool it in warm weather.\The green building movement isn't just about the products that are used, Tobin said, it's also about creating as little waste as possible and reusing anything you can.\For instance the trees that needed to be taken down in the Rib Mountain lot were chipped for use in the owners' new garden. In the future, the owners of Eco-Peak hope to have a local businessperson turn the downed trees on a homeowner's lot into building materials for that person's home.\""Nobody else is doing (green building). We think its important to build that way,"" Tanya Schwartz said. ""It's going to be a lot better on the environment. Recycling and reusing - if we don't do it now, we'll be forced to do it later.""\About Eco-Peak Construction\Founded: November 2004\Headquarters: Rib Mountain\Owners: Tim and Tanya Schwartz and Jeff Tobin\Type of business: Construction firm that builds only green buildings\Something you should know: Recently completed its first home and the area's first Green Built Home in Rib Mountain and will begin work on its second home in Weston later this month.\What does green mean?\A Green Built Home is a certification set up by the nonprofit group Wisconsin Environmental Initiative and the Madison Area Builders Association. Those standards can be found at greenbuilthome.org.\A green building refers to a number of ways to construct a building to make it healthier, safer, more durable, energy efficient and environmentally responsible. It focuses on issues related to indoor air quality, energy efficiency and natural resource depletion.\An Energy Star qualified home is part of the Green Built Home certification process. These homes are independently verified to be at least 30 percent more energy efficient than homes built to the 1993 national Model Energy Code or 15 percent more efficient than the state energy code, whichever is more rigorous. The standard is enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\Butch McCartney/Wausau Daily Herald\This single-story home with a walk-out at 1710 Baneberry Court is the first certified Green Built Home in the Wausau area. The home meets a number of strict standards for being environmentally friendly and energy efficient.\Butch McCartney/Wausau Daily Herald\The inside of the area's first Green Built Home looks like most contemporary houses. However, small but important differences, such as natural flooring, countertops made of recycled paper and an energy-efficient design, make it green.\(headshot)\Tee Daly"
172," The State Journal's June 29 editorial ""Gas tax cut would come with a cost"" contained a sound argument against a state gasoline tax cut. Maintenance of our existing highway network is important. We paid dearly for those 113,000 miles of state highway, in dollars, farmland, wetlands, prairie, private and public property, and they should be kept in good shape.\ Keeping the existing state tax on gasoline might also help reduce Wisconsin's contributions to global warming. Higher fuel costs should, theoretically speaking, mean less gasoline will be burned for travel, reducing the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from cars. Fewer cars on the road during high traffic times should, theoretically speaking, be another benefit of the higher prices. But something should be done to help people who can't reasonably afford higher priced gasoline because of low income level.\ What concerns me about the editorial is that you say state Transportation Secretary Terry Mulcahy ""doubts the current taxing formula will produce enough money to meet long-term maintenance needs, even without a temporary cut."" One has to seriously question why DOT proposes to spend almost a third of its $20-billion, 20-year highway plan, approved four months ago, for building more miles of state highway that will also require maintenance?\ The money hasn't even been identified for to satisfactorily maintain the highways that have already been built, yet the department approved spending $7.3 billion more for an additional 2,800 new lane miles of highway that will also require future highway maintenance money from Wisconsin taxpayers.\ - Michael Neuman, Madison\ Forget speeding tickets: Focus on serious crimes\ I can't tell you how disappointed I was to read in your paper that once again, the city of Madison is committing more time, money and the resources of the Police Department in an effort to control speeding in our fair city.\ When asked about stopping the graffiti that is plaguing the city or the vandalism that goes unchecked or major thefts that are unsolved or drunk drivers who kill innocent victims or sexual assaults that continue throughout the city, the response is always that there is ""a lack of resources.""\ There never seems to be enough manpower or money when it comes to issues of quality of life and personal safety, but when it comes to raising revenue by issuing traffic tickets there seems to be unlimited resources available.\ It's time to get the police priorities realigned with the realities of life in Madison.\ Oh, never mind, what was I thinking?

Turn down the volume\ I agree wholeheartedly with the recent article on so-called music coming from the trunks of cars.\ Our home is set back about 300 feet from a heavily travelled highway with quite a dense growth of trees.\ I can hear this booming invading our home from a quarter mile away. Naturally, it becomes even louder as the vehicle gets across from our house.\ This is my air space. These people don't have the right to annoy other people with their noise. Keep the noise to themselves.\ If this is what turns them on, I suggest they find an 80-acre field and boom all they want.\ - Wesley J.

Well, I and my family will be following their lead.\ We're dumping, too. That's right, no more dairy for us! Why would we want to support such actions. It's disconcerting enough to know how milk is obtained - confined cows forced into pregnancy after pregnancy and injected with hormones to produce more milk than is natural, all for our benefit. But then to take what they yield and waste it just like spoiled children?\ My family and I have more respect for the cows' bounty than that. We have heard that soy and rice milk are just as nutritious and even more humane. . . .\ - Tracy Schad, Cottage Grove\ Require drivers' exams to be taken in English\ It seems extremely foolish to me for the state Transportation Department to give drivers' license exams in languages other than English. After all, I don't recall seeing any road signs written in a language other than English.\ Some people might say, ""They can identify the shape of the sign,"" which might be all right for some occasions. But often there are instructions on the signs that these people would not be able to read. . . .\ Driving a vehicle is a privilege, not a right. If drivers can't read the signs, how can they possibly be expected to be safe and responsible drivers?

173,"Determined to present himself as a man with a plan, Texas Gov. George W. Bush was all set to join congressional Republicans in pitching a gimmicky response to rising gasoline prices that, ultimately, will undermine highway safety and harm the environment.\Bush, a former Texas oil man, wanted to temporarily eliminate a portion of the federal gas tax that pays for highway construction and repair, as well as some other transportation initiative. The all-but- nominated Republican presidential candidate had joined several members of his party's congressional leadership in hatching a scheme to enact a short-term cut in the 4.3-cent gas tax increase enacted in 1993 as part of the sweeping deficit reduction plan that economists credit with having sparked the current economic boom.\They were even going to refer to the target of their ambitions as ""The Gore Gas Tax,"" a reference to the fact that Vice President Al Gore, the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee, had cast a deciding vote for the deficit reduction plan.\But as Republicans prepared to roll out their campaign, er, policy proposal, they got slapped in the face by reality.\A nonpartisan report to Congress determined that a cut in the federal gas tax, which has not increased since 1993, would devastate needed transportation programs, including highway construction and repair. Economists chimed in as well, arguing that a 4.3-cent cut in the tax would not be noticed at the pump. And sensible House Republicans stepped forward to warn that squeezing transportation funding would make it even less likely that there will be money available to pay for development of real solutions to issues raised by the price hike.\Bush and his pals now seem likely to back off the tax scheme, as key committee chairs in the House are now saying it should not - and, considering their positions, will not - be enacted.\The whole Republican gambit points up the problem with politicizing energy policy: It leads to precisely this sort of showboating. In an attempt to score points, candidates will do almost anything, even if their ""action"" is useless at best, and damaging at worst.\Tinkering with the gas tax will only marginally reduce fuel prices at a time when they are rapidly rising. We'd call this the energy policy equivalent of placing a small bandage over a gaping wound, but, frankly, that's insulting to the bandage.\That's something Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson wisely recognized, when he rejected proposals for a gas tax cut or freeze in Wisconsin.\An entirely symbolic attack on transportation funding is not a proper - let alone logical - response to gas price hikes. And turning energy policy into a partisan issue isn't going to move this nation in the right direction.\What is the right direction? Rather than cut gas taxes, lift the ban on offshore drilling or, worst of all, permit oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, federal officials should be dusting off long-neglected proposals on energy conservation and renewable fuel research.\As Muhammad Sahimi, one of the world's most highly respected specialists on energy issues, noted in an opinion piece that appeared in Monday's editions of The Capital Times: ""Cheap oil induces people to overuse it and thus discourages development of alternate sources of energy that are environmentally friendly.""\Indeed, notes Sahimi, the chairman of the chemical and petroleum engineering department at the University of Southern California, ""the main culprit of air pollution is fossil fuels, mainly oil, which in the United States accounts for 85 percent of fuel use. There are hidden costs of cheap oil, which we pay for through air and water pollution, global warming and acid rain.""\Instead of responding to oil price increases with quick-fix ""solutions"" that seek to depress prices by bankrupting federal transportation programs, politicians should seize this opportunity to find real solutions that reduce reliance on fossil fuels. That requires a focus on conservation and alternative fuels, not gimmicky tax tinkering."
174," WHILE STATE LEGISLATORS WORK TO COVER A BUDGET SHORTFALL, SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN WISCONSIN WANT A STATE GASOLINE TAX REPRIEVE ESTIMATED TO COST $13 MILLION IN REVENUE FOR THE WISCONSIN TREASURY.\ Local government officials want to insert the tax break into the 2001-2003 state budget.\ ""Here's one way to give us all a little relief,"" said Racine Mayor Jim Smith, whose city would save about $211,700 if the tax break is enacted.\ The Wisconsin Alliance of Cities is promoting the gas tax break as a way to give local governments some relief from high gas prices.\ The tax break might not get a warm reception from the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee, which is trying to find ways of dealing with a $761 million budget shortfall.\ Smith said local officials are facing the same fiscal problems as the state.\ A survey by the Alliance of Cities showed Appleton could save $91,908 on a gas tax reprieve, Madison $202,697, La Crosse $109,200, and Wausau $45,594.\ Northwest offers deals on first-class seats\ With high-yield business travel slumping, Northwest Airlines has introduced a discount for first-class tickets purchased at least 14 days in advance.\ Though limited in availability, the tickets will put business travelers in first class for $50 to $200 more than they now pay for 14-day advance ""BizFlex"" coach seating.\ American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, US Airways and America West were among the major carriers this week that matched Northwest's deal for cheaper first-class seats.\ A decline in high-yield business travel has been a major problem throughout the airline industry this year. At Northwest, for instance, the situation contributed to a first-quarter loss of $123 million.\ EARNINGS\ Guild parent's loss lowers as sales rise\ HOUSTON - Luxury e-tailer Ashford.com, which earlier this month completed its acquisition of Madison-based art e-tailer Guild.com, cut its net loss by more than half while its sales rose more than 20 percent in the quarter ended March 31 compared with a year ago.\ Ashford.com reported a net loss of $17.0 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, on sales of $14.3 million, compared with a net loss of $41.2 million, or 92 cents per diluted share, on revenues of $11.8 million a year ago.\ MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - Commtouch, which includes Wingra Technologies of Madison, reported a first-quarter net loss, excluding amortization charges, of $15.7 million, or 93 cents per share, on revenues of $4.0 million, compared with a net loss of $6.4 million, or 43 cents per share, on revenues of $3.6 million a year ago.\ WESTBOROUGH, Mass. - American Superconductor Corp., which includes the former Superconductivity of Middleton, reported a loss for its fiscal year 2001 ended March 31 of $21.7 million, or $1.08 per share, on revenues of $16.8 million, compared with a net loss in fiscal 2000 of $17.6 million, or $1.11 per share, on revenues of $15.1 million.\ BRIEFLY\ The nine recipients of Governor's New Product Awards include Standard Imaging Inc. of Middleton, which has produced products for treating prostate cancer, and Uclid Software of Madison, which has created software to digitize paper land records, and Delarue Cash Systems, which produces coin sorting/counting systems.\ Computer recycling firm Parts Now! LLC of Madison won a ""Pollution Prevention"" 2001 Business Friend of the Environment award.\ Area firms among the 12 companies given Governor's Export Achievement Awards were Angi International LLC of Milton, Voegeli International of Monticello and Knight Manufacturing Corp. of Brodhead.\ Arnold & O'Sheridan Inc. of Madison won the Grand Award in the 2001 Engineering Excellence Awards competition, sponsored by the Wisconsin Association of Consulting Engineers, for its design of the state Supermax Prison in Boscobel."
175," In the past, I've squawked against the huge public subsidy in this country for the automobile, pointing out that gas taxes and vehicle registration fees cover just a fraction of our car-happy lifestyle.\ For that reason, I haven't been entirely opposed to Gov. Tommy Thompson's proposal to raise the state gas tax to help balance the transportation budget.\ Any increase in the gas tax, even a paltry 2.9 cents a gallon, is a step toward making cars pay their fair share, right?\ Unfortunately, the gas tax being discussed doesn't signal a change in the state's transportation policies. It's being proposed simply to keep the state on its road-building binge.\ Few people -- other than some of my bicycle fanatic buddies -- are going to argue against a safe, well-maintained road system. But does Wisconsin really need or can it afford the type of Cadillac highway plans the concrete-crazed planners at the DOT continue to push?\ Some legislators are saying no, as evidenced this week by the failure to approve a transportation budget that includes a gas tax hike.\ Pundits following the action over at the state Capitol have labeled the discussions political, speculating that the Democrats are balking at the tax hike so they can use it against the Republicans in the 1996 election.\ But there are signs that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are questioning whether Wisconsin needs to adjust its transportation philosophy to better reflect the realities of what a medium-sized Midwestern state needs or can actually afford.\ What has rankled some are the threats and intimidation tactics the DOT is using this fall in bullying the final votes needed for its tax hike.\ One particularly telling case involves the reconstruction of Highway 54 which runs between Stevens Point and Wisconsin Rapids. The section of highway that passes through the village of Plover has been torn up all summer, causing headaches for businesses and residents alike.\ DOT officials have used this unfinished highway to pressure legislators to vote for the tax hike, saying there may not be enough money to finish the project on time without a gas tax increase.\ Not coincidentally, two of only five Democrats to vote for the gas tax in the Assembly Thursday -- Bill Murat and Marlin Schneider -- represent the central Wisconsin area that includes Highway 54.\ A similar story came out of Milwaukee over a notorious section of grooved pavement at the Silver Springs interchange. The communities of Fox Point and Whitefish Bay have been pushing for a resurfacing of the roadway, which is so noisy that residents claim they are forced from their backyards during the summer.\ Once again, the DOT said there might not be enough money in the budget for the project, leaving Sheldon Wasserman, a Democrat from Milwaukee, with no choice but to vote for the gas tax, especially with 1,000 letters from constituents in his districts calling for either a fixed road or his head.\ Of course, long-time political observers will note that legislators have historically been held hostage over particular road projects. Bringing home the pork frequently causes lawmakers to bend over and grab their ankles.\ But the level of arrogance coming out of the DOT this fall has never been higher. After growing fat and happy for the past nine years under the Thompson Administration's blank-check approach to highway building, the DOT seems to have forgotten who ultimately pays the bill.\ Perhaps the DOT should be required to seek a gas tax increase that truly reflects the costs of road building.\ The DOT's own pricing studies done last year show that shifting all highway costs to car and truck drivers would require a 29 cent per gallon increase in the gas tax.\ Now 29 cents, there's a tax increase that might actually affect behavior in terms of getting people to carpool, use mass transit or limit those endless trips to the strip mall for a video and a quart of Diet Coke.\ Better yet, it might even get the public to understand that the continuing unchecked suburbanization of Wisconsin isn't only displeasing to the eye, bad for our urban communities and harmful to the environment -- it's damn expensive."

It's time to repeal state's gas tax

\
It's time somebody speaks to our elected representatives about repealing the gas tax -- it's costing us jobs.
\
Wisconsin's gas tax, one of the highest in the nation, rose last week to 29.1 cents a gallon from 28.5 cents. The price of gas in the state already costs an average of $1.78 a gallon.
\
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed to reduce oil production quotas by 4.1%. That means:
\
-- The price of gas is going up.
\
-- The price of doing business will go up.
\
-- The amount of money you have to buy the necessities of life will go down.
\
-- More people will be laid off.
\
-- Inflation will rise.
\
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that interest rates would stay low as long as inflation stays low. You can guess what is going to happen to interest rates if inflation starts to spiral out of control.
\
Americans went to the Middle East and built the oil fields as we know them today. Then the governments of Middle Eastern countries pushed us out, saying we were stealing their national resources.
\
Meanwhile in America, we were busy restructuring our refineries. Many were considered outdated and dangerous, and were closed. Today, we have limited refining capabilities and import much of our gas and oil.
\
America still has its own oil wells and some refineries. We could erect more, if the oil companies paid attention to the environment.
\
Now is the time for our government representatives to give back to the people.
\
The state increases the gas tax each year based on inflation, without debate or a vote. By repealing the gas tax and other hidden taxes and fees, we will be able to repair much of the damage done by rising oil prices and the loss of jobs to foreign countries.
\
Repealing these taxes will not be an easy thing to do. The state says it will collect $340 million this year from the tax. Our elected representatives have an argument all ready against repeal -- where will the money come from to build our roads?
\
If people are unemployed, they can't buy gas, cars or much else. If gas prices keep going up, only the well-to-do will be driving. What will the rest of us need roads for?

177," Senate Democrats conceded Monday that a temporary repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax increase is unavoidable, and Republican leaders prepared to tap the nation's savings institutions to pay for it.\ Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said the Senate could vote as soon as today on the tax cut, which he proposed less than two weeks ago. He planned to discuss the timing, as well as a Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage, with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.\ ""We think (it) is inevitable,"" Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters. Republicans are ""in the majority. They have the votes to pass legislation.""\ The leading proposal for paying for the cut, according to House and Senate aides, was separate legislation that strengthens the government fund insuring savings and loan deposits.\ That plan requires a one-time premium payment from S&Ls, and, under budget rules, the money can be used to offset the tax cut.\ GOP leaders also are looking at a cut in Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.\ The Clinton administration supports the S&L legislation and Daschle said ""I'm not necessarily averse"" to using it.\ Republican leaders are pushing hard for the repeal, which is seen as having wide popular appeal. Dole, Clinton's rival in the presidential race, notes that the tax increase was approved ""without a single Republican vote.""\ Many Democrats are criticizing the tax cut, saying it could amount to a windfall for the oil companies who pay the tax and ultimately pass it on to the consumer. And environmentalists maintain the tax cut would encourage more energy consumption and hurt the environment.\ Repeal is ""attractive as a matter of rawpolitics, but it is terrible as a matter of public policy,"" said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. ""Just as we were beginning to make sustained progress in bringing down the deficit we blink.""\ However, some Democrats feel compelled to vote for the tax cut and Republicans are near unanimous in backing it.\ At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton wanted the tax cut considered as part of a balanced budget. But that doesn't mean Clinton had decided to veto the tax cut.\ ""If it comes to us separately, we'll look at it separately,"" McCurry said. ""We would hope that the Congress would give equal priority treatment to raising the minimum wage.""\ With gas prices soaring roughly 20 cents per gallon since February, Dole on April 26 proposed shaving the 1993 increase of 4.3 cents off the 18.3-cent federal gasoline tax.\ Dole, R-Kan., suggested the Senate should act today, which marks what the private, business-financed Tax Foundation has called Tax Freedom Day. That's the date, according toits calculation, by which the average taxpayer has earned enough to pay federal, state and local taxes for the year."

179,"From June 12\Madison drivers love their electric hybrid vehicles, no doubt about it. \After all, who doesn't like getting 50 miles or more per gallon while curbing the planet's air pollution? \But less money spent at the pump also means less gas tax collected by the government to pay for the roads and bridges to convey that Toyota Prius as it hums along quietly. \To address the issue, a growing number of states are now implementing special registration fees and tax add-ons for electric or hybrid vehicles to make up for the loss of gas tax collections. \In Washington state, for example, owners of all electric vehicles are being hit with a $100 annual surcharge. North Carolina is pondering a similar move. \Virginia has eliminated its gas tax at the pump in favor of a 3.5 percent wholesale sales tax on fuel. It has also implemented a $64 surcharge on hybrids. \And Vermont is seeing support in the state Senate for a tax on electric hybrid vehicles. \Wisconsin hasn't implemented any special charges for high-mileage vehicles yet, but is also facing the same sort of shrinking gas tax collections as other states. Less money coming from fuel sales here has led to deficits in the transportation fund, forcing the state to borrow money to pay for highway improvements and maintenance. \A report from the Transportation Finance Commission suggested a variety of ways that Wisconsin could raise more money for roads. One suggestion was a surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles, along with fees based on miles driven, toll roads or bridges and charges for using express highway lanes. \Road builders, of course, would like to see some new sources of transportation revenue coming in. Their business depends on it. But so far they aren't pushing for any single solution. \""There are a wide range of options out there,"" says Kevin Traas of the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association. ""We're for anything that can help address the shortfalls."" \But so far, the Republicans who control the Wisconsin statehouse and Gov. Scott Walker have been more concerned with cutting taxes than trying to address any long-term problems in transportation funding. \In fact, when the idea of raising the state gas tax surfaced last year, it was quickly dismissed by Walker. Instead, Walker's new 2013-2015 budget includes increased borrowing to pay for new road projects. \The problem with borrowing is that the money needs to be paid back, with interest, putting the state further into the hole when it comes to keeping traffic moving. \WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING\tshaw: I think an alternative suggestion would be to raise the money for roads, bridges, etc. from an increase on carbon utilization (gas tax). After all, those of us who drive hybrids are helping to save our planet and its inhabitants (and descendants) from the consequences of rising CO2 levels.\happydays: Don't be silly ? just because you drive a car that uses less gas doesn't mean you don't use the roads ? you should be paying for them just like everyone else. I don't ride a bike ? but I sure the heck have to pay for the bike paths through my taxes.\patricko: Sounds like the incentives to get a hybrid worked, so now they will take them away. This is sort of like when they berate people to quit smoking for health and economic reasons, only to jack the cigarette tax rate when people actually quit smoking. They hate your smoking but love your taxes.\human: Hybrids aren't the only reason gas tax revenues are declining. People are also driving less than they used to. Instead of increasing taxes, and creating special charges for hybrids, perhaps we should ask whether Walker's proposed multibilliondollar highway expansions in southeast Wisconsin are really needed. Perhaps we should think about living within our means, instead.\Credit: MIKE IVEY , The Capital Times , mivey@madison.com"
180,"The state of Wisconsin, facing a $3.2 billion budget deficit, could save millions of dollars by such simple things as turning off lights, cutting gasoline and becoming more energy efficient.\The moves would be win-win measures since they'd also be good for the environment.\The so-called green budget put together by the Sierra Club, the Wisconsin Interfaith Climate Change Campaign, Madison Audubon Society, Wisconsin Wetlands Association, the River Alliance of Wisconsin and Citizens for Safe Water Around Badger would save an estimated $225.3 million over two years.\One of the most common sense parts is for the state to adopt energy efficiency measures such as switching to more efficient light bulbs and heaters and turning off lights and computers in state buildings. Another idea would be to dump t;he state's fleet of gas-guzzling vehicles, which includes several Ford Excursions that get 12 miles to the gallon. These measures could save $18.4 million to $36.8 million over the two years of the next state budget, according to the Department of Administration.\A total of $1.52 million could be saved by simply enforcing state laws on water pollution.\Other solid suggestions by the coalition of groups include ending property and sales tax breaks to passed in 1927 to encourage the timber industry to carry out lumbering projects on private lands, streamlining environmental programs into the Department of Natural Resources and revising the motorboat fuel gas tax.\More controversial would be the groups' proposal to save more than $58 million by eliminating six major road projects. One of the projects the plan targets is the rebuilding of the Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee. This, however, would be a mistake, in our opinion because a large proportion of the state's commerce flows through this deteriorated freeway interchange near Milwaukee's downtown.\Cutting wasteful use of energy, outmoded subsidies and other excessive spending would make sense at any time for the environmental and fiscal health of this state.\They are absolutely essential steps in this time of fiscal crisis."
181,"
Instead of building more highways, Wisconsin could pay people to drive less, a state Department of Natural Resources official said Monday.
\
The DNR has asked the state Department of Transportation to consider sending gas tax rebate checks of up to $2,800 a year to residents who voluntarily limit their driving.
\
That could help reduce the environmental damage from highway expansion, said Michael Neuman, a DNR specialist on transportation and the environment.
\
""I think it's the only answer to solving this nightmare of highway congestion we have in this country,"" Neuman said.
\
But key legislators of both parties and a DOT official immediately voiced skepticism about the concept, which apparently would be the first of its kind in the nation. They said the rebate plan would cost too much and wouldn't make a difference in how much people drive.
\
""The DNR hasn't considered any of the downsides of doing it,"" said Ernie Wittwer, DOT investment management administrator. ""They just tossed another idea out at the 12th hour.""
\
Neuman said the rebates could cost as much as $800 million a year but would be balanced by an equal cut in highway spending. If people didn't reduce their driving, the state wouldn't pay that much, he said.
\
The rebate idea is part of a broader assault on the $20 billion long-range highway plan. Over the next 20 years, the plan calls for adding 2,800 miles of highway lanes and 34 bypasses, using 25,000 acres.
\
DNR Secretary George Meyer has said that this much highway expansion could threaten air, water, land and wildlife.
\
At the same time, a coalition of local governments, environmentalists and transit activists declared Monday that the highway plan should be rewritten to consider alternatives to highway expansion, and to place a higher priority on maintaining state and local roads instead of building state highways.
\
The DOT has touted its highway plan as a balanced proposal that assumes train and bus service would be increased. But critics said that rail lines, bus systems and local streets would suffer, because the highway expansion would cost $4.2 billion more than gas taxes and license fees can cover at current rates.
\
Neuman suggested the rebate concept in his critique of the DOT plan. According to the DNR comments, still in draft form, the DOT should study such rebates and other incentives, among them higher parking fees, to persuade people to drive less and to reduce the need for more highways.
\
Drivers who want the rebates would agree to bring their cars to a Division of Motor Vehicles office once a year and let state employees check their odometers. They would pay a $30-a-year fee to cover the cost of administering the program.
\
Checks would be based on the vehicle miles traveled and the number of drivers, other people and cars in each household. For example, a family of two drivers and three children could earn a $1,200 rebate by driving less than 10,000 miles a year.
\
Households without cars could qualify for the maximum $2,800 rebate by filling out a form and paying a $10 fee.
\
Andrea Broaddus, campaign director of the New Transportation Alliance, praised the rebate as a ""really innovative"" idea that would pump more money into the consumer economy instead of into costly highways.
\
But Rep. David Brandemuehl (R-Fennimore), chairman of the Assembly Highways and Transportation Committee, said people wouldn't turn from driving to public transit as long as gas is ""relatively cheap.""
\
Brandemuehl said the state must continue to support highways until it can build a far more extensive network of passenger and freight rail lines. Residents wouldn't stand for letting highways deteriorate, he said.
\
Even Sen. Brian Burke (D-Milwaukee), a critic of the highway plan, called the rebates ""an idea whose time hasn't come.""
\
Burke, co-chairman of the Joint Finance Committee in the Legislature, said, ""We have to focus on smart growth and better transportation planning and more travel options and voluntary measures before throwing money at a proposal such as this.""
\
Still, Meyer said Monday that he is negotiating directly with Transportation Secretary Charles Thompson and his top deputy to bring more environmental sensitivity to the highway plan.
\
In a letter to Thompson earlier this year, Meyer said he was particularly concerned that the plan ""accepts increased vehicular travel as a given and accommodates it through increased highway capacity.""
\
Meyer said the DOT hasn't addressed his concerns. Wittwer disagreed, saying the DOT has thoroughly considered the environmental impact of its plan.
\
And although the DOT hasn't studied the rebate idea, it did ask the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission to examine 15 or 20 other ways to encourage people to drive less, Wittwer said.
\
None of those ideas would have significantly reduced driving, the study found. Nor has driving been reduced because of rising gas prices or higher vehicle registration fees in other states, Wittwer said.
\

Public hearings on the state highway plan are scheduled from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Monday at the University of Wisconsin-Marathon County in Wausau and from 5:30 to 8 p.m. Dec. 8 at the Dane County Expo Center in Madison.

House might agree to gas-tax suspension
\
By WILLIAM C. MANN
\
Associated Press
\
Monday, July 3, 2000
\
Washington -- The House would likely go along if the Senate votes to suspend the 18-cent federal gasoline tax, but a new way would have to be found to pay for highway construction, the House majority leader said Sunday.
\
Also Sunday, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson blamed the Clinton administration and OPEC for high gas prices.
\
The majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, said suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem of high gasoline prices. More helpful would be to augment the natural gas delivery system, deal more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on oil imports, he said on ""Fox News Sunday.""
\
""Let's look at building natural gas lines so people in the Northeast can be . . . heating with good, clean, reliable inexpensive natural gas,"" said Armey (R-Texas). ""Let's have a foreign policy that allows us to get some respect out of the OPEC nations that we deserve -- and we fought for, by the way. And then let's . . . reduce our domestic dependence on foreign oil.""
\
On the gasoline tax, most of which is supposed to go into a highway trust fund, Armey said a source of replacement money would be an important consideration before the tax could be suspended. Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who controls the flow of legislation in the Senate as majority leader, has said he may have a vote on a suspension suggested by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas).
\
""I think the House is willing to do that, but . . . we want to do it correctly,"" Armey said. ""And the first thing you have to answer is, `How do you replenish the highway construction funds?'
\
""And if we can work out that riddle, I think we'll be able to do that. It will be a good thing to do.""
\
Like other Republicans in this presidential election year, Armey largely blamed the Clinton administration for high gasoline prices. Should Vice President Al Gore become president instead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, he said, gas prices would climb inexorably higher.
\
""That is his policy for the environment, to eliminate the internal combustion engine,"" Armey said.
\
In April's reissue of Gore's 1992 book ""Earth in the Balance,"" the vice president wrote a foreword in which he reaffirmed his idea that such engines should be eliminated within 25 years. He said he did not want to eliminate the car, just to develop a car that would not harm the environment.
\
On ABC's ""This Week,"" Thompson was asked his view of what is causing the current price levels.
\
""First,"" Thompson said, ""I don't think the Clinton-Gore administration has any idea what a good energy policy is. Second, we're so dependent on OPEC nations for importing our oil.""
\
He added into the mix new Environmental Protection Agency rules for less-polluting fuel and the country's dwindling refining and delivery infrastructure.
\
""I've just heard from Governor Thompson (what) you've heard from virtually all the Republicans across America, I guess following the lead of Governor Bush,"" responded Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), whose state also has been hit by particularly exorbitant prices. ""You never once heard him suggest the possibility -- even the possibility -- that the oil companies might have been gouging us. . . . They don't want to put the blame where it should lie, and that's with the oil companies.""

183,"Is a gas tax ""holiday"" a good idea? What, if anything, should be done to give consumers a break from rising gasoline prices?\Infrastructure needs taxes\We've seen a deadly collapsed bridge, had pavement-shattering winters, experienced half a century of deferred maintenance. Traffic is many times heavier than road design criteria called for. There's a price-induced preference for smaller cars, fewer and shorter trips, gas conservation, alternative fuels and public transportation.\We have the lowest fuel price among democracies in a world where only tin-horn dictators and despots subsidize lower fuel prices as a sop to the masses.\Gas taxes pay for transportation infrastructure. What the feds take away, the state must pay. So tell me again why Sen. John McCain's gas tax ""holiday"" is good public policy.\- Harry Miles, Madison\Wasteful SUVs rolling along on our rickety bridges\How much will a gas tax holiday cost the transportation budget? It looks like that would endanger the repair of the nation's highway infrastructure, especially upgrading aging bridges, so SUV drivers can keep going their merry, wasteful way.\- Clifford Voegeli, Madison\Try an excess profits tax\Have the Democrats joined the Republicans in borrow and spend, and let the grandchildren pay for it? The last thing we need is a gas tax holiday.\High gas prices are finally persuading more people to drive less; why try to reverse that? Instead, let's designate a major part of the gas tax for developing alternate energy sources. That makes some sense.\What is needed is an excess profits tax on the oil companies. I suggest that any profits a company makes over a billion dollars a year should be taxed at least at the 75 percent level.\That would reduce the power of corporations over our society, and would also provide some money to pay for what our government is not doing to support the ongoing killing in Iraq.\- Roy U. Schenk, Madison\Plan saves little while cutting highway funds\Sen. John McCain's proposal for a federal gas tax holiday from Memorial Day through Labor Day, now supported by Sen. Hillary Clinton, brings two things to mind.\McCain is clueless about the effect of the tax holiday, which will save the typical consumer $28 through the three months but will leave a $10 billion hole in the federal highway trust fund. McCain says that can be made up by cuts elsewhere.\We have the biggest federal deficit ever, crumbling roads and a federal passenger rail system that has to fight for funds each year - and these two clowns want to cut taxes more?\Hillary Clinton's support of this plan is nothing short of more pandering for votes. But her support no doubt comes on the heels of threats of more sniper fire.\The U.S. road system is in horrible condition, as the bridge collapse in the Twin Cities so well displayed. Yet we will short the federal highway trust $10 billion to look good to the voters. In the world of grand delusion that both McCain and Clinton reside in, that half-baked plan probably makes sense to them.\America would be best served if neither of these two pandering buffoons had to worry about the 3 a.m. phone call. To his credit, Sen. Barack Obama is opposed to the tax holiday but probably will never fully explain why he's against it, other than because Clinton and McCain support it.\- Kim Tschudy, New Glarus\Need realistic way to fund road system\When autos got around 15 miles per gallon, a tax of 30 cents per gallon produced revenue of 2 cents per vehicle mile. This revenue was reserved and used to improve the nation's transportation systems, i.e., to benefit the road-user who paid this special tax.\This concept of trust fund financing to build and maintain the nation's transportation systems is no longer feasible. To generate revenue equal to 2 cents per vehicle mile, the gas tax would have to be increased to at least 70 cents per gallon in addition to the ongoing cost of refined fuels, distribution and a margin of profit.\And politicians would have to restore the concept of cost indexing and quit robbing transportation trust funds for other uses.\On the other hand, if we recognize the value of efficient transportation, particularly our highways, we should be willing to pay what they cost to build and operate. We shouldn't expect highway users to pay all the costs; hikers, bikers, recreational vehicles and farm machinery should all pay a fair share.\And most importantly, the public should match the funds obtained from road users via the gas tax, vehicle registrations, and related special forms of taxation. This could be a uniform sales tax with exceptions for necessities, toll roads, an income surtax or some form of ""transaction tax.""\Regardless, it's time to stop the decay of our nation's transportation systems.\- Walt Hannan, Livingston\Need smarter pols, not gas tax holiday\The last thing we need is to stop paying the tax that funds our roads and bridges. Besides the thousands of jobs we would lose, we would fall father behind on the repairs we desperately need.\Why can't we reign in the rich oil barons and the fat cats who sit at the top of all the companies? Why are we paying $4 a gallon and they have record profits?\Is it because in reality they control our elected politicians, like McClain, who is trying to put a useless Band-Aid over a very serious problem?\Or how about our governor, who has raided the road building fund and never put it back to the tune of $1.2 billion in his last two budget repairs? What's wrong with balancing the budget, spending what you have not what you don't have?\We need to make politicians accountable for their actions. Say no to a gas tax cut and yes to balance the budget.\- Patrick Walsh, Sun Prairie\Cheaper gas won't make us conserve\We can't afford a gas tax holiday! Don't get me wrong - I yearn to see the price of fuel reduced. However, 18 to 24 cents per gallon is not going to help me out.\The present price of fuel doesn't seem to affect how people drive. Reducing the gas tax certainly isn't going to cause us to conserve. If anything, the opposite would be true.\There are plenty of ways we could conserve, such as car-pooling to work, combining trips, walking, riding a bike, students taking the bus, driving slower etc. Choosing one or more of these conservation measures will save fuel, which will ultimately reduce the amount of money collected for gas taxes which affects the amount of money available for highways.\However, as opposed to a tax holiday, these conservation measures will mean less vehicle miles of travel, and that could mean less money needs to be spent on infrastructure.\Finally, we need to maintain our highways. Wisconsin and other states have had a winter that's been very hard on the roads. Regardless of how we feel about paying taxes, we need that money for our transportation system.\- Wesley Geringer, Black Earth\Tax holiday a joke - improve gas mileage\A gas tax holiday? It's almost a joke. Why not get serious about gas mileage?\Discourage buying vehicles which get poor mileage by increasing registration fees on new gas guzzlers. Restrict their speed on the highways to 55 mph. When you see a dealership with Escalades and Hummers for sale, don't you see something wrong?\If our corn-based ethanol system is a success, let's remove the subsidies. All we are doing is turning oil into ethanol with little efficiency and added damage to our environment. I doubt agriculture equipment matches the emission levels of our cars.\Europe uses diesel cars that get 45 to 70 mpg; we think you should convert oil to E-85 then put it into a SUV and get 13 mpg.\- Phil Fransen, Belleville\Government can't run like a business\I recall when the Republican-led state Legislature bandied about the idea of repealing the gas tax for awhile. Now GOP presidential candidate John McCain has added his name to this bone-head idea.\The savings to you and I will be small, while already underfunded infrastructure projects get fewer funds.\Politicians in general, and the GOP in particular, think the answer to everything is to cut taxes, services and programs. They like to remind us that government should run like a business.\Business has the luxury of choosing which products and services they wish to provide, and they can raise prices when costs go up.\Government must serve all the people. As Americans, it's what we all have in common. Regardless of race, creed, gender or economic means, the government serves all of its people for the common good. It cannot, like business can, preserve the right to refuse to serve anyone.\And because government gets income from taxes, it needs to raise those when costs go up. In business terms, taxes need to be seen as investments and not a way to gut transportation needs and education.\What we need is a return to common sense and a fair, progressive tax system. Business needs to pay its fair share and loop holes need to be closed. While there is wasteful spending, taxes need to be fairer.\- Robert Montgomery, Madison"

Top Department of Natural Resources officials Tuesday disavowed an agency employee's suggestion that Wisconsin could pay people to drive less instead of building more highways.
\
""There is no DNR plan"" to offer people gas tax rebates of up to $2,800 a year for voluntarily limiting their driving, said Franc Fennessy, executive assistant to DNR Secretary George Meyer.
\
""We are realistic at the DNR,"" Meyer said in a written statement. ""The idea is, at the very least, controversial, but was offered as a trial balloon to help spark public consideration of a wide variety of ideas for curbing the growing number of driver miles in the state.""
\
Michael Neuman, the DNR transportation specialist who outlined the idea Monday, ""was not speaking for the secretary,"" Fennessy said. Neither Meyer nor Fennessy has seen the nine-page draft of the concept that Neuman distributed to a coalition of local government representatives and environmentalists Monday, Fennessy said. Neuman said Tuesday he had been told to refer all news media questions to Fennessy.
\
Neuman was assigned to critique the state Department of Transportation's $20 billion long-range highway plan, and to develop alternatives to the 20-year plan's call for building 2,800 miles of highway lanes and 34 new highway bypasses, taking 25,000 acres. The rebate concept was among those alternatives.
\
Fennessy said it was up to the DOT to decide which alternatives to study. Ernie Wittwer, DOT investment management administrator, made it clear Monday that his agency wouldn't study the rebate idea.
\
Discussion of the rebate concept overshadowed what Fennessy and Meyer said was the DNR's main concern: that the DOT plan's proposed highway expansion would threaten homes, farmland and wildlife, and would increase air pollution and urban sprawl.
\
""The result, I fear, will be a transportation system that in two decades substantially increases congestion . . . continues to facilitate poor land use and harms Wisconsin's environment, economy and quality of life in numerous, irreparable ways,"" Meyer said in a letter to DOT Secretary Charles Thompson. Meyer and Thompson are negotiating on the plan's environmental impact. The Fair Share Coalition, representing municipal governments, major counties and environmental activists, also wants the plan overhauled to pay more attention to the environment and to stress maintenance of existing roads over building new highways.
\
But a road-building industry spokesman called Meyer ""reckless"" for ""perpetuating the myth of an out-of-control, irresponsible mobile sector"" increasing air pollution ""when nothing could be further from the truth.""
\
Environmental improvements in cars and trucks have led to a ""dramatic"" reduction in southeastern Wisconsin air pollution over the past decade, said Tom Walker, executive director of the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association.
\
Before the DNR backed off the rebate idea, Walker and Phil Scherer, executive director of the Transportation Development Association, called the concept unrealistic. They said economic growth would fuel increased driving and cash rebates wouldn't persuade people to use public transit.
\
If growth continues and highways aren't expanded, traffic congestion will increase, causing more pollution, Walker and Scherer said. And worsening traffic in downtown Milwaukee could encourage urban sprawl by pushing businesses into the suburbs, Scherer warned.
\
Scherer and Walker said they supported increased spending on trains and buses and incentives to encourage car-pooling, telecommuting and better traffic flow. But highways will still need to be rebuilt and expanded even with those measures, they said.
\
The DOT will hold public hearings on the highway plan Monday in Wausau and Dec. 8 in Madison.

What an innovative idea! Getting paid not to drive. I like it -- a lot. And it doesn't surprise me that the Department of Transportation and several key legislators pooh-poohed it.
\
We might all lose weight and live longer as a side effect. And we might leave our children and grandchildren a healthier, less paved environment. What a novel idea.
\
DOT Secretary Charles Thompson is much in the mold of our Gov. Tommy Thompson. Too much power! I credit Department of Natural Resources chief George Meyer for speaking out in favor of a more environmentally sensitive, long-range transportation plan. Not easy when your job is by appointment.
\
I think the rebate might work. We could be first in the nation to try something unique and worthwhile. After all, ""Work not Welfare"" was a first, also.
\
If we keep building more roads, it enables people to drive alone to their destinations. And have you looked at the SUVs and full- sized trucks barreling along? It's crazy!

We must maintain our state roads
\
As business manager for Operating Engineers Local 139, I am accustomed to working on a regular basis with state agencies, including the DNR and the DOT. When they stay in their area of expertise, they generally do their jobs well.
\
The plan proposed by a DNR employee last week to have the DOT send rebate checks to people who limit their driving is a classic case of an agency that has strayed from its expertise. The DNR should no more be involved in gas tax rebates than the DOT should be involved in setting deer hunting license fees.
\
Contrary to the opinion of those who would like us to go back to the days of the horse and buggy, we need to continue to spend dollars on maintaining our highway infrastructure. The vast majority of our commerce is moved by road; it is also the most common way for people to get around. Anyone who drove during Thanksgiving weekend can attest to that.
\
Bribing people to not drive should not be government's role.

Environmental tax could be great for state
\
Department of Natural Resources Secretary George Meyer's quick disavowal of a tax-based proposal to reduce vehicular air pollution is shortsighted (""Top DNR officials say there is no rebate plan,"" Dec. 1). Environmental tax reform is a rapidly evolving area of public policy, combining regulatory and market-based strategies to increase industrial efficiency and reduce pollution.
\
Ironically, the Dec. 2 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and major national news outlets reported that the Milwaukee metropolitan area lags seriously behind in the development of plans to reduce smog and other airborne threats to public health (""EPA orders tougher plans against smog"").
\
Environmental taxes, while not prevalent, are not new. Tax credits are available for renewable energy sources; various fees are assessed on the production, use and release of hazardous chemicals. Revenue mechanisms such as these create incentives to improve environmental performance, reward efficiency and innovation and generate funds necessary to administer regulatory programs.
\
Our studies strongly indicate that environmental tax reform at the state level would help address air pollution in metropolitan areas, storm water run-off and water pollution, mercury contamination and sprawl, among other issues.
\
The DNR was correct to criticize the state's ""paving the 21st century"" highway plan. However, the DNR should explore rather than hastily reject innovative policy mechanisms.

Current system favors drivers
\
As a dedicated transit user and someone who drives only once per week -- if at all -- you might think I'd support the now-disavowed suggestion from a Department of Natural Resources specialist to give rebates to low-mileage drivers.
\
However, these types of proposals, no matter how well- intentioned, completely miss the point of our transportation problems. They would accomplish nothing except create bureaucratic overhead and present opportunities for fraud and abuse.
\
The reason people drive so much is that they are using an infrastructure that is artificially priced below its actual cost.
\
If roads didn't have the advantages of tax-free bonding, property tax exemption, eminent domain powers, etc., the cost of driving would be much higher. If roads had to be built and operated in more of a free market system, I believe people would make very different decisions; I also believe that public transportation would be viewed much more favorably than it is today.

186,"
I have a confession to make: Even before the old Bob Dole became the new Bob Dole, our family station wagon wasn't exactly plastered with his bumper stickers. But last week I returned from an overseas trip to find that Dole was proposing to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, and I've changed my mind about the old guy.
\
Yes, sir, scrapping the gasoline tax. That's the sort of leadership America needs; that's the sort of spirit of sacrifice the country's been missing: a president who's ready to sacrifice the budget, to sacrifice the environment, to sacrifice energy conservation, to sacrifice oil reserves in order to save the American people 4.3 cents a gallon.
\
And when Dole's sidekick Dick Armey, the House majority leader, suggested that we consider cutting the education budget to make up for the lost gas tax revenue, well, then and there I knew I was a Dole man. I mean, cutting education to save Americans a few pennies a gallon at a time when their gas is already the cheapest in the world that's the kind of thinking that will keep us the world's most competitive nation in the 21st century. I sure hope the Japanese don't get that idea.
\
Are we out of our minds? Raising the gas tax has been one of the few smart things we've done in recent years. It promotes energy conservation, it helps protect the air, it encourages development of alternative energies, it promotes national security by reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies and it reduces the budget deficit. That 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax raises $5 billion a year. It is one of the reasons the deficit has been cut in half since 1993. Any proposal to repeal the gas tax should be hooted out of Congress with scorn. Unfortunately, that's not what President Clinton did. Instead, he's trying to trade his support for this idiotic gas-tax repeal for a Republican endorsement of his proposal to raise the minimum wage the worst sort of election-year poker. Clinton is saying to Dole: ""I see your foolishness, and I raise you one.""
\
It is hard to believe that the Dole proposal for repeal of the gas tax is effective even as political pandering. How many people are really going to change their votes from Clinton to Dole over 4.3 cents a gallon? Moreover, how can Republicans argue that a balanced budget and deficit reduction are the two most urgent priorities in American politics and then, when gas prices go up a bit due to seasonal factors, simply discard the gas tax without regard for the long-term budget implications?
\
""It only makes sense politically if it is part of a broader Dole strategy for lowering taxes,"" says Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard.
\
And then for Armey to even hint that we might pay for this giveaway by cutting education that takes your breath away. For a cheap political high with the shelf life of a dead fish, a House Republican leader is ready to cut $5 billion a year from education? How could such a thought even cross Armey's mind? Forget about what a Dole presidency would be like; if this keeps up, I'm not sure we can afford a Dole candidacy. The truth is we shouldn't be lowering our gas taxes; we should be raising them. Gasoline is probably the best bargain commodity in the U.S. marketplace. The latest blip aside, the real price of gasoline in the United States has been falling for 15 years (and, given that Iraqi oil sanctions are being eased by the United Nations, gas prices in the U.S. will likely resume that downward trend). In France and Italy, gas goes for $4.50 a gallon; in Japan, it costs $3.75. Most of the difference between their prices and ours is taxes that those governments use to finance public services. We could put a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on U.S. gasoline, get rid of the deficit and still have a huge competitive edge over the Europeans and Japanese.
\
""This is one of the easiest and most attractive ways of raising tax revenue, and we're just giving it away,"" says oil economist Vahan Zanoyan, of the Petroleum Finance Co.
\
In his speech announcing his resignation from the Senate, Dole insisted that ""my campaign for the president is not merely about obtaining office.""
\
""It's about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real,"" he said. ""My campaign is about telling the truth; it's about doing what is right.""
\
If that's true, then I can't wait for the Dole campaign to begin.

187,"
Senate Democrats conceded Monday that a temporary repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax increase was unavoidable, and Republican leaders prepared to tap the nation's savings institutions to pay for it.
\
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said the Senate could vote as soon as today on the tax cut, which he proposed less than two weeks ago. He planned to discuss the timing, as well as a Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage, with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
\
""We think (it) is inevitable,"" Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters. Republicans are ""in the majority. They have the votes to pass legislation.""
\
The leading proposal for paying for the cut, according to House and Senate aides, was separate legislation that strengthens the government fund insuring savings and loan deposits.
\
That plan requires a one-time premium payment from S&Ls, and, under budget rules, the money can be used to offset the tax cut. GOP leaders also are looking at a cut in Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.
\
The Clinton administration supports the S&L legislation, and Daschle said ""I'm not necessarily averse"" to using it to cut the gasoline tax.
\
Republican leaders are pushing hard for the repeal, which is seen as having wide popular appeal. Dole, Clinton's rival in the presidential race, notes repeatedly that the tax increase was approved ""without a single Republican vote.""
\
Many Democrats are criticizing the tax cut, saying it could amount to a windfall for the oil companies that pay the tax and ultimately pass it on to the consumer. And environmentalists maintain the tax cut would encourage more energy consumption and hurt the environment.
\
However, some Democrats feel compelled to vote for the tax cut, and Republicans are nearly unanimous in backing it.
\
At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton wanted the tax cut considered as part of a balanced budget but that does not mean Clinton had decided to veto the tax cut.
\
""If it comes to us separately, we'll look at it separately,"" McCurry said. ""We would hope that the Congress would give equal priority treatment to raising the minimum wage.""
\
With gasoline prices soaring roughly 20 cents a gallon since February, Dole on April 26 proposed shaving the 1993 increase of 4.3 cents off the 18.3-cent federal gasoline tax.
\
Dole (R-Kan.) suggested the Senate should act today, which marks what the private, business-financed Tax Foundation has called Tax Freedom Day. That is the date, according to its calculation, by which the average taxpayer has earned enough to pay federal, state and local taxes for the year.
\
The cut would begin in mid-May or the start of June and end on Dec. 31. Republicans hope to make it permanent as part of the 1997 budget.
"
188,"Electric vehicles are among the most promising of green technologies, offering cleaner air and lower greenhouse gas emissions than those produced with gasoline-powered vehicles.\But they face consumer resistance in many parts of the country, especially because of the relatively low range of miles they can travel between charges. Federal and state tax credits are one way to help advance the technology and build consumer confidence.\These incentives differ from those applied previously to hybrid vehicles. The new tax credits - up to $7,500 is available in federal incentives, and up to $5,000 in state credits can be claimed in some places - are only available for newly purchased, fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. The amount of the credit depends on the battery size, and it is phased out as sales increase. That is, the credit is designed to push a new technology, not to permanently subsidize electric cars.\Some complain the tax credits are unnecessary because they benefit affluent buyers who can afford costly electric vehicles. This may be true for buyers of the Tesla Model S or the BMW i8, but the credit also is available for less expensive models, such as the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt and Ford Focus Electric. Others object to the seemingly high value of the tax credits. Yet studies have shown that an even larger tax credit might be necessary to make up for the higher cost of electric vehicles, especially with gasoline's current low price.\Sales of electric vehicles have been rising but remain low, registering at about 10,000 per month compared to the 1.4 million conventional cars and light trucks sold in the same time. So electric vehicles constitute less than 1 percent of the market. If we want that to grow, with the benefits of reduced air pollution, improved public health and lower greenhouse gas emissions, we need to continue the credits or offer comparable incentives.\Why should government favor one technology over another through economic incentives? The idea is to foster a transition to greener energy sources.\That's also the reason to encourage many new transportation technologies. A combination of cleaner cars and better mass transit could have a major impact on urban air quality.\Yes, the electricity that runs electric vehicles may come from power plants fired by coal and natural gas, but those generating facilities typically are not located in urban cores. And as a greater percentage of electricity is produced from wind and solar energy, and as coal-fired power plants are phased out or cleaned up, the overall contribution to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions should come down.\Consider also that we rely overwhelmingly, about 83 percent, on fossil fuels as our energy source today, and those fuels remain heavily subsidized. There is no completely free market here.\As one example, the federal gasoline tax has not been increased since 1993 even though it now fails to generate sufficient revenue to pay for highway maintenance. States also are reluctant to raise the gas tax. Yet continued low gas taxes are another subsidy for drivers of conventional vehicles.\A carbon tax could stimulate market forces to promote many different green technologies, including electric vehicles. However, at the moment, it lacks sufficient political and public support. Until that environment changes, keeping the electric vehicle tax credit makes sense.\Credit: MICHAEL E.

Middle-income taxpayers in Wisconsin stand to save about $100 next year as a result of the 1% cut in the state income tax called for in the new budget.
\
And if you're married, you'll qualify for a bonus: an additional $120 break with the elimination of the marriage penalty for couples filing a joint return.
\
That's the good news out of Madison as after weeks of political wrangling, pettiness and sheer boredom the Legislature seems poised to give the $37.4 billion 1997-'99 state budget final approval this week and rush it to the governor's desk three months late. The tax news was mixed, however. Whatever you pocket, don't rush to spend it. You'll need it to pay a higher gasoline tax and auto registration fee.
\
If you have a child attending the University of Wisconsin, you'll need it for a boost in tuition. And if you smoke well, maybe you should think about quitting.
\
Even more bad news. For all the unanticipated revenue flowing into the state coffers during this vibrant economic period, there are troubling fiscal undercurrents because the state keeps spending more money.
\
In other words, your tax break today could spell bust in budgets to come, especially if the economy turns sour.
\
But for now, the opposing sides at the statehouse are euphoric for having broken the budget stalemate in the Senate.
\
More surprising than the Senate's swift passage of the budget by a 30-3 vote Thursday in verily the blink of an eye was the political odd couple that achieved the compromise: Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Chvala (D-Madison), Thompson's nemesis who unsuccessfully ran against the governor in 1994.
\
Chvala and Thompson's top aides, Administration Secretary Mark Bugher and Chief of Staff John Matthews, struck the deal, and late last week Chvala and Bugher were promoting it as the best bipartisan budget in years. Bugher was confident Republicans controlling the Assembly would pass it this week, putting aside their hard feelings over revisions of a budget version the Assembly adopted overwhelmingly the previous week.
\
Chvala and Bugher said the key points of the two-year spending plan are income tax breaks, primarily for low- and middle-income taxpayers; initiatives in education, health care and the environment; and a transportation package, a feat in itself considering the divisiveness over funding highways and mass transit in the last budget.
\
Under the Senate-passed budget, income tax rates would be reduced by 1% in 1998, and starting in 1999, the standard deduction and tax brackets would be ""indexed,"" or adjusted for inflation.
\
Wisconsin's top tax rate is now 6.93% for individuals earning $15,000 or more a year, or married couples filing a joint return on income of $20,000 or more a year. About 80% of all Wisconsin wage earners are in the top bracket.
\
However, the budget plan calls for reducing the top tax rate to 6.87%. A similar reduction in all three brackets would save taxpayers nearly $50 million.
\
Bugher said the impact of indexing in the following years is difficult to estimate. But he said the savings to taxpayers would be greater than the Assembly's plan to reduce rates by 1% each year for five years.
\
""The indexing provisions, and most tax experts would agree with this, are far more meaningful to taxpayers in the state than any five-year, one-time rate reduction because it's permanent, and it's indexed to inflation, and it drives the tax benefit to low- and middle-income taxpayers,"" he said. Added Chvala: ""Everybody will see a little more money in their pocketbook, but the great thing about indexing is that it will continue on and on, year after year, and the money will be targeted really at average-income families.""
\
While the Senate chose indexing over the Assembly's five-year rate reduction, the Senate did embrace the Assembly's plan to end the so-called marriage penalty.
\
As the tax code stands now, married couples filing jointly pay more taxes than they would if they filed separately, or two single taxpayers with incomes matching the married couple's earnings. To partially offset the penalty, married couples now get a credit of 2% on the second wage earner's income up to $15,000, resulting in a maximum $300 credit. Both houses have agreed on a maximum credit of $420, effectively eliminating the penalty.
\
Bugher and Chvala also touted property tax relief in the budget, chiefly two items:
\
Continued state funding of two-thirds of local school costs, a nearly $400 million a year item.
\
Restoring the lottery credit on property tax bills. With two years of receipts on hold, the average homeowner should receive a $100 credit this year.
\
Until 1996, the lottery credit went only to primary residences and farms, but non-residents with Wisconsin vacation homes went to court to have it applied to all property.
\
Chvala and Bugher said the bipartisan agreement planted a seed for seeking a constitutional amendment to target the credit to Wisconsin homeowners and farmers.
\
Sounding a warning amid all the self-congratulations was Todd Berry, executive director of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a private, non-partisan organization.
\
For all the talk about tax relief, however, Berry said the budget so far contains no major tax reform, despite a surprising $600 million windfall from unanticipated revenue the state has collected since November. He said the budget will spend $200 million of that to settle a longstanding suit over a pension fund raid.
\
Berry said indexing the income tax brackets was significant but long overdue, considering that low- and middle-income taxpayers have suffered from the ravages of inflation over the past decade. While the income tax rate reduction the first year will mean $49.8 million savings for taxpayers, he said that cigarette tax would increase by 15 cents to 59 cents per pack, raising more than $50 million. ""It looks pretty close to a wash,"" he said.
\
In addition to the cigarette tax increase, residents will pay a penny more for gasoline, currently taxed at 23.8 cents per gallon, and $5 more for auto registration, now $40 a year.
\
But what's disturbing about an otherwise vanilla, status quo budget, Berry said, is that spending exceeds collections by $350 million the first year and $150 million the second year.
\
""This will be the fourth year in a row where our revenues don't match our expenditures . . . I don't mean to be harsh, but we don't seem to get any more `big picture' thinking as time went on,"" Berry said. ""We took three or four months longer to do this, and all we did was make those kind of global fiscal issues worse.""

Would the further loss of 300,000 (construction) jobs, crumbling highways and bridges be worth the half tank gas we would get out of a gas tax holiday? Readily available facts are that the $40 billion Exxon Oil company profits of 2007 was the profit after the CEO received $16.7 million in compensation and after taxes were paid. This is definable and a windfall tax sounds like an idea well worth the effort to help our country out of the economic mess we are in. An April 19 letter gave a thoughtful picture of changing our way of living. In addition, this energy crisis demands government intervention on many fronts. Rescinding gas taxes is not the answer.

Data from the US Energy Department shows that so far in 2008 we used gasoline at a rate that should total 138 billion gallons for the year. Figuring an average price of $3/gallon of gas, and being conservative by giving ethanol only a 10 percent price effect, that calculates into savings of more than $40 billion.\Consumer expenditure data for 2007 is not yet available, but taking 2006 spending on food and bumping it up by the 4.4 percent rise in the Food Consumer Price Index suggests American's total food costs rose by a little more than $30 billion.

191,"Gov. Scott Walker unveiled a $68 billion two-year spending plan Tuesday night that calls for a sweeping expansion of private school vouchers, consolidating control over environmental regulation and natural resources, sharp cuts for the University of Wisconsin System and defunding public television and radio. They're the kind of ""go big and go bold"" ideas that Walker has promised as he lays the groundwork for a 2016 presidential run.\""I worry that too many of our fellow citizens feel that dream has become out of reach for them and their families. The budget plan we present tonight will help restore that American Dream right here in Wisconsin,"" Walker said in his 25-minute speech. ""Our plan is based on growth and opportunity ? which leads to freedom and prosperity for all.""\The proposal calls for borrowing $1.3 billion for road projects, rather than increasing the gas tax and other fee increases to address a long-term transportation shortfall. It cuts property taxes by $5 for the average value home in each of the next two years, but otherwise makes no major changes to the tax system. It holds school funding levels flat, and cuts 400 state positions; about half of them have been vacant for a year or more.\Walker previously revealed the UW System cuts and he had publicly expressed a desire to expand vouchers. But the proposal revealed new plans to make major changes at the Department of Natural Resources ? including the elimination of a number of scientists' jobs and putting off new land purchases for more than a dozen years ? and to defund Wisconsin Public Television and Wisconsin Public Radio.\Officials at WPT and WPR did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday night.\The 2015-17 budget proposal addresses a projected $2 billion shortfall, a figure that included agency requests, most notably through the UW cut, but also through myriad smaller cuts throughout state government, such as the consolidation of a handful of agencies. It also brings Dane County into a statewide program for the developmentally disabled and elderly.\The Republican governor's speech continued connecting his Wisconsin ideas to a national platform, a theme he has been hitting since his re-election speech in November.\""Our reforms will also improve programs that provide assistance to people in times of need. Here in Wisconsin, we help folks facing financial challenges,"" he said. ""For those who are able, however, these programs should be a temporary safety net ? not a hammock.""\Walker has repeatedly said he is committed to not raising taxes, and the budget includes a modest property tax cut ? one that will amount to about $5 in savings for a median value home each year.\""Just as I promised, property taxes by the end of 2016 will be lower than they were in 2014,"" Walker said. ""That means lower property taxes for six years in a row. How about that?""\Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, said the property tax remains a ""huge burden,"" but he acknowledged Walker's proposal represents ""an attempt to keep (property taxes) at an even zero"" rather than a significant reduction.\Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon, said Walker's proposal for cutting taxes, by adding about $211 million to the school levy credit, ""is a serious problem in my mind"" because ""it goes to the wealthier property value districts and nothing goes to schools.""\Walker rejected tax and fee increases suggested by his transportation secretary and instead proposed balancing the state's transportation budget by borrowing $1.3 billion for roads and infrastructure. That's an increase from about $1 billion in the current budget. Total borrowing is $1.6 billion, down from $2 billion in the current budget.\Fitzgerald said he's uncomfortable with the borrowing level for roads and that it's too early to rule out a vehicle registration fee increase.\""We either have to increase revenues or start cutting projects, and this Legislature may go there,"" he said.\UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank said Walker's $300 million proposed cut to the UW System, which represents about 13 percent of state support and 2.5 percent of overall UW funding, would hurt students and taxpayers.\""It would jeopardize the investment by Wisconsin taxpayers who have created a world-class institution in UW-Madison. It would hurt our students by increasing class sizes, reducing program offerings and potentially lengthening the time to graduation,"" Blank said in a statement. ""And it may provide less access for Wisconsin students to the state's flagship university."" The governor also called for an expansion of voucher schools and drug testing for public assistance recipients. He also wants to require able-bodied adults who receive food stamps to be enrolled in an employment and training program.\With his budget proposal, Walker is ""doing a beautiful job"" of keeping his feet in both worlds of state and national politics, said UW-Madison political science professor Barry Burden.\Walker has continued to avoid raising taxes, covered health care for low-income people without accepting the federal Medicaid expansion, continued to streamline state government and injected free-market principles into public education, Burden noted.\""That works really well with voters in Wisconsin and works especially well with Republican activists who will be key players in the nomination,"" Burden said.\Democrats railed against Walker's proposals. State Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, a member of the budget committee, called Walker ""the most anti-public education governor in the country.""\""Like the last budget, Gov. Walker's proposed budget leaves the people of Wisconsin behind, hurts our economy and shortchanges our children and the bright future they all deserve,"" Taylor said. ""We should be helping create the American dream for the people of this state, not destroying it.""\But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, praised Walker's agenda.\""I think that if you look at the priorities that he has laid out for our state focusing on economic development, reforming government, trying to ensure that government lives within its means by helping families, that's the exact set of priorities that all of us agree with,"" Vos said.\Walker's plan includes an operating budget of $68.3 billion for the two-year period if all funding sources are included. That figure includes about $32.8 billion in state money known as general purpose revenue.\In his speech, Walker did not address his proposed cuts to Wisconsin Public Television and Wisconsin Public Radio.\The state funding decrease amounts to about $2.5 million annually, Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick said.\She added that the budget preserves state support for Amber Alert and other emergency functions that the Educational Communications Board, which oversees WPT and WPR, carries out. And she said the administration believes the board will be able to make up the difference in program revenue through grants, gifts and private donations.\""It's important to note that nearly all programming costs are currently covered by program revenues, which include membership dues to PBS and NPR, and funding for their programming,"" Patrick said.\She added that less than 10 percent of programming costs were funded by the state in fiscal year 2014.\Credit: MARY SPICUZZA and MATTHEW DEFOUR , Wisconsin State Journal"

Gas prices expected to drop soon, U.S. says
\
Agency anticipates a national average of $1.46
\
By TOM HELD
\
of the Journal Sentinel staff
\
Friday, April 7, 2000
\
Gasoline prices should peak this month and decline to a national average of $1.46 a gallon for the summer, the Energy Department said Thursday.
\
Thursday's announcement dramatically revised the department's previous predictions of fuel prices soaring into the heavy driving season.
\
The nationwide average has been hovering around $1.52 a gallon for regular unleaded, but it should soon decline to $1.46 and stay there through the summer, then slide to $1.39 by September, the department's Energy Information Administration said.
\
In related developments:
\
-- The U.S. Senate approved, by a 66-34 vote, a non-binding resolution that opposes a reduction in the federal gas tax of 4.3 cents per gallon. Rollback critics said it would give little help to consumers while depriving the government of billions of dollars needed for road projects.
\
Wisconsin's gas tax increased 0.6 cents on April 1. The increase will cost vehicle owners about $20 million more a year.
\
State officials said the annual adjustment for inflation raised the state tax gas to 26.4 cents per gallon, which does not include a separate 3-cents-per-gallon levy that pays to dig up and replace leaking underground petroleum tanks. The federal gas tax is 18.3 cents per gallon.
\
-- By a separate 51-49 vote, the Senate paved the way to finding more domestic oil by including in the budget $1.2 billion in new revenue to be raised through leasing drilling rights on Alaska's fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
\
The Clinton administration and environmental groups have declared the refuge, breeding grounds for the caribou, off-limits to development. Clinton in 1995 vetoed a similar effort to open the wildlife refuge to oil exploration.
\
Assistant Senate Majority Leader Don Nickles (R-Okla.) said the measure has added importance this year because high gas prices are showing Americans the consequences of the nation's dependence on oil imports for 56% of its consumption.
\
He argued that Alaska lands could be opened to oil development without harming the environment or the caribou herds.
\
""You can do this in a sound, environmental way, and also reduce our dependence on foreign oil sources,"" Nickles said.
\
Sen. William Roth (R-Del.) said Congress is making ""an irreparable mistake"" by threatening to open up pristine areas of the Alaska refuge to oil drilling. ""There are parts of this Earth where it is good man can only come as a visitor. The Arctic Wildlife Refuge is one of those places,"" Roth said.
\
In Wisconsin, the price for regular gas already has dropped to the $1.40 to $1.45 range, compared with a peak average of $1.58 per gallon in March.
\
Steve Buchan, a cashier at the Citgo station at 11931 W. Janesville Road, Hales Corners, said the lower prices and revised projections will make his customers friendlier and more likely to tack a few snacks and sodas onto their gas purchase.
\
When the price of regular gas hit $1.58 at the station in March, Buchan noticed that motorists stopped smiling or buying those little impulse treats.
\
""They're not in a very good mood when they just paid $40 for gas,"" Buchan said. ""They were pretty much just coming in, paying for the gas and complaining.""
\
State tourism officials and Michael Bie, AAA Wisconsin spokesman, said they still expect the changes in gas prices to have little effect on tourism in the state this summer.
\
""I don't think it means a lot either way,"" Bie said of the news from Washington. ""As long as the economy's strong, and inflation is low, and unemployment is low, people are going to feel comfortable traveling.""
\
Thursday's slightly rosier price forecast was attributed to the recent decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to step up production. The Energy Information Administration projected that the additional supply would pull down the price of imported crude oil, from the current level of about $27 a barrel to $25 by June, then to $23.50 by the end of 2000 and $21.50 by the end of 2001.
\
But all these predictions are based on the assumption that conditions in the Middle East will remain stable. If there is a war (as there has been before between OPEC members), or an oil embargo, or if OPEC decided to turn down the spigot again, gasoline prices could soar.
\
While the forecast dampened the prospect of $2 per gallon for regular grade gasoline even in high-price areas, as once feared, motorists still will be paying about 25% more for gasoline this summer than last year, the forecast said.

High gas prices a political threat
\
Skyrocketing costs cast a cloud
\
By CRAIG GILBERT cgilbert@journalsentinel.com, Journal Sentinel
\
Sunday, May 23, 2004
\
Washington -- About this time four years ago, Republicans were ripping Vice President Al Gore over sky-high, $2-a-gallon gasoline prices.
\
""Gore Gas,"" they called it.
\
Now Democrats are returning the favor.
\
They're dubbing the White House ""Oil House"" in a new ""ad"" on the Web site of John Kerry's campaign, an effort to link high gas prices to the oil backgrounds of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and other administration figures.
\
For the second time in four years, a presidential election-year gas spike has drivers squirming and the parties pointing fingers at each other.
\
Behind the rhetoric, there are serious differences between Kerry and Bush on energy.
\
But how much either candidate's policies would do to lower gas prices is another question altogether. Energy experts, who tend to focus on the broader forces at work, aren't impressed by the substance of the campaign debate over gas prices.
\
""Both sides are politicizing it,"" says Pietro Nivola of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
\
""Everybody seems to be trying to gambit this for political advantage, to the point where both sides, I think, are making fools out of themselves,"" says Richard Shaten, who coordinates energy analysis and policy programs at the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
\
The price surge during the 2000 presidential race was different in key respects from this one. It was much more regional, slamming the Midwest. And it was closely tied to pipeline problems amplified by the changeover to summer gas blends, or boutique fuels, required by anti-pollution rules.
\
It faded as an issue when prices fell later in the summer, and whether it hurt Gore in the election is unclear.
\
But a tight supply of crude oil also played a role in that price surge, as it does today. Republicans blamed the Democratic White House for not getting the OPEC oil cartel to boost production, thereby easing pressure on prices.
\
Candidate Bush said he could ""jawbone"" the Saudis and Kuwaitis to ""open up the spigot.""
\
Today, the roles are reversed. Democrats blame the Republican White House for not getting tough with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and are hurling Bush's words back in his face.
\
""We should go to the Saudi government and other OPEC nations and demand that they increase supply,"" Kerry said in a radio address Saturday.
\
Analysts are skeptical
\
Many analysts are skeptical of the notion implicit in such claims -- that a president who has the right touch with OPEC can manage world oil prices. The Saudis announced Friday that they would expand production.
\
But experts note the larger forces behind the price trend, from seasonal patterns to increased demand (consumption by U.S. cars, massive industrial growth in China and India) to limits on supply (depleted oil fields -- many pumping near capacity -- and maxed-out refinery capacity in the U.S.). Speculative trading and turbulence in Iraq also are contributing.
\
""But the broad trend is that the resource is getting smaller; the demand is getting bigger,"" Shaten says.
\
Experts also note that while gas prices are setting records in many parts of the country -- $2.17 per gallon was Saturday's average for regular gasoline in southeastern Wisconsin -- they're still much lower in real, inflation-adjusted dollars than they were during the early 1980s price peak.
\
They're also much lower than in Europe, because of higher gas taxes there.
\
But for politicians -- as for many motorists -- rising gas prices are potential dynamite. That has fueled questionable claims and charges all around.
\
Kerry and Democrats are pillorying Bush for not diverting some oil from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which Bush wants to fill to capacity as a security cushion against attack or emergency.
\
But when President Clinton tapped the reserve four years ago to boost supply and ease prices, the effects were short-lived.
\
Shaten, who describes himself as no Bush fan, said blaming Bush for an OPEC supply crunch ""has no basis.""
\
Nivola also argues that the Democrats' clamor for lower gas prices is at odds with their calls for conservation and alternative energies. He says expensive oil happens to be the most powerful incentive to conserve -- to buy more efficient cars, for instance -- and invest in other sources of energy, which can't compete with cheap oil.
\
""The only way you can get some real energy efficiency and conservation is through higher (oil) prices. It's the one mechanism,"" Nivola says.
\
Higher gas taxes would have the same effect, but neither party supports that.
\
Republican issue: supply
\
What about Republican claims?
\
Bush said Wednesday that had Congress passed his energy bill, which included drilling in the Alaskan wildlife refuge, ""we would be in a much better situation today."" In other words, boosting U.S. oil production would help ease gas prices.
\
""The reason fuel prices are rising is simply that John Kerry and his fellow Democrats prefer to play politics with our energy policy, rather than enacting President Bush's comprehensive energy plan, which would ensure a reliable energy supply,"" says Bush spokesman Merrill Smith.
\
But the provision to drill in Alaska, a big part of Bush's effort to boost domestic oil production, was removed from the bill by not just Democrats; a small group of Senate Republicans helped kill it.
\
Of course, there's much else in the bill aimed at bolstering energy supplies.
\
Would legislation help?
\
Would the legislation, stalled largely because of Democratic opposition in the Senate, make gas any cheaper?
\
A February study by the government's own Energy Information Administration suggested the effects on gas prices would be negligible. In fact, it projected the plan would add a few cents to a gallon of gas over time because of its provisions on reformulated gas.
\
The study did not assess whether drilling in the Alaska refuge would help ease gas prices, since that provision had been stripped. Yet Nivola and Shaten say that because oil is a world market, and the protected Alaska fields would represent a fraction of world supply, drilling in Alaska would do very little to relieve gas- price pressures.
\
One way the Bush campaign is countering Kerry on gas prices is to portray him as a gas-taxer. Republicans regularly accuse the Democrat of backing a 50-cent increase in the gas tax. But the basis for that charge is thin and dated. Kerry expressed support for the idea on one occasion 10 years ago. He doesn't now. Kerry did back a 4.3-cent-per- gallon gas tax increase in 1993 and opposed later efforts to repeal it.
\
While both campaigns have made questionable claims about gas prices, their differences on energy policy, and how to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, are substantial. Those differences may bear more directly on issues other than the price at the pump, from the environment to foreign policy.
\
The broad difference in their approaches: Bush puts more emphasis on boosting U.S. energy supplies, Kerry more on reducing demand for oil through conservation and alternative energies.
\
As for the politics, House Republican Paul Ryan of Janesville admits that gas prices are a problem right now for Bush.
\
""I think it's a problem for incumbents, absolutely,"" Ryan says. ""I get people yelling at me (in parades): 'Do something about high prices!' ""
\
But Ryan also argues that ""it's going to be a problem for Kerry because of his gas-tax-increase track record.""
\
Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, contends that the Bush administration's historic ties to the oil industry give it a ""more serious vulnerability than most administrations"" on the issue.

Specific tax source sought for highways
\
Car sales tax should go to roads, builders say; others disagree
\
By LARRY SANDLER
\
of the Journal Sentinel staff
\
Tuesday, May 29, 2001
\
With state transportation officials warning of a looming $5 billion shortfall for state highways, road builders are quietly pushing to use vehicle sales taxes to help pay for roads, buses and trains.
\
At present, all revenue from the state's 5% sales tax has no specifically designated purpose.
\
The road builders' plan also would let local governments levy special sales taxes to support public transit systems, said Tom Walker, executive director of the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association.
\
But environmentalists, local governments and bus systems are urging lawmakers to slow down and come up with a plan that forecasts spending needs for all forms of transportation before they start splitting up the cash. Otherwise, they fear, local streets and transit lines could be shortchanged to finance highways.
\
Also, lawmakers are unlikely to support any measure that pulls sales tax dollars from other pressing state needs, such as schools, courts and shared revenue for local governments, said Rick Stadelman, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association.
\
Those different perspectives are likely to be discussed this week, as two legislative committees ponder transportation funding. When it meets Tuesday and Wednesday, the Joint Finance Committee is expected to consider state Department of Transportation spending in the 2001- '03 state budget.
\
The Assembly Transportation Committee will hold two public hearings on long-range plans for financing transportation:
\
-- 1 p.m. today at Chippewa Valley Technical College in Eau Claire, with a video link to the University of Wisconsin-Superior.
\
-- 1 p.m. Thursday at O'Donnell Park's Miller Pavilion in Milwaukee.
\
Previous hearings were in Green Bay and Wausau.
\
State Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greenfield), the Transportation Committee chairman, called the hearings after the state highway plan adopted last year called for spending $20.4 billion over the next 21 years -- or $5.1 billion more than current state gas taxes and vehicle license fees will raise.
\
That's also the driving force behind the road builders' plan, which Walker says he has been discussing informally with lawmakers for several months.
\
Walker suggests dividing transportation spending into three funds - - one for state highways and local roads, one for airports and one for public transit, railroads and harbors. The road fund would get all revenue from the gas tax and license fees, plus half the sales tax on vehicles, while the transit fund would get the other half of the sales tax.
\
Method used in Chicago
\
And instead of using property taxes to support their bus systems and future rail plans, cities and counties would be able to levy local sales taxes, under Walker's plan. That's the same mechanism used to fund other transit systems around the country, including the Chicago area's Regional Transportation Authority, he said.
\
Dedicating specific types of revenue for specific types of transportation would produce greater accountability, Walker argued.
\
Stadelman and Rob Kennedy, senior policy analyst for Citizens for a Better Environment, agreed that the state needs new ways to pay for transportation. And transit advocates have long backed setting up a dedicated transit revenue source and weaning bus systems off property tax revenue.
\
But with highway needs receiving more publicity than transit needs at this point, Kennedy said he's concerned that any funding plan could focus on state highways while ""local programs, including transit, are going to be scrambling for the crumbs.""
\
""Everybody knows the $5 billion number. Nobody knows the $4.7 billion number,"" which is what could be needed over the next 20 years to keep up local roads and bus systems, run a high-speed train line across the state and build commuter rail systems in the Milwaukee and Madison areas, Kennedy added.
\
The DOT has completed its long-range highway, airport and bicycle plans, and is finishing its railroad and pedestrian plans, but has not produced any transit or local road plans, Kennedy and Stadelman said. That's why they and other local officials and transit backers want a comprehensive plan, covering all transportation modes, before dealing with funding issues.
\
State Sen. Brian Burke (D-Milwaukee), the finance panel co- chairman, is preparing to try to amend the 2001-'03 budget to call for that type of a plan. But Walker, a former top DOT official, said he doubted this could be completed even in time to affect the 2003- '05 budget.
\
That budget will confront lawmakers with paying for the first of the massive road projects ahead: reconstruction of the Marquette Interchange and nearby pieces of I-94, I-43 and I-794 in downtown Milwaukee, a $1.4 billion job starting in 2004.
\
Rebuilding the rest of the freeways in the Milwaukee area alone is expected to cost several billions more.
\
The Legislature is just starting to talk about how to come up with that money.
\
Last week, the finance panel recommended spending $160 million in 2001-'03 for engineering and design work on the interchange.
\
One idea the finance committee rejected during that debate was selling the naming rights to roads and interchanges.
\
That recommendation, from Rep. David Ward (R-Fort Atkinson), failed after panel members recoiled at the thought of motorists driving through the Coca-Cola Interchange in downtown Milwaukee.
\
But Stone said the naming rights idea deserves more study.

195," Last week, we asked you for ideas on how to cut our seemingly insatiable demand for fuel. Here's a sampling of reader views. More online: www.madison.com/wisconsinstatejournal/\ 'Free ride' is over\ It has been over 30 years since the oil embargo and we have forgotten that we are dependent on other countries for our energy. With gas approaching $2 a gallon, we have finally realized that we are not growing petroleum-based products on trees and Jed Clampett won't hit oil while out hunting in the back 40.\ I've met people who commute from Stoughton to the West Side of Madison or from Baraboo to the East Side. We are using the most energy globally and we are going to pay the price for it whether it's now or later. And all energy, whether it's LP, gas for boats, planes, mowers and blowers, affects the price of this commodity. The ""free ride"" that we have been enjoying will soon be over and how we solve our energy problems will largely determine our future.\ - J. L. Zimmerman, McFarland\ Hike gas taxes\ Using higher federal gas taxes to reduce gasoline consumption is a good idea, and would also tend to reduce summer ozone levels and slow the increase in carbon dioxide levels. The increased federal revenues could be devoted to the Medicare Trust Fund, perhaps allowing a reduction in regressive Medicare payroll taxes.\ Taxing pollution more and employment and labor less would benefit the U.S. economy and assist our transition to a clean energy economy in closer harmony with the earth.\ - Robert H. Owen Jr., Middleton\ Try biodiesel fuels\ This country's suicidal dependence on fossil fuels is demonstrated in chilling statistics from a book about biodiesel, a fuel made from oilseed crops such as soybeans and canola. The city of Madison is testing biodiesel blends in some of its diesel vehicles, and Europeans use the fuel extensively in commercial and personal vehicles.\ ""From the Fryer to the Fuel Tank,"" by Joshua Tickell, reminds us of the oil shocks of the 1970s when the OPEC nations raised the world price of oil from $10 to $56 per barrel. We weathered that economic crisis with fuel conservation (missing from the Bush ""energy policy"") and massive exploitation of our other fossil fuel sources.\ Oil and gas reserves won't save us again. We are probably within five to 10 years of the ""point of no return,"" when we've consumed half of the available, affordable oil in existence and the OPEC nations will control the world oil market. We can grow the main ingredient for biodiesel, a rigorously-tested and impressively clean fuel that would be superb for trucks, trains, boats and farms. We need to pursue renewable fuels, vehicle fuel efficiency, mass transportation options and personal conservation.\ - Mary V. Bowman, Madison\ Driving cheaper\ While concern over the rising price of gas on the state and national level continues, there is one fact that goes unmentioned. Wisconsin continues to be the least expensive Midwestern state in which to operate a vehicle. This is something worth reporting.\ Yes, our state gas tax is high, but the average motorist's fuel tax expense plus the state's annual vehicle registration fee equals a total of $248 - the lowest annual operating expense among our neighboring states. In fact, the average cost per mile to operate a car has declined since 1990 due to increased fuel efficiency.\ Despite indexing, Wisconsin's gas tax revenues have not kept pace with inflation. The gas tax was 7 cents per gallon in 1966 and would be 40 cents today if it had been tied to inflation. It is clear additional revenue is needed to improve and maintain the state's transportation system. Policymakers and the public must think long term about how we fund transportation projects and provide alternatives to our dependence on the gas tax. If we do not diversify revenue, the gas tax will need to be increased because that is the state's primary transportation financing mechanism. The alternatives are reduced safety and gridlock, which are really not alternatives at all.\ - Todd Pierce, Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin\ We are the enemy\ Gasoline prices are the result of supply and demand. Because we use so much, we are half of the problem. Very few drivers really need a four-wheel drive, large and powerful engines, ""big duallie"" rear axles, cavernous vans or two-ton sedans. If the price of gasoline jumped to $5 per gallon and stayed there, most drivers would seek more fuel-efficient vehicles. Manufacturers would soon provide more of them to stay in business. Our damage to the environment, national balance of payments, dependency on foreign oil and consumption of resources would all be reduced. To quote Pogo, ""We have met the enemy, and they is us.""\ - Roland Peck, Madison\ Tax gas guzzlers more\ There are multiple Web sites directing you towards the cheapest gas station in town, so there are certain methods of keeping driving affordable. However, there is hardly anything being done to try to cut our fuel demands. Cutting our fuel intake now will affect our environment with less polluted air, slowing of global warming and possibly even the hole in the ozone layer would start to repair itself.\ Because larger cars consume more gas, a higher tax should be placed on these types of cars. If it is necessary to raise the tax on all gasoline, so be it - Americans have one of the lower gas price averages.\ - Elyse Lofgren, Madison\ Encourage hybrid sales\ Although Ford is making hybrid cars, I don't think they advertise them well. The first time I heard of these vehicles was when I was watching a news story on the Ford Escape. I think everyone should have a car like this. Toyota plans on selling 300,000 hybrids by 2006, but I think that's too far away. We need to think about now, and get more hybrids on market so people see them and buy them.\ - Matt Decker, Madison"

A host of transportation groups have set aside any past differences to unite around a common theme: preventing lawmakers from drawing on transportation revenues to balance state books.
\
On Tuesday, these groups formed under an umbrella known as TRUST, an acronym standing for Transportation Revenues Used Strictly for Transportation. Including motorists, truckers, builders, unions, public transit authorities and local governments, the coalition is mounting a diverse effort to sway Gov. Jim Doyle and state legislators from again siphoning a large amount of money from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation to pay for aids to schools and local governments.
\
At a news conference in Madison unveiling the coalition, TRUST members made a case for the sanctity of the state's segregated transportation fund, which is composed almost exclusively of the gas tax and a $55 annual registration fee. In the last budget, lawmakers pulled $675 million from this fund to help plug a $3.2 billion state budget deficit, and made up all but $110 million through borrowing.
\
The increased bonding now means WisDOT must spend in excess of $40 million every two years just to pay off debt, and while the next state budget deficit won't be as great, TRUST members acknowledged that the transportation fund is an appetizing target for cash.
\
The temptation to divert transportation revenue to other (programs) is strong, said Ernie Stetenfeld, vice president of corporate relations for AAA Wisconsin and a co-chairman of the TRUST coalition.
\
Gas tax increases
\
There are other pressures on the transportation fund that concern TRUST. Various lawmakers have expressed displeasure with the automatic yearly increase to the gas tax, which provides most of the state's transportation revenues. Despite the annual indexing, the gas tax lags far behind increases in sales- and income-tax revenue and is increasingly asked to do more even as it loses buying power to more fuel-efficient cars, according to TRUST.
\
WisDOT's major projects program is also short of funds, so short that the biannual meeting of the Transportation Projects Commission to approve new big projects likely won't take place later this year.
\
And if lawmakers do tap the transportation fund for nontransportation programs, it could set off a cascading series of events. The state still hasn't identified how it will pay for the second half of the $810 million reconstruction of Milwaukee's Marquette Interchange, and a proposal backed by the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association to fund the project through cash and short-term borrowing hinges on a fully funded WisDOT.
\
User fees suggested
\
Doyle's administration recently announced its intention to proceed with a $1 billion reconstruction of the Interstate 94 corridor south of Milwaukee, and it plans to include money in the upcoming budget to kick off planning and an environment study for the job. Still, the project figures largely into WisDOT's $5 billion deficit projected through 2020.
\
We are very concerned about preserving transportation funding, said Peter Beitzel, vice president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, another TRUST member.
\
Tom Walker, WTBA's executive director, said the public and its elected representatives need to view transportation user fees in the same way they perceive state Department of Natural Resources' hunting and fishing license fees. Hunters and anglers are comfortable with those charges because they know the fees will protect and enhance the resources that make outdoor sports possible, he said.
\
That user-fee concept is what unites all the groups here today, Walker said.
\
And, TRUST members argued, adequate transportation funding will provide thousands of jobs, make for safer roadways and boost the development of minority-owned businesses.
\
Doyle is expected to roll out his budget proposal early next year.

197,"Other GOP states have raised gas tax\Iowa did it. \Indiana did it. \They both raised their state gas tax by 10 cents per gallon. And they both did it with Republican-controlled state office-holders. \Iowa will net about $213 million, and Indiana will raise an additional $1 billion per year. One Indiana legislator, who had signed a ""no new taxes"" pledge, signed onto the bill because, as he said, ""it just made good sense."" \With gas hovering about $2.25 per gallon, could there be a better time to raise the gas tax? \To our state legislators: You have explored all the possibilities. So now it is time to improve our roads and put people to work. The gas tax is the fairest and most direct way to increase revenue. \Our constitution provides a way to prevent one person from holding up progress: It is called the veto override. \Stuart Vamstad, Darlington \Health care is getting fragmented \More companies are offering health and wellness services at the job site. And pharmacies also offer non-urgent health care at the corner drug store. \These alternatives to making an appointment to see your personal health care provider are billed as employee benefits and cost-effective. \What ever happened to the concept of a medical home? At the medical home you could see the familiar faces of staff, discuss recommendations from consultants and have all patient records at your fingertips (I hear you, Epic Systems). Just being in such an environment is therapeutic in itself. \I'm afraid medical care at the job site is contributing to medical care becoming a fragmented commodity. \Jeff Seltz, Middleton \GOP budgets put environment at risk \At both the federal and state levels, budget cuts to science and conservation programs have been severe. Recent algae blooms occurring in our Madison lakes, earthquakes in Oklahoma due to fracking, and the lack of proper maintenance of our state and national parks should concern every American. \At one time, our Wisconsin park system and the water quality of our lakes were the envy of the nation. Gov. Scott Walker has cut park funding while increasing fees on visitors. Yet Walker is now proposing spending $2 million to promote lottery games. \President Donald Trump wants to cut the entire funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has helped combat invasive species such as Asian carp and clean up toxic chemicals while protecting and restoring wetlands and wildlife habitat. \Yet Trump wants to build a border wall costing U.S. taxpayers billions, because he hasn't figured out a way to make Mexico pay for it, which he promised during his campaign. \We depend on a clean environment for jobs, food security and the health of our families. The Republican budgets under Trump and Walker put all of that at risk. \Bruce Bloedorn, Middleton \More children need discipline \Thanks for the July 20 letter to the editor, ""Teens need good parents, not curfew."" \My sister lives in Milwaukee, where the curfew has been place for shopping malls, and it has made a huge improvement. \Some young people's behavior in public places - malls, medical waiting rooms, coffee shops, on city buses - is deplorable. If they are with their parents, some decent conduct may follow. \The writer of the letter is correct. We don't need televisions, cellphones or a mall curfew. We need good parents. They are your children. Discipline them. \Helen Spring, Madison \Bad morals to blame for gun violence \The proliferation of gun violence in large American cities and now in Madison is disheartening to all law-abiding citizens. \We must establish that guns don't cause these deaths. An even bigger problem is not teaching good morals around the country. Instead young hearts and minds have been infected with evil thoughts, which lead to these horrific actions and deeds. \A person's upbringing with absentee moms and dads is part of the problem, but the bigger problem is the rejection of teaching and training by people in authority. \We must remember that every human being has a sin nature. As Jeremiah 17:9 says: ""the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: Who can know it'"" \There's always hope for everyone if a new attitude is instilled in a person's heart. It is wonderful when we read about the attitudes of good Samaritans helping others in time of need instead of another gun violence murder statistic. \Wayne Alden, McFarland"
198,"It's a pretty simple equation.\If you're going to build, fix and improve roads, bridges and public transit across Wisconsin, you're going to need more money. \Wisconsin hasn't raised its gas tax in seven years. And the federal government hasn't raised its gas tax in decades. \At the same time, more fuel efficient vehicles - and some that don't use any petroleum at all - will continue to erode gas tax revenue. \The state's other big source of funding for its transportation needs comes from vehicle registration fees, which are lower than in surrounding states. \So how will Wisconsin pay for its roads and public transit systems over the next decade? \That's a glaring and difficult question that a state panel just tackled, with strong results. The Wisconsin Transportation Finance and Policy Commission recommended several options - all of which deserve serious consideration: \* Increase the gas tax by 5 cents. That would increase combined state and federal gas taxes to 56.3 cents per gallon, putting it in the middle of the pack for Midwestern states. \The gas tax is really just a user fee. It's one of the fairest ways to pay for roads, and it brings in more revenue from out-of-state tourists and over-the-road trucks. It also could encourage more fuel efficiency, which saves money and helps to protect the environment. \* Charge vehicle owners a registration fee based on the mileage a vehicle travels, and increase registration fees on big trucks a proportionate amount. \* Increase the cost of an eight-year driver's license by $20 to $54. \* Eliminate a sales tax exemption on trade-ins. \No-stop tolling on the interstates also should be an option, though the state panel didn't recommend it. Unfortunately, no-stop tolling would require permission from Congress, which won't be easy. \Not all of the panel's recommendations will move forward. The governor, for example, has stubbornly opposed a gas tax increase, even though he has pledged to make roads a priority. \State leaders also need to convince the public the extra money won't be raided for other purposes. That will require approving a constitutional ban on such raids, which appears likely in the coming legislative session. \The state panel that made the recommendations was dominated by Republican appointees. Yet former Madison mayor and environmentalist Dave Cieslewicz participated as a Democratic appointee and embraced the overall package. He noted the panel's endorsement of higher funding for transit, bicycle and pedestrian projects. \Good roads and public transit help foster economic development and jobs. Flat funding won't cut it. Flat funding will only lead to project delays. \State leaders need to act so people and products can quickly and safely get to where they need to go. \WHAT DO YOU THINK? \Do you support a higher gas tax, vehicle registration fees based on mileage, or other ways to pay for Wisconsin's growing transportation needs?

Well, sorry, but last time I looked, cigarettes are still sold almost everywhere. And, those smokers you hate so much are paying mucho taxes on them. So, you want them to quit? OK, let's try that. Are you going to open your checkbooks and cover the costs yourselves? I didn't think so. Without cigarette tax money, the government would have to look elsewhere.

The surrounding areas where smoking is allowed have flourished.\So, the next time little Johnnie wants to go bowling in a smoke-free environment, why not talk to the owner?

Its rapacious expansion of ambulance service in competition with a well-performing private, but non-profit company, actually endangers lives and should be halted. The city's annexations of parts of the towns of Wilson and Sheboygan have gobbled up land out of proportion to any population growth and are not good for either the environment or local self-rule.\James Tobin, Town of Wilson\Toll roads\As state gas tax revenue falls due to decreased driving and better fuel efficiency, the idea of toll roads again raises its ugly head. Don't even think about letting the toll-road genie out of the bottle; you'll never get it back in. Instead, an independent audit should be done, and all of the money misappropriated from the transportation trust by all previous administrations should be replaced. Do people really think the gas tax will go away if tolls are implemented?\Tom Pilgrim, Kohler\Term limits\Since we have a dysfunctional Congress, divided into tribes, and a Supreme Court that claims people need not be biological beings, I have a modest suggestion for a constitutional amendment which could cure some gridlock: The president would serve a single six-year term.

It will be the so-called, self-proclaimed, ""compassionate conservatives"" and all those who are manifestly greater, superior, wiser or happier than those with some degree of misfortune or sickness. The malignity of the ""ultra right"" disgustingly looks downward, without pity in their pocket, on the helpless, sick and weak, until the time comes, when they too, or their loved ones, will also need care.\Dan Sohre, Cleveland\City administrator\The Common Council approved a city administrator answerable only to the Common Council president. Currently, the mayor is accountable to the people through elections and recalls. The new administrator is not. The administrator's contract runs through 2015, and Ald. Jim Bohren said it'll be ""almost impossible"" to remove him before it expires. The result: Sheboygan residents can no longer choose or oversee our city's top leader. Council members who voted for this change demonstrated little respect for democracy or the citizenry of Sheboygan.

SUNDAY SYMPOSIUM
\
Our transportation future
\
Consumers can take responsible steps
\
Sunday, May 30, 2004
\
In his May 25 letter, David Onken called on us for action ""to pressure government, industry and consumers to abandon their shortsighted ways and finally act in a socially responsible way when it comes to our reliance on Mideast oil and fossil fuels in general."" He suggested that keeping the price of gasoline at the pump at high levels or even higher will accomplish this (""Let's take action to end reliance on Mideast oil"").
\
Who is kidding whom here? I agree that members of the groups mentioned are shortsighted, especially the government. As shortsighted consumers, our actions need to be in the direction of showing the industry we really care.
\
First, we need to lobby our government so the entire country is put on a 10% ethanol blend: We cut our oil needs by 10%; our corn farmers reap huge benefits; our air is cleaner everywhere. Then, we need to take seriously the suggestions in the May 23 Transportation section. Consumption can be lowered, folks, and that will go much farther than keeping the price high.
\
Don't misread. There are things going on that will not help the consumer, and those involved don't care one whit about the consumer. We are being caught between two hard places. We have met the enemy, and he is us!
\
Fred Kurth Menomonee Falls
\
U.S. still depends too much on fossil fuels
\
In the May 23 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, H. Sterling Burnett wrote about the need to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development (""Drilling would ease U.S. dependence,"" Crossroads). However, Burnett did not offer any ways to eventually wean the United States from the world's dwindling supplies of fossil fuels.
\
If ANWR oil is drilled, it will eventually dry up. The U.S. will need to find alternative energy sources. Some may think that this is 30 to 40 years in the future and that there will a technological solution. During the energy crisis of the early 1970s, one would have also thought that we would solve this problem in 30 years. Obviously, we are more dependent on fossil fuels than ever.
\
To drill in ANWR as part of a comprehensive plan to slowly decrease fossil fuel use should be an acceptable compromise. To drill in ANWR just so we don't have to pay $2 per gallon to fill up our SUVs is shortsighted and irresponsible.
\
Andy Jacobson Manitowoc
\
Don't forget taxes in pricing equation
\
This is in reference to the extensive coverage about gas prices in the May 23 Crossroads section, which seems to have missed a real factor: taxes -- what are they, both federal and state, and what were they 10 years ago? An examination of states bordering Wisconsin may explain why motorists will drive 10 to 20 miles for a tank fill- up.
\
It has also been reported that no new refinery has been built in the past 10 years or more. That being the case, it would follow that the business is not very lucrative. I wonder what the industry pays in taxes and what the profit margin is.
\
Without additional capacity, new or additional crude would not get to the market faster. I believe that increased capacity is needed to increase competition and allow the free market system to work.
\
Erwin Mrozinski Greenfield
\
We must come up with a better plan
\
In Charles Krauthammer's column ""Raising gasoline tax would help consumers, economy,"" he proposed to create a new gas tax that would keep pump prices at a floor of $3 per gallon (Crossroads, May 23). The concept of a gas tax has merits, but his plan would be a disaster.
\
If the price of gas could never fall below $3, it would be Big Oil, not the federal government, that would be the beneficiary. Sure, demand for gas would be reduced, but the burden for paying the taxes would fall on the middle- and working-class drivers. Rather than soaking those who now drive fuel-efficient vehicles, a better solution would be to target those who drive the gas-guzzling vehicles.
\
Create a hefty luxury tax for those who insist on cruising around in SUVs. Raise fuel efficiency standards for the vehicles produced by the automobile companies. Provide incentives -- in the form of tax credits -- to the car companies, so they will be willing to produce smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.
\
Finally, the federal government should make a major commitment to develop alternative sources of energy, improve and expand public transportation and create viable alternatives to gas-powered cars.
\
David Granik Milwaukee
\
Changes could prompt some alternatives
\
We are in a global economy and compete with others to obtain the oil for our gasoline.
\
A large part of what we pay for gasoline consists of state and federal taxes. This makes our cost higher and interferes with our ability to compete for oil. It also adds costs to the price of gas such as administration to collect the tax by the distributors.
\
Here is an interesting idea: Eliminate all tax on gasoline. In exchange, pass a tax law that says:
\
1) If oil companies are unable to come up with a proposal that makes drilling for oil and natural gas with minimal impact on the environment within five years, their dividends will be taxed at a rate of 1/2 the gas tax and 100% of the gas tax adjusted for inflation in 10 years.
\
2) If people fail to purchase more efficient vehicles within five years, their income will be taxed at a rate of 1/2 the gas tax and 100% of the gas tax adjusted for inflation in 10 years. A certification of the purchase of a fuel-efficient vehicle will avoid the tax.
\
Pending developments, the government should no longer build roads but merely maintain what is there. The pressure on consumers of individual transportation might lead to entrepreneurs finding alternative modes.

202,"Dane County budget is a bright spot\In the midst of dark political news elsewhere in the state and nation, I commend the Dane County Board for developing a people's budget, which County Executive Joe Parisi has signed. \The increase in the 2017 budget, which invests more in infrastructure, the environment and human services, will add about the cost of a monthly cup of Starbucks coffee to the average Madison property tax bill. \Climate is the big winner. The budget provides for new solar development. It increases conversion of renewable landfill methane to clean-burning compressed natural gas. This will help fuel county vehicles. The budget will help develop a county-wide climate action plan. Local governments, businesses, electric utilities and environmental advocates will join a new council on climate change, and a new Office of Energy and Climate Change will reside within the county executive's office. \I wish Gov. Scott Walker and President-elect Donald Trump would take a page from Dane County's playbook. I am proud to live in this progressive, forward-looking county that is resolutely bucking the tide in the state Capitol and the soon-to-be Trump administration. \Carol Steinhart, Madison \Donate to your local food pantry \What a timely and thoughtful message by Dr. Zorba Paster in his Nov. 20 column about thankfulness. He stated the two questions that doctors should ask patients to screen for hunger: Do you ever worry about running out of food? Have your ever run out of food before you had money to buy more? \Reading those questions brought tears to my eyes. As a retired educator, I am fully aware of the inability of children to learn when they are hungry. Because of this great need, I am now a regular volunteer at my local food pantry. \Families are working hard to provide for their children, and some are just one illness or car repair away from financial disaster. People are so grateful for the healthy variety of food available, thanks to so many generous individual donors, businesses and civic groups. \People have many opportunities to donate to food pantries this time of year, so please join me and Dr. Paster in the challenge to fight hunger. Your local food pantry will appreciate items to fill their shelves, and can stretch your financial contributions further than you can imagine. \Susan Taylor, Verona \Raise alcohol, beer and gas taxes \Gov. Scott Walker and the Legislature have dug a hole in our state budget due to an inability or refusal to raise taxes, and they won't accept federal underwriting of Medicaid and other programs. \I suggest two options. \First, increase the tax on alcohol and beer. The beer tax hasn't been raised in a half century. That would raise lots of revenue for education, mental health education and alcohol and drug treatment. Second, increase the gas tax a nickle, and you'll raise lots of additional money for highways and bridges. That's it, these are user fees, not taxes. \Fees have already been raised for using state parks, hunting and licensing a car. But, oh, state leaders owe the corporate lobbyists too much to make a change. Good luck spending more and taxing less. \Tom Heine, Madison \Immigrant history is more complex \Friday's letter to the editor ""Immigrants should learn from history"" could use a lesson from the past. \Speaking of her ethnic heritage, the writer says, ""They didn't have tellers at the banks, grocery stores or any stores speaking Norwegian or German."" \But here in New Glarus, most of our store owners and clerks spoke their native Swiss dialect with their customers well into the 1960s. Our fourth-generation fathers and mothers often spoke Swiss or Norwegian until they entered grade school. Many country schools were taught in the native language, be it Swiss or Norwegian. \A friend's father, born around 1900, spoke Swiss first, then moved to the Primrose area, where he had to learn in a school taught in Norwegian. Despite being born here, English was his third language. \Many of our churches held at least one service each Sunday in the native language. A classmate often spoke of going to his grandparents' home in Hillsboro in the 1960s, where Czech was still actively spoken both in trade and casual conversation. \If we were to go back to America's roots, we would be speaking one of over 300 languages used by the Native Americans, whose land we stole. \Kim Tschudy, New Glarus \Pitts is right to take head-on course \Leonard Pitts Jr.'s writing is always insightful and intelligent. His column last Monday was no exception. \Instead of sinking into depression and withdrawing in fear from the hateful and racist threats posed by President-elect Donald Trump and his associates, Pitts offers a courageous and head-on course of action for those of us who voted in the popular majority and against Trump and somehow lost. \If you can march, then march, said Pitts. If you can confront legislators, do it. If you can boycott, boycott. Or if you can volunteer time and money to ""progressive, inclusive and compassionate"" organizations and causes, do that. Or do it all. \Pitts is, no doubt, accustomed to the inevitable criticism of snipers because he speaks truth to power. He writes on courageously.

203,"Evan Braun and Rebecca Clarke will square off Tuesday to represent Democrats in the 26th Assembly district race against Republican incumbent Terry Katsma.\Katsma was elected in 2014.\Evan Braun\Evan Braun is a 22-year-old graduate of UW-Milwaukee. He has a degree in Music Theater Performance and graduated in May. He said he has volunteered in campaigns for Barack Obama, Russ Feingold and Scott Walker's recall election.\""I have seen firsthand what the Walker administration and current republicans have done to the school district within this area, to the UW system,"" Braun said of why he chose to run.\Braun was born and raised in Sheboygan. He said the biggest differentiation between him and his opponent, Rebecca Clarke, is she did not buy all her campaign materials from union printers.\""I think it's disingenuous to speak in favor of unions and to say you're pro-union and to not use labor unions for your print materials on the campaign,"" Braun said.\Clarke said that was a mistake on her part at the beginning of her campaign and she has since used a printer in Manitowoc that is union for her materials.\When it comes to funding a hole in the state transportation fund, Braun said he is in favor of focusing on the gas tax, rather than road fees because it still ensures people are paying into the infrastructure system who use it. He also supports the tuition freeze for the UW System, but that the state needs to give more funding to the system.\Braun is in favor of giving more power to local municipalities to levy property taxes. He cited Sheboygan Falls, which has had multiple referendums to try and come up with funds for the school district, as an example.\""I would be in favor of allowing different municipalities to govern themselves and create a tax base as they see fit,"" Braun said.\Braun is pro-union, and opposes Right-to-Work and Act 10, but he said he found common ground with the Walker administration and the Republican legislature when they froze tuition and when Walker left students with the ability to control segregated fees. He was in charge of lobbying for the latter on behalf of students. Students were already able to control seg fees, but Walker vetoed a Republican change in the budget that would have eliminated that right.\Rebecca Clarke\Rebecca Clarke is not originally from Sheboygan. She worked for UW-Stevens Point and UW-Extension in environmental education before coming to Sheboygan to work as the park naturalist at Maywood Park for ten years.\Clarke said spending so much time in environmental education is what prompted her to run. She said the state of education cuts and environmental deregulation needs to be addressed.\That experience and passion for education and the environment is also what differentiates her from Braun, she said.\""For me, it's more just about the experience. Having some more contact statewide in some of these areas that I want to work on within the DNR, within Extension,"" Clarke said. ""And I think just in looking over some of his stances, I just want more specifics.""\Clarke is also pro-union, and said she wants to repeal Act 10. She said she does not believe that the financial problems the state experience were a result of unions, saying that Minnesota did not ""bust their unions"" in the face of financial difficulties. However, she said she never belonged to a union while she worked for the state.\She is also in favor of focusing on the gas tax to fund gaps in the transportation fund and continuing the UW System tuition freezes, so long as the cuts to the system stop. The state may need to consider allocating funding by region, rather than county or municipality to cover more roads during maintenance, she said.\She added that she believes the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation has given away too much money to corporations that haven't stayed in state and it should be abolished.\Clarke also believes that the state should allow municipalities to raise property tax rates. She said it is less of a problem for cities, and needs to be lifted for small towns to be able to raise funds.\She had a more specific example of how she has agreed with Republicans in the legislature. Clarke met several times with Sheboygan-area State Senator Devin LeMahieu after Wisconsin DNR grants were cut. They would have been able to save the City of Sheboygan thousands, and after meeting with him, she said they were reinstated.\The winner of Tuesday's primary will go on to face Katsma on November 8 in the general election."
204,"Burke understands business and labor\My political bias was formed early in life by my grandmother. ""The rich always get richer when Republicans are in office,"" she would say as she related the story of living and farming in The Great Depression. \The object of her disdain was President Herbert Hoover, whom she said ignored obvious signs that income and wages were rapidly eroding. \A classic conservative, Hoover stubbornly pushed on with his low-tax, government austerity policies. Most economists confirm my grandma's real-life observations - that government austerity only makes a failing economy worse. \So it was no great surprise that Wisconsinites elected Scott Walker four years ago as the nation struggled to recover from the Great Recession. Also not surprising is the result of Walker's spending cuts, his rejection of federal cost-sharing programs, his pro-business agenda and attack on the working class. \We have an opportunity to reverse this by electing Mary Burke as our next governor. As a Democrat, Burke understands a vibrant economy can only be achieved when wages outpace the cost of living. \As a business owner, she understands a strong economy requires business and labor working together. \- Dean Dickel, Shullsburg \Interstates in Wisconsin need tolling \Gov. Scott Walker is floating the idea of replacing the gas tax with a sales tax. This sounds like a proposal a Democrat would make. The goal is to fund the highway program to benefit those who use the roads and cause the deterioration of our roads. \An automobile or a truck now can fill its fuel tanks in Rockford and drive to Minneapolis and not buy a drop of fuel in Wisconsin - while pounding Wisconsin highways. \No fuel taxes or sales taxes will be collected by Wisconsin. The only fair way to collect road taxes would be to have toll roads that collect taxes from those using the roads. \Our interstate system should be the source of highway income. Motorists could pay in cash or electronically. \This would be a use tax. If you use it, pay for it. \- Bill Evans, Stoughton \Take responsibility for own actions \Newspapers are full of articles about people blaming others for the harm that comes to them.

The responsible individual weighs those characteristics against their competencies and accepts the consequences of their decisions. \Certain behaviors are inherently risky, such as a woman walking alone at 1:30 a.m. on a deserted street. Although we empathize with her suffering if she is assaulted, and condemn her assailant, we must also recognize she voluntarily accepted that risk, knowingly or otherwise. \There are countless similar situations: Becoming intoxicated at a bar and leaving with a perfect stranger. A gunshot death, because someone put an automatic weapon in the hands of a child. Being bitten while teasing a dog. Suffering a heart attack, because one is sedentary, smokes, and eats a high-fat diet. \If society ignores such failures to use better judgment, than it also encourages similar incidents to occur. \- Eric Kietzke, Madison \Marklein has a proven record of dedication \Our current state Assembly District 51 Rep. Howard Marklein is running for the open seat in the 17th Senate District. It has been my experience as the former mayor of Shullsburg and as a voter that I can speak openly and frequently with Rep. Marklein on pertinent matters. \Marklein has earned my respect as an elected official. He has always made himself available. This has involved speaking with his colleagues at the Capitol, contacting various governmental agencies and taking issues to Gov. Scott Walker for clarification and resolution. \I have always been impressed by the time Marklein has dedicated to remain in touch with his constituency, our local school board and city government. Marklein maintains agricultural investments, which further adds to his personal resume as qualifications for state senator. \Voters of the 17th Senate District have a great opportunity to elect Marklein. I ask you to strongly consider him as your candidate, based on his proven record of dedication and knowledge. \- Tom Lethlean, Shullsburg \Walker has courage to make tough calls \I've been thinking about how our sisters from yesteryear fought hard for the privilege to bring the vote to every adult woman in Wisconsin. I will not dishonor their effort by taking my voting duty lightly. \I've taken the time and done my research. There's truth to be found. But lies fly recklessly about, and truth requires patience to sort. \I know whom I'm voting for and why. I'm voting on behalf of my children and adult grandchildren who call Wisconsin home. This election will burn its impact into their future. \My vote is going to Gov. Scott Walker because he's walked his talk. He delivered well. He brought jobs to the state, and taxes have gone down. \Courage is on my list of requirements. Courage is making the tough call when you know you may be rejected, criticized, ostracized. \I will not vote for a woman because she's a woman, nor would I vote for a black man because he's black. Politics is not an affirmative action playground. Political decisions impact people's lives. \I'm grateful we have a good, capable man in Walker. If he wins, Wisconsin wins. \- Judith Rolfs, Fontana"
205,"Gov. Scott Walker is launching a tour across Wisconsin to gather ideas about the state's budget priorities and legislative agenda next year.\In an interview with The Associated Press and in comments at a press conference Monday, Walker:\? Said he hasn't decided whether Wisconsin will seek a voluntary expansion of Medicaid services as provided for under the federal health care overhaul.\? Downplayed the possibility of a gas tax increase or the use of toll roads to pay for transportation projects in Wisconsin, and said he is inclined to stick to the current schedule for completing work on the Zoo interchange at the junction of I-94, I-894 and Highway 45 in western Milwaukee, and the expansion of I-39-90 in Rock and Dane counties.\? Expressed confidence the Republican-controlled Legislature would pass a mining bill next year and said he would look at a bill that would do away with the state's 15-year-old ""moratorium"" on mines that produce polluting acids. He said he doesn't want a law that would jeopardize the state's tourism and agriculture industries, and he won't sign a bill that he believes hurts the environment.\? Said he would sign a bill that ends same-day voter registration in Wisconsin, but he won't make doing away with it a priority.\?

206,"""I don't feel as if I should have to pay extra for my car since there are other non-hybrid vehicles that get that same gas mileage.""\Jenny Meyer Rae, Manawa resident\MERRILL – Joseph Dutton feels like he's being punished for caring about the environment. Dutton's wife bought a used 2012 Toyota Prius because they wanted to use less gasoline during her 70-mile round-trip daily commute. Dutton's wife died two years ago, and the hybrid isn't driven as much now. But when he went to re-register the car online in early October, he saw he would have to start paying a $75 surcharge, and he called his state legislators to ask why. ""They told me that they decided to do that because of fuel costs,"" Dutton said. ""I wasn't paying enough in taxes because I wasn't burning as much fuel."" Wisconsin has technically had a $75 surcharge on gas-electric hybrids — as well as a $100 fee for electric vehicles — for two years, but the fee on hybrids was not initially collected by the state Department of Transportation because the law was written in a way that made it difficult to determine which cars qualified.\That was changed this year, in the state's biennial budget, to make the law clearer and more enforceable. The amended language removed the distinction between a plug-in hybrid, which starts in electric mode before switching on its gas engine, and a conventional hybrid, like Dutton's Prius.\Money collected through the surcharge is transportation fund revenue collected by Wisconsin's Division of Motor Vehicles. That money goes to maintaining Wisconsin's infrastructure and services.\The main source of transportation revenue 2017–2019 was state funds, at 60.1%. Other sources include bond funds and federal funds. State funds were primarily collected through motor fuel tax and registration fees.\The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon. Wisconsin charges another 32.9 cents per gallon, where 2 cents of that goes to the state's petroleum clean-up program. Wisconsin had the 19th-highest state gas tax in the country as of February 2019.\Combined, residents pay 51.3 cents in tax for every gallon of gas, or about 21.4% of the average price per gallon of regular gasoline on Nov. 25, according to AAA.\The surcharge came as an unwelcome surprise for some of the more than 70,000 Wisconsin owners of hybrid vehicles, who question its fairness.\Manawa resident Jenny Meyer Rae has a 2014 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid. Rae said her car gets between 30 and 38 mpg.\""I don't feel as if I should have to pay extra for my car since there are other non-hybrid vehicles that get that same gas mileage,"" Rae said.\De Pere resident Caullen Matthew Omdahl has a 2000 Honda Insight Hybrid and a 2017 Ford Fusion Plug-In. He said the Insight is driven about once a week during non-snowy months.\""Unfortunately, it's more financially wise for me to purchase gas or diesel vehicles based on my mileage in those cars,"" he said, adding that hybrid vehicles are not always more fuel-efficient that gas-only vehicles.\He used the example of a Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid that gets about 22 mpg. That truck is subject to an additional tax, whereas a car like a diesel Chevrolet Cruze that can get more than 40 mpg isn't.\Deborah Salon is a senior scientist at Arizona State University's Global Institute of Sustainability. She said Wisconsin's inclusion of hybrids in fees is odd because these vehicles run entirely or partly on gasoline, similarly to gasoline-powered vehicles.\""I don't see why hybrids are charged this fee at all. Hybrids are simply fuel efficient vehicles, and the state isn't charging a fee (and shouldn't) for other high fuel economy cars,"" Salon said in an email.\Wisconsin is one of only eight states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, to require fees for conventional hybrids. Only Mississippi ($75) and West Virginia ($100) charge as much.\Whether a hybrid driver pays more or less to the state depends on how much a driver drives, the model of their hybrid and which car you're comparing them to.\If the combined state and federal fuel tax in Wisconsin is 51.3 cents per gallon, and the hybrid surcharge is $75 a year, the surcharge is the equivalent of the tax on about 146 gallons of gas per year.\Is that a fair payment for road use? That depends on the vehicle and the driver.\Take, for example, Dutton's 2012 Toyota Prius.\Dutton is paying $75 a year whether or not he drives the car. So if he doesn't, he's paying $75 that he wouldn't have to pay for a gas-only vehicle.\But let's say it was used for a 70-mile-per-day commute, for 250 workdays per year. That'd be 17,500 miles, requiring 365 gallons for the 48 mpg Prius, or about $120 in state gas tax.\Compare that to a fuel-efficient, non-hybrid car.\The 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage gets 39 mpg. An owner would need 449 gallons of gasoline to drive 17,500 miles, paying about $148 in taxes. That's only $28 more — making the cost of driving the Mirage $47 cheaper after you factor in the Prius's $75 surcharge.\But if you apply this same math to a 2020 Toyota Camry that gets 26 mpg, the Camry driver would pay about $221 in taxes. Even with the Prius' $75 surcharge, it would be $26 cheaper to drive the hybrid.\In this example, the 2012 Prius makes out better than any car getting less than 29.5 mpg.\For model year 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated average fuel economy at 25.4 miles per gallon.\Door County resident Sandy Brown, who drove a 2005 Toyota Prius for 14 years and now drives a 2019 Toyota Prius. She said she purposefully invested in a car that would use less gas to help the environment, which is important to her in light of climate change.\Yet as hybrid and electric vehicles become more popular they pose a problem: decreased revenue for state and federal road maintenance.\The point of a fuel tax is that people pay for the upkeep of the publicly provided road they're driving on. The more someone drives, in theory, the more they'd have to pay.\However, electric cars and hybrids don't neatly fit that formula. In fact, electric vehicles alone reduced federal gas tax collections for road maintenance in the U.S. by an estimated $249 million in 2017, according to research by Lucas Davis and and James Sallee of the University of California-Berkeley.\Davis, director of the Energy Institute at UC-Berkeley's business school, researched the idea of a pay-by-mile tax on electric and plug-in hybrids, which compared with a surcharge would more closely tie annual costs for drivers to the wear and tear they put on roads and highways.\But it wouldn't address another cost of driving: pollution.\According to the Environmental Protection Agency, transportation accounts for about 30 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.\The American Lung Association in California estimated that passenger vehicle pollution was responsible for $37 billion in public health and climate change costs in 2015, over just 10 states. The negative impacts included 2,580 premature deaths.\If drivers of electric and hybrid vehicles are paying as much or more than gasoline-powered vehicles — whether that's a surcharge or per mile — it would make less financial sense to drive less expensive low-emission vehicles.\Beth Robinson drives a 2008 Toyota Prius and hopes to buy an electric vehicle next. She said the state and country need fewer barriers to use hybrid and electric vehicles, instead of the opposite.\""Newer clean technologies are desperately needed to combat climate change,"" Robinson said.

208,"Low rate of pesticide use reduces risks\Dr. Zorba Paster's Aug. 3 column, ""That perfect lawn may be hazardous to your health,"" targeted the potential of pesticide leaching. \Modern pesticides applied to residential lawns are used at low rates, often less than half an ounce of active ingredient per thousand square feet. This low application rate reduces the risk of the product leaching into our groundwater. Most of the product is metabolized by the plant or broken down by sunlight. \What is not taken up by the plant is tightly bound by the soil, then eventually broken down by microbes, minimizing any risk of contaminating our groundwater. \When properly managed, pesticides enable homeowners to create landscapes to increase home value, reduce the heat island effect, provide a safer environment for recreational activities and reduce runoff. \- Brad DeBels, Middleton, Weed Man Lawn Care \Find courage for new way to fund roads \Tuesday's letter, ""New ways needed to support highways,"" was excellent. It mentioned the need for creative technologies. A digital device in a vehicle can measure miles traveled and charge a fee based on that data to replace the gas tax. \In 1988, the Arizona DOT was putting chips in semitrailer license plates to allow trucks to be identified and weighed at weigh stations without stopping on a scale. If this technology worked then, it certainly could be adapted for road use and taxing purposes today. \As the writer notes, it will take courage to move beyond the obsolete gas tax. It will also take legal safeguards to prevent tampering with a new device. A fair user fee will require a new concept to fund highway infrastructure. The courage must be found to address this challenge. \- Bob Hunt, Lodi \Road conditions the least of our concerns \We definitely need leaders in Washington, D.C. and Wisconsin willing to make the tough decisions regarding America's future transportation needs. They ought to agree on how best to raise the funds for resurfacing and rehabilitation of the highway system and bridges \But rebuilding the highways and bridges should be restricted to the number of vehicles the current highways and bridges were designed for. \There ought to be a nationwide moratorium on converting green space to highway pavement. There is the loss of carbon dioxide-consuming vegetation when green space is converted to cement. Also, cement manufacturing and spreading requires that fossil fuels be burned, adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. \Every gallon of gasoline burned in a vehicle emits pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, where it can remain for a century, adding heat to our air and waters below. The condition of the highway system may turn out to be the least of their worries. \- Mike Neuman, Madison \Still, Burke dodge Trek's outsourcing \Nobody covers up for Mary Burke's boo-boo against outsourcing jobs as well as Tom Still in his ""Inside Wisconsin"" column July 27. \Still wrote about why outsourcing jobs and selling our products overseas is a good thing for Wisconsin. I agree that sales help Wisconsin, but outsourcing jobs only helps the company. \Still writes that ""Burke has 'chastised' the Walker administration because the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation awarded tax credits in 2011 and 2012 to two companies which later outsourced jobs abroad."" He also mentions that ""Republican Walker has 'gone after' Democrat Burke over the 'supposed' outsourcing of jobs by Trek."" \Others have harped that Walker is ""bashing"" a great Wisconsin company. How convenient that they push Burke aside and just defend Trek, because they can not defend her hypocrisy. \Burke ""jumped"" on Walker's WEDC loans, saying she would stop outsourcing jobs. Yet when Burke worked for Trek, it sent jobs to China. \- Don Ennis, Reedsburg \Voter ID just another conservative roadblock \Requiring identification for anything is subject to the whims of the interested party. \A bank requires ID to protect them from financial loss. The Department of Transportation requires you to have a license and proof of insurance but cannot stop you from driving until an interested party (the police) pulls you over for some violation. \When asked to provide your Social Security number, you don't pull out your card - you just recite your number. If you forget your store ""rewards"" card, you just type in a phone number. \Voter fraud is almost nonexistent, but interested parties think they could somehow benefit in a small way by throwing up another roadblock in the voting process. \If the conservatives want to wave the flag and show their patriotism, they should go after all the young people who defy the law and fail to sign up for the draft. That will keep them busy and should tie up the court system for the next 100 years. \- Rex Tilley, Brooklyn \Church should stop 'Pig Rassle' \St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Stephensville needs to relegate the ""Pig Rassle"" to the dark past where it needs to stay. \A new tradition must be established where the voiceless are not exploited and children learn kindness in lieu of cruelty. \It is sadly apparent that the tenets of St. Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals, extending Christian love and compassion to all of God's creatures, are being ignored. \This is shameful and not at all Christ-like. \- Jean H.

Wisconsin has technically had a $75 surcharge on gas-electric hybrids — as well as a $100 fee for electric vehicles — for two years, but the fee on hybrids was not initially collected by the state Department of Transportation because the law was written in a way that made it difficult to determine which cars qualified.\That was changed this year, in the state's biennial budget, to make the law clearer and more enforceable. The amended language removed the distinction between a plug-in hybrid, which starts in electric mode before switching on its gas engine, and a conventional hybrid, like Dutton's Prius.\Money collected through the surcharge is transportation fund revenue collected by Wisconsin's Division of Motor Vehicles. That money goes to maintaining Wisconsin's infrastructure and services.\The main source of transportation revenue 2017–2019 was state funds, at 60.1%. Other sources include bond funds and federal funds. State funds were primarily collected through motor fuel tax and registration fees.\The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon. Wisconsin charges another 32.9 cents per gallon, where 2 cents of that goes to the state's petroleum clean-up program. Wisconsin had the 19th-highest state gas tax in the country as of February 2019.\Combined, residents pay 51.3 cents in tax for every gallon of gas, or about 21.4% of the average price per gallon of regular gasoline on Nov. 25, according to AAA.\The surcharge came as an unwelcome surprise for some of the more than 70,000 Wisconsin owners of hybrid vehicles, who question its fairness.\Manawa resident Jenny Meyer Rae has a 2014 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid.

He said the Insight is driven about once a week during non-snowy months.\""Unfortunately, it's more financially wise for me to purchase gas or diesel vehicles based on my mileage in those cars,"" he said, adding that hybrid vehicles are not always more fuel-efficient that gas-only vehicles.\He used the example of a Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid that gets about 22 mpg. That truck is subject to an additional tax, whereas a car like a diesel Chevrolet Cruze that can get more than 40 mpg isn't.\Deborah Salon is a senior scientist at Arizona State University's Global Institute of Sustainability. She said Wisconsin's inclusion of hybrids in fees is odd because these vehicles run entirely or partly on gasoline, similarly to gasoline-powered vehicles.\""I don't see why hybrids are charged this fee at all. Hybrids are simply fuel efficient vehicles, and the state isn't charging a fee (and shouldn't) for other high fuel economy cars,"" Salon said in an email.\Wisconsin is one of only eight states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, to require fees for conventional hybrids. Only Mississippi ($75) and West Virginia ($100) charge as much.\Whether a hybrid driver pays more or less to the state depends on how much a driver drives, the model of their hybrid and which car you're comparing them to.\If the combined state and federal fuel tax in Wisconsin is 51.3 cents per gallon, and the hybrid surcharge is $75 a year, the surcharge is the equivalent of the tax on about 146 gallons of gas per year.\Is that a fair payment for road use? That depends on the vehicle and the driver.\Take, for example, Dutton's 2012 Toyota Prius.\Dutton is paying $75 a year whether or not he drives the car. So if he doesn't, he's paying $75 that he wouldn't have to pay for a gas-only vehicle.\But let's say it was used for a 70-mile-per-day commute, for 250 workdays per year. That'd be 17,500 miles, requiring 365 gallons for the 48 mpg Prius, or about $120 in state gas tax.\Compare that to a fuel-efficient, non-hybrid car. The 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage gets 39 mpg. An owner would need 449 gallons of gasoline to drive 17,500 miles, paying about $148 in taxes. That's only $28 more — making the cost of driving the Mirage $47 cheaper after you factor in the Prius's $75 surcharge.\But if you apply this same math to a 2020 Toyota Camry that gets 26 mpg, the Camry driver would pay about $221 in taxes. Even with the Prius' $75 surcharge, it would be $26 cheaper to drive the hybrid.\In this example, the 2012 Prius makes out better than any car getting less than 29.5 mpg.\For model year 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated average fuel economy at 25.4 miles per gallon.\Door County resident Sandy Brown, who drove a 2005 Toyota Prius for 14 years and now drives a 2019 Toyota Prius. She said she purposefully invested in a car that would use less gas to help the environment, which is important to her in light of climate change.\Yet as hybrid and electric vehicles become more popular they pose a problem: decreased revenue for state and federal road maintenance.\The point of a fuel tax is that people pay for the upkeep of the publicly provided road they're driving on. The more someone drives, in theory, the more they'd have to pay.\However, electric cars and hybrids don't neatly fit that formula. In fact, electric vehicles alone reduced federal gas tax collections for road maintenance in the U.S. by an estimated $249 million in 2017, according to research by Lucas Davis and and James Sallee of the University of California-Berkeley.\Davis, director of the Energy Institute at UC-Berkeley's business school, researched the idea of a pay-by-mile tax on electric and plug-in hybrids, which compared with a surcharge would more closely tie annual costs for drivers to the wear and tear they put on roads and highways.\But it wouldn't address another cost of driving: pollution.\According to the Environmental Protection Agency, transportation accounts for about 30 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.\The American Lung Association in California estimated that passenger vehicle pollution was responsible for $37 billion in public health and climate change costs in 2015, over just 10 states. The negative impacts included 2,580 premature deaths.\If drivers of electric and hybrid vehicles are paying as much or more than gasoline-powered vehicles — whether that's a surcharge or per mile — it would make less financial sense to drive less expensive low-emission vehicles.\Beth Robinson drives a 2008 Toyota Prius and hopes to buy an electric vehicle next.

217,"The letter-writer's proposed solution to the state's road-funding problem was about as perfect a solution as you can get in today's political environment.\I was chagrined not to have come up with it myself, and annoyed that lawmakers haven't either. \With an audit last week showing road construction is even more expensive than we thought, Gov. Scott Walker's political ambitions shouldn't be enough to keep his party's legislative leaders from growing spines and turning the proposal into reality. \In a Jan. 23 letter to the editor in the Wisconsin State Journal, John Roberts of Oregon writes that majority Republicans should get together with minority Democrats to pass some kind of sensible increase to the gas tax to pay for road construction. \The state needs more than $1 billion in additional funding per year to keep its road system from getting worse, according to a 2013 report. Without it, projections are that 40 percent to 50 percent of roads would be in poor condition by 2027. Last week, the Legislative Audit Bureau announced the state has for years been underestimating the cost of road projects. \The kicker, according to Roberts, is that the tax increase should, by design, draw veto-proof support, or two-thirds of the lawmakers present for the vote. Then Walker would be free to veto the increase, and the Legislature could override him. \That way Walker could keep his national political ambitions alive by saying he never acted to raise taxes, and the people who can't wait for Walker to become president for their roads to get better can actually get better roads. \Moreover, although Roberts didn't suggest this, ""no"" votes could be parceled out to Republican lawmakers likely to face serious challenges in the 2018 and 2020 elections. There shouldn't be too many given how well - and unconstitutionally, a federal panel of judges has ruled - the GOP has gerrymandered state legislative districts to protect their own. \I ran Roberts' idea past Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, who in a statement said: ""Democrats would welcome the opportunity to have more input in the budget process. Protecting Wisconsin jobs, keeping construction projects on track and finding a long-term transportation funding solution have been Democratic priorities for years."" \Assembly Leader Robin Vos has called for considering gas tax and the vehicle registration fee increases to pay for roads. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald hasn't ruled them out.

Madison -- Assembly Democrats voted Wednesday to make changes that could add 4 cents to the cost of a gallon of gas, but said they would abandon rewriting Wisconsin's liability laws as they fine-tune the state budget.
\
Democrats, who control the house, made the changes as they tried to round up the 50 votes necessary to pass the state budget the full Assembly will take up Thursday.
\
They said they strengthened the oil company tax by ensuring it was legally sound, but Republicans criticized them for raising gas taxes when the economy is in shambles and gas costs $2.81 a gallon on average, according to AAA Wisconsin.
\
Assembly Democrats found support from business groups who praised them for turning their backs on changing liability laws. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle has recommended allowing people and businesses to be held liable for all damages in a lawsuit even if they were 1% at fault.
\
""Wisconsin would become an attractive place to file lawsuits"" if the law were changed, said Mark Grapentine, a lobbyist for the Wisconsin Medical Society. ""We want wrongs to be righted, but we don't want to be the place where it's just easy pickings.""
\
Doyle for years has pushed for taxing oil companies and barring them from passing on the assessment at the pump. But Assembly Democrats said they were concerned such a provision would violate a constitutional protection on commerce. That would mean the state would lose a likely lawsuit from the oil industry and have to pay millions in interest and legal fees.
\
Instead, Democrats tweaked Doyle's proposal to allow gas companies to pass on the tax at the pump if they wanted. Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), author of the proposal, said they could not increase the price of gas more than 4 cents a gallon.
\
""This is legally defensible,"" Shilling said. ""It still will generate $260 million for our transportation infrastructure. We will have a stable funding source for investment in this budget for transportation projects.""
\
Wisconsin's gas tax is 32.9 cents a gallon, one of the highest in the country. But the oil company tax would be separate from that, and companies would have to decide independently if they were going to pass on the tax, Shilling said.
\
""Covering up Governor Doyle's deficit by increasing the gas tax by 4 cents and swiping it for other parts of the budget just continues his ongoing political sleight of hand,"" Assembly Republican Leader Jeff Fitzgerald of Horicon said in a statement.
\
But 15 groups representing grocery stores, convenience stores, small businesses and others said the changes were a compromise that significantly improved Doyle's plan.
\
Doyle structured his proposal so that the bigger the revenue of an oil company, the larger the percentage tax it paid. Assembly Democrats changed that so all oil companies would pay a flat 2%. Full details were not released.
\
Aiming for 50 votes
\
Democrats control the Assembly 52-46, with one independent, and Rep. Bob Ziegelbauer (D-Manitowoc) has said he is all but certain to vote against it. No Republicans are expected to support it.
\
Representatives are expected formally to adopt the measures Thursday when the full Assembly takes up the budget.
\
After the Assembly votes on the budget, the Senate will take it up. The Senate also is controlled by Democrats, but the two houses are expected to pass budgets that have some differences. Any differences would be negotiated by leaders, then brought up for a second round of votes in each house before going to Doyle.
\
It remains unclear if Senate Democrats would go along with the Assembly's plan for the oil tax. Senate Majority Leader Russ Decker (D-Weston) said Tuesday he wanted to keep the provision that bars passing on the tax, saying no one had convinced him it wouldn't be legal.
\
Liability laws
\
The two houses could also differ on the changes to liability laws, which Assembly Democrats stripped out of the budget. Decker said Tuesday senators wanted to make the measure ""more appealing,"" but didn't say how.
\
Now, someone must be 51% or more liable to pay all damages in a lawsuit; Doyle wanted to drop that to 1%, while the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee recommended putting it at 20%.
\
The office of Assembly Speaker Mike Sheridan (D-Janesville) announced they wouldn't change the liability laws after a storm of criticism over the measure.
\
The decisions were made in a closed-door caucus meeting, though leaders had said they would make many of their deliberations open to the public.
\
Business groups have railed against the proposed change to liability laws, saying it would drive companies out of business and raise insurance costs. James Buchen, vice president of government relations for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state's largest business lobby, said the provision had triggered an outpouring of opposition from all parts of the business community, from tourism to health care.
\
For businesses, ""It created an environment where they could be put out of business, and they had some protection under the old law,"" Buchen said.
\
Trial attorneys counter that the changes are needed to make the system fairer for victims.
\
""These provisions were designed to make sure injured consumers were not stuck with paying the bills for accidents they did not cause,"" the Wisconsin Association for Justice, a trial lawyers group, said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, the decision appears to be largely based on misinformation and scare tactics by those who do not want to be held accountable for injuries they cause consumers.""
\
Justice Department
\
Assembly Democrats also agreed to restore $5.4 million to the Department of Justice, and gave Republican Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen a chance to hang onto another $1 million.
\
""We are committed to ensuring that our state's top law enforcement agency has the tools and resources it needs to keep our citizens safe,"" Sheridan said in a statement.
\
Last month, the Joint Finance Committee recommended taking away funding, despite Van Hollen's claim that doing so would impair public safety efforts.
\
A separate budget measure would have required Van Hollen's office to give up another $1 million in the second year of the budget, which would be given as raises to assistant district attorneys and public defenders. Assembly Democrats gave Van Hollen discretion to make that transfer, however.
\
""Public safety is the first priority of government, and it must be a budget priority as well,"" Van Hollen said in a statement that thanked legislators for restoring the funding.
\
Other changes by Assembly Democrats made late Tuesday and Wednesday, as announced by Sheridan's office, included:
\
- Requiring that 30% or more of people hired to work on Milwaukee Public Schools construction projects funded by federal stimulus dollars live in areas of the city with high unemployment rates.
\
Sponsor Rep. Annette ""Polly"" Williams (D-Milwaukee) said her goal was to ensure that funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act go to those who need it most. Addressing Milwaukee's high unemployment rate will be key to securing her vote for the budget, she said.
\
- Scuttling a provision that would guarantee tax exemptions for nonprofit retirement homes, including those for wealthy seniors.
\
- Reversing a provision that some said would have limited hunting on some state land.
\
OIL TAX
\
Gov. Jim Doyle proposed increasing taxes on oil companies and barring them from passing the tax on to consumers. Assembly Democrats decided to allow oil companies to pass along the new tax to consumers, by up to 4 cents a gallon, removing any questions about its legality.

220,"MADISON -- State transportation officials released a new plan Monday to delay reconstruction work on southeastern Wisconsin's freeways and scale back road aid to local governments in hopes of closing a looming deficit in the state's transportation fund.\The fund is the state's major source of money for highway improvements and maintenance, aid to local governments for road work, the State Patrol and the Division of Motor Vehicles. Republican Gov. Scott Walker's 2013-15 executive transportation budget estimated the fund would finish fiscal year 2015 with a $12.6 million deficit.\But the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau released projections late last week that show a $63.5 million shortfall in the fund on June 30, 2015, thanks largely to dwindling gas tax revenue. The state Department of Transportation, a Walker cabinet agency, put out the new plan a day before the Legislature's powerful finance committee was scheduled to review the governor's transportation budget. DOT spokeswoman Peg Schmitt said the plan is meant as a guide for lawmakers as they grapple with the deficit.\Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, one of the committee's two co-chairs, said the suggestions look reasonable but acknowledged the state must find more stable ways to fund road building as more people turn to fuel-efficient vehicles and the gas tax dries up.\""We're dealing with it by prioritizing,"" Nygren said. ""Within the environment in which we're living, it's the best possible scenario.""\The plan calls for saving $19 million by pushing back funding an Interstate 94 interchange upgrade in Milwaukee County until the next budget. The interchange reconstruction is part of a larger multi-year project to upgrade the interstate between Milwaukee and the Illinois border.\The agency also wants to delay reconstruction work on a portion of Milwaukee's Zoo Interchange, saving $14 million; cut $7.3 million from a program that funds major highway projects in the first year of the budget but restore it in the second; cut $4.3 million from road aid for local governments in year one and restore it in year two; reduce funding for a Milwaukee-to-Chicago Amtrak passenger rail line by $1.1 million across the two-year spending plan; and cut $900,000 from a program designed to reduce congestion.\The agency went on to suggest cutting $2.5 million from payments that go to municipalities for maintaining state highways and pushing back hiring 24 new State Patrol vehicle inspectors until fiscal year 2015.\""WisDot believes (the plan) provides a fair and reasonable path forward that addresses the most pressing needs of the state's transportation system in a fiscally responsible way,"" Schmitt said.\Lawmakers have been worrying about the transportation fund's solvency for years. The fund consists largely of gas tax and vehicle registration revenue, but people have been driving less in more fuel-efficient cars and registering fewer vehicles.\The fiscal bureau estimated people are expected to buy 276 million fewer gallons of gas and diesel over the biennium than Walker's administration thought, resulting in a loss of $83.5 million in revenue. The bureau also projected registration revenues will ring in at $5.3 million less than Walker planned.\A bipartisan commission Walker and the Legislature appointed in 2011 to examine the state's transportation funding needs recommended raising the gas tax by 5 cents per gallon, increasing driver's license fees and creating a registration fee based on miles driven.\Republican leaders have said they won't increase the gas tax and have ignored the rest of the recommendations. Walker's budget instead shores up the fund by transferring $55 million from the state's general and petroleum inspection fund and authorizes $994 million in new borrowing for transportation projects.\It's unclear how much of a long-term impact the agency's plan might have on the state. DOT officials left the borrowing authorization alone. The rail line cut would have next to no effect, according to the fiscal bureau; Amtrak's contract is expected to cost $1.1 million less than when Walker introduced his budget in February.\Most of the program cuts would be restored in the second year of the 2013-2015 budget, and the Milwaukee projects should still be completed on schedule, DOT officials said."
221,"
Madison -- Assembly Democrats voted Wednesday to make changes that could add 4 cents to the cost of a gallon of gas, but said they would abandon rewriting Wisconsin's liability laws as they fine-tune the state budget.
\
Democrats, who control the house, made the changes as they tried to round up the 50 votes necessary to pass the state budget the full Assembly will take up Thursday.
\
They said they strengthened the oil company tax by ensuring it was legally sound, but Republicans criticized them for raising gas taxes when the economy is in shambles and gas costs $2.81 a gallon on average, according to AAA Wisconsin.
\
Assembly Democrats found support from business groups who praised them for turning their backs on changing liability laws. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle has recommended allowing people and businesses to be held liable for all damages in a lawsuit even if they were 1% at fault.
\
""Wisconsin would become an attractive place to file lawsuits"" if the law were changed, said Mark Grapentine, a lobbyist for the Wisconsin Medical Society. ""We want wrongs to be righted, but we don't want to be the place where it's just easy pickings.""
\
Doyle for years has pushed for taxing oil companies and barring them from passing on the assessment at the pump. But Assembly Democrats said they were concerned such a provision would violate a constitutional protection on commerce. That would mean the state would lose a likely lawsuit from the oil industry and have to pay millions in interest and legal fees.
\
Instead, Democrats tweaked Doyle's proposal to allow gas companies to pass on the tax at the pump if they wanted. Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), author of the proposal, said they could not increase the price of gas more than 4 cents a gallon.
\
""This is legally defensible,"" Shilling said. ""It still will generate $260 million for our transportation infrastructure. We will have a stable funding source for investment in this budget for transportation projects.""
\
Wisconsin's gas tax is 32.9 cents a gallon, one of the highest in the country. But the oil company tax would be separate from that, and companies would have to decide independently if they were going to pass on the tax, Shilling said.
\
""Covering up Governor Doyle's deficit by increasing the gas tax by 4 cents and swiping it for other parts of the budget just continues his ongoing political sleight of hand,"" Assembly Republican Leader Jeff Fitzgerald of Horicon said in a statement.
\
But 15 groups representing grocery stores, convenience stores, small businesses and others said the changes were a compromise that significantly improved Doyle's plan.
\
Doyle structured his proposal so that the bigger the revenue of an oil company, the larger the percentage tax it paid. Assembly Democrats changed that so all oil companies would pay a flat 2%. Full details were not released.
\
Aiming for 50 votes
\
Democrats control the Assembly 52-46, with one independent, and Rep. Bob Ziegelbauer (D-Manitowoc) has said he is all but certain to vote against it. No Republicans are expected to support it.
\
Representatives are expected formally to adopt the measures Thursday when the full Assembly takes up the budget.
\
After the Assembly votes on the budget, the Senate will take it up. The Senate also is controlled by Democrats, but the two houses are expected to pass budgets that have some differences. Any differences would be negotiated by leaders, then brought up for a second round of votes in each house before going to Doyle.
\
It remains unclear if Senate Democrats would go along with the Assembly's plan for the oil tax. Senate Majority Leader Russ Decker (D-Weston) said Tuesday he wanted to keep the provision that bars passing on the tax, saying no one had convinced him it wouldn't be legal.
\
Liability laws
\
The two houses could also differ on the changes to liability laws, which Assembly Democrats stripped out of the budget. Decker said Tuesday senators wanted to make the measure ""more appealing,"" but didn't say how.
\
Now, someone must be 51% or more liable to pay all damages in a lawsuit; Doyle wanted to drop that to 1%, while the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee recommended putting it at 20%.
\
The office of Assembly Speaker Mike Sheridan (D-Janesville) announced they wouldn't change the liability laws after a storm of criticism over the measure.
\
The decisions were made in a closed-door caucus meeting, though leaders had said they would make many of their deliberations open to the public.
\
Business groups have railed against the proposed change to liability laws, saying it would drive companies out of business and raise insurance costs. James Buchen, vice president of government relations for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state's largest business lobby, said the provision had triggered an outpouring of opposition from all parts of the business community, from tourism to health care.
\
For businesses, ""It created an environment where they could be put out of business, and they had some protection under the old law,"" Buchen said.
\
Trial attorneys counter that the changes are needed to make the system fairer for victims.
\
""These provisions were designed to make sure injured consumers were not stuck with paying the bills for accidents they did not cause,"" the Wisconsin Association for Justice, a trial lawyers group, said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, the decision appears to be largely based on misinformation and scare tactics by those who do not want to be held accountable for injuries they cause consumers.""
\
Justice Department
\
Assembly Democrats also agreed to restore $5.4 million to the Department of Justice, and gave Republican Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen a chance to hang onto another $1 million.
\
""We are committed to ensuring that our state's top law enforcement agency has the tools and resources it needs to keep our citizens safe,"" Sheridan said in a statement.
\
Last month, the Joint Finance Committee recommended taking away funding, despite Van Hollen's claim that doing so would impair public safety efforts.
\
A separate budget measure would have required Van Hollen's office to give up another $1 million in the second year of the budget, which would be given as raises to assistant district attorneys and public defenders. Assembly Democrats gave Van Hollen discretion to make that transfer, however.
\
""Public safety is the first priority of government, and it must be a budget priority as well,"" Van Hollen said in a statement that thanked legislators for restoring the funding.
\
Other changes by Assembly Democrats made late Tuesday and Wednesday, as announced by Sheridan's office, included:
\
- Requiring that 30% or more of people hired to work on Milwaukee Public Schools construction projects funded by federal stimulus dollars live in areas of the city with high unemployment rates.
\
Sponsor Rep. Annette ""Polly"" Williams (D-Milwaukee) said her goal was to ensure that funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act go to those who need it most. Addressing Milwaukee's high unemployment rate will be key to securing her vote for the budget, she said.
\
- Dropping a plan to issue $28 million in bonds for a University of Wisconsin-Madison nursing building. The earmark was one of several that came under criticism after the Joint Finance Committee inserted it into the budget in the middle of the night last month.
\
OIL TAX
\
Gov. Jim Doyle proposed increasing taxes on oil companies and barring them from passing the tax on to consumers. Assembly Democrats decided to allow oil companies to pass along the new tax to consumers, by up to 4 cents a gallon, removing any questions about its legality.

222,"Reform tax status and donation rules\House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, says tax reform as a priority. I certainly agree and support this because the American tax code, as written by Congress, is too complex and unclear.\Unfortunately some areas that may get neglected are charitable deductions and the tax-exempt status of organizations.\The need for reform here is highlighted by recent reports of white supremacist groups getting tax-exempt status. Another reason is the IRS scandal from a few years ago.\We shouldn't allow tax-exempt status for any political work - period. Attempts to set an acceptable percentage of political work have been a failure. The Constitution guarantees all Americans free speech, but not tax-exempt status for that speech.\Charities should do charitable work and not provide luxurious benefits for some people working for the charity. Therefore, any tax deduction for donations should be limited to the amount of funds that go to charitable work - administrative costs should not be deductible.\Charity should be anonymous. If you are giving to put your name on a building or a list, then you are getting something back.\These ideas are reasonable, and I hope they are considered in any tax reform effort.\Mark K. Allen, Madison\The gas tax is hardest on the poor\Raising the gas tax is not a good idea. The gas tax is highly regressive, pitting the rich against the poor.\When the tax is raised, the wealthier among us have the option of switching to more efficient, hybrid and plug-in cars to reduce and perhaps eliminate having to pay the gas tax. Those of us unable to afford to change are left paying the bill.\Part of the solution to our transportation budget may be to change our registration fee schedule. We should base rates on the weight of the vehicle, much as is done with trucks. We might even include bicycles that use public roads and paths, as well as scooters, motorcycles, three-wheel vehicles, small cars, SUVs and pickups.\Relying on a gas tax as the primary source of highway funding cannot continue as gas usage declines.\It is important that we find alternative means of funding our very important transportation system.\Marcel Thoma, Brooklyn\Everyone should boycott inauguration\I am just an old retired Vietnam War veteran and freethinker who has never had an allegiance to, nor am I a member of, any political party.\However, in these most critical times where the very existence of our species is in peril, we must attempt to thwart those in power who deny our having caused the destruction of our natural environment and continue to support policies toward our end. In this regard, I urge everyone, especially all politicians, to boycott Donald Trump's inauguration, as U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Black Earth, and Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, have announced.\Trump acts like a fascist and is a most despicable man in every respect who deserves no respect as president.\Scott Storm, Madison\Pocan shouldn't boycott inauguration\I find it interesting that Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Black Earth, will not attend the presidential Inauguration.\I did not realize he was elected to be the representative of the Democrat Party from the 2nd Congressional District of the state of Wisconsin. I thought he was elected to be the representative to the U.S. House of Representatives from the 2nd Congressional District of the state of Wisconsin.\Dennis Carlson, Fitchburg\Boys and Girls Club should cancel hunt\The Boys and Girls Club of Janesville is holding a canned pheasant hunt as a fundraiser for their organization on Feb. 13.\The club states its values include integrity, accountability, respect and excellence. This includes doing the right thing every day, holding each other to the highest standards, and treating others with respect. Canned hunting is not an activity that falls within the important values that they hold.\These animals are bred in captivity purely to be hunted for sport. They often are kept in a confined area, increasing the likelihood of the hunter obtaining a kill.\The Humane Society of the United states calls canned hunts ""cruel and brutal activities,"" in which the animals have little chance of escape.\In fact many hunting groups oppose canned hunts and several states have banned them. We value the important work of the Boys and Girls Club and respectfully ask that they find a more appropriate fundraiser that does not involve the unfair practice of shooting animals for entertainment.\Sara Andrews, Madison, executive director, Alliance for Animals"
223," Two environmental groups criticized Republican Gov. Scott McCallum on Wednesday for accepting $67,000 in campaign donations from road builders during the first six months of the year.\ The Sierra Club and 1,000 Friends of Wisconsin suspect the donations to McCallum, which total $207,000 since 1996, influenced such McCallum decisions as continuing an automatic gas tax hike and endorsing a $6.3 billion spending increase on road projects over 20 years.\ ""Obviously, the road builders got a good return on their investment there,"" said Brett Hulsey, a Midwest spokesman for the Sierra Club.\ The state needs to focus more of its resources on alternative transportation such as commuter trains, Hulsey said.\ The groups also rapped Attorney General Jim Doyle, one of three Democratic candidates for governor, for accepting $30,000 in campaign donations from road builders during the first six months of 2002 and an additional $20,000 since 1996.\ The two other Democrats for governor, U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett and Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, received $4,755 and $2,500, respectively, during the first six months. Barrett had previously collected an additional $3,000.\ Debbie Monterrey-Millett, a spokeswoman for McCallum, said the governor makes road decisions based on the merits of the projects and ""absolutely"" is not affected by campaign contributions.\ ""The governor has made no secret that in order for our economy to move forward we need a strong infrastructure,"" Monterrey-Millett said. ""That includes roads and other forms of transportation.""\ She added that McCallum voted against automatic tax hikes as a state senator. As governor, he can't unilaterally prevent automatic hikes, and ""the Legislature hasn't been willing to reduce that,"" Monterrey-Millett said.\ John Kraus, a spokesman for Doyle, said the attorney general has fought hard to protect Wisconsin's natural environment.\ ""That's why the father of Earth Day, (former Wisconsin Gov. and Sen.) Gaylord Nelson, is not only supporting Jim but is the co- chair of his campaign,"" Kraus said."
224,"Transport fund overwhelmed by unnecessary construction\The recent editorial ""Fill holes in road budget"" was an insightful look at funding transportation. But talking about funding without talking about spending won't solve our problems. The first step must be to stop wasting taxpayer money on unnecessary highway expansions.\Unfortunately, the solution offered by the state transportation commission is to spend more, rather than cut waste, and the big winners are the highway lobbyists and road builders who would profit.\For example, highway lobbyists have convinced the state Department of Transportation to choose the most expensive options for expanding Interstate 90-39 south of Madison. Plus, the Wisconsin Public Interest Research Group found that traffic count and crash data used to justify this project are nearly 10 years old and don't support widening as a mitigation measure. The cost to taxpayers? Up to $1.5 billion ? that's a lot of road repair and transit money!\Recent reports found that over 1,000 Wisconsin bridges are structurally deficient, and over 40 percent of our roads are in ""less than good"" condition. Meanwhile, we are driving less. The average Wisconsinite drove 500 fewer miles in 2010 than in 2004. And while young people drove 23 percent fewer miles in 2009 than the average young person in 2001, their travel on public transportation increased by 40 percent nationwide. Let's focus on prioritizing Wisconsin's real transportation needs.\? Bruce Speight, Madison, director, Wisconsin Public Interest Research Group\Mileage fees reward those who use roads the least\Of all the options the Wisconsin Transportation Finance and Policy Commission recommended for funding transportation improvements, charging vehicle owners a registration fee based on the mileage a vehicle travels, while increasing registration fees on big trucks a proportionate amount, should be a selected option.\This strategy would encourage people to drive less, resulting in less need for new lanes and bridges and less congestion on the highways. The money collected should be used to maintain the highways we already have, not to build new ones or expand the capacity of current highways. Taxes on big trucks should be increased depending on the damage they cause to our highways.\People who don't drive on the state's highways (those not owning cars) or those who rarely drive (less than 1,000 miles annually) should be financially rewarded for reducing traffic congestion and putting less burden on the environment, two of the benefits which accrue to all state residents and help make the state a good place for doing business and raising a family.\Raising the state gas tax and doubling license fees are not fair to low-income residents who have to drive but can't afford higher efficiency vehicles. Raising these taxes would also be inflationary, which hurts all of us.\? Michael Neuman, Madison\Begin open-road tolling - it's practical and economical\We should implement an open-road tolling system on our interstate highways.\I recently traveled east, and Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts all have tolls on their interstate routes. The E-Pass has made paying tolls practical and economical. It's time we do it, too!\? March Schweitzer, Madison\Easiest solution to base fees on vehicle purchase price\Basing registration fees on mileage driven would be difficult to administer.\For example, I drive 35 miles each way to work but live near the Illinois border and work in Illinois. Half of my daily miles aren't driven in Wisconsin. How would these instances be handled?\And most of the wear and tear on country roads is done by farm equipment, even though they don't drive long distances.\We should do what some European counties do and base a vehicle's annual registration fee on the purchase price of the vehicle. All those big, expensive SUVs would then cover the extra toll they take on the roads.\? Greg Hakala, Monticello\Functional roads trump vehicle frills, design elements\It costs about 60 cents per mile of travel to own and operate an automobile on one of our nation's highways. And of that, about 2 cents per mile is devoted to building and maintaining roads and bridges. When cars got 15 mpg, the revenue from the 51 cent-per-gallon gas tax provided about 3.4 cents per mile, a sufficient sum.\Today, however, with cars getting 30 mpg, the revenue has dropped to about 1.7 cents per mile, which is not sufficient. We are actually driving more miles but paying less to support the existing highway system.\Apparently there is reluctance to pay a larger tax at the gas pumps, so a fairer system is needed that would charge all highway users a reasonable fee, including bikes, motorcycles and farm tractors. And particularly large trucks, each of which takes about as much space on the road as 10 cars. These do most of the damage to highway pavements and require larger design elements to negotiate curves, roundabouts, other intersections and related geometric features.\To put highway costs in perspective, we must decide what is more important ? good roads that save operational costs, or frills such as super design elements, multi-track CD players, mag wheels, or off-road capability. And don't overlook the related cost of insurance and depreciation.\? Walt Hannan, Livingston, engineer"
225," Sitting straight up at the breakfast table, chewing on a toothpick at the Lunch Bucket Cafe in Black Earth, Ken Zander doesn't hesitate when asked how farmers could be affected by the 1996 presidential race.\ ""I don't think it makes much difference who gets elected,"" Zander said.\ At a time when many farmers agree the farm economy is healthier than it has been in years, they express a withering discontent with the political climate.\ Zander, who oversees a 400-acre dairy operation in Black Earth, said he has heard both campaigns' general appeals to farmers. He said he doesn't mean that politicians can't shape farm issues, but they usually choose not to for political reasons.\ He and other farmers admit that farm income has risen in the past several years,but they note that President Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole have made few comments on capital gains taxes, rising costs of operation and land use issues.\ The candidates ""are both pretty much ignoring farmers,"" said Bert Riege, 69, who owns a 230-acre farm near Deerfield. ""But the economy is doing better, and when that happens, people have more money to buy our products, so it's pretty good.""\ With a month remaining until the election, Clinton and Dole have stated their agriculture positions about taxes, cutting price supports, free trade and the environment. But farmers don't expect to hear those issues in speeches, presidential debates or television commercials.\ ""Farming is really not a top priority with any political party,"" said Mala McGhee, an active Democrat who runs a 100-acre farm with her husband Jim in rural Hollandale.\ Brent Gjermo, who has a 170-acre dairy operation outside Deerfield, said the 1996 farm bill, which gradually phases out more than 60 years of agriculture subsidies, has been well received by many farmers -- but they vary on whether to give credit to Clinton or the Republican-majority Congress.\ ""It's a step in the right direction,"" Gjermo said. ""We really have to go on what the market dictates, not just the government."" As an independent voter, Gjermo said he would not endorse Clinton but does not favor Dole's proposal for a 15 percent tax cut because it could balloon the budget deficit.\ Some farmers said both candidates are missing the point about the future -- that young people aren't going into farming.\ ""They're going to have hungry people someday, and they're going to wonder where all the farmers went,"" said Allen Myhre, who runs a 50-acre farm near Albany. ""There's not enough young farmers in the dairy industry.""\ Still, Myhre said farmers are earning more money now than they have been in a generation, with corn steadily selling for roughly $3 per bushel. At several points in the 1980s, corn prices fell below $1 per bushel.\ Milk and hog prices also have remained at high levels in the past year, and Myhre said that may be the best incentive for young farmers.\ ""With prices being on the increase, people are in a different state of mind,"" he said. ""But even though you're making more, it never keeps up with taxes, feed and repairs. It never will.""\ According to the Wisconsin Agriculture Statistics Service, land values rose 5 percent from 1992 to 1993.\ Despite higher land values, several farmers said they worry about small farmers being pushed out of business while larger corporate farms continue to grow. The industry itself has not shrunk, according to a recent University of Wisconsin study, with agriculture accounting for $40 billion -- 22 percent -- of the state's economy.\ From 1960 to 1993, Wisconsin lost 44 percent of its farms, from 138,000 to 79,000, state agriculture department figures show. In that same span, the average farm in Wisconsin increased from 160.9 acres to 216.5 acres.\ Riege blames that trend on Republican politics of the 1980s that allowed more farms to incorporate for tax breaks.\ ""They should support the family farm more than the corporate farm,"" Riege said.\ The campaign rhetoric has mostly avoided those issues thus far, with Clinton emphasizing agricultural prosperity during his term and Dole claiming the president has raised taxes too much.\ So far, Clinton's agricultural campaign is pointing to: An all-time high of $60 billion in projected exports for 1996, including almost $10 billion through NAFTA.\ Crop and livestock prices rising 19 percent from June 1995 to June 1996.\ Reducing the USDA budget by $4.1 billion, partially through reducing staff by 10,000.\ Phasing out federal crop subsidies through the 1996 farm bill. Dole's campaign claims that the Clinton administration has hurt farmers by: Signing a 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax increase, which disproportionately affects farmers.\ Raising estate taxes, thereby making it more difficult for a farmto stay within a family.\ Failing to promote alternative fuels such as ethanol through the Environmental Protection Agency.\ Approving the Northeast Dairy Compact, which would raise prices for dairy farmers in six New England states.\ Several local politicians have denounced the dairy compact and called for the firing of Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman since he approved it in August under authority of Congress.\ However, McGhee said Wisconsin farmers will not be put at a competitive disadvantage because it involves only fluid milk, and none of Wisconsin's milk goes to the Northeast.\ Wisconsin annually produces 22.5 billion pounds of milk, compared to 4.4 billion in the Northeastern six-state area.\ ""It isn't as big a deal as everybody thinks it is,"" said Earl Ellickson, who runs a 240-acre farm near Cambridge. ""But prices should be the same in all parts of the country.""\ Ellickson said he approved of the 1996 farm bill's plan to eliminate crop subsidies, and he credited members of the Republican majority in Congress for authoring and passing the bill.\ As a delegate at the Democratic National Convention in August, McGhee said she was concerned about the lack of focus on farm issues, but said Republicans and Democrats have agreed that lessening the role of government would benefit farmers.\ ""Farmers traditionally do better under Democratic presidents,"" McGhee said. ""The last 12 years under the Republicans were horrible for farmers.""\ Ellickson, who said he usually votesRepublican because of the emphasis on cutting taxes, agreed with McGhee that the farm economy is in better shape than it was in the 1980s.\ ""Right now, things aren't too bad,"" Ellickson said. ""It will keep getting better if government keeps its nose out of it.""\ Farm petition: Several state farm organizations have asked a group of Wisconsin city officials to drop a Supreme Court petition against use-value assessments.\ Under the recently enacted law, farm property taxes will be based on farm use value rather than the value for which the property could be sold to land developers.\ The new assessments take effect in 1998; farm property taxes are frozen in 1996 and 1997. The state Department of Revenue estimates that the property tax freeze will save farmers $37.5 million in 1996 and 1997 combined. At least 34 other states have use-value assessments, the farm groups said.\ Led by the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation and the Wisconsin National Farmers Organization, the 11 groups called the state's previous property tax system ""archaic.""\ ""We believe that cooperation, rather than confrontation, will better serve all property taxpayers,"" said a farm group statement. ""Use-value assessment is important to farmers across the state, not just those in urbanizing areas."""
226,"
Nass challenged for Assembly seat
\
He focuses on wrong issues, candidates say
\
Two candidates challenging incumbent state Rep. Stephen Nass (R- Whitewater) say he is only focused on appealing to single-issue voters and doesn't have the foresight to do what's best for the state's future.
\
Nass, a member of the Assembly since 1990, said he's working on keeping taxes and spending, which are the greatest concerns of residents in the 31st District, in control.
\
The 31st Assembly District includes western Waukesha County and portions of Walworth and Jefferson counties.
\
Democratic challenger Scott Woods and Wisconsin Green Party candidate Bruce Hinkforth are also on the ballot in the Republican- dominated 31st Assembly District.
\
Woods said Nass and other Republicans are trying to put their ideology into law, specifically with a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Nass said he supports the ban.
\
Woods said he is pursuing the state Assembly seat to protect civil liberties. The government shouldn't be forcing ideology on its citizens, he said.
\
""I look for the reality, rather than ideology, for the answers,"" Woods said.
\
Hinkforth said the two major political parties do not address the issues that he feels are important, such as preserving natural resources, pollution controls and other environmental concerns. Instead, he said, the parties focus on issues that he said affect small groups of people, such as gay marriage and abortion.
\
Legislators should be talking about alternatives to a reliance on oil, development policies and highway expansion, Hinkforth said.
\
""A lot of people think we're just left and liberal, but we are truly conservative,"" Hinkforth said about the Green Party. ""We are responsible, pragmatic and prudent in our choices.""
\
Nass says taxes are overwhelmingly the biggest concern of Wisconsin residents and he will continue to keep taxes and spending under control. He supports the so-called taxpayer bill of rights -- a proposal to amend the state constitution to limit government spending.
\
Both Hinkforth and Woods do not believe a constitutional amendment to limit spending is necessary. Woods doesn't want to take the control away from local governments. Hinkforth said legislators are already supposed to be controlling spending and limiting taxes and questioned why an amendment is necessary.
\
But Nass said it isn't enough to trust some legislators to do their job. Elected to the Assembly in 1990, Nass said he has continued to oppose tax increases such as the Miller Park and Lambeau Field stadium taxes, a tourism tax and a gas tax.
\
 ""Those of us who try to control spending haven't been able to get to some other legislators,"" Nass said.
\
Nass said he became concerned last spring when the state borrowed more than $400 million with little discussion.
\
""I realized some people in the Legislature were not interested in cutting spending,"" he said.
\
Nass expects abortion, education issues and a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage to continue to be issues in the next legislative session.
\
The cost of health care and prescription drugs will also be discussed. Nass said he is open to allowing consumers to get their medications from Canada, but the measure needs more exploration.
\
Woods believes residents should be able to get medications from Canada.
\
Woods previously ran unsuccessfully for the 11th Senate District, the 43rd Assembly seat, Delavan alderman and for a seat on the Walworth County Board. He said he would move into the district if elected.
\
Hinkforth, who lives in the district, said the Legislature needs more scientists and fewer lawyers so the state can properly address issues of natural resources and the environment.

227,"Olsen, Madison, is a Dane County supervisor. He worked on Gov. Tommy Thompson's Alternative Fuels Task Force from 1991 to 1994.\ Gov. Tommy Thompson and the Assembly Republicans are shamelessly exploiting the gas price issue. Attacks on the Environmental Protection Agency and Al Gore over gas prices are flawed and deceptive.\ Thompson wants to blame the EPA for price hikes because of new reformulated gasoline requirements. Thompson omits the fact that the EPA is enacting the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1991, passed by Congress and signed by President George Bush. Thompson also fails to explain why prices are also up in Madison and other Wisconsin cities with no reformulated gasoline requirement.\ The most obvious contributor to higher gas prices is OPEC. The OPEC nations have shown unusual discipline in reducing oil supplies and driving up prices. At the same time, global demand is growing. Constrained global supplies and increased demand push prices up. The EPA and Gore have nothing to do with this. False accusations don't help us confront the problem.\ Don't forget, Thompson vetoed removal of automatic increases in Wisconsin's gas tax. Thompson is probably more responsible than the EPA for the gasoline price increases due to his strong support for gasoline taxes over the years.\ Energy and environmental issues are intertwined. Thompson and George W. Bush would sacrifice environmental protection for cheap oil. Thompson wants clean air requirements repealed and to forfeit increasingly rare natural areas offshore and in Alaska for cheaper gasoline. Republicans must think voters are idiots when they consistently undermine environmental efforts yet tell us they are ""pro-environment.""\ Thompson ignores another player in gas prices. Oil companies have manipulated prices in the past. Why assume they are not doing so now? Reformulated gasoline requires use of ethanol, and Big Oil fought hard against ethanol competition for decades. Oil companies are not beyond manipulating prices to give ethanol a black eye.\ Then, Thompson complains about our level of oil imports. Yes, oil imports are a high percentage now, and they were when I wrote Thompson's alternative fuels speeches in 1992 and 1993 after 12 years of Republican energy policies. Yet Thompson still attacks the energy policies of President Clinton and Vice President Gore.\ Clinton and Gore have followed cheap oil policies similar to those of their Republican predecessors. However, Clinton and Gore also pushed for consistently funding efforts to develop alternatives to oil opposed by Republicans in Congress. Cheap oil is a bipartisan energy policy; developing alternatives is not.\ But cheap oil is only cheap at the pump. If we add in military costs to protect foreign oil supplies, environmental damage to land, sea and air, public health costs, costs of sprawling growth and lucrative tax breaks to oil companies, the costs rise significantly."
228,"MERRILL – Joseph Dutton feels like he's being punished for caring about the environment. Dutton's wife bought a used 2012 Toyota Prius because they wanted to use less gasoline during her 70-mile round-trip daily commute.\Dutton's wife died two years ago, and the hybrid isn't driven as much now. But when he went to re-register the car online in early October, he saw he would have to start paying a $75 surcharge, and he called his state legislators to ask why.\""They told me that they decided to do that because of fuel costs,"" Dutton said. ""I wasn't paying enough in taxes because I wasn't burning as much fuel.""\Wisconsin has technically had a $75 surcharge on gas-electric hybrids — as well as a $100 fee for electric vehicles — for two years, but the fee on hybrids was not initially collected by the state Department of Transportation because the law was written in a way that made it difficult to determine which cars qualified.\That was changed this year, in the state's biennial budget, to make the law clearer and more enforceable. The amended language removed the distinction between a plug-in hybrid, which starts in electric mode before switching on its gas engine, and a conventional hybrid, like Dutton's Prius.\Money collected through the surcharge is transportation fund revenue collected by Wisconsin's Division of Motor Vehicles. That money goes to maintaining Wisconsin's infrastructure and services.\The main source of transportation revenue 2017-19 was state funds, at 60.1%. Other sources include bond funds and federal funds. State funds were primarily collected through motor fuel tax and registration fees.\The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon. Wisconsin charges another 32.9 cents per gallon, where 2 cents of that goes to the state's petroleum clean-up program. Wisconsin had the 19th-highest state gas tax in the country as of February 2019.\Combined, residents pay 51.3 cents in tax for every gallon of gas, or about 21.4% of the average price per gallon of regular gasoline on Nov. 25, according to AAA.\The surcharge came as an unwelcome surprise for some of the more than 70,000 Wisconsin owners of hybrid vehicles, who question its fairness.\Manawa resident Jenny Meyer Rae has a 2014 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid. Rae said her car gets between 30 and 38 mpg.\""I don't feel as if I should have to pay extra for my car since there are other non-hybrid vehicles that get that same gas mileage,"" Rae said.\Deborah Salon is a senior scientist at Arizona State University's Global Institute of Sustainability. She said Wisconsin's inclusion of hybrids in fees is odd because these vehicles run entirely or partly on gasoline, similarly to gasoline-powered vehicles.\""I don't see why hybrids are charged this fee at all. Hybrids are simply fuel-efficient vehicles, and the state isn't charging a fee (and shouldn't) for other high fuel economy cars,"" Salon said in an email.\Wisconsin is one of only eight states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, to require fees for conventional hybrids. Only Mississippi ($75) and West Virginia ($100) charge as much.\Door County resident Sandy Brown, who drove a 2005 Toyota Prius for 14 years and now drives a 2019 Toyota Prius. She said she purposefully invested in a car that would use less gas to help the environment, which is important to her in light of climate change.\Yet as hybrid and electric vehicles become more popular they pose a problem: decreased revenue for state and federal road maintenance.\The point of a fuel tax is that people pay for the upkeep of the publicly provided road they're driving on. The more someone drives, in theory, the more they'd have to pay.\However, electric cars and hybrids don't neatly fit that formula. In fact, electric vehicles alone reduced federal gas tax collections for road maintenance in the U.S. by an estimated $249 million in 2017, according to research by Lucas Davis and and James Sallee of the University of California-Berkeley.\If drivers of electric and hybrid vehicles are paying as much or more than gasoline-powered vehicles — whether that's a surcharge or per mile — it would make less financial sense to drive less expensive low-emission vehicles.\Beth Robinson drives a 2008 Toyota Prius and hopes to buy an electric vehicle next. She said the state and country need fewer barriers to use hybrid and electric vehicles, instead of the opposite.\""Newer clean technologies are desperately needed to combat climate change,"" Robinson said. ""Incentives to buy these vehicles should be ratcheted up instead of reversed.""\CREDIT: Nusaiba Mizan"
229,"
There was one noticeable absence in the roster of speakers at the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin's 2006 Annual Meeting in Madison Thursday: any politician.
\
""We've got a lot of work to do for the upcoming state budget,"" said TDA President Scott Sharp. ""It used to be that no matter who you were - Democrat or Republican - you recognized the importance of the transportation industry. But somewhere along the line, we lost public opinion and political will. And that's why today's agenda is void of candidates running - we're addressing issues that go beyond next week's elections.""
\
Under the title of Transportation Investment: Public Opinion and Political Will, the 2006 TDA meeting not only pointed out the needs of Wisconsin's transportation system but the far-reaching effects it can have on businesses throughout the state.
\
""Candidates are wrapped up in issues right now that won't affect the dynamics in the transportation system that much,"" said TDA Executive Director Bob Cook. ""This is an agenda that gives us an honest look at what the system is facing.""
\
And what it is facing isn't pretty. The financial stability of the state's transportation fund took hard hits in the last session when the Wisconsin Legislature repealed gas tax indexing and voted against a bill that would have prevented further raiding of the fund in future budgets for nontransportation related initiatives.
\
Businesses feeling crunch
\
And while the Road to the Future Committee was launched earlier this year to address the state's financial needs, it hasn't put out any news to assuage any lingering concerns of the system's financial vulnerability. In August, the committee announced that it would take almost $700 million per year to maintain the basic needs of Wisconsin's transportation system.
\
David Alamshah, the director of transportation logistics for Harley-Davidson, spoke at the meeting and said that the environment in Wisconsin right now was building up to what he called a perfect storm.
\
""Equipment costs, driver shortages and fluctuations in the price of gas are all building up to a tough situation for businesses in the state,"" he said. ""This was the first year that we had to accept there was a cost-containment problem starting to occur.""
\
And while a lot of people are starting to accept the problem, Cook said, it's time to start dealing with it.
\
""If we don't address the problem in the upcoming budget, the transportation system could very well get away from us,"" Cook said. ""It's good today, but we have to ensure that it will be good tomorrow. If we let it get away from us, we also can end up letting lives, jobs and the quality of life we have get away from us.""
\
Legislators ignoring issue
\
The answer, then, may be simply getting the word out. Cook's presentation showed figures that said in 2003, a vast majority of voters agreed that the nation was facing a transportation crisis. Today in Wisconsin, however, most voters don't think there is a crisis, and transportation is nowhere near the top of voter's priority list in the coming election.
\
""Is it reasonable to expect that the Legislature will give the system $700 million a year?"" Cook asked. ""No. But we have to expect that they'll do something. I think that legislators recognize the problem, but in the mix of education, health care and various tax issues - not to mention countervailing political pressures - it's easy for them to look past it. Hence this meeting's title.
\
""It's easy to put off addressing the issue for another year or two, but the more you do that, the more it gets away.""
\
And while the agenda set up something of a ""no politicians zone,"" Sen. Roger Breske, D-Eland, made a surprise appearance and was afforded a few minutes of talking time. While he pointed out that his seat was not one that was going to be voted on Nov. 7, he encouraged those in attendance to make sure the politicians that will be voted on are held to their word.
\
""Put your person to the test,"" he said. ""Make them accountable for what they say. We need to keep the roads open because I do know this - if we don't have good roads, we're all going to starve.""
"
230,"Editor's note: The deadline for submitting letters to the editor about the Nov. 6 election has passed. Watch for more letters next week.\As voters, you will be asked to perform a very important task on Nov. 6. Please vote, and please vote for Shawn Becker to become the next sheriff of Wood County. We owe it to ourselves to put the best person in office, one who will have the best interests of the public ahead of his own.\I know candidates Becker and Hiller very well. I was responsible for their hiring in 1997 and supervised them for about 13 years. Although I like John Hiller, I strongly recommend Shawn Becker as the person who should serve as our next sheriff.\Rather than make comparisons, I would emphasize the qualities that Becker has to make him the best candidate. Shawn has held multiple positions within the Wood County Sheriff's Department, with many having leadership responsibilities. He has a background in criminal investigations, has been involved in SWAT and is currently a captain supervising the Patrol Division since 2010. This demands that he becomes involved with every facet of the department on a regular basis.\Wood County deserves a sheriff who is accountable to the public and devoted to department employees. The public will be better served by a sheriff who supports positive law enforcement that is consistently administered on a regular basis. They deserve a sheriff who is motivated to do the right thing, without a personal agenda.\Please vote Shawn Becker, as he will serve you well!\David Laude,\Wisconsin Rapids\I like Scott Krug, and, as a fellow Rome resident, should support him. But, I'm also a lake dweller, concerned with the declining water quality of my lake and the streams around me.\Scott is hampered by the party he represents, as its history over the past eight years shows it is firmly in the camp of industrial agriculturists, at the expense of those of us concerned about our environment here in the Central Sands.\On a few occasions, Scott appeared to support us with amendments to control the proliferation of high capacity wells, but he either didn't get the party support or the proposals were de-funded and made useless. It's time for a change.\I think Dave Gorski will follow through on his promises to protect our lakes and streams in the Central Sands, and he is not hampered by an administration and a party so heavily influenced by industrialists and their lobbies. We need to find a balance that supports farms and the environment, and that has not happened during the terms of Krug and Walker.\Drive around the area and notice all of the Krug/Walker signs surrounding businesses and agriculture fields. Then, notice where Dave Gorski's signs are. They are in the yards of homeowners like us, the forgotten constituents.\Vote for the environment this year. Vote for Dave Gorski.\Donald Ystad,\town of Rome\It's hard for me to sit back and watch daily Scott Walker's campaign ads that are deceitful, misleading and unethical.\Tony Evers is an honest and decent man, who would find any unconscionable crimes against children abhorrent. He is a man of substance and character, who would clearly work hard for the citizens of Wisconsin, rather than the out-of-state special interest groups pouring millions into Walker's campaign.\In a recent television Walker ad, citing the Middleton School District that involved a teacher viewing pornographic images, two courts upheld an arbitrator's decision to reinstate this teacher. At the time, Evers, as state superintendent, did not have the authority to revoke the license. What is sickening is Walker knows this, but deviously tries to lead viewers in his ads into believing Evers is soft and does nothing about unsavory behavior.\What Evers did do was change laws, by working with both parties to give the state superintendent broader powers to revoke educator licenses. Where was Walker when this case actually took place?\Don't fall for the governor and his backers' deceitful tactics. Wisconsin deserves honesty and integrity. Vote for Evers this November as part of the ""BIG BLUE WAVE.""\Fred Hardt,\Wisconsin Rapids\When I learned that Shawn Becker was running for Wood County Sheriff, I knew that he was the right man for the job.\I have known Shawn since we attended the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point together in the 1990s. I have had the honor to coach alongside him the past four years. I have watched Shawn become a major part of the community of Wisconsin Rapids and Wood County.\If you are looking for a sheriff who knows his community, it is Shawn. He has been with the Wood County Sheriff's Department for more than 20 years. What I also feel is important is what he has done with his time to get to know the community and the people in the community outside of his career with the Wood County Sheriff's Department. Shawn has been involved in Aqua Skiers, Special Olympics-Polar Plunge, Elks and the Grand Rapids Lions.\What is most important to take away from his involvement for this community, is that he knows his community. He works alongside coaches and gives of himself to the people of this community and beyond. He knows what is going on with our community because he has been here, working and living with the people of our community.\I was fortunate to have Shawn coach my son in football and powerlifting. The unspoken lessons our son learned from Shawn will be with him every day. Shawn is a gifted individual, who has the ability to gauge a situation and know which way to proceed. I have been able to watch it firsthand as a parent and coach. Shawn always makes the time and effort to be the best advocate he can for the role he is called to do.\I am happy to call Shawn a friend, a fellow coach and, hopefully, this fall I will be able to address him as Sheriff Becker.\Tony Biolo,\Wisconsin Rapids\From what I've seen from Scott Walker from his first day as governor, he has not earned my vote.\Scott Walker has redirected K-12 educational funding to other areas, and attacked unions and state employees, which caused many to have a pay freeze for six to eight years. He has borrowed money for his first two budgets and gave K-12 a funding boost for one year that is still lower than the 2003 budget, with inflation adjustments included.\He wanted to replace gas tax with sales tax four years ago, and possibly boost gas tax by 5 cents per gallon. He refuses to visit prisons, even when inmates and staff are in unsafe conditions that occurred under his watch, or a facility fails. And he's failed to manage the Deer Kill program for our roads, statewide. He says that Tony Evers wants to increase toll fees on tollways that we don't even have, and he has not identified a tax income source to fix our road conditions.\Next, there's Foxconn's $3 billion in tax credits. There are also tax credits for college, child care, apprenticeship programs and a $100 child tax credit. Who will be paying taxes if Scott Walker is giving the possible tax income sources away, the older middle-class empty nester? Finally, there's the nondisclosure of how he paid for his failed presidential run so quickly.\Please assess why you are voting, besides party loyalty.\Robert Shear,\Nekoosa\Please consider voting for David Gorski for the 72nd Assembly District seat on Nov. 6.\I taught school with Dave for nearly 20 years at Alexander Middle School in Nekoosa. I know him as very knowledgeable, very caring, hardworking and a man of integrity.\He can help turn Wisconsin around and make it truly more concerned with the issues important to all of us. Dave is strong on infrastructure, health care, the environment and education.\See what a difference he will make.\Bill Leichtnam,\Saratoga\I encourage everyone to vote for Shawn Becker on Nov. 6. I have spent a career assessing human behavior/judgement. I have found Shawn to be a man who prioritizes community safety, and is willing to implement procedures towards that end. He truly wants what is best for the community and the professional growth of the Wood County Sheriff's Department.\I agree with his views on the drug problem within the community. He believes in strong prosecution of drug dealers, as well as advocating for successful recovery programs, such as those being implemented by the Wood County Drug Task Force. Shawn was instrumental in a Sheriff's Department program that supplies a heroine overdose medication (Narcan) to be administered by first responding deputies at overdose scenes. All Wood County police agencies followed suit, and now carry this overdose medication, resulting in numerous lives saved.\Shawn Becker has held leadership roles in the Investigations Division, Special Response Team, Accident Reconstruction and Administration. It is this range of experience that clearly makes him the most qualified candidate. Shawn recognizes the importance of listening to people and implementing appropriate change. Shawn has mentored young men by coaching high school football and is active with several community organizations. (I first met Shawn when he came into the SWEPS food pantry to donate food.)\Police work is a career which exemplifies honor and integrity. Shawn Becker displays these characteristics. He is the right choice to fill this position.\Scott Stewart, retired police commander,\Wisconsin Rapids\There's a lot of noise this election year about who's the best fit for offices up and down the ballot. But, in this year's U.S. Senate election, Tammy Baldwin is the clear choice.\Tammy is the only candidate who's in our corner. She's the only one who's fighting against powerful special interest groups and out-of-state billionaires who are trying to buy our Senate seat.\Tammy's record is proof enough that she works for Wisconsin, not special interests. I've seen that through Tammy's work to defend those with preexisting conditions from losing their coverage. Tammy herself has a preexisting condition, so she knows how important it is to advance affordable health care, and how wrong it is for insurers to place profit over people.\And, her work doesn't stop there. Tammy is dedicated to Wisconsin's workers and building an economy that works for everyone. Her ""Buy American"" legislation is a comprehensive, bipartisan effort to protect the Wisconsin workforce and economy.\As I go to the ballot box, I'll be voting for someone with a history of working across the aisle to protect affordable health care and advance our state's workforce and economy. I'll be voting for someone who works for me, who refuses to be bought out by powerful special interests or outside money, and who is in my corner.\I'll be voting for Tammy Baldwin.\Marge Edwards,\Adams\The most important election of our lifetimes is coming up on Nov. 6. What do you want your future to look like?\President Trump has accomplished much in his 23 months in office: record-low ethnic unemployment, four million new jobs created, nearly four million off food stamps, consumer confidence at an 18-year high, the stock market is at an all-time high, and trillions in tax cuts that put money into family's pockets.\All this, despite endless attacks on the president that is hated by liberals. The Mueller/Russia probe has found nothing, yet keeps rolling on, costing taxpayers millions. The liberal media has attacked him relentlessly, something it never did with President Obama.\Liberal lawmakers, such as Pelosi, Waters and Schumer, are urging liberals to get in the faces of Republican politicians and their constituents and ""tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.""\Former Attorney General Eric Holder suggested that conservatives should get kicked when down.\Liberal groups, such as Black Lives Matter and Antifa, more closely resemble hate groups in physically and verbally attacking anyone who doesn't think the way they do.\Is this really what you want our country to look like?\Liberal voters, you seriously need to re-think your vote. For those on the fence, the choice should be easy. America is not being divided by Trump and the conservatives. Obama, Clinton and the Democrat leaders are the ones to blame for that.\Vote Republican/conservative, if you want to save your country.\Michael Trzinski,\Port Edwards\Two years have passed, and once again, I am writing in support of David Gorski for the 72nd Assembly.\This is the second letter to the editor that I have written in my life. My first letter was written two years ago, when I wrote in support of Dave.\What I like about Dave is that he cuts to the chase. He is honest and straightforward, and he truly cares about the hard-working people in our state. He has shown that he, himself, will be a hard worker.\He has knocked on more than 4,000 doors, so far, during his campaign. He has probably come to your door to ask for your vote. His campaign contributions come from people actually living and working in our Assembly District. He has spent many hours becoming well-informed and knowledgeable about the pollution in our environment, the neglect of our infrastructure, the lack of parity in our health care system, and the sad state of our public school funding. He is earnest, enthusiastic and ethical, and he is not afraid to stand up to big money agendas that are not good for our state.\Please, join me in voting for David Gorski, a man of integrity, when he runs against incumbent Scott Krug on Nov. 6.\Jan Davis,\Wisconsin Rapids"
231,"
Madison - The first Democratic governor elected in 20 years, and by only 45% of voters, Jim Doyle had to lead from the political middle.
\
He signed almost all bills that the Republican-leaning state chamber of commerce, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, pushed through the Legislature. He pushed a job creation package of regulatory reforms for businesses wanting to expand or move to Wisconsin. He wanted nothing to do with a task force that suggested raising the sales tax in exchange for a new school-aid formula.
\
""He's a centrist - another Bill Clinton,"" said Martin Gruberg, associate chairman of the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh's political science department. Indeed, Clinton will visit Milwaukee on Nov. 3 to help Doyle's re-election bid.
\
Still, ""it's a disappointment to those who were expecting that (Doyle) would have a more active agenda,"" Gruberg said.
\
Gruberg and Ed Miller, a UW-Stevens Point political science professor, said Doyle's reach also was limited by having to face off against Republicans, who control the Legislature.
\
Because of that, ""he's been playing defensively,"" Gruberg said.
\
Miller noted one more restriction on Doyle: ""His pledge not to increase taxes constrained what he could do to confront problems facing the state.""
\
Here's a summary of Doyle's record on key issues.
\
Fiscal: Doyle campaigns on three major budget themes: He fixed a budget mess, he hasn't raised state income or sales taxes and he has signed into law $600 million in tax cuts. He signed limits on property taxes after twice vetoing more stringent measures passed by Republicans.
\
But some of those tax cuts - phasing out income taxes on Social Security, for example, and a 1-cent cut in the state gas tax - were first offered by Republican legislators, and Doyle simply approved them. Doyle also agreed to cut taxes paid by multistate corporations - a tax cut two Republican governors before him could never get approved.
\
Doyle has boosted state general-fund spending for his top priorities, while moving to limit the costs of other programs and toward a goal of cutting 10,000 state jobs by 2010.
\
Over his four years, general-fund spending went up by 13%, from $11.2 billion to $12.7 billion a year. But that's less than the 16% increase in the previous four years, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.
\
To pay for his priorities, Doyle has been willing to increase state government's general debt load by 20%. And to quickly rebuild the Marquette Interchange in downtown Milwaukee, Doyle approved issuing $382 million in bonds, which will force more of the future gas taxes and license plate renewal fees to pay down debt.
\
Education: The son and husband of teachers, Doyle said this at his first debate with Republican challenger Mark Green and has often repeated it or something like it: ""I'm going to save the schools of this state.""
\
Because of the budget crisis he found when he took office in January 2003, Doyle had to let state aid for public schools drop below the two-thirds goal in his first two-year state budget. But state aid for public schools returned to the two-thirds benchmark in the current two-year spending cycle.
\
That means, in Doyle's first four years as governor, state aid for public schools rose by 11%, to $5.63 billion a year. He paid for some of the increase by taking dollars from other accounts with vetoes and by increasing state debt.
\
He's also proud of this statistic: The number of poor children in a program that subsidizes small class sizes has increased by 27%, from 38,000 to 48,300.
\
But that increase was part of a deal that raised the number of poor Milwaukee children attending private schools at state expense to 22,500 - an increase fought by teachers unions that have endorsed Doyle - and a deal that also put those private schools under new financial accountability standards.
\
Doyle also has proposed making high school students take more math and science courses and expanding 4-year-old kindergarten.
\
Health care: Under Doyle, the number of people receiving health care through state Medicaid programs has increased 51%. That means 836,700 elderly, disabled or low-income residents were helped by it in the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the fiscal bureau.
\
Doyle also wants to expand the BadgerCare program for the working poor to cover every child not now covered by insurance, and he wants to create a new tax deduction for health insurance premiums.
\
Doyle worked with federal officials to extend the state's popular SeniorCare prescription drug program, despite the creation of a similar but less generous federal program that went into effect this year. But SeniorCare is set to expire at the end of June, and federal officials haven't said yet if it will continue.
\
Doyle also has tried to lower the cost of prescription drugs by helping residents order cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and allowing them to join BadgerRx, a state purchasing pool for prescription drugs.
\
He also worked to give families more long-term care options by trying to move more residents out of nursing homes and into community-based care. Last year, 1,101 were moved under this program.
\
Transportation: Wisconsin's annual transportation spending has risen 14.3% - to $2.28 billion - since Doyle took office. Doyle has pointed to the increase as a sign that he heartily supports building roads and railways that will boost the state's economy.
\
Critics say he has relied too much on borrowing, noting that annual payments on transportation bonds more than doubled since he took office.
\
In both of his budgets, Doyle moved hundreds of millions of dollars out of the transportation fund to prop up funding for schools. He then issued bonds to replace that money.
\
Last year, Doyle signed a bill that ended the annual spring increase in the gas tax for inflation - a funding mechanism that had existed for 20 years.
\
In his first budget, Doyle raised the annual vehicle registration fee by $10, to $55. He tried to raise it another $10 last year, but the Legislature balked.
\
Crime and corrections: Doyle signed several bills toughening penalties for sex offenders, including one that will require some sex offenders to be monitored for life with global-positioning devices after their release from prison.
\
Because of those new laws, the growing prison population and increased health care costs, the Department of Corrections says it needs an additional $247 million over the next two years.
\
Last year, Doyle ended a longstanding policy of housing as many as 5,000 inmates out of state to ease crowding and save money. He said prisoners were more likely to successfully return to society when they were released if they were imprisoned in Wisconsin, where relatives could support them.
\
Environment: Doyle has pushed ethanol production and handed out financial incentives to promote it. He pushed a bill that would have required the sale of gasoline with 10% ethanol, but it was defeated.
\
He also got Republicans and some environmental groups to agree on a package of regulatory reforms to speed up permits for companies that want to expand or locate in Wisconsin.
\
Doyle signed a bill this year that requires 10% of the state's power to be generated from renewable sources by 2015.
\
In August, Doyle pledged to reduce mercury emissions by 90% at coal-fired power plants in Wisconsin over the next dozen years or so by using new limits on emissions and giving utilities incentives to cut pollution.
\
On Doyle's watch, the state took title to another 160,000 acres of natural areas to keep them from being developed.
\
Social issues: He championed stem cell research without limits and set a goal of Wisconsin doing 10% of all such research nationally by 2015, which he said could employ 100,000. He vetoed a bill to ban human cloning, saying it could prevent some medical research; a measure to allow pharmacists and other medical professionals to refuse to perform certain procedures because of their personal beliefs; and a bill to prohibit same-sex marriages.
\
He opposes a constitutional amendment on the Nov. 7 ballot that would prohibit those marriages, saying they are already illegal in Wisconsin. He twice vetoed bills to allow people to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons.
\
Political reform: Doyle vetoed a proposal to require that voters show a photo ID, saying it could disenfranchise some voters. He endorsed ethics reforms that would merge the Ethics and Elections boards and give the new agency greater investigative powers; ban all fund raising while the state budget is debated; and ban former state officials from lobbying for a year after leaving office.

232,"Where they stand: 8th Congressional District candidates on the issues\Press-Gazette\The Green Bay Press-Gazette and The Post-Crescent of Appleton asked all five candidates for the 8th Congressional District for their stances on 10 issues, with answers of 100 words or less.\Winners of the Sept. 12 primary elections will face off in the Nov. 7 general election.\Democrats: Health care\STEVE KAGEN of Appleton: For many of my patients, it's either skip a pill or skip a meal. As a father-husband-physician-businessman-patient, I see and feel this crisis everyday. In Congress, I will fight for legislation that guarantees access to affordable care for everyone, by mandating open disclosure of all prices, securing the same discounts for all citizens, and forming a single insurance risk pool nationwide to leverage down prices for insurance and prescription drugs. I'll also work to establish a standardized health insurance policy that covers patients from head-to-toe, without exclusions or pre-existing conditions. In other words, if you're a citizen, you're in.\NANCY NUSBAUM of De Pere: My goal is to cover every American and stop pharmaceutical company lobbyists from writing policy that ignores children and hurts seniors. I've seen the importance of health care to children growing up in poverty. We need to start by covering every child. As Brown County executive, I oversaw a health-care facility that provided every patient with quality health care. We must fix the flawed Medicare drug plan that gives obscene profits to drug companies at the expense of seniors. We need to provide small businesses with tax incentives to provide health care and establish buying pools.\JAMIE WALL of Green Bay: Our current health care system is a moral and economic disaster. We need universal health care in this country. In the short term, there are several things we can do to cover more people. Tax incentives can help small businesses offer insurance to their employees, and I support allowing small businesses, family farmers, and the self-insured access to a nationwide health pool, which lowers premiums by spreading risk across more people. But we need a fundamental overhaul of our current system to achieve universal coverage and contain costs.\Republicans: Health care\JOHN GARD of Peshtigo: I support health-care reform that will lower the cost and provide more access with higher quality. These are key reforms that make us more competitive. As a legislative leader, I led numerous efforts to save people money. I helped write the best prescription drug program in America, known as SeniorCare. We worked successfully to enact a risk pooling program called Co-op Care and made insurance premiums tax deductible. Recently, we passed a transparency proposal to disclose provider costs. I support consumer-driven models that reform Medicaid and end cost shifting. I can bring people together to pass groundbreaking reform.\TERRI McCORMICK of Greenville: For Wisconsin farmers, small business owners and entrepreneurs, health insurance is an unaffordable luxury. A recent GAO report found that only a handful of companies are controlling 43 percent of the market, up from 33 percent in 2002. This decreases choice and increases costs for consumers. The solution lies in providing more competition and in providing access for consumers to price leveraging pools. In the Assembly, I wrote the first transparency laws for costs and quality, as well as the first competitive prescription drug purchasing pool in 2002, which saved $30 million dollars on drug costs in the first year.\Democrats: Energy\KAGEN: Like you, I believe we must become energy independent, and I will work hard in Congress to establish four essential energy goals: (1) emit less carbon dioxide and other pollutants; (2) invest heavily in renewable energy sources; (3) enable existing utilities to become sources of renewable energy; and (4) begin to decrease the effects of human activities on our environment. Becoming energy independent will require sacrifices from everyone, but a well-conceived strategy can succeed when developed in the open - not behind closed doors - and especially if it is based on energy conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy resources.\NUSBAUM: We must stop the huge tax breaks for big oil companies that have reaped record profits in the billions while we pay more at the pump. I will work to end the tax breaks for big oil companies and return the money to taxpayers who are struggling with gas and home heating costs. In Congress, I will support investing in renewable energy sources that create jobs here in Northeast Wisconsin where we need them and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We need energy policy that is good for our environment, our economy, and our homeland security.\WALL: The best thing we could do for our national security, our economy, and our environment would be to get this country on the road to energy independence and to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. President Bush's approach to the problem has been to give billions to the oil industry at a time when it was making record profits and we're paying record prices at the pump. We need a different approach. We need to invest in research in alternative energy, raise federal mile per gallon standards, and encourage conservation.\Republicans: Energy\GARD: America and American jobs are more secure when we rely less on foreign sources of energy. I believe we need to come together and aggressively work to lower the price of gas. We need to increase supply, aggressively promote alternative fuels and energy, and encourage conservation. I have voted for tougher laws to prohibit price gouging at the gas pump. In addition, I voted to cut the gas tax and diversify our transportation fund. We need an energy policy that promotes independence. We need additional refinery capacity along with streamlined regulations to increase supply and drive down prices.\McCORMICK: First, we must increase American production by repairing the Alaskan pipelines and building new refineries. I also supported a bill to end Wisconsin's automatic gas tax increase. We must continue to support the use of renewable fuels, which is why I co-authored a bill to expand ethanol use in Wisconsin. We must ensure that markets are open for ethanol and bio-fuels. Hybrid cars should be promoted along with research and development of clean renewable fuels like hydrogen. Eventually, we must strive to be like Brazil, which recently announced its complete independence from foreign oil.\Democrats: Homeland security\KAGEN: We must do whatever it takes to protect America from terrorism and keep hostilities off our shores. Today, we're all on the front lines, but we can become more secure by making three initial decisions: first, implement all recommendations of the 9/11 Commission; secondly, secure our borders; and thirdly, reduce threats from nuclear weapons. Terrorism is a tactic used by extremists, and there are extremists in every religion and in every political party. The real enemies of mankind are ignorance, fear, superstition and disease. We won't be truly safe until we confront the roots of the hatred directed at us.\NUSBAUM: This administration and Congress have under-funded homeland security and failed to fully implement the recommendations of the 9/11 commission. In Congress, I will work to make sure our first responders have the tools they need to respond to any possible event. Homeland security also means reducing our dependence on foreign oil and working for American energy independence. We must bring an end to the misguided and mishandled war in Iraq. Instead of sending our resources to Iraq we must secure our ports, give our first responders what they need, and make sure our National Guard can protect us at home.\WALL: We need to make smart investments in homeland security that will make our borders safer without sacrificing the freedoms that make us American. For less than the cost of six days of the war in Iraq, we could put 6,000 more border guards to work to secure our borders so that the National Guard doesn't have to do it. For less than we spend in Iraq in a month, we could pay for all our remaining port security needs as estimated by the Coast Guard.\Republicans: Homeland security\GARD: Our highest responsibility is to keep you and your family safe from terrorism. Unlike the Democrats in this race, I support the Patriot Act and giving our troops and intelligence agencies the tools they need to keep you and your loved ones safe. We must not underestimate the enemy. They are using more technology and tools to plan attacks. We must stay vigilant, focused, and use everything we have to keep Americans safe. While the Democrats embrace the ACLU position of weakness and appeasement, I support the Reagan strategy of peace through strength.\McCORMICK: The 911 Commission findings were clear - our failure to respond to the bombings of the Marine barracks in Lebanon, the World Trade Center, the USS Cole and American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania resulted in the attacks of Sept. 11. The war on terror and homeland security begin with effective ""intelligence systems"" and high-level coordination between local, state and federal agencies committed to securing our borders and protecting our citizens. These systems must ensure domestic response capabilities. ... Cooperation within the entire intelligence community is critical, and a complete entry and exit record of non-U.S. citizens must be carefully maintained.\Democrats: Taxes\KAGEN: Everyone knows that you can't get something for nothing. In this country, the wealthy own nearly all of the nation's assets and you'd think they would be willing to pay a little more in taxes to protect them. Leaders in Washington need to recognize that fair taxation is the real principle that should guide our tax policy, and take the necessary steps to ensure fairness. Congress should represent the interests of people who elected them, not corporations that have no rights under our Constitution. We need to simplify our tax code, and make sure that everyone pays their fair share.\NUSBAUM: This administration is giving tax breaks to multimillionaires while cutting education, health care and veterans' benefits. I fully support tax cuts that help middle class Americans make ends meet. However, Northeast Wisconsin families don't benefit from tax cuts designed for CEOs making $20 million a year. Instead, we pick up the slack when our schools are under-funded and our highways need repair. We need a tax system that works for working families, one that does not leave our children and grandchildren with an unbearable debt burden.\WALL: Our tax code should be simplified and made more fair - we've added 10,000 pages to the federal tax code in the past five years to create loopholes for various special interests. At a time of war and exploding national deficits, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans were a mistake. We must also end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, and we must ensure that American workers and businesses operate on an even playing field with their foreign competitors.\Republicans: Taxes\GARD: The hardworking people of Northeastern Wisconsin deserve a tax system that is fair, simple and collects less from them. I believe tax reform is imperative to an aggressively competitive economy that leads to good-paying jobs in Northeastern Wisconsin. As a state legislator, I helped cut income taxes by over $1 billion and passed numerous measures to reduce the tax burden on middle-class families and job creators. As congressman, I will fight to reduce the tax burden on middle class families and reform the system so that businesses can grow good-paying jobs in the district.\McCORMICK: It is important to remember that a big part of the reason our taxes are high is that the government can't control its spending. And the reason it can't control spending is that special interest groups and lobbyists contribute so much money to political campaigns. The number of earmarks in federal spending bills has exploded in the last 10 years from 1,400 to nearly 14,000. Earmark reform, zero-based budgeting and competitive bidding for government contracts are several reforms that would help rein in spending and taxes. You can read more details of my ethics and fiscal reforms at www.mccormickforcongress.com.\Democrats: Immigration\KAGEN: America has always been the land of hope and opportunity, and immigrants have often been our new leaders. But uncontrolled immigration has put great stress on our national security, health-care and education costs, taxpayers, and local economies. There are three things we can do immediately to address this challenging and complicated problem: (1) obey and enforce all our laws - with no cutting in line; (2) secure our borders; and (3) make employers of foreign workers pay for all of their health care and educational expenses - not local taxpayers. Let's all become legal and fair for a change.\NUSBAUM: Illegal immigration is a serious problem. Congress has a responsibility to strengthen our borders and fully fund border security to crack down on illegal immigration. But we also need to focus on employers who hire illegal immigrants as cheap labor. Illegal immigration creates a shadow work force, which hurts all workers. Corporate America is addicted to cheap labor; corporate executives either move our jobs overseas or bring people here to work for less than a living wage and then exploit that work force.\WALL: We need to beef up our border security and enforce laws against employers who hire illegal immigrants. Once we regain control over our borders, I would support proposals advanced by congressional leaders like Sen. Barak Obama and Sen. John McCain which would create a decade-long path to citizenship for some of those who are currently working illegally today - provided they get in the back of the line, learn English and pay fines.\Republicans: Immigration\GARD: We live in a post 9-11 world where it is critically important to secure our borders for economic and national security. I believe we need to act decisively to secure our southern border. I support sending 10,000 to 15,000 border security guards immediately to the Mexican border. We must strengthen our system of checks and balances to ensure that people are legal citizens when they are hired for jobs. In addition, I voted for legislation that would require anyone who applies for any taxpayer aid to prove they are an American citizen. Finally, I oppose amnesty.\McCORMICK: The number of illegal immigrants has doubled to 12 million in the last decade, despite the fact that domestic security spending has risen 13 percent per year. We need to start by tightening the borders and creating a new Ellis Island-style checkpoint to register immigrants and distribute biometric identification cards so that we can track the people who are entering this country. I support enforcing the rule of law and oppose amnesty. I also support patriotic and legal immigration that strengthens our economy and our diversity as a nation.\Democrats: Economy\KAGEN: Thousands of hardworking people in our 8th district lost their manufacturing jobs, and when their jobs were shipped offshore, much of the wealth in our region also disappeared. We need a positive change and a new direction. Let's start by repealing unnecessary tax cuts to the wealthy, and then begin to ship our Wisconsin values overseas, not our jobs. We need fair trade, not free trade. Congress should also close tax loopholes that assist corporations in moving their operations overseas and reward companies who create higher-wage jobs back here in Wisconsin. Let's bring great manufacturing jobs back to Wisconsin.\NUSBAUM: I know what it takes to create jobs, bring businesses here and grow the economy in Northeast Wisconsin. We have suffered under the influence of corporate special interests and their lobbyists in Washington who have created tax policy that encourages companies to move jobs overseas instead of creating and keeping them here. I am going to Washington to fight for policy that gives businesses incentives to create jobs right here at home, not move them overseas. We also need fair trade policy that creates a level playing field and includes child labor laws, workplace safety and environmental standards.\WALL: I spent two years promoting job creation in Wisconsin as head of the state's economic development programs. Manufacturing is the backbone of our local economy, and we need to support manufacturing companies and the high-quality jobs they provide. That means helping them to modernize their operations to stay competitive by funding programs like the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. It also means fighting to ensure that trade agreements are fair for American workers and businesses. Finally, we need to control the unprecedented budget deficits that are mortgaging our future and damaging our economy.\Republicans: Economy\GARD: The economy is one of the most important issues for families in the 8th district. We must create an environment that allows American employers to be aggressively competitive. Tax reform, streamlining permitting processes, and ensuring affordable health care will help companies provide good-paying American jobs. At the state level, I delivered regulatory and tax reforms that led to numerous job expansions. I also worked in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that Northeastern Wisconsin has the infrastructure to expand our economy. I will work to make sure we have the federal resources that make our district competitive in a global economy.\McCORMICK: According to the Census Bureau, average household income in Wisconsin declined by more than $2,200 from 2004-2005. This trend can be reversed by increasing our commitment to job growth and manufacturing. We must also focus on job training and education for an adequately skilled work force. As chair of the Assembly Committee on Economic Development, I wrote the Blueprint for Change, a major job growth initiative. I fought to save the funding for our Manufacturing Extension Centers so our manufacturers will remain competitive, and my Small Business Regulation Reform Act received a ""best practice"" award as a national model.\Democrats: Stem cell research\KAGEN: I know something about human diseases and the personal suffering of my patients and their families. I support stem cell progress to fulfill the promise of finding a cure for many life-altering and painful disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, juvenile diabetes and spinal cord injuries. Saying no to stem cell progress is extremely unkind to patients who can benefit from new treatments and potential cures. If one truly cares for life, and believes in improving the quality of our lives, then one should say yes to stem cell progress. Be not afraid to take this step forward. I am proudly pro-cure.\NUSBAUM: I stand with families across Northeast Wisconsin in support of stem cell research with appropriate ethical guidelines. Stem cell research will help millions who suffer from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and a host of other potentially treatable diseases - like my husband who suffers from Agent Orange-related diabetes. Caring people support stem cell research that can change the lives of millions of Americans. We must do whatever we can to bring an end to the suffering of individuals and families. Responsible research that helps families and communities is vital for the future of Northeast Wisconsin.\WALL: I support embryonic stem cell research. We must eliminate the current restrictions on therapeutic research involving stem cells. Our current government policy is a failure - even President Bush's own National Institutes of Health director believes that the administration's position is hindering scientific progress. More stem cell lines for research mean hope for the tens of millions of Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-1 Diabetes, and other maladies.\Republicans: Stem cell research\GARD: I believe Wisconsin can and should be a leader in ethical medical research. I supported building the BioStar initiative to further medical research at UW-Madison. In addition, I helped deliver $2.5 million in funding for critical Alzheimer's research at UW. I support adult stem cell and umbilical cord blood research where over 70 disease cures and or preventions have been discovered. There is tremendous common ground on this area where we should work together. I voted to prevent the cloning of human beings in Wisconsin but Governor Doyle unfortunately vetoed the bill. We should not create life to destroy life.\McCORMICK: I am against embryonic stem cell research and fully support research on adult stem cells and umbilical cord blood. My heart goes out to the families who have loved ones affected by diseases searching for cures. Researchers have been unable to move beyond animal embryonic stem cell studies because of their unpredictability and tumor-causing propensity. Embryonic stem cells have not ""cured"" or treated a single human patient. Stem cells from cord blood, teeth, blood, bone marrow, muscle, pancreas, placenta, uterus, and scalp have been successfully treating diabetes, heart damage, liver damage, strokes, cerebral palsy, and acute renal failure.\Democrats: Government integrity\KAGEN: Public confidence in our government has not been this low since the impeachment of President Nixon. We must free our government from the influences of special interests and elect a congressman who is accountable only to the will of the people. I am running for a public office, not a corporate office. I will work hard in Congress to restore public integrity with five essential reforms: (1) eliminate corporations from our governing process; (2) establish public financing of elections; (3) close the revolving door between Congress and lobbyists; (4) pass comprehensive ethics reforms; and (5) restore openness in federal contracts.\NUSBAUM: In Washington the interests of hardworking people have been pushed aside for special interests. We must get lobbyists and special interests out of Washington and restore the voices of hardworking people. I have vowed to make ethics and lobbying reform a top priority. As a founding member of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign and a board member of Common Cause, I have been a leader in Wisconsin to restore ethics in government. In Congress, I will reject all gifts or travel from lobbyists or special interests, report all meetings with lobbyists within 24 hours, and support legislation to prohibit anonymous earmarks.\WALL: The relationship between Congress and lobbyists is a disgrace. I support a reform package called ""A Proposal to Make Congress Work."" This proposal would ban lobbyists from congressional travel, end the practice of using earmarks to buy votes for questionable legislation, curb the congressional leadership's abuse of power, and prohibit the House from voting on legislation without giving members time to familiarize themselves with it.\Republicans: Government integrity\GARD: Wisconsin has some of the toughest ethics laws in the nation. Lobbyists can't buy a legislator anything - not even a cup of coffee. I think implementing similar laws in Washington D.C. would offer real reform. As Assembly Speaker, one of my first acts was to pass a bill outlawing pay-to-play. Recently, I authored the Contract Sunshine Act to increase public disclosure of anyone who is bidding on major state contracts. I think these reforms bring integrity back into the system. I pledge to work together with both sides and lead with integrity to move our nation forward.\McCORMICK: We have seen corruption and convictions on both the state and the federal levels. This is the result of career politicians who value their jobs and campaign contributions more than their constituents. I'm calling my campaign the ""Honesty Tour"" because I believe government integrity must be restored. That's why I was the lead Assembly author of the Ethics Reform Bill. In Congress, I will fight for ethics reforms like term limits and bans on fundraising outside your congressional district. We need to close the ""revolving door"" practice of legislators and staff taking high-paying jobs as lobbyists after they leave office.\Democrats: War in Iraq\KAGEN: Our brave soldiers do not belong in Iraq, and Iraqi extremists do not belong over here. What Islamic clerics could not do in a thousand years, President Bush did in three: He united our enemies and divided us from our friends. We must elect tough and smart leaders to begin to end our involvement in their thousand-year-old civil war. Our best strategy forward is to declare victory; deploy our forces elsewhere; implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations; secure our borders; and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. By working together, we will defeat extremism, everywhere in the world.\NUSBAUM: This issue affects me personally because of my husband's service in Vietnam and my commitment to military families. This president took us into a war that is both misguided and mismanaged. In Congress, I will demand President Bush create a plan that reduces the level of violence, reduces troop numbers and stops the hemorrhaging of American dollars into this war. We need to give Iraq back to the Iraqis and bring our brave men and women home as soon as possible. In Congress I will make sure that veterans' services are fully funded when our troops come home.\WALL: Invading Iraq was a mistake. It's been a distraction from our struggle against terrorists. We're bogged down in the middle of a civil war and spending billions of dollars and thousands of lives in the process. It's time to redeploy our troops. Our servicemen and -women have performed admirably under difficult circumstances, but their civilian leadership has failed them. We need a fresh start in Iraq and a congressman who will ask tough questions about President Bush's failed policies.\Republicans: War in Iraq\GARD: We must stand united as Americans to support our troops in this critical moment. Americans are safer when freedom and democracy expand. While mistakes have been made in Iraq, victory is critical. We must not allow terrorists to have a safe haven to plan future attacks on Americans. We need to work together as Republicans and Democrats to finish the job as soon as possible, bring our troops home and keep our nation safe. I support a well defined and understood plan to stabilize the Iraqi democracy, defeat the terrorists and bring our troops home.\McCORMICK: I stand firmly with the U.S. military and troops that are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. They must have the best armor, equipment, training, air support and intelligence. Our resolve and commitment to stabilize the region has resulted in a weakened terrorist network and reduced likelihood of an attack on U.S. soil. A stable democracy in the Middle East will serve as a model of liberty. The nuclear threats from Iran are less likely with a stable Iraq and Afghanistan. Our presence in Iraq has resulted in the construction of hospitals, schools and other critical infrastructure for the Iraqi people.\Democrats: Greatest challenge facing the United States\KAGEN: We need to find a better way to do things in America. Our government has lost its way and failed to listen to ordinary people. We must restore faith in our government; good government can make a positive difference in people's lives. Let's restore our faith in each other by enacting meaningful and effective election and lobbying reforms. Abroad, we need to show our allies and our enemies that conversations, not confrontations, can solve even our greatest differences. Let's rediscover the American values that made us great. I believe we need a positive change and a new direction this fall.\NUSBAUM: The interests of hardworking people have been pushed aside for special interests. I have spent my life standing up for those among us who most need a voice, and in Washington I will be an advocate for the people of this district. I will fight for ethics reform to restore our trust in government. From listening to people, I know the health care crisis and the mismanaged and mishandled war in Iraq are top challenges facing our country. I will represent the hardworking families of Northeast Wisconsin and find a solution for health care and get us out of Iraq.\WALL: The war in Iraq. President Bush has led us into a quagmire. The war has made us less safe rather than more so. Almost 3,000 Americans have lost their lives. And we've diverted resources that could be better spent elsewhere to secure our borders, to pursue the people who actually attacked us on 9/11, or to meet other important needs here at home. For what we spend in Iraq in two months, we could cut the number of students to 18 in every classroom in American or provide health insurance to every child in the country who now lacks coverage.\Republicans: Greatest challenge facing the United States\GARD: I believe we need to focus on making America the best place in the world to create jobs. There are many things we can do to tear down obstacles to job growth. I support policies that encourage investment and make us fiercely competitive. We have a tremendous work force with some of the hardest-working, highest-skilled workers in the world. We must give them the chance to compete in a global economy. I believe families want a good job, in a safe neighborhood, in a strong country. I am confident I can get the job done to make that a reality.\McCORMICK: The role of the U.S. in a post-Cold War world. After the wall came down, the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union was gone but the fractionalized Eastern European block remained without national identities and in many cases in social and economic ruin. These conditions helped foster terrorist groups in many areas. It will be a great challenge and a great opportunity to work toward peace and economic security as we move forward as the single remaining super power in the world. Terrorism has no borders. The United States has set the stage as a lasting democracy.\On the Net\ae John Gard: www.gardforcongress.com\ae Terri McCormick: www.mccormickforcongress.com\ae Steven Kagen: www.stevekagen.org\ae Nancy Nusbaum: www.nancy2006.com\ae Jamie Wall: wallforcongress.com"
233,"Dear Editor: As a Madison resident for 10 years, and someone who lives just a few blocks from the Edgewater Hotel, I know how much the hotel and our community need the project to move forward.\Particularly in these challenging economic times, it would be irresponsible to turn our backs on the chance to improve our community, bring new tax dollars to the area, and create jobs for workers.\Sara Kanawati, Madison\Court made a mistake\Dear Editor: Bill Malkasian, president of the Wisconsin Realtors Association, stated that the Wisconsin Supreme Court justices were right in their decision that there is no need to recuse themselves from cases involving huge campaign contributors.\If a judge's election campaign is able to be bought and paid for by certain interests, at least he or she should be required to recuse himself or herself from cases involving the ""buyers.""\Read the John Grisham novel, ""The Appeal."" It is a totally believable concept where big business essentially bought high court justices to serve their purposes.\Georgianna Stebnitz, Madison\WIAA using taxes to fight for secrecy\Dear Editor: This letter follows up on a recent column, ""WIAA needs greater transparency,"" by Rep. Tony Staskunas, on his bill to make the WIAA abide by the state's open meetings and public records laws.\It may interest your readers to know that shortly after the bill was introduced in late October, the WIAA registered with the state as a lobby organization and hired two lobbyists to oppose the proposal. This influential organization will pay lobbyists an untold amount of taxpayer dollars so it can continue to shut out taxpayer involvement in its decisions.\High school sports play an important role in many people's lives and Wisconsin communities. It's not unreasonable to require an organization that relies on public dollars and public facilities to conduct its business in public.\Michael Buelow Research director for the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign and member of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council\A shameful display\Dear Editor: I live in Monona, on Tonyawatha across from Lake Monona, where small houses are often demolished to make way for mansions. This is what Thorstein Veblen called conspicuous consumption. We who believe in reasonable use of private property find this bothersome as any ostentatious use of wealth is offensive.\But now we have a new phenomenon: conspicuous destruction of an already conspicuous mansion to make way for an even larger mansion. From small to bigger makes some sense, but what reason is there for destroying an already huge mansion?\In the process a dozen or more trees that protected the shoreline have been destroyed.\Conspicuous consumption attended by destruction for more consumption seems a vice, a gluttony for resources which are needed elsewhere.\Shame, where is thy sting?\Daniel J. Guilfoil, Monona\Yes, hike gas tax\Dear Editor: Kudos to columnist Bill Berry for his call to increase the federal gas tax. The most effective way to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil is to force a cut in consumption through a substantial increase in the gasoline tax.\Money raised through the gas tax could fund public transportation and renewable energy, thus creating jobs while benefiting the environment. Moreover, as Berry noted, a higher gas tax would bring other benefits, such as fewer traffic fatalities and fitter Americans as walking and bicycling replaced the auto on shorter trips.\Alex Szczech, Madison"
234,"Gov. Tommy Thompson has been a great fit for Wisconsin. However, I think he has lost touch with the people on the proposed high-speed passenger rail service from Madison to Milwaukee. This is not ""Back to the Future"" - it is more like ""Back to the Past."" . . .\Billions of dollars have been invested in the interstate highway system. It seems to me that the brain trust in this country could come up with a way to use the grid developed for the interstate system to meet our future transportation needs. We will not have the considerable safety concerns of incompatible railroad-highway crossings with this approach. As drivers of cars, we will not be forced to sit at a railroad crossing watching a train of almost empty cars pass by.\I also suspect that the cost being talked about is only the start and that the final total will be much more.\If you want to ride to work in a train, why not move to Chicago? If you want a nostalgic train ride, why not go to North Freedom? Why not use our technology to allow people to live where the jobs are? If more organizations insist on creating jobs in crowded cities, these organizations should pay for the transportation to get more people to their buildings.\As a taxpayer, I want my money used to educate our children, protect our environment, provide proper medical care and protect us from criminals. I don't want my tax dollars wasted on railroads, and I will vote for elected officials who support the same view.\- Thomas G. Arnold, Madison\Dependence on cars costs more than you think\The cost of the Midwest high-speed rail project is estimated to be $3.5 billion to $4 billion over 10 years, shared among nine states, with federal aid. Wisconsin's estimated share is $125 million. In contrast, the proposed cost of the new Marquette I-94 interchange in Milwaukee is estimated to be $350 million. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates U.S. societal economic losses from motor vehicle crashes to be $150 billion annually.\The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance recently issued several reports on transportation spending. In fiscal 1999, state spending on highways and interstates was $911.7 million. State highways and interstates are only 10.6 percent of Wisconsin's total road miles. The remaining miles are maintained by local governments. . . .\In 1997, spending by local governments for road construction and maintenance was $1 billion, which accounted for 15.8 percent of total local expenditures. . . .\In its TransLink 21 document, the state Department of Transportation estimated that in order for the gas tax to replace the property tax to fund automobile transportation, it would require an increase in the gas tax of 29 cents per gallon. This increase would certainly lead to a demand for high-speed rail service.\Since I love my home more than my car, I would gladly support this shift in the tax burden from my property to the gas tax. The anti- high speed rail groups fail to mention this operating subsidy for automobile transportation.\According to federal reports, two-thirds of petroleum demand is due to transportation demands. The automobile's share of that demand is 62 percent. American dependence on imported oil is more than ever a result of transportation's reliance on oil. Because we were Iraq's No. 1 oil customer, automobiles helped to fund Saddam Hussein's war machine. That war machine required billions of dollars of income taxes and American lives to destroy.\Since I love my paycheck more than my car, I would gladly support shifting the cost of our continuing Persian Gulf war operations (estimated at 50 cents per gallon) from the income tax to the gas tax.\- Todd T. Temperly, Lake Mills"
235,"City's police chief needs to grow up\Just like the out-of-control teenager running amok at East Towne Mall in Madison last year was referred to the restorative justice program, Police Chief Mike Koval should have to face consequences for his angry rants at the City Council and other adults in the community. \A police chief should not be able to act so immaturely and out of control, admit he did, and then be awarded by having taxpayers pay his legal fees. The chief's lack of self-control is inappropriate for the job and has been from the start. \The City Council should impose the strictest penalties possible. It'd be better to get rid of him, but that won't happen. \Please support the cop on the beat by showing the public that cops cannot run amok without consequences. \Stan Sheggeby, Madison \Badger Ammo site is hidden treasure \When you're driving by the old Badger Ammo lands on Highway 12 near Baraboo, it doesn't look like much, does it? \You wouldn't know it, but this quiet expanse of land hosts a wealth of grassland birds and other species rarely found anywhere else in Wisconsin. It is ecologically significant for our region and holds the potential for national significance. \Two-thirds of American grassland bird species are declining in numbers. These are the birds found at Badger. In 2003, biologists with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources found that Badger provides habitat for 97 confirmed or probable breeding bird species, of which 21 are grassland and shrubland dependent. \Prairies and oak woodlands were historically common in Wisconsin but now are rare throughout the state. Prairie once occupied about some 2 million acres in Wisconsin. Now, only about 2,000 acres remain. \Just as generations before us assured that today we enjoy the marvel of Devil's Lake State Park and bald eagles still soar over the Wisconsin River, the Badger prairie is our inheritance and legacy. It is a treasure chest holding the last remnants of our prairie heritage. \Laura Olah, Citizens for Safe Water Around Badger \Raise the gas tax to pay for roads \I was sad to hear Gov. Scott Walker say he would veto any budget that included a gas tax increase. To me, it is a failure in leadership to believe conservative values can somehow overcome the basic economic factor of inflation. \As construction costs have gone up, neither state taxes or the gas tax has increased to pay our state bills. Not having the courage to make any type of potentially unpopular decision, such as raising the gas tax, shows Gov. Walker is failing us. \I try not to be so callous as to believe his goal is to someday run for higher office and be able to claim he never raised any significant tax. But his current obstinance leads me to wonder. \Please fix our roads now and pay the bills now rather than increasing our future debt with increased bonding. \Robert Landgraf, Madison \Don't make cuts to the federal EPA \As a physician and mother of four, I am opposed to cutting the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Air and water cannot be regulated by states because these substances do not stop at state boundaries. Protecting our environment is critical for the safety, beauty and enjoyment of our country. \It is also a health and financial issue. Cutting back on environmental protection leads to problems such as in Flint, Michigan, where children had brain damage from being exposed to lead in their water. These children may now need support throughout their lives, a very emotionally and financially costly error for our country. \Air pollution leads to increased heart disease, strokes, asthma and the risk of Alzheimer's disease. These diseases add a tremendous emotional and financial burden to our families and health care system. \So I ask Scott Pruitt, who heads the EPA, are you looking out for the protection of the American people or for the protection of the dividends for big corporations? Please do not forget who is paying your salary. We the American people expect you to protect us. \Judian Smith, Madison \Trump has chance to reform health care \With the demise of the disastrous American Health Care Act, President Donald Trump has a golden opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise for affordable universal health care and ensure his presidential legacy. \Because Trump is not an ideologue, he is in a unique position to negotiate the enactment of truly bipartisan comprehensive health-care reform with Congress. He could adroitly capitalize on the recent widespread grassroots demonstrations in favor of expanded health care, and enlist the support of a coalition of health-care economists, physicians, nurses, hospitals and other health networks. \He also could enlist businesses that would benefit by reduced labor costs from a shift away from employer-based health insurance. Indeed, private insurance companies could continue to have a role in offering supplemental policies. \Achieving such sweeping health-care reform would require an unwavering commitment and focus by Trump to work with Congress in a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, given his ego needs, intense narcissism, lack of focus and current political ineptitude, it is unclear whether he has the ability to close this deal. \Stephen Austin, Madison"
236," Last week, after months of debate, theAssembly finally passed a new transportation budget for the state.\ Republicans hailed the budget as a victory for taxpayers because it won't raise the state's gasoline tax except for a slight adjustment for inflation.\ But the plan makes major cuts in mass transit aids for Madison and Milwaukee and reduces road maintenance aids for both cities.\ The bill will go to the Senate for approval next month.\ Rob Kennedy, the head of the New Transportation Alliance, has been watching the proceedings with interest.\ Kennedy's organization -- a voluntary coalition of more than 100 groups interested in the environment, elderly and disabled transportation and mass transit -- is pressing for a more balanced approach to transportation spending.\ Kennedy has a special interest in the fate of local mass transit funding because he's also a member of the city's Transportation Commission.\ He spoke with reporter David Callender about the budget's long-term effects on Madison, Dane County and the state.\ Q: Was the gas tax really needed to preserve transit programs?\ A: No. That's the main point to me. We're talking about $1.5 million to make Madison transit whole out of a $3 billion budget. We don't need a gas tax increase for that. The comparison is just crazy.\ Q: Should people assume that the budget -- with its cuts for Madison Metro -- will go through?\ A: I wouldn't say so at this point. It's going to be hard for the Senate to pass (a budget that restores funding for Madison) and getit back through the Assembly, but I think the shock level in the Madison community is strong enough that there may be an effort to change the budget before it gets to the governor's desk.\ Q: Who are the big winners in the Assembly version of the transportation budget?\ A: The folks who have the big state highway contracts.\ Q: Are they winning at the expense of transit systems?\ A: Yes. The Republicans talked about how they need the gas tax to continue with what's already on line; however, those programs are expanding the system, whereas transit is being asked to cut at the same time that development is increasing their service area.\ In other words, development is making the urban service area (for transit systems) larger, but the state has held transit service levels -- route miles and hours -- at basically the same level since the late 1970s. Can you imagine if we'd done that for roads?\ One of the biggest frustrations is that here you have one of the biggest parts of the state highway budget, which is rehabilitation, and federal cuts are on the way that would amount to $53.6 million, and that federal cut is being replaced entirely by the Assembly proposal.\ Bigger cuts are anticipated for mass transit -- roughly 49 percent -- and those are not going to be replaced at all. And that's on top of the cuts in state funding that we're getting.\ Q: If the Senate and the governor go along with this budget, what are its long-term implications?\ A: We will continue to depend on automobiles, by necessity.\ There's a market science to deal with this between the intensity of ridership. For every 1 percent increase in the fare, you have a 0.3 percent decrease in ridership.\ So I wouldn't be surprised to see a 15 percent or more drop in the ridership, which in turn hurts revenues. And it's very difficult to get that ridership back.\ Meanwhile, the gas tax, plus the price of gasoline, still gives us a lower cost for gas at the pump than we had 20 years ago, so it's not surprising that people aren't riding the bus so much. They really don't have a choice.\ Q: One of the suburban Republican leaders complained that to most suburban and rural residents, mass transit is just empty buses running around big cities. Is that characterization accurate?\ A: It's not an accurate characterization in Madison. During peak hours, they're full. At other times, they still have people on them.\ If you look at all the people on the highway, they're one person in a five-person car. They're one-fifth full, even during rush hour. If you took a one mile segment of cars on the Beltline during rush hour, you could get all of those people out of their cars and put them in one or two buses. There's far more empty space in cars than on buses.\ Q: At the federal and state level, we're seeing cuts in transportation aids amid a broader attempt to cut what's perceived as ""big government."" Some people see mass transit systems as a form of big government. Why should these programs be immune from cuts?\ A: Mass transit is a tiny operation compared to the roads. And we're already being forced to pay for ourselves more than others. Local roads get a 70 to 80 percent subsidy from property taxes. Meanwhile, the state highway system gets 60 percent of its costs paid for by the state. Local mass transit gets roughly 40 to 42 percent of its costs paid for by the state, and in Madison's case, that's about to slip to 37 percent.\ It's not the case that we're subsidizing buses, and not subsidizing cars.\ Q: Isn't that what the public wants -- bigger roads that make it easier to get from place to place?\ A: Some of the organizations we work with nationally have done polls, and while people agree there are problems with the automobile, changing that hasn't become a priority for them. What tends to happen, and what has happened especially out east, is that as urban sprawl becomes a problem, rail becomes a priority for them, and they begin thinking about that.\ Madison and Dane County, by the way, are on the edge ofa classic case of sprawl.\ Q: What will this budget do to that trend?\ A: The budget brings us to the crossroads faster. It will force Madison and Dane County to make a decision faster than it might have about putting into investments in transit and avoiding the sprawl. I think this budget puts in sharper relief what the choices will be.\ Q: Last week the Dane County Regional Planning Commission took an advisory vote to oppose expanding a portion of U.S. 12 because of environmental concerns. At the same time, the Assembly rejected several proposals to shelve the project as a cost-saving measure. Do you still have any hope of derailing this $60 million project?\ A: The decision was mainly a comment on the inadequacy of the federal Environmental Impact Statement.\ That means if the impact statement is not deemed adequate by federal authorities, or if it's challenged in court, the road cannot proceed. Thus far, there have been lots of voices saying the EIS is inadequate.\ Q: At this point are you optimistic about the future of mass transit?\ A: Today is very scary, but I'm optimistic overall. I don't see how we can go backwards. This is the only country in the developed world that's not investing heavily in mass transit."

RISING GAS PRICES
\
Public transit spurned as option
\
Thursday, June 15, 2000
\
The reasons for increasing gas prices are obvious: the destruction of Environmental Protection Agency regulations and the greed of gas and auto manufacturers, politicians and journalists. These groups profit from our lack of public transportation, which holds our entire population prisoner to a ""car culture.""
\
Gas producers rake in profits because Wisconsinites travel in the summer months. The deregulation of gas businesses allows this theft to take place without consequences. Politicians profit from the contributions of road builders and auto manufactures. Journalists profit from the daily auto ads that subsidize their operations. If there was a Sunday ""train section"" in our paper, ""journalists"" might give trains and train service honest assessment.
\
Without new investment in public transportation, we will not escape this prison. Go to Europe, where in Paris, for example, you can walk less than six blocks, get on public transportation and, for around $2, go anywhere in the city -- every 10 minutes or so.
\
The blind, selfish devotion to profit by these unscrupulous criminal groups is destroying the quality of life for all Wisconsin residents. Gov. Tommy ""greedy"" Thompson chooses to call for the removal of gas regulations, which does not solve our current problems, but surely will make gas producers richer while not reducing gas prices for the rest of us.

Consumers part of problem
\
I am happy that the Journal Sentinel is devoting much space in its paper and on its Web site to gasoline pricing.
\
I work at the retail end of gas sales, and the consumer is part of the problem. Consumers are not changing their habits, and, in fact, they are using more gas than last year.
\
Consumers need to send a message to big oil companies that when prices get out of hand, they will cut back. If consumers fail to do this, the prices will just keep climbing.
\
The local service station has no real choices on the retail price. By Wisconsin law, prices need to be marked up a certain percent above cost. Competitors can sue service stations that go below this markup minimum. However, even if service stations sold gasoline at cost right now, the Journal Sentinel would still be printing news stories on this topic. It is that serious.

\
Alternative fuels the best solution
\
What is all the fuss about high gas prices? We live in a capitalist society; therefore, the rules of supply and demand are in effect.
\
Whining to government officials is not the solution. The only real long-term solution is to cut down on our use of gasoline, which should drive down the price of gas. We can do this by driving less, using mass transit and trading in that gas-guzzling SUV for a more economical car that gets higher gas mileage.
\
But I believe the best thing to do would be to use alternative fuels, such as gasohol. Because gasohol is made from corn, it not only would lessen our need for foreign oil, but it would benefit our farmers.
\
This would also help to keep U.S. dollars in the United States. Plus, gasohol would be better for our environment. This is definitely a win-win solution.

Supply, demand a dated theory
\
The Wisconsin Petroleum Council has justified the price of gasoline with the ""supply and demand"" theory. Are we to assume that all progress is dependent on this less-than-noble theory?
\
I can no more accept that theory and OPEC's adherence to it unless it is applied universally. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries needs everything except oil; should not all of those products be withheld to drive up their prices?
\
How about Pick 'n Save? Can it refuse to open its doors and sell food only on a bid basis? Every service or product offered has the right to apply this theory, and then the world can go completely mad.

\
Incentive plan could offset costs
\
My plan to pay people who drive less (""Gas tax rebate of up to $2,800 could limit road expansions"") was first published in the Journal Sentinel on Nov. 30, 1999, in response to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's long-range highway plan. Had governmental officials considered my plan to be a realistic and sincere proposal, as it was offered, Wisconsin residents now driving less because of high gasoline prices (""Gas price's sting goes beyond pumps,"" June 11) would be over the hump to getting their rewards -- $400 to $2,800 -- for driving fewer miles this year.
\
That money might have helped to offset the negatives now being created in people's budgets due to rising gas prices. They would be emitting less greenhouse gas and air pollution as well.
\
But it was not to be; too unrealistic, expensive and, of course, not what Wisconsin's citizens are asking be done with their gas tax money and vehicle license registration fees, which, incidentally, have both also gone up in price recently.
\
According to the Wisconsin DOT and the road-building industry, what Wisconsin residents are asking for -- in fact, demanding -- is that they continue to build wider and faster highways with that money, and not offer some of that money back in the form of financial incentives for driving less.

Price issue more than reformulation
\
I don't understand why various public officials are focusing their gas price concerns on only reformulated gas in Milwaukee. Gas prices are going up in Illinois and other places, too.
\
Gas prices have risen far more than the 15 to 30 cents per gallon that reformulated gas is priced above the non-reformulated gas. Diesel prices have also risen dramatically.
\
Why are gas prices going up so much and so often?

Gas waiver would hurt residents
\
In 1997, there were more than 4,200 visits to area hospitals for asthma attacks triggered by smog. Children playing outside during summer, when ozone levels in the air are highest, are in greater danger of triggering asthma because they breathe 50% more air than adults per pound of body weight. Infants in high soot areas have a 45% greater chance of dying from respiratory causes.
\
One of the largest causes of pollutants such as these is emissions from cars. Yet our governor is petitioning the Environmental Protection Agency to let us burn dirtier fuel so it will be cheaper for us to drive to the supermarket.
\
Why doesn't he lobby the automobile industry to produce cleaner and more efficient cars? The technology exists for cars to get 70 miles per gallon. Yet there is no move from our governor to protect both the health and pocketbooks of Wisconsinites. Reformulated gas, in use since 1995, has improved the quality of air we breathe and done less to destroy our ozone layer.
\
For once, the Department of Natural Resources is separating itself from Thompson. Secretary George Meyer is right when he says public health in Wisconsin will be in trouble without reformulated gas, especially with the heat and humidity we've had.
\
If the EPA grants this waiver, we will suffer greatly.

ELECTION 2000
\
Monday, October 30, 2000
\
What would it be like with a President Nader?
\
Why is Ralph Nader an appealing candidate? Why does anyone think he will make a good president? What do people honestly think would happen if he is elected, however unlikely? Let me speculate.
\
The presidency would become marginalized because he has no experience holding elected office, has worked mainly in an adversarial role as a lawyer/advocate and not as a compromise builder, and clearly does not and would not have the support of Congress or the Senate. No one on Capitol Hill would work with him because those people know he has little respect for them.
\
He would become increasingly irritating to both the public and Congress as he uses his veto power to stall legislation while his own initiatives would go nowhere.
\
Don't get me wrong. I think Nader is a great person, just not the right person for the role of president. If he had a chance to debate, it is likely we would all know this. Instead, he has this wonderful ""outsider"" glow because we can only imagine what this principled man may have said in debate.
\
Too bad we won't know. We might have been surprised, and not always in a good way.

Gore clearly not a pro-union man
\
I couldn't disagree more with comments made by fellow Teamsters in the Oct. 23 article ""For these voters, the decision is made."" Al Gore is not pro-union despite what union members in the article believe.
\
They've apparently forgotten what happened eight years ago when Clinton-Gore broke a campaign promise to pass a law banning permanent striker replacement workers. They also ignore Clinton-Gore broken tax relief promises. Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in 1993 that passed what a senator in his own party called the largest tax increase in history. This included a gas tax increase. Imagine what this has cost a Teamster trucker filling his twin tanks the past seven years.
\
I've also discovered Gore's current tax relief plan would save my middle-class family nothing, while George W. Bush's would save me $1,200.
\
Gore's character is also an issue with me. He lost his only sister, a smoker, to lung cancer in 1984, yet he continued to grow and profit from tobacco farming years after her death. Gore's Big Oil babble is threatening union oil patch jobs. Are Teamster jobs on the line if Gore's next evil empire is Big Trucking?

National debt should be of great concern
\
Facts and figures.
\
1981: The national debt is less than $1 trillion. Ronald Reagan takes office and lowers taxes, especially for the highest incomes. He promises to balance the budget.
\
1989: The national debt is $2.3 trillion. George Bush takes office and follows Reagan's lower tax plan.
\
1993: The national debt is $4.6 trillion, a world record. Thank you, Presidents Reagan and Bush. Bill Clinton takes office, raises taxes without one single Republican vote. In the last three years, Clinton balanced the budget showing a surplus; $200 billion has been paid to help lower the debt.
\
Oct. 19, 2000: The national debt is $5,670,716,361,031.21. The yearly interest on this debt at 6% is $340,242,981,664.87.
\
It would be nice to lower the debt to next to nothing. We would save billions every year.
\
Young George W. Bush is running for office; he says one of the first things he will do is lower taxes across the board. Our big chance for our country to get out of debt would be out the window. Guess who I will not vote for. You're right. I will not vote for Bush.

Note biased sources of campaign polls
\
The banner headline in the Oct. 24 Journal Sentinel shouting that George W. Bush is ahead in polls is an example of inaccurate reporting at its worst (""GOP nominee takes the lead in Wisconsin"").
\
Reporter Alan J. Borsuk conveniently forgot to mention that the poll was paid for by the Bradley Foundation. He describes the front for the Bradley Foundation, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, as an organization ""often associated with conservative causes."" An honest description would be that it is a right-wing front for the Bradley, Scaif and Olin foundations. They are always associated with conservative causes.
\
Then, as if to spin the story for the doubters who might know about the Bradley Foundation's role, he wrote, ""There is no reason to believe that the poll was slanted.""
\
It is oddly convenient that this poll was released so it could be read at Bush's rally by Gov. Tommy Thompson. What Borsuk does not say is whether the poll would have been released had it demonstrated a dead heat or Gore in the lead. The Milwaukee Journal and the Milwaukee Sentinel would not have been so shameless.

Do your own polls and release them. Don't make a banner story out of a biased source.

I don't ask this to be unkind, but the Journal Sentinel really is spinning for the Democratic National Committee, isn't it? Case in point: the headline ""New day, new poll, and this time Gore has lead in state"" (Oct 26).
\
While literally true, the second paragraph states additional facts and suggests another headline: ""Majority of polls show Bush ahead in state"" or ""Bush leads in 2 of 3 Wisconsin polls"" or even ""Polls show race tight."" Any of those might have been a more accurate, and honest, headline. But then, I imagine the headline the paper ran was intended to spin the reader who would scan the headlines and not read the whole story.

Nader deserves credit; Gore deserves vote
\
Ralph Nader and the Green Party should be congratulated for garnering as much money and support as they have. Nader has always been a man of integrity.
\
Nader best represents me on environmental issues and his standards for clean air, automobile emissions and clean water. He also has many common-sense, no-nonsense approaches to issues affecting us all. Nader best represents the average American.
\
Unfortunately, in this political environment, with the huge amounts of money being spent by both Democrats and Republicans, no third-party candidate will ever be successful in a national election. It is nearly impossible for a third-party candidate to win the White House until there is some form of campaign finance reform.
\
Campaign finance reform has a chance of passing in the next administration only if Al Gore is elected. It could be argued that only Gore will keep issues such as campaign finance reform, clean air and water standards, strengthening public education and the teaching profession, and medical and drug benefits for seniors. A George W. Bush White House will set this country back 10 to 20 years on progress we have made and will allow our country to be owned and run by giant oil companies and special interest groups.
\
The best and only chance for the Green Party's agenda lies with Gore.

239,"Kelly is an economist with the Indiana Department of Transportation. Brannon is an assistant professor of economics at UW-Oshkosh.\ Environmentalists and corn producers have touted the production of corn-based ethanol as benefiting the environment and the economy. Ethanol is good for the environment, it is said, because it cuts down on noxious emissions from fossil fuels and good for the economy because it increases income for Midwestern farmers.\ In reality, the increased usage of ethanol neither significantly improves the environment nor materially helps farmers despite costing the economy billions of dollars each year. It does, however, provide ethanol producers with significant income at the expense of reducing the funds available for building or maintaining roads.\ Ethanol produced from corn is essentially a negative value-added energy source; the Environmental Resources Management consulting firm estimated that when the harvesting, distillation, production and transportation of ethanol is computed, it takes more energy to produce a gallon of ethanol than it gives off. This is reminiscent of the old chemical plants in the former Soviet Union that would take $100 worth of raw materials and magically turn them into $70 of finished product.\ The environmental benefits ascribed to ethanol are equally suspect. The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating a possible link between increased use of ethanol and smog, especially in summer months. While ethanol itself burns more cleanly than fossil fuel, the production of corn for ethanol is far from environmentally clean. The fertilizing, harvesting and transportation of corn decrease the true benefits of burning ethanol.\ Ethanol can be made from a number of raw materials, even garbage, yet the government only subsidizes the production of ethanol from corn. As this subsidy is the sole method of making the ethanol price competitive with fossil fuels, no other production methods are attempted on a wide scale. The reason behind subsidizing corn is not that corn is necessarily the most efficient input for ethanol but that Archer-Daniels-Midland essentially bought this subsidy through heavy political lobbying.\ With corn prices near record highs this spring, the economic inefficiency of corn as an ethanol base merely increases. The 5.4 cent tax break on gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol, or gasohol, amounts to a 54 cents-a-gallon subsidy for ethanol production, and several states also exempt gasoholfrom a part of the state sales or excise tax.\ But perhaps the least-known but most egregious method of ethanol promotion is found in the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which spells out the methods by which federal highway transportation dollars are allocated to the states. The ISTEA happens to be up for renewal this year. Most of the money for the various transportation projects comes from the excise taxes on fuels collected by the states and passed along to the Highway Transportation Fund.\ Buried deep within the lines of the ISTEA is the rate at which various motor fuels are taxed. The federal gas tax on ethanol is much lower than on fuels based solely on petroleum. The Federal gas taxes collected by the ISTEA make up the most of funding for the nation's highways.\ The problem with the tax break on ethanol is that states that decrease their contribution to the Highway Transportation Fund by increasing the use of ethanol (say, by mandating that all gasoline sold has10 percent ethanol) do not see a commensurate decrease in their funding for highway projects. A state can cut payments by $50-$100 million and still receive the exact same apportionments. As a result, individual states lose nothing, at least in terms of tax revenue, by mandating ethanol usage, yet the total amount of money available for roads and bridges in the U.S. falls, hurting the country. Hence, the ISTEA does more than just encourage states to promote ethanol; states can receive a revenue windfall by mandating ethanol usage, as states are quickly figuring out. If the ISTEA is left in its present form, most states will arrive at ethanol mandates that do nothing for the environment or for the economy while bankrupting the highway trust fund.\ Virtually everyone wants a clean environment, and the important debate is not on how much we should spend to improve the environment but rather on how we should spend this money. Anything we do to improve the environment comes at a cost. The cost of the various ethanol mandates are huge, and the benefits are nearly nonexistent. It's time to end the subsidization of ethanol and come up with better solutions for air pollution."
240,"Ed Garvey is a Madison lawyer who was the Democratic candidate for governor in 1998.\ Alliant Energy will have its name on Dane County's Expo Center, and Coca-Cola, the pause that used to refresh, is now in our schools. Where Reagan was condemned for suggesting that tofu and ketchup be called vegetables for school lunches, we now push sugar water and hope the kids drink it so we can reach the bonus payment level.\ Seems to me that if Alliant would pay $6 million for the Expo Center, why not sell naming rights to the City-County Building? Pretty dull name when you think about it. Why not the Colgate building: ""Come in and we will put a smile on your face."" And the new jail could certainly use a spiffy name. ""Jail"" sounds so punitive when we are really creating low-wage jobs inside. Perhaps the glove company from Green Bay could get naming rights and earn free labor for 15 years in return for a down payment.\ Jim Carley, a local developer, could have earned $650,000 over the life of the contract for brokering the deal between Dane County and Alliant. Imagine what he could do for the jail. Topf Wells was quoted in Isthmus as saying that ""it's the same system as when people win the lottery"" in explaining why Carley took his ""lottery winnings"" in the form of a check for the immediate sum of $365,000. Some lottery. Where do I buy a ticket?\ A cottage industry has been formed. Carley must look longingly at Bascom Hall. Imagine the deal they could strike with Jim Klauser at the Wisconsin Energy Corp.: Klauser Hall or the Wisconsin Energy Center. While the neon sign on the top of old Bascom might offend a few traditionalists, my guess is that a good broker could bring $15 million to $20 million to the university for that lottery ticket. Heck, we could pay the salary of the new chancellor. While Klauser would want to name him/her directly instead of going through the cumbersome Board of Regents, so what? We need the money, and it will avoid the messy open records law. Go for it! The law school? Name it for the tobacco lawyers. Education building? Barnes and Noble.\ And the fountains outside Monona Terrace? Why, Perrier of course. One can almost hear the secretary of commerce and her team discussing how the Perrier Fountains could create the public mood to permit the establishment of Perrier water extraction of millions of gallons of fresh ground water every day. A broker's dream. Give us the rights to take your spring water and we will fund Monona Terrace for 20 years. Trucks in and out, new housing for the Perrier executives, all the good stuff would follow. More highways, more campaign contributions from those who build them, more gas tax money. This is getting exciting, and we owe it to Jim Carley.\ Why stop here? The Chequamegon Forest is hard to pronounce, isn't Weyerhauser easier? And they will keep it neat and orderly, no more falling trees or pesky bobcats. A joint venture with Disney would be OK.\ How far-fetched is this? You should read the correspondence surrounding the Perrier efforts to take our water. ""Team Wisconsin,"" made up of George Meyer at the once-proud DNR, Secretary of Commerce Brenda Blanchard, Ben Brancel of the once independent Department of Agriculture and Forward Wisconsin, all worked to bring Perrier to pristine rural farmland.\ The land of Owen Gromme and Aldo Leopold would now support water extraction for a company that once shamelessly sent baby formula to Third World countries despite polluted water. And the goal of Team Wisconsin was not to protect the environment or our precious ground water or our trout streams. No, it was to help a subsidiary of a Swiss multinational settle a water extraction business here. It included ""selling"" the idea to the ""locals.""\ One obstacle was the absurd notion that Perrier would, like local residents, pay property taxes on its machinery and equipment. Outrageous. So Team Wisconsin began looking at a solution, and the easy one was to change the definition of manufacturing to include water extraction. Nirvana! No property taxes, no charge for the water, no worries about roads because the counties and towns would take care of those costs. How could Perrier lose? Team Wisconsin was so anxious to bring these truckers into Wisconsin to carry out our water that they had Forward Wisconsin give their corporate team free air travel on Midwest Express. Whoa, Nelly! Would the ""agent"" get 10 percent of the free ticket?\ If you think we are the progressive state of Wisconsin, go to Christiana and ask Alliant if it has a work permit to build the new plant. It doesn't, of course, but it says it has no need to follow local rules because the Public Service Commission (soon to be known by the name of their new corporate sponsor, Ameritech) gives it power to override all local rules.\ There is much to be thankful for in the new Alliant deal. It opens the way for all sorts of moneymaking schemes. No need to check on the credibility of the naming corporation. If Nike runs sweatshops that's OK. The swoosh will look great on the Capitol. And, inside, why call it the Assembly chambers if Foley & Lardner is willing to pay the salaries of the legislators for naming rights?\ If Microsoft runs a monopoly, that's OK, it will provide free computers and software for 20 years if we just drop the name University of Wisconsin. GatesU.com sounds better anyway.\ The only problem is our state song. How do we work in the ""Inc.""? What could we get for the naming rights to Wisconsin? Might as well check it out."

These key reforms make us more competitive.\As a legislative leader, I led numerous efforts to save people money. I helped write the best prescription drug program in America, known as SeniorCare. We worked successfully to enact a risk pooling program called Co-op Care and made insurance premiums tax deductible. Recently, we passed a transparency proposal to disclose provider costs.\I support consumer-driven models that reform Medicaid and end cost shifting. I can bring people together to pass groundbreaking reform. Energy: America and American jobs are more secure when we rely less on foreign sources of energy.\We need to come together and aggressively work to lower the price of gas. We need to increase supply, aggressively promote alternative fuels and energy, and encourage conservation.\I have voted for tougher laws to prohibit price gouging at the gas pump. In addition, I voted to cut the gas tax and diversify our transportation fund.\We need an energy policy that promotes independence. We need additional refinery capacity along with streamlined regulations to increase supply and drive down prices.Homeland security: Our highest responsibility is to keep you and your family safe from terrorism.\Unlike the Democrats in this race, I support the Patriot Act and giving our troops and intelligence agencies the tools they need to keep you and your loved ones safe.\We must not underestimate the enemy. They are using more technology and tools to plan attacks. We must stay vigilant, focused and use everything we have to keep Americans safe.\While the Democrats embrace the ACLU position of weakness and appeasement, I support the Reagan strategy of peace through strength. Government integrity: Wisconsin has some of the toughest ethics laws in the nation. Lobbyists can't buy a legislator anything -- not even a cup of coffee. I think implementing similar laws in Washington, D.C., would offer real reform.\As Speaker, one of my first acts was to pass a bill outlawing pay-to-play. Recently, I authored the Contract Sunshine Act to increase public disclosure of anyone who is bidding on major state contracts. These reforms bring integrity back into the system.\I pledge to work together with both sides and lead with integrity to move our nation forward. Taxes: Northeastern Wisconsin deserves a tax system which is fair, simple and collects less from them. Tax reform is imperative to an aggressively competitive economy that leads to good-paying jobs.\As a state legislator, I helped cut income taxes by over $1 billion and passed numerous measures to reduce the tax burden on middle class families and job creators.

A recent GAO report found that few companies are controlling 43 percent of the market, up from 33 percent in 2002. This decreases choice and increases costs.\The solution lies in providing more competition and in providing access for consumers to price leveraging pools. Greater transparency is needed so that patients know the costs and quality of their health care.\I wrote the first transparency laws, as well as the first competitive prescription drug purchasing pool in 2002, which saved $30 million in the first year.Energy: Energy impacts the ability of business, farmers and manufacturers to compete and thrive in our economy.\First, we must increase American production by repairing the Alaskan pipelines and building new refineries.

Cooperation within the intelligence community is critical, and an entry and exit records of non-U.S. citizens must be maintained.

In Congress, I will fight for ethics reforms like term limits and bans on fundraising outside your congressional district.\We need to close the ""revolving door"" of legislators and staff taking high-paying jobs as lobbyists after they leave office. Taxes: A big part of the reason our taxes are high is that the government can't control its spending. And the reason it can't control spending is that special interest groups and lobbyists contribute so much money to political campaigns. The number of earmarks in federal spending bills has exploded in the last 10 years from 1,400 to nearly 14,000.\Earmark reform, zero-based budgeting and competitive bidding for government contracts are several reforms that would help rein in spending and taxes.

In other words, if you're a citizen, you're in.Energy: I believe we must become energy independent, and I will work hard in Congress to establish four essential energy goals: (1) emit less carbon dioxide and other pollutants; (2) invest heavily in renewable energy sources; (3) enable existing utilities to become sources of renewable energy; and (4) begin to decrease the effects of human activities on our environment.\Becoming energy independent will require sacrifices from everyone, but a well-conceived strategy can succeed when developed in the open -- not behind closed doors -- and especially if it is based on energy conservation, energy efficiency and renewable energy resources.Homeland security: We must do whatever it takes to protect America from terrorism and keep hostilities off our shores. Today, we're all on the front lines, but we can become more secure by making three initial decisions: first, implement all recommendations of the 9-11 Commission; secondly, secure our borders; and thirdly, reduce threats from nuclear weapons.\Terrorism is a tactic used by extremists, and there are extremists in every religion and in every political party.\The real enemies of mankind are ignorance, fear, superstition and disease. We won't be truly safe until we confront the roots of the hatred directed at us.Government integrity: Public confidence in our government has not been this low since the impeachment of President Nixon.\We must free our government from the influences of special interests and elect a congressman who is accountable only to the will of the people. I am running for a public office, not a corporate office.\I will work hard in Congress to restore public integrity with five essential reforms: (1) eliminate corporations from our governing process; (2) establish public financing of elections; (3) close the revolving door between Congress and lobbyists; (4) pass comprehensive ethics reforms; and (5) restore openness in federal contracts.Taxes: In this country, the wealthy own nearly all of the nation's assets and you'd think they would be willing to pay a little more in taxes to protect them.\Leaders in Washington need to recognize that fair taxation is the real principle that should guide our tax policy, and take the necessary steps to ensure fairness.

Homeland security: This administration and Congress have under-funded homeland security and failed to fully implement the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission. In Congress, I will work to make sure our first responders have the tools they need to respond to any possible event. Homeland security also means reducing our dependence on foreign oil and working for American energy independence. We must bring an end to the misguided and mishandled war in Iraq. Instead of sending our resources to Iraq, we must secure our ports, give our first responders what they need and make sure our National Guard can protect us here at home.Government integrity: In Washington today, the interests of hardworking people have been pushed aside for special interests.\We must get lobbyists and special interests out of Washington and restore the voices of hardworking people.

Taxes: This administration is giving tax breaks to multimillionaires while cutting education, health care and veterans' benefits.\I support tax cuts that help middle-class Americans make ends meet. However, northeast Wisconsin families don't benefit from tax cuts designed for CEOs making $20 million a year. Instead, we pick up the slack when schools are under-funded and highways need repair.\Our tax system must work for working families, and not leave our children and grandchildren with unbearable debt burden.Jamie Wall\Business consultant, De Pere\www.wallforcongress.comHealth care: Our current health care system is a moral and economic disaster. We need universal health care in this country. In the short term, there are several things we can do to cover more people.\Tax incentives can help small businesses offer insurance to their employees, and I support allowing small businesses, family farmers and the self-insured access to a nationwide health pool, which lowers premiums by spreading risk across more people.\But we need a fundamental overhaul of our current system to achieve universal coverage and contain costs.Energy: The best thing we could do for our national security, our economy and our environment would be to get this country on the road to energy independence and to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.\President Bush's approach to the problem has been to give billions to the oil industry at a time when it was making record profits and we're paying record prices at the pump.\We need a different approach. We need to invest in research in alternative energy, raise federal mile per gallon standards and encourage conservation.Homeland security: We need to make smart investments in homeland security that will make our borders safer without sacrificing the freedoms that make us American.\For less than the cost of six days of the war in Iraq, we could put 6,000 more border guards to work to secure our borders so that the National Guard doesn't have to do it.\For less than we spend in Iraq in a month, we could pay for all our remaining port security needs as estimated by the Coast Guard.Government integrity: The relationship between Congress and lobbyists is a disgrace.\I support a reform package called ""A Proposal to Make Congress Work.""\This proposal would ban lobbyists from congressional travel, end the practice of using earmarks to buy votes for questionable legislation, curb the congressional leadership's abuse of power, and prohibit the House from voting on legislation without giving members time to familiarize themselves with it.Taxes: Our tax code should be simplified and made more fair -- we've added 10,000 pages to the federal tax code in the past five years to create loopholes for various special interests.\At a time of war and exploding national deficits, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans were a mistake.\We must also end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, and we must ensure that American workers and businesses operate on an even playing field with foreign competitors."

Budget-minded Bush threatens to veto highway funding bill

\
Wednesday, February 4, 2004
\
Washington -- Trying to restrain spending, the Bush administration on Tuesday threatened to veto a huge highway funding bill that would ensure building projects for almost every member of Congress and provide a jolt of jobs to the economy.
\
Lawmakers from both parties said the six-year, $318 billion bill before the Senate was must-pass legislation in an election year when few major bills are expected to pass.
\
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), who urged the Senate to finish the bill by next week, said it could create up to 2 million jobs.
\
There were no votes on the bill Tuesday because the Senate was distracted by the discovery of the poison ricin in Frist's mailroom in one of the Senate office buildings. All three Senate office buildings were closed, disrupting hearings on the legislation.
\
A day earlier, President Bush proposed a budget with a projected record deficit and urged Congress to show greater fiscal restraint.
\
The administration has recommended $256 billion for highway and mass transit spending over the next six years. And on Tuesday, it made public a letter from Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta and Treasury Secretary John Snow, in which they advise Bush to veto any legislation that would increase taxes or use budgetary gimmicks to raise that total.
\
The Senate Finance Committee on Monday approved several budgetary actions that members said would add $35 billion to the Highway Trust Fund over six years without raising the federal gas tax, which is 18.4 cents a gallon.
\
Montana Sen. Max Baucus, the top Democrat on the panel, said the legislation ""really comes down to this: In order to pass a bill, we will need more money.""
\
Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), head of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said he had talked to Bush on Monday and, after the Finance Committee actions, ""we now have the offsets necessary to do this without increasing the deficit, that I think the president is going to be more supportive than he has been in the past.""
\
More money was also the message of the House Transportation Committee under Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska). Young is backing a $375 billion package that would be funded via congressional action to raise the gas tax.
\
House Republicans who want to raise the gas tax have pointed out that it has not increased since 1993, which amounts to a reduction if inflation is considered.
\
""We're trying to restore purchasing power of the Highway Trust Fund,"" Rep. Tom Petri (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on highways, transit and pipelines, said recently.
\
""If we continue to erode the purchasing power of the trust fund, we will fall short. The result is we will sit in traffic, and we'll face higher prices due to lower efficiency.""

244,"
Environmentalists on Tuesday criticized a draft of the state's long-range highway plan, saying it would be too expensive and would encourage urban sprawl without substantially increasing highway safety.
\
But a state Department of Transportation official called the reaction premature because the plan isn't complete.
\
In its current form, the draft plan calls for adding 3,000 miles of highway lanes and spending $19.9 billion during the next two decades. It was attacked by representatives of the New Transportation Alliance, Citizens for a Better Environment, the Sierra Club, Wisconsin's Environmental Decade and 1,000 Friends of Wisconsin.
\
Rob Kennedy, state director of the New Transportation Alliance, said the plan would require a 7- to 10-cent-a-gallon increase in the state gas tax. He also said it would spend money on roads that could be spent on trains and buses.
\
Linda Thelke, spokeswoman for the Transportation Department, said financing for the plan had not been worked out and the plan must still be refined before public hearings are held on it. Eventually, the Legislature must decide what to approve and how to pay for it, she added.
\
Kennedy, who serves on an advisory committee reviewing the plan, said the document does not examine the impact of highways on land use and urban sprawl. Thelke said the final draft of the plan would address land-use concerns.
\
Kennedy also said the plan would emphasize expansion of major highways over safety improvements on local roads. Thelke said the plan tried to strike a balance between improving safety and controlling traffic congestion.
\
The department will be holding hearings and accepting written comments on the plan from June 10 through July 8.

We believe you).\It was his comments following the Amtrak train crash near Seattle just before Christmas that took the lives of three and injured dozens more. \Although this particular crash wasn't the fault of infrastructure, President Donald Trump called attention to our failure to maintain that infrastructure. \Our politicians sat idly by as our bridges deteriorated, our highways disintegrated and our mass transit became a laughingstock. While people in other civilized countries travel on trains exceeding 200 mph, we can't navigate corners at more than 30. \He insisted that's going to change in 2018 when he comes up with his plan to invest up to a trillion dollars in roads, airports and rail corridors to bring infrastructure up to snuff. \That's music to the ears of those of us who have advocated for infrastructure spending, whether it be to replace lead pipes that deliver our water supplies or to fix dangerous rail lines that carry hundreds of thousands of passengers to work in our biggest cities. \In this penny-wise and pound-foolish political environment of the past several decades, we managed to put things off to future generations. \No one has been better at doing this than Trump's own party. How many of them, for instance, like sheep took the notorious Grover Norquist ""no tax increase"" pledge, effectively refusing to even consider improving infrastructure if it means adding a dime to the gas tax or an extra 20 bucks on vehicle registration? Here's looking at you, Scott Walker. \The Wisconsin governor, incidentally, is the epitome of the politician who can't - or more accurately, won't - see beyond next year's election. One of his first acts as governor was to squelch an $800 million improvement in Wisconsin's passenger rail infrastructure because it might cost the state a couple of million dollars in maintenance costs in years to come. \Same with his turning down tens of millions in federal help to expand broadband capability to rural areas. \And how many highway maintenance and improvement projects have been placed on the back burner because Walker couldn't countenance an increase in the gas tax, especially as another election day looms? Instead, he's traveling the state touting his abolition of the state forestry property tax - a savings of about 27 bucks a year per tax filer - which helped maintain the health of our forests and provided access to them. That maintenance will now be up to the whims of the Legislature in each biennial budget. Good luck with that. \But Walker isn't alone. He's just one of hundreds of short-sighted politicians we send to office because they've promised to make sure we won't have to pay more taxes. It's like putting off fixing the roof on the house for years and then having to spend thousands to replace the whole thing. \That's where we are now. \Let's figure this out in the new year. \In this penny-wise and pound-foolish political environment of the past several decades, we managed to put things off to future generations.\Credit: By Dave Zweifel"

According to a PEW poll, most Republicans think college is more bad than good. Learning is hard, hurts their little puddin' heads. The anti-intellectualism campaign on the right has worked incredibly well, writing off the value of education, calling it liberal indoctrination.\They formulated an elegant and far-reaching plan to quash American intellectualism so the populace could be tricked into systematically giving its tax money to corporations and defense contracts, rather than programs and services that make our lives better.\There is a fallacy that America has always valued education. Until 1945 we were a cultural backwater, not part of the modern world. A part of the country still adheres to what once was traditional. Remember the kids in high school who thought it was lame to know stuff ... they are now running the country. Their strain of anti-intellectualism has been winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means ""my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.""\If we chose to be ignorant, people from other countries that value education will develop the technology to dominate America, an issue of national security.

GAS TAX
\
Remember concepts of supply, demand
\
The Nov. 20 Journal Sentinel contained a couple of letters to the editor commenting on Thomas L. Friedman's Nov. 15 column regarding the gas tax. I would like to add my own comments.
\
As I recall, my economics classes taught that in a free market, commodities will reach a price where supply will eventually roughly equal demand. As demand goes up, prices rise and suppliers produce more; more suppliers enter the market to match this demand as long as there is profit in it.
\
However, where the commodity is finite, such as with a non-renewable natural resource like oil, the price must continue to rise until demand lessens and eventually stops - although it is said that the last will never be used as the price will become too dear.
\
It would seem that a gas tax would only accelerate the reduction in demand and extend the availability of this finite resource and provide incentives for other sources of energy and conservation. In other words, the gasoline price will rise to what the market will bear no matter if the revenue goes to the U.S. government, to large corporations or to foreign countries.

PARADE
\
Enough of being so politically correct
\
On Nov. 17, local residents were not treated to a holiday parade; rather, they were treated to a Christmas Parade. If it was not a Christmas Parade, why wasn't it held on July 4? That's a holiday. Can anyone tell me why, if it was not a Christmas Parade, Santa Claus was there? Does the chubby guy dressed in red usually show up at Easter?
\
I wish we still lived in my parents' day, when politically correct wasn't vogue. It was nice when Easter meant the Easter bunny and Christmas meant Santa was going to show up at the ""Christmas Parade.""
\
Now did the politically correct readers notice how I was able to keep religion out of my letter and still call events what they should be called? And as a matter of fact, there's entirely too much of that, also.

CONGRESS
\
Bush shouldn't talk about failing
\
The president, with no humility, no sense of history, no realization of actions his administration has taken, has accused Congress of ""failing to meet its responsibilities to our troops."" The president further accused Congress of ""choosing political posturing over the priorities of the people.""
\
President Bush chose to send American troops to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction that were not there; he chose not to send enough troops when Gen. Eric Shinseki testified that three to four times the troops being sent were needed. His administration sent troops without the proper equipment; it had Osama bin Laden trapped and let him go. Bush did nothing as wounded veterans lived in mold-infested VA hospital rooms.
\
Bush chose to give tax cuts to the wealthiest and no-bid contracts to friends and political supporters; he signed statements to deny Americans their right to face their accusers and to have their day in court. Bush's administration failed New Orleans. His administration ignored the environment, the poor and the disenfranchised of our nation.
\
If Congress has failed the American people, it is because it followed Bush's lead; his administration has been nothing but a failure.

PIT BULLS

We must put a stop to animal abuse
\
I just wanted to thank the Journal Sentinel for bringing these very sad and unfortunate stories to the public's attention (""9 injured pit bulls taken from home,"" Nov. 20). This is probably one of the most disgusting crimes occurring in society right now.

CLIMATE CHANGE
\
This is the issue; give it needed attention
\
I am not an alarmist, but the world has a crisis and the Journal Sentinel must run daily articles on the issue of climate change.
\
We all have one opinion or another on many issues, but all the issues combined - health care, Iraq, Social Security, Brett Favre, Badgers football bowl game, immigration, education, abortion, stem cell research and on and on - don't compare to the lowest common denominator - climate change.
\
I believe daily suggestions on how all of us can help, from the light bulbs we use, the cars we drive and how many times, the water we use in brushing our teeth, leaf blowers, snowmobiles and so much more. We need a daily dose of how we all can help stop the madness!
\
No, we all don't need to put solar panels on our roofs or geothermal holes or wind turbines in our backyards, but some of us should. And for those who can't afford them, there are simpler solutions that will help - even in the smallest way.

President Donald Trump pivoting back to the Mueller investigation
and giving Democrats a Russian talking point. With a
year-and-a-half of the investigations behind us, and not one shred

construction projects that really need to be done. Gov. Walkers'
own commission strongly recommended that he raise the gas tax and

Donors ignore governors' party labels
\
Cash has no favorites in buying access, critics say
\
By STEVEN WALTERS swalters@journalsentinel.com, Journal Sentinel
\
Monday, April 12, 2004
\
Madison -- Dozens of wealthy Wisconsin residents give thousands of dollars at a time to the campaign funds of Wisconsin governors regardless of party affiliation.
\
State Elections Board records show that 54 contributors gave the state's past three governors -- Democrat Jim Doyle and Republicans Scott McCallum and Tommy G. Thompson -- a total of more than $352,000 over the past five years, according to totals compiled by the non-profit Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.
\
The state's first Democratic governor in 16 years, Doyle raised $1.5 million in 2003, the first year of his four-year term. His campaign fund ended the year with a balance of $950,000.
\
Some say those contributors give big to win big -- by getting and renewing state contracts, or by gaining access to the governor or those around him.
\
""These people are buying access,"" said Sen. Mike Ellis (R- Neenah), who led more than a year of negotiations on campaign- finance reform only to have it die days before legislators went home in March.
\
Mike McCabe, executive director of the Democracy Campaign, said those who write the largest checks look beyond party labels.
\
""What it really says is, they don't much care about ideology,"" McCabe said. ""It's all about making an investment in the political process; they expect a return on that investment.""
\
But big givers to the past three governors say they wrote those checks to recognize and encourage governors to be advocates for the industries they lead.
\
""Do you think (Doyle) has moved to the middle of the road on business issues?"" said Milwaukee-area business executive Bob Trunzo, a Republican and former cabinet secretary to Thompson who gave $3,500 to Doyle last year. ""I think that answers your question.""
\
Business leaders such as Trunzo have praised Doyle for signing bills that cut business taxes and streamlined regulations for businesses that seek to expand or locate in Wisconsin, and for leading a trade mission to China.
\
Having an influence
\
Highway and construction executive David Kraemer gave a total of $16,119 to sitting governors in recent years. ""I believed they believed in investing in our infrastructure in Wisconsin,"" he said.
\
Another transportation and consulting executive, HNTB Chairman Harvey Hammond, said he gave $13,000 to the past three governors because they ""understand the important role infrastructure development plays in the overall good of the state.""
\
Donations ""do open doors, because candidates typically want to acknowledge supporters, but contributions do not buy influence,"" Hammond said in a statement.
\
Influence and trust are ""only earned,"" he added.
\
By law, individuals can give up to $10,000 to a governor over a four-year term. Many of those who give the maximum do so with what amounts to installment payments, giving $2,500 a year for four years or more than $3,000 a year for three years.
\
McCallum, who spent $7.3 million in a failed bid for re-election as governor, said he is surprised that more large givers didn't contribute to both Republican and Democratic governors between 1998 and 2003, the period surveyed by the Journal Sentinel.
\
""There are some people that want to be around powerful people,"" the ex-governor said.
\
For example, McCallum said, that was true of Bulk Petroleum executive Darshan Dhaliwal. State Elections Board records show that Dhaliwal gave $18,000 -- ranking him first among the top 54 contributors to governors of both parties who gave a total of $352,000. (The total does not include the $5.65 million Doyle raised in the three years leading up to his 2002 election.)
\
Dhaliwal, whose company receives state grants to rebuild sites contaminated by oil products, did not return calls seeking comment.
\
But Milwaukee-area lawyer Frank Daily, the grandson of a former Chicago alderman, said he gave $17,850 to Doyle, McCallum and Thompson since 1998 -- ranking him second on the list -- because he ""grew up in a political environment.""
\
""I just feel like people like me ought to be involved in our political process, instead of sitting on the sidelines and complaining,"" Daily said.
\
Specifically, Daily said:
\
-- He gave $8,850 to Thompson in 1998 for the Republican's fourth campaign for governor, because he felt Thompson had been a wonderful national and international ""cheerleader"" for Wisconsin.
\
-- He donated $5,500 to McCallum's campaign in 2001 and '02 to reward the former Republican lieutenant governor for waiting 14 years to become chief executive. ""Loyalty is a quality that I admire and put above all others,"" Daily said.
\
-- He also gave $3,500 to Doyle last year because two talented former attorneys in his firm joined Doyle's administration, he said, and the Democrat has been a fine governor.
\
Power of incumbency
\
In his 33 years in the state capitol, Ellis said, he has seen one constant: Sitting governors never have trouble raising money.
\
Those writing large checks to Republican and Democratic governors alike ""are not true believers,"" Ellis said. ""They are pragmatic. They will put their money with a winner, regardless of political party.""
\
Road builders and construction executives give to governors because they ""want to make sure that they can continue to pour concrete,"" Ellis said.
\
He said they also ""don't want us to touch the indexed gas tax"" -- a law that automatically adjusts the state gas tax for inflation each spring, raising it this month, for example, from 28.5 cents per gallon to 29.1 cents. That 0.6-cent increase will cost drivers $19.5 million more a year -- money that will go to highway and transportation projects. Wisconsin's gas tax is one of the highest in the nation.
\
Business executives backed McCallum in his losing 2002 race, but Ellis said they now are tripping over themselves to write large checks to Doyle.
\
Doyle said he is not the problem and still hopes to sign campaign- finance reform into law.
\
Ellis said the $352,000 that dozens of executives gave to the past three governors is one reason to pass his campaign-finance changes, which he hopes the Legislature does by calling itself back into session in coming weeks.

BIG CONTRIBUTORS
\
The contributors to the $1.5 million that Gov. Jim Doyle's campaign raised in 2003 came from individuals associated with the following groups:
\
-- Lawyers, lobbyists, law firms: 18.1% -- Non-highway construction: 9.3% -- Health professionals: 7% -- Banking, finance: 6.4% -- Tourism, leisure/entertainment: 6% -- Labor unions: 5.6% -- General business: 5.5% -- Highway construction: 4.5% -- Manufacturing/distribution; real estate: 4.3% each -- Insurance: 4% - - Energy; natural resources: 3.6% each -- All others: 17.8%

255,"State Journal reporter Barry Adams wrote a good article Tuesday describing the current state of recycling prices. However, the headline ""Recycling doesn't pay"" is not an accurate description of the current situation.\True, the city of Madison had to pay $41,249 to have its recyclables processed in November, and we are sure to see more bills. But those costs pale in comparison to the financial and environmental costs of sending recyclables to the Dane County Landfill.\The cost to process recyclables in November was $15,705 less than we would have paid had we sent them to the landfill. In addition, our recycling efforts have allowed the current landfill to remain open far longer than anticipated, saving taxpayers millions.\Recycling also pays dividends for the environment. The material we recycled in November reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 836 tons, the equivalent of taking 631 cars off the road. It also reduced the generation of landfill methane, 23 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\Recycling prices will continue to fluctuate. What remains constant are the benefits of recycling, today and in the long run. Madisonians should continue to fill their green recycling carts, confident that they are doing the right thing.\- George P. Dreckmann, recycling coordinator, Madison\Rescue banishes a cynical shadow\I don't know who you were, where you lived or where you came from, but I want to thank you - the guy who pushed me and my car out of a snowbank near Tree Lane last week.\My cynical ""shadow"" disappeared, at least for a day. There are still people who care and are willing to help. Thanks once again.\- Lee Haas, Madison\Doyle: Don't squelch lower gas prices\Deep in the midst of layoffs, bailouts and rising unemployment, consumers see one small light at the end of a long, dark tunnel of recession - lower gas prices.\Now they're threatened by our own Gov. Jim Doyle, who wants the state's gas tax to rise.\Our frail economy cannot afford more taxes. Perhaps when the time comes, our governor should be placed in the unemployment line. His tax increase proposals clearly show he is part of the problem.\- Brian Brown, DeForest\Governor hypocritical on green issues, gas tax\Gov. Jim Doyle can't have it both ways. Try as he might to couch it, we see the hypocrisy of his words and actions.\He recently declared that the Legislature may have to reinstate the unpopular automatic gas tax increases so we can refill the Transportation Fund coffers. We don't seem to be paying enough taxes into the fund, which he raided of millions - not to repair roads and bridges, but to fill holes in his mismanaged budget.\And the reason we are not driving as much? The governor and his phony global warming report told us to stop driving our Wisconsin-manufactured GM SUVs because they are killing our planet. Well, he's killing our economy.\Does anyone recall our ""business friendly"" governor praising GM in Janesville for building quality vehicles while imploring them to keep the plant open? Meanwhile he's peddling his global warming report.\Did he want the plant to stay open because GM workers do good work, or because he needs the support of the UAW for re-election?\How about the tax revenue that will be lost with the plant closing? Could it be GM's payback for the work our governor and his environmentalist comrades do in passing insidious overregulation resulting in the ultimate demise of industries that aren't ""green"" enough?\- Chuck Cook, Sun Prairie\Time to bust Favre's heroic leader myth\The myth of Brett Favre endures. Some fans still see him as a hero. Some in the media still insist he's a leader and winner.\Well, you might want to ask running back Thomas Jones and his Jets teammates about that, but let's examine Favre's recent playoff record:\*In 2001 Green Bay was thrashed by Atlanta in the first round as Favre completed less than half the passes.\*In 2003 the Packers blew a 14-0 lead to the Eagles and lost in the second round as Favre's interception set up a winning field goal in overtime.\*In 2004 the Pack was thumped by the Vikings as Favre racked up four more interceptions.\*In 2005 and 2006 the Packers failed to make the playoffs, compiling a 12-20 record those two years.\The Giants beat us last year after yet another foolish Favre throw into double coverage, so Favre's late-season collapse with the Jets was predictable. I've yet to hear him take any blame, as usual.\When it comes to holding himself accountable, Aaron Rodgers has demonstrated more leadership and maturity than Favre ever did. Mark my words: Rodgers will lead Green Bay into the Super Bowl before long.\Favre, on the other hand, has shown himself to be a loser and a jerk.\- Randy Hawley, Oregon\Firing Sanders bad move for Packers\The Packers' great 2007 defense was inadequate in 2008? Coach Mike McCarthy ignores the fact that quarterback Aaron Rodgers did not sustain drives long enough to allow the defense to rest.\Rodgers is incapable of the quick, short pass over the middle often used by Brett Favre. Longer passes, mostly due to running out of the pocket and throwing downfield, plus three and outs, put the defense back on the field without adequate rest. For three quarters you can complete a lot of passing yardage, but it leaves the defense worn out by the last quarter.\Add the crucial injuries to two top defensive linemen, a middle linebacker and a top defensive back, yet McCarthy still blames his excellent coaches on defense.\Sorry, Packer fans, the Jets' general manager fired Coach Eric Mangini as an offensive failure for wasting Brett Favre's talents. And Ted Thompson knows too little about NFL football to see the truth about McCarthy.\The Packer defense will be worse without defensive coordinator Bob Sanders and his coaches. The 2008 record of 6-10 cannot improve in 2009.\- James Oliver Campbell, Sun Prairie\Kohl, Baldwin are big pork offenders\In Wednesday's editorial, ""Stand with Obama against pork,"" you point out Sen.

256,"State Journal reporter Scott Milfred contributed to this report.\ Gov. Jim Doyle's proposed budget relies on deep cuts and job reductions to eliminate about half of the state's $3.2 billion deficit.\ But about 40 cents of every dollar the governor proposes to use to balance the budget depends on tapping new, and controversial, sources of revenue.\ The budget calls for moving an unprecedented amount of gas tax and other ""segregated"" money - dollars collected for a specific purpose - to the general fund, a five-fold increase in Indian gambling proceeds, and a flood of federal Medicaid money based on revising old claims.\ Doyle, a Democrat, said the moves are intended to protect core state programs affecting the needy, children, the elderly and the environment. Republicans who run the Legislature say the governor is taking a risk, at best, and relying on ""funny money"" at worst.\ ""The governor said he'd use honest numbers. That there wouldn't be any smoke and mirrors,"" said Assembly Speaker John Gard, R- Peshtigo. ""We just want to know what's fact and what's fiction.""\ Yet critics who don't like the budget will be told to find the money themselves.\ ""If they want to undo what the governor's done, then they've got to come up with (money) to plug that hole,"" said Senate Minority Leader Jon Erpenbach, D-Middleton.\ Doyle maintained his promise not to balance the budget by raising taxes. Although his plan does raise fees on items like hunting and fishing licenses, and vehicle registration.\ But Doyle's budget gets its biggest infusion of cash from the state's $4.7 billion transportation fund. Financed by the state gas tax and vehicle title and registration fees, the fund historically has been used for highway projects, road maintenance and to run the state Department of Transportation.\ Governors and legislators, many elected with help from road builders, largely resisted the urge to raid the fund for other purposes until recently. To help close a deficit in the current budget, former Gov. Scott McCallum recommended, and the Legislature approved, moving $23.9 million from the DOT to the general fund.\ Doyle's budget raises that amount dramatically, to $500 million. Of that, $400 million would be used to continue funding shared revenue, the state's largest aid program to local governments, which was paid for this year largely with tobacco settlement dollars.\ Administration officials are counting on normal revenue growth to take over funding of the program in two years. Doyle would make up the loss to the transportation fund by allowing the department to borrow the money instead.\ The remaining $100 million would help fund public schools, and would be an ongoing transfer from the transportation fund.\ Republicans are balking at the proposal, saying drivers expect their ever-rising gas tax dollars to be used to improve roads, not to be dumped into the general fund. Gard said the plan would stop most road projects.\ But Doyle is betting on winning any argument that pits school children against highway construction.\ Doyle has also proposed taking $200 million from a another fund, set up to share risks among medical providers for malpractice lawsuits. The fund has a balance of $550 million and has paid out more in interest earnings in recent years than malpractice awards, Doyle said.\ Republicans have already sought to block Doyle's plan to dramatically increase the state's share of the take from Indian casinos in exchange for longer compacts, more games, higher betting limits and longer hours of operation.\ The state currently earns about $24.5 million a year from Indian gaming. Doyle's proposal would increase that by about $112 million in fiscal 2004 and $125 million in 2005.\ Acting with rare speed, the Legislature Friday pushed through a bill that would give lawmakers final say in approving any gambling compacts signed by the governor. Doyle is expected to veto the bill.\ But Republicans are most skeptical of Doyle's plan to attract more federal money to the state.\ The plan takes advantage of a provision in federal law that allows states to boost their claims for Medicaid, the medical assistance program for the poor. Because the federal government pays a portion of states' Medicaid costs - in Wisconsin's case, about 59 percent - the higher claims translate into more federal dollars for the state.\ Doyle's proposal builds on a program first implemented in 1987 by former Gov. Tommy Thompson - now in charge of doling out federal Medicaid money as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - and continued by his successor, McCallum.\ Initially, the plan worked like this: Counties with government- run nursing homes would bill the state for the cost of providing care for poor people. The state reimbursed the counties under a formula, which usually didn't cover their costs.\ The counties then reported to the state how much more they spent above the reimbursements. The state would combine those figures with what it spent and claim the entire amount as its Medicaid expense, resulting in a larger payment from the federal government.\ Although seen by some as a loophole, the procedure is explicitly allowed by federal law, said Peggy Handrich, associate administrator of the state Division of Health Care Financing.\ The higher reimbursements were used to increase payments to medical providers and expand alternative Medicaid programs allowing people to receive care at home or in small group homes.\ In 2001, the state switched to a different approach, also permitted under federal law: Three counties - Rock, Sheboygan and Walworth - borrowed millions of dollars and sent it to the state in what is known as an intergovernmental transfer (IGT). The state then returned the money, claiming it as a Medicaid payment.\ The payments were well above the counties' costs but within the upper limit established by the federal government for nursing home care, and the state was reimbursed for 59 percent - or about $1 billion over three years. Again, the state used the money to increase payments to providers around the state.\ But Wisconsin was far from alone in exploiting this new vein of federal money, and the government moved quickly to shut it down, dramatically lowering the maximum allowable payments for nursing home services.\ As a result, Wisconsin's federal Medicaid payments for nursing home IGTs is expected to drop from $321 million in fiscal 2004 to $92 million in fiscal 2005.\ Doyle's plan focuses on the growing subset of Medicaid patients who receive care outside of institutions. In Wisconsin, counties also administer those programs, which cost far less than traditional nursing homes.\ Under the plan, the state would pay counties at a rate above their actual costs, but less than the maximum federal nursing home rate. After the state reports the payments to the federal government for reimbursement, the counties would return the extra money to the state through an IGT.\ Doyle's budget calls for applying the new rate retroactively, to the start of 2001. The higher rate is projected to bring a one-time bump in federal aid of $434 million.\ Combined with higher fees charged on nursing homes, and after using some of the money to increase provider payments and expand home and community-based placements, the plan could improve the bottom line for the state's Medical Assistance budget by $408 million.\ Officials justify applying the rate retroactively - the proposed payments are being called ""supplements"" to the ""interim"" payments made already - saying the state has not yet submitted a final claim to the federal government for the years covered.\ Federal authorities have expressed doubt about the plan, although administration officials say those authorities are reacting to misinformation about the proposal and insist the law allows it.\ Tom Scully, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, declined repeated requests for comment by the Wisconsin State Journal last week.\ Rep. Dean Kaufert, R-Neenah, and Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, co-chairmen of the Legislature's budget committee, have asked Doyle to further explain the proposal and offer a contingency plan if it doesn't hold up.\ ""If we can get the money, great,"" Gard said. ""If it turns out this was a mirage to make the budget look balanced, we certainly hope the governor will provide us with the rest of the puzzle.""\ Doyle said the alternative is slashing state Medicaid reimbursements to doctors and hospitals by 20 percent.\ ""If we don't get that money, it's not like the budget is going to go out of balance,"" Doyle said. ""What's going to happen is our (Medical Assistance) rates are going to take a huge hit."""
257,"Republican lawmakers who control the Wisconsin Legislature have shown little inclination for bipartisanship as they enter a new era of divided government. But despite the fact that he's entering hostile territory, Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers has a lot of tools to further his agenda, with or without Republican support.\And if the GOP's track record so far is any indication, it will be without.\In a lame-duck session that garnered national attention, Republicans significantly undercut Evers' powers. They've tied his hands on issues he campaigned on, like withdrawing from a lawsuit against Obamacare and having a say in economic development matters, specifically the $3 billion deal to lure Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to the state.\""We don't trust Tony Evers right now in a lot of these areas,"" declared Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau.\Now they're talking about crafting their own budget, an extraordinary move considering that one of the governor's most significant acts is crafting a two-year spending plan.\So much for the honeymoon.\""Before this week it looked like there were a couple of big policy areas where Gov. Evers and Republican legislative leaders might work together,"" said University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Barry Burden shortly after Fitzgerald's Dec. 3 remarks.\In particular, he said, the door was open to find common ground on criminal justice and infrastructure issues, discussions that went nowhere with Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a tough-on-crime conservative who drew a hard no-tax-increase line on transportation funding.\""Those were both areas that didn't move very far under Gov. Walker, and there were a lot of signals during the campaign that Evers and some of the legislative leaders were on the same page and could at least have productive conversations about those areas,"" Burden said. ""But the actions over the last few days may have tainted that relationship right out of the gate.""\While Republicans have deprived Evers of his ability to do some things, he still has plenty of power. And his administration can fundamentally change the state's political landscape.\He and his appointees will enact rules and policies that will be at odds with those of his predecessor, and with the GOP majorities in the state Legislature.\""A major authority the governor has is to appoint heads of agencies and many of the units just below the level of secretary,"" said Dennis Dresang, UW-Madison emeritus political science professor. ""For example, Evers can make a major change in the direction and the culture of DNR, transportation and corrections. Even when Senate confirmation is required, an acting appointment can have a major impact.""\And his budgets will set the stage for a highprofile battle over the priorities of the state.\Evers is likely to propose big things. He has vowed to expand Medicaid, a move rejected by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Evers will propose a remedy to the transportation funding standoff. He'll propose a sharp boost to education funding. He'll try to dissolve the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.\Republicans on the legislative budget committee will no doubt deep-six much of his agenda. But Evers gets the last say with one of the most powerful veto pens in the nation. And Republicans don't have the votes to override a veto.\""The governor does have a strong veto in Wisconsin,"" said Burden. ""So bills that come to him, he'll have some ability to carve up and tailor to his interest.""\Republicans have signaled that they see divided government as hardball. But here are a few areas where Evers might be able to find common ground, and others where he can enact change whether Republicans like it or not.\Health care\Of the issues that voters identified as important to them during the election, health care topped the list. And the biggest flashpoint between Evers and Republicans is Walker's 2014 rejection of Medicaid expansion which, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, cost the state $1.1 billion. According to a 2017 Kids Forward report, it also left more than 80,000 additional state residents uninsured.\Evers has vowed to adopt the expansion, but Republicans have threatened to dig in their heels.\""Not gonna happen. No. Never,"" Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said last fall.\But Tom Oliver, a population health sciences professor at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health, thinks Evers has some cards to play.\""Health care is budget policy, and that creates a strong place for some common ground with Republican leaders that the governor might yield some ground on,"" Oliver said.\As governor, Evers will have the biggest soapbox in the state to communicate his agenda. He plans a statewide tour in 2019 to sell the expansion, which would change eligibility requirements for individuals seeking Medicaid from those earning wages at 100 percent of poverty level to 138 percent.\Oliver said from a fiscal point of view, it's a no-brainer that is likely to resonate with voters who are souring to the idea of paying federal taxes so people in other states can get affordable coverage.\""It's really difficult to continue to justify giving hundreds of millions of Wisconsin taxpayer dollars to other states to cover their people and not do it here,"" Oliver said.\In addition, Oliver said, it's not all about state expenses. It's about jobs, and the health care field offers lucrative careers with good benefits.\""So you're really missing the opportunity for additional jobs,"" he said. ""All that money goes into paychecks.""\If Republicans draw a line in the sand, there will likely be an ugly budget impasse. But Oliver said he thinks Evers will take a conciliatory approach, offering to address some Republican priorities in exchange for support for expansion.\""I think there's a very strong hand to play with a decent proposal that really looks good fiscally,"" Oliver said. ""On top of it you can change the terms of why you're doing it, and that looks a lot more appealing to Republicans, who are presumably quite concerned with balancing the budget.""\The environment\The Department of Natural Resources has seen dramatic change over the past eight years.\Walker and legislative Republicans have snubbed a science-based approach to policy and regulations. Early in Walker's tenure the DNR scrubbed references to climate change from its website.\Walker's administration laid off several scientists some federally funded, offering no fiscal rationale who worked on climate change, chronic wasting disease and other controversial issues. Then Republicans eliminated the agency's science bureau.\In an effort to make the agency more business- friendly, pollution enforcement dropped sharply, destruction of wetlands has increased and lawmakers have mounted a continual effort to chip away at air and water standards.\Evers has vowed to turn that ship around. His pick to lead the DNR, Preston Cole, promised to implement Evers' agenda.\""I'd like to double down on science in the epicenter of natural resources management,"" Cole said at a press conference last week announcing his appointment.\Cole, the neighborhood services commissioner for the city of Milwaukee, was previously the environmental services superintendent at the city's Department of Public Works. He is a 12year DNR Board member, serving three of those years as chairman.\He said he'll give voice to disheartened DNR staff who have weathered the last eight years.\""There's certainly been apathy (among staff) about will anyone listen to us,"" said Cole, a forester by training. ""I will represent those natural resource managers, those scientists, to give them the life that they so deserve to add value to the conversation about natural resource management.""\George Meyer, who headed the DNR from 1993 to 2001, said he expects Evers to fill all the top spots at the agency with people who have scientific and natural resources management backgrounds.\""That automatically changes the perspective in decision-making,"" he said. ""Their first analysis will be impact on the resource.""\Those officials include the secretary, the deputy secretary, the assistant deputy secretary, chief legal counsel, chief information officer, chief legislative liaison and five division administrators. Only the secretary is subject to Senate confirmation. Meyer doesn't anticipate much resistance.\""I really doubt that the Senate will block his appointments unless they are really controversial,"" he said.\Meyer, now head of the conservation group Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, predicts a renewed focus on climate change, stepped-up enforcement of environment and conservation laws, a renewed effort to contain chronic wasting disease, more wetlands and groundwater protection, and an objective analysis of proposed legislation, which he said has been sorely lacking.\He also thinks having Evers in the East Wing will put a halt to the steady flow of anti-environment legislation during Republican rule.\""There'll be a lot of bad things that won't get introduced,"" he said. ""And that's going to make conservationists' lives a lot easier. They'll be able to work on positive things rather than rear-guard defensive actions.""\Corrections\Under former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, the state mounted an effort to cut the prison population, seeing some success in the two years preceding Walker's administration.\In 2007, the prison population peaked at 23,236. By 2010 that number was down to 20,015.\Under Walker, who dubbed Doyle's initiative ""catch and release,"" that number increased 18 percent. On Nov. 23, the Department of Corrections reported 23,626 in a system designed to hold 17,821.\Wisconsin now has an incarceration rate well above the national average, higher than neighboring states, and nearly twice that of Minnesota.\To handle the overload, Walker's administration was studying adding another prison, which would be a significant addition to a ballooning corrections budget.\Evers has said he wants to cut the prison population in half, in part by reducing the number of people sent back behind bars for minor violations of their supervision, so-called crimeless revocations, which add thousands of inmates every year.\Evers has also vowed to end solitary confinement, a practice that has come under intense scrutiny in recent years because of the psychological damage it can cause.\His pick to head the Department of Corrections, U.S. Marshal Kevin Carr, indicated that he's on board with Evers' plan to reduce the inmate population and take a more progressive approach to corrections.\He vowed to work with unions, advocacy groups, elected officials, community members and ""subject matter experts"" to come up with a blueprint for change.\""We can make a real difference and change the outcomes we produce and make a positive impact on the lives of not only those involved in the criminal justice system,"" he said, ""but more importantly to the taxpayers of the state of Wisconsin, by being smart on crime.""\Ed Wall, who ran Corrections from 2012 to 2016, said Carr is a ""natural collaborator"" with plenty of experience to do the job.\""He's kind, patient and considerate, which the DOC needs after Walker's eight years of refusing to visit (a prison), let alone address any issues the agency was trying to deal with,"" he said.\Wall, a Walker critic who backed Evers, said there's a bipartisan desire in the Legislature to reduce the corrections budget and find compromise.\""Wisconsin is in a unique position with a new governor who wants to work collaboratively on corrections issues,"" he said.\He said there are two ways to reduce corrections spending: reducing the number of inmates, and reducing the number of institutions and staff.\Republicans, he said, are willing to revisit ""truth-in-sentencing"" laws, adopted in 2001, which have led to longer sentences and longer periods of supervision after release. Walker, then in the state Assembly, sponsored the law.\""The problem was that we had a governor who wrote those laws and refused to consider changes,"" Wall said.\The 2001 law removed discretion on when inmates can be released. And released inmates who break supervision rules can be ordered to serve out their terms behind bars.\Wall said changing the laws to give corrections officials more discretion to release inmates deemed unlikely to reoffend is something both parties want.\""I don't think you'd even have pushback from Republicans on that,"" as long as it was done responsibly, he said. But changes would require some heavy lifting.\""It will involve legislative changes, recalculation of thousands of sentences, making sure programming needs are met and preparing community corrections for the population shift from incarceration to release,"" he said.\On ending solitary confinement, Evers can work unilaterally.\""Policies dealing with confinement protocols, like segregation, don't need legislative approval beyond administrative rules, and those can be reworked fairly easily,"" Wall said.\He said solitary confinement could be replaced with alternatives, such as loss of recreational privileges or confinement to a cell. And it could be done cheaply. Wall said the prison system is equipped with programming, counselors and mental health professionals that could facilitate alternatives.\""Solitary confinement alternatives are not typically money issues,"" he said.\Wall said Evers could also address the prison guard shortage, which has been a chronic problem for decades, but has been highlighted since Walker and Republican lawmakers stripped public employees of the ability to negotiate wages, safety issues, working conditions and benefits.\Unions have complained that the 2011 law increased the exodus of experienced guards, leaving vacancy rates that led to punishing mandatory overtime that costs the state tens of millions a year.\A rule put in place by the Department of Justice under Republican Brad Schimel, who lost the November election to Democrat Josh Kaul, made matters worse, Wall said. The rule allowed guards at state correctional facilities to transfer to county jails without additional training, Wall said. The state's sheriffs, he said, pushed the change.\""By that simple stroke of the pen we were training guys and they would complete their training with us, get certified and leave to go to the counties where many of the counties were paying $3 to $4 (per hour) more than Corrections is,"" he said. ""It was a gut punch to us.""\That could be changed administratively, Wall said.\But the core problem is pay. Prison guards in the Wisconsin prison system start at $16 an hour after an 80-cent raise in 2016. That's not enough for an extremely difficult job, Wall said. And Republicans haven't proposed any further increases.\""Those vacancies have to be filled, and you're not going to fill them by paying people what they could make going to Wal-Mart,"" Wall said. ""Those jobs are dangerous, they're stressful, and I'd like to see a legislator go in there and try to live off of a corrections officer's pay for six months while they're getting urine and feces thrown on them.""\Transportation\More than half of Wisconsin roads are in poor or mediocre condition, according to one major study. Big projects have been interrupted or put on hold. Deficits have been plugged with borrowing rather than revenue. One in five transportation dollars goes toward debt.\Walker refused to consider an increase in the gas tax. And he's been cool to tolling. During the campaign, Evers said everything is on the table.\A UW-Madison transportation expert who has helped other states find transportation solutions said Evers has the opportunity to fundamentally change the direction of the DOT, ending the decades-long chase for money to fund big projects and putting an emphasis on fixing what we have.\""We should for sure put a big emphasis on what is called the 'fix-it-first approach,'"" said Eric Sundquist, director of the State Smart Transportation Initiative, which works with 18 states, not including Wisconsin, to enact sustainable transportation policies. Those include states that traditionally vote Republican, which have found that SSTI's recommendations to more thoughtfully prioritize transportation spending has saved money and improved outcomes.\""Before you start adding more and more assets that we've got to manage, figure out how to manage the assets we already have,"" he said.\To head the Department of Transportation, Evers picked Craig Thompson, executive director of the Transportation Development Association, a powerful influencer of transportation policy with more than 400 business, labor, local governments and other transportation service providers. Thompson has been an outspoken advocate for raising the gas tax and increasing license fees to fund road projects.\Sundquist called the choice unusual in that membership in Thompson's group is heavily weighted toward industry.\""Governors usually don't pick vendors, or vendors' representatives, to lead departments they depend on for business,"" he said. ""The conflict sets up problems when there's a revenue ask, raising the appearance of devoting new taxes to the secretary's own industry.""\But he said he's reached out to Evers' transition team and urged the Evers administration to embrace sustainable strategies that SSTI has successfully employed in other states.\One of the states where he said SSTI's initiatives have met with the most success is Virginia. For instance, one toll road not only provides revenue to cover the cost of the road, but tolls rise during peak hours to manage demand.\Sundquist has met with the Evers transition team to discuss a fix-it-first policy, as well as changing the way that the agency selects projects. The change would entail listing potential projects and weighing costs against benefits. That way, for example, a $50,000 bike path with a high costbenefit ratio would be just as likely to get funded as a $1 billion interchange.\""The $1 billion interchange project better have a ton of benefits or else it's not going to compete,"" he said.\Key to making those kinds of changes, he said, is appointing a transportation secretary and highlevel staffers, unlike road builders and union officials, who don't have a stake in how transportation projects are determined.\""Wisconsin has one of the worst records around in terms of having the vendors in charge of stuff,"" he said. ""What we don't want is those guys calling the shots on what we build and how much we build.""\So he said it's imperative that Evers lay out a solid blueprint for a sustainable transportation plan before looking at how to pay for it.\""The need to precede any revenue increases with real reform is even stronger now,"" he said. ""I know the transition team heard that message, so I'm hopeful the administration will proceed that way.""\Sundquist is also encouraging Evers to revisit regional transit authorities, which Walker and legislative Republicans banned in 2011, beef up mass transit initiatives and explore intercity rail, which Walker abandoned even though it would have been funded with nearly $1 billion in federal money and the state had to pay $50 million for trains it bought but never used.\But trains and RTAs would require legislative approval, and that would be a tall order with the current majority.\Changing the priorities of the DOT to rightsize or forego big projects that lack clear benefits and repair existing roads is something Evers can do administratively, Sundquist said.\""WisDOT proposes and vets projects, and they design them,"" he said. ""All the project development stuff is within their realm. They can also bring a budget to the Legislature that focuses on fix-it-first, focuses on asset maintenance.""\REINS Act\While Evers will wield considerable power through his ability to craft administrative rules, which have the force of law, Republicans last year passed a law limiting that power.\Of Tea Party origin, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, known as the REINS Act, gives a legislative committee the authority to put the brakes on any rule that has compliance and implementation costs of $10 million or more. And if the rule costs less, the committee can commission an outside study, which is not detailed under the law, to do an estimate. If the new study varies by 15 percent from the agency's estimate, the new estimate is adopted, and the agency has to pay for the new study.\That, said the Sierra Club's Bill Davis, is a problem.\Because of other measures over the years, it already takes about three years to create and implement an administrative rule.\""You add on the REINS Act, and for anything of any kind of controversy, it's potentially impossible for an agency, not just the DNR but any agency,"" he said. ""It's going to be damn near impossible for them to create administrative rules. But that's how they enforce the law.""\Adam Neylan, R-Pewaukee, the Assembly sponsor of the law, said last year that there are few rules that approach the $10 million threshold. But Davis said that's not the case.\For instance, the mining bill Republicans passed a year ago ended a nearly 20-year-old mining moratorium. If a mining company tries to set up shop in Wisconsin, $10 million might not be enough to implement regulations.\""I wouldn't be surprised at all if viewed one way the impact of any rules dealing with mining is going to be more than $10 million in any two-year period,"" he said. ""That potentially is a very big industry and it costs a lot of money and it costs a lot to do stuff, and potentially liabilities are high.""\The law could also forestall rules curbing pollution. For instance, a 2010 rule to reduce algaecausing pollution from phosphorus were estimated to cost billions.\""For anything that's at all controversial, it's just not going to happen,"" Davis said. ""I think that's the biggest impact for the incoming administration.""\CREDIT:

258,"
Congressional leaders are defying predictions and moving ahead with a six-year transportation bill, but final approval of a complete package could still be a long way off, an industry observer said.
\
The heart of this thing is what (funding) number they're going to settle on because the Senate, House and White House don't agree, said Bob Cook, executive director of the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin. Still, it's always good to see a bill moving.
\
Last week, the U.S. Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee produced a draft bill to reauthorize the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, the six-year omnibus transportation spending bill that expired at the end of September. Just beating the September deadline, federal lawmakers signed off on a five-month extension to TEA-21.
\
The extension kept the federal highway program solvent, but it also postponed a more thorough debate on how the U.S. government would fund transportation for the next six years. Predictions abounded that lawmakers would continue to postpone final passage of a six-year bill until after the 2004 presidential election.
\
Over the summer, President Bush forwarded to Congress his own six- year proposal, but leading lawmakers said his package didn't provide enough money for highway construction. One of the main ways to boost funding would be to increase the federal gas tax, and Republican leaders in the House have said they didn't want to saddle Bush with a tax increase during the campaign.
\
The Senate committee's proposal raises highway funding to $255 billion, exceeding Bush's plan by nearly $20 billion, according to the state Department of Transportation's budget office. The panel had expected to pass its bill this week, but the vote has been put off until Nov. 12.
\
Agreeing to agree
\
WisDOT last week reported that the House also could approve its own reauthorization proposal by December, setting up a full Congressional debate for early next year. The current five-month extension expires in February.
\
Despite the Senate's action, Cook said a lot still has to be done on Capitol Hill. The $255 billion figure is not nearly definitive, and the debate is only beginning since both houses of Congress and the president aren't close to agreeing on a final tally.
\
In fact, the Senate proposal sets a $255 billion benchmark but doesn't say how that will be funded, according to WisDOT.
\
But by hammering out a draft bill, the Senate is getting the ball rolling, Cook said. Real progress will begin once the House completes its plan, and then all three sides will have models to work off of, he said.
\
At some point, they've all got to get in a room and figure it out, Cook said. They need to pass a bill to at least start discussions.
\
But he said the signs in Washington, D.C., still seem to be pointing toward another extension, which would keep funding at TEA- 21 levels. That extension is likely to see Congress past the 2004 elections, Cook said.

259,"NEW DENMARK – I recommend we promote Caleb Frostman from economic development coordinator of Door County to our state Senator in the election Tuesday.\Caleb promotes well-paying jobs, getting infrastructure projects like the south De Pere bridge funded, and enforcing new DNR regulations to protect our groundwater.\His opponent is Andre Jacque, a sitting assemblyman. In the last state budget, Andre helped eliminate prevailing wage mandates for state and local projects, so as to reduce the paychecks of workers. He has not helped change the funding formulas for schools. As a result, many starving schools have to sponsor local operating referenda. In the last nine years, the Denmark School District had to raise over $7 million locally due to lack of aid.\On the environment, Andre's score is also poor. He voted to drop protections for over 1 million acres of wetlands, exempt Foxconn from state clean water protections, eliminate proof needed for safe sulfide mining, and grant ""forever"" permits for high-capacity wells — so the DNR cannot stop over pumping.\We need to promote good jobs and the economy, and protect our workers and environment.\Please vote for a better leader, Frostman for state Senate.\James Crawford\DE PERE – On the state level, ""government for the people, by the people"" has its roots in local representation, with dedicated attention by our elected officials on issues that affect us in our daily lives.\These issues are many and varied; none is more important than protecting the sanctity of all life. During his four two-year terms of state Assembly service, Andre Jacque's unequivocal support for life from womb to tomb has received the thanks and support from pro-life organizations.\Andre's voting record verifies that he is his own man, not bowing to pressure when voting his conscience on any issue, whether it be life-related, economy-related, gun control or any of the many other issues on which he has represented us well.\It is up to all of us to vote on June 12, and a vote for Jacque for the 1st Senate District will enable Andre to continue his outstanding public service.\Jim Alt\DE PERE – As a resident of the 1st state Senate District, I was in complete dismay when I saw the TV ad put out by the Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters concerning the water problem in Kewaunee County and the many lies it throws out to the viewing audience.\I know Rep. Andre Jacque personally, and I know the stellar record that he has in the state Legislature on a large and varied number of issues. With regard to the lies thrown at him, in particular that he opposes clean water legislation, along with the pieces of legislation written on the screen at the end of the ad implying this same thing, voters should know that not one of those pieces of legislation had anything to do with the water conditions of Kewaunee County. Checking out the legislation, which few people will do, I instead found that they were very supportive pieces of legislation that Jacque has been a part of — some of which the LCV supported themselves. This is an interesting twist in dirty politics.\We have another election coming up on Tuesday. For so many reasons, I sincerely urge the voters of the 1st Senate District to vote for Jacque, a man of integrity, a man of proven ability, a legislator who will continue to work for his constituents and indeed all citizens of Wisconsin.\Ann Ostrowski\GREEN BAY – I truly don't understand Republican thinking. They think it's healthy to spend $700 billion dollars on a military that is bloated, but a waste to spend a much smaller amount on public education.\We wouldn't need so much military spending if we kept our noses out of everybody else's business. George Washington said all our dealings with other countries should be for business only, a good rule to follow. Republicans in Wisconsin are so arrogant. In what universe is it OK to mortgage Wisconsin to the tune of over $4 billion for the Foxconn deal without asking the people of the state of Wisconsin? Hey Gov. Scott Walker, why not have a referendum on Foxconn, what are you afraid of? I have not heard one person say they think that it is a good idea.\You can always tell when it's near election time — that's when Republicans started asking people what they think and want and telling us how much they have done for us.\After the election, they are not interested in what non-Republican or non-donor citizens have to say. I have met a few Republican legislators who I thought cared about the well-being of Wisconsin, but not many. President Dwight D. Eisenhower has always been my favorite president, I wish we could find another one like him.\John Enstrom\LAWRENCE – During the recent run-up to the Senate District 1 primary, my mailbox was flooded with ads suggesting candidate Andre Jacque was quite a wretched fellow. Nonetheless, Jacque won the primary, and next Tuesday faces off against his Democratic opponent. How valid are the numerous negatives that were hurled against him?\The ads suggested ""his legislative salary (was) one of the highest in the country."" Apparently, a political money-grubber. Truth is, over the past eight years in Wisconsin's Assembly, he received the same salary as all legislators in Madison, and that salary is currently around $50,000 annually.\Worse yet, the ads indicated that Jacque ""pocketed nearly $70,000 in tax-free, taxpayer-funded per diems."" Nasty fellow. Actually, per diems are payments made to Wisconsin's legislators to cover food, travel, and lodging costs while away from home in Madison. The stated figure covered eight years of service and, in fact, Jacque preferred to be home in his own bed at night rather than lodging in Madison.\Finally, Jacque was ""open to raising the gas tax by millions of dollars."" Truth is, Jacque is not a big tax guy. His view aligned with that of Gov. Scott Walker: If the Legislature raised the gas tax, they would also have to reduce other taxes by that amount.\You may have had a bitter taste in your mouth from the foul ads flooding the mails during the primary. Sweet relief will ensue when you cast your vote for Jacque next Tuesday. He's one of the best.\Ronald Zahn\BELLEVUE – We have a 71-year-old petulant child in the Oval Office. He lies, demeans and insults people. He demands loyalty from all, but shows no loyalty to anyone. He will neither accept responsibility nor apologize when he is wrong. He has given racism, bigotry, and hate a stamp of approval, and yet most of his party and base cheer him on and make excuses for him.\One does not have to be a mental health expert to know this is not just bad behavior. This man was elected to lead a country, bring people together and include all, regardless of race, religion, gender or party, and he has made a mockery of all of these.\There is nothing we can do about the low standards of this president or his reprehensible behavior, but we should certainly learn from it.\I do not want my grandkids to emulate a man with no self-control and condone that which we know is unacceptable and should never be tolerated. I was hoping that this White House would step in and say enough, but I now know that they have normalized and accepted this president and are unwilling to do anything as long as their party is in control.\People will never feel the same politically on a number of issues, but there should never be a debate on values. This country has always prided itself on tolerance and compassion for the less fortunate. I am hoping we can become that country again.\Sandra L. Neuser\DE PERE – There is a big decision to make on Tuesday. Residents of Senate District 1 will head to the polls to select a new senator. State races typically do not get the attention of the national races, but it is important, during this time in history, that we began to engage as actively on a local level, as we do on a national level. Especially when an outside group, specifically Eric Holder's, is spending $175,000 specifically to back Democrats in Wisconsin special legislative elections.\André Jacque is a rare breed in politics. He has actively engaged, and fought, against not only the Democratic Party, but his own Republican Party. That means that he is doing what is best for his constituents and the state of Wisconsin. He is not being driven by his own political interests like most do once elected. Don't take my word for it alone, go to his Assembly webpage and look at all he has accomplished.\He has received numerous awards during his time as an assemblyman and has received campaign endorsements from a growing number of organizations, and state and local officials, including, the Farm Bureau's PAC, Pro-Life Wisconsin, Vicki McKenna of WIBA, Wisconsin Family Action, Greater Green Bay Chamber, NRA-PVF and others listed on this site: http://www.jacque4senate.com.\Wisconsin needs a principled senator like Jacque.\Lisa Urick"

Unlikely to see changes in oil production policy
\
Concern over the rising cost of gasoline and all other refined petroleum products has a multitude of effects on manufacturing costs, consumer spending, employment and inflation. This situation will add renewed support for U.S. energy policy to increase domestic exploration and drilling to reduce our dependence on imported oil.
\
It is important to understand that the major integrated oil companies were profitable when crude oil was priced at $18 to $20 a barrel and are now awash in profits at $32 to $38 a barrel. There is no incentive for the oil companies to spend billions of dollars in exploration and drilling when it would result in greater supply and lower profits.
\
At present, the oil industry is investing only 30% to 40% of its revenue in new production, and most of this is being invested in onshore and offshore development in Russia, China, Asia, Africa and the Mideast.
\
Under this scenario, there does not seem to be any energy policy that our government can enact to increase domestic production.
\
Ron Koessler New Berlin
\
Automatic tax increase a bad sign for taxpayers
\
The public has been zapped again with the automatic gasoline tax increase. Why is this increase in place? Because legislators are too cowardly to face the ire of the voters of this state each year.
\
Why is this tax wrong? If the Legislature has a tax in place that automatically increases year by year, the taxpayers have no voice. If we do complain, all our state lawmakers have to do is raise their collective hands and say, ""It was our predecessors in office; we had nothing to do with it.""
\
Having a free and democratic society means our elected officials must always be accountable to us. That means those same officials must take responsibility for our present government and how it is run. If our governing officials don't have any responsibility to respond to our wishes, that is called a ""dictatorship.""
\
If we don't squawk about this small loss of representation, then the automatic gasoline tax increase won't be the only law marching our state toward a ""democratic"" dictatorship. There will be others.
\
Robert Terrill West Allis
\
Lawmakers didn't offer workable energy plan
\
What's with all the squawking about high gasoline prices? Gas is one of the best bargains out there. In 2002 dollars, gas in 1918 was $3 per gallon; in 1973, it was $1.60; in 1981, it was $2.69; in 1990, it was $1.75; and in 2002, it was $1.48.
\
Who's to blame for the supposed run-up in prices of late? I'd point fingers, thumbs and toes at do-nothing, wait-until-the-last- minute federal and state politicians over the past three decades.
\
In 1973, the first modern-era oil crisis hit. Prices spiked, and drivers groused. Politicians promised answers and solutions yet did nothing of substance. In 2004, it sounds like the same quacking duck.
\
What could politicians have done differently 30 years ago? Maybe put their cooperative brains together and hammer out a collective, workable, amenable, long-range U.S. energy plan. What would have been the result? Maybe less dependence on foreign oil, better mileage for the vehicles we drive, a national energy plan that works regardless of which party inhabits the Oval Office, a sounder- running economy, a cleaner environment.
\
I'm starting to get a headache thinking about the past 30 years of squandered opportunities. Anyway, it's time for the wife and me to lash the bicycles onto the Hummer H1 and head up north for the day.

\
Justice Department should go after Big Oil
\
Where is our government now that we need it on the home front? I am referring to the recent gas price hike. On April 1, the Wisconsin gas tax went up six-tenths of one cent. My local gas station raised its price, in one morning, from $1.74 to $1.89. Is my math wrong, or am I missing something?
\
My dictionary's definition of a monopoly is: ""the exclusive right or privilege of engaging in a particular traffic; especially, such control, as of a commodity, as allows prices to be raised."" Take a drive around town and compare the prices at other stations. All the same. Isn't that a monopoly?
\
Why doesn't our Justice Department go after the Big Oil companies as it went after Bill Gates?
\
Richard Ledvorowski Milwaukee
\
Those outside U.S. have different perspective
\
Poor America. You constitute 5% of the world's population, consume 30% of the world's energy, produce nearly 50% of the world's pollution and, even with recent price increases, still pay less than half of what the other industrial nations pay per gallon at the gas pumps.
\
Alas, I'm sure the world weeps for you.
\
Patricia Mitchell Mukwonago
\
Administration has other ideas about conservation
\
The April 4 editorial ""Posturing over gas prices"" recommended ways Americans could reduce energy, such as not buying gas hogs and demanding greater fuel efficiency from auto manufacturers.
\
Fair enough, but where is the incentive with an administration that rewards buyers of new vehicles used for business and weighing more than 6,000 pounds a first-year tax deduction of up to $100,000 and those buying fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles only $2,000?
\
It's obvious that the only energy policy the oil-hungry Bush administration advocates is more exploration and more consumption. Is it any mystery why the rest of the world now views us with such contempt due to our inability to promote any semblance of conservation, thus causing greater world instability and putting more of our young men and women at risk?
\
For those of us who don't go along with the Bush philosophy of ""conservation,"" the only suitable definition for the acronym SUV is ""socially unacceptable vehicle.""

261,"Mike Ivey is a business reporter for The Capital Times.\ One of the more useful features of the Netscape Internet browser is the ""find"" function, which allows you to search through documents for certain words or phrases.\ Just for kicks, I accessed Gov. Tommy Thompson's State of the State speech this week (www.wisgov.state.wi.us) and then used the find function to scan for particular items.\ When I punched in words such as ""education"" or ""economy"" or ""jobs"" I found dozens of references. This wasn't too surprising.\ These have been major themes throughout Thompson's reign. The kinder, gentler, moderate Republican also made several references to the ""environment"" and ""women"" and has promised major initiatives on both fronts. The governor knows he is vulnerable on those issues and there is, after all, an election coming up in 1998. And, of course, any speech from the governor wouldn't be complete without some references to a winning Wisconsin sports team. He mentioned the word ""Packers"" nine times.\ But curiously absent from Thompson's address were any references to ""land use"" or ""transportation"" or ""highways"" or ""cities"" or ""suburbs.""\ Growth and development issues aren't nearly as exciting as a Desmond Howard kick return. But it's certainly a major issue facing Wisconsin at the close of the century.\ Land use impacts everything from schools and taxes to crime and the environment. It's hard to find a public policy question that is more sweeping -- or controversial.\ With apologies to late Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart and his comment on pornography, I can't define urban sprawl but I known it when I see it.\ So it's not surprising that Thompson didn't address growth issues during his speech. Bring up land use planning and the real estate, construction or road building industries goes into a collective panic.\ And certainly the governor didn't want to mention transportation, with the state's ambitious and expensive highway building program in a fiscal shambles, the only way out an unpopular gas tax or registration increase.\ Still, Thompson has at least paid lip service to land use planning through his Interagency Land Use Council, a group headed by top aide Mark Bugher.\ Bugher, former revenue secretary who now heads the Department of Administration, has noted that Wisconsin is facing the greatest growth pressure it has seen in decades because of its robust economy.\ The council last year produced a report that itself proved controversial, especially with those who think the state should take a stronger role in controlling urban sprawl.\ One recommendation from Bugher's council calls for putting more planning powers in the hands of the counties and taking some powers away from the cities -- such as the right to reject developmentin unincorporated towns near their borders. The city of Madison has used its ""extra territorial jurisdiction"" to block sprawl projects, such as the proposed River Ridge Run development on the north shore of Cherokee Marsh in the town of Westport.\ Another recommendation from Bugher calls for prohibiting cities from requiring that landowners annex in order to get sewer service. This tactic has been used successfully by cities to control development on their borders and to plan rationally for future growth.\ Groups such as the newly formed ""1,000 Friends of Wisconsin"" argue that the state must take the lead in adopting goals to promote the redevelopment of existing urban lands, protect farmland and natural resources and discourage development that is expensive to service.\ Unfortunately, Gov. Thompson hasn't shown much interest in tackling a tough nut like land use planning. Politically speaking, there is too much to risk and too little to gain.\ But the quality of life in Wisconsin clearly hinges on how well the state addresses an issue that to date has received precious little attention from policy makers at the Capitol."

Let's put pressure on Big Oil
\
Thank you for the editorial on June 21 regarding the ever-so-high gas prices (""Gas price `stability' no cure"").
\
I am so fed up with the lame excuses for why the price I pay for gas has gone up so much in a relatively short period of time. And it's not like I haven't reduced my gas consumption.
\
This is the first summer in which I have limited my driving to and from work. This is also the first summer I haven't gone out of town or vacationing, or planned on doing such traveling.
\
And if more people become like me and just stay home, then motorists will not be the only ones suffering. There are many businesses who thrive on the revenue from summer activities, but if people can't afford to do as much because of gas prices, those businesses will feel the pinch as well.
\
I think everybody should be putting the pressure on big oil companies and government to produce some sound answers.
\
Also, if it's so costly to create fuel with these new guidelines, why aren't we looking down other avenues to provide fuel for our vehicles? Maybe if we just forget about Big Oil, Big Oil will miraculously find a way to meet our fuel requirements at a reasonable price.

\
U.S. prices nothing to be happy about
\
Of all of the letters the Journal Sentinel has published in recent weeks from readers commenting on our high gas prices, none are more entertaining than those whose authors compare our gas prices to those paid by motorists in European countries. Europeans pay $4 or $5 per gallon, so we should be happy that our prices have jumped and are now more than $2 per gallon.
\
In fact, some will argue, we should be paying $4 or $5 for our gas as well. What? If European motorists began eating their own excrement, should we be doing so here? What nonsense!
\
If there was any leadership at all in the White House, this problem could be dealt with in three steps:
\
1) Put serious pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost production now, particularly Kuwait. They seem to have awful short memories over there.
\
2) Ease some of the restrictions on domestic drilling and refining of oil. The rallying cry of the 1970s was to end our dependence on foreign oil. Since then, the environmentalists have made it nearly impossible to drill oil over here. We haven't opened a new gasoline refinery in this country in more than 20 years.
\
3) Get rid of all reformulated gas in any form immediately. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that it works or is even needed.
\
Connie Ott
\
Franklin
\
Explain cost away from city
\
The Journal Sentinel is rightly exercised about the high price of gasoline in the Milwaukee area, and some attribute this to the price of having to use reformulated gas. But the price of regular gas in Sturgeon Bay is only about 5 cents less than gas in the Milwaukee area. That puts our regular gasoline at a tremendous differential over the price in other parts of the country.
\
This should make any investigation much more interesting. Our prices can't be explained by the simplistic reformulated gas excuse.

Better ways to deal with problems
\
Congratulations to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner for refusing to grant a waiver of the reformulated gasoline requirement in southeastern Wisconsin.
\
Why is the EPA the first one blamed for higher gas prices? Why does the first remedy we look to come at the expense of sound environmental regulation? Reformulated gasoline means more to our region than simply environmental protection. Among other things, good air quality is vital to human health.
\
It seems logical to me to pay the extra change while we get to the true reasons for the increased prices. In the meantime, why don't we look to other alternatives, which may be a bit inconvenient to our comfortable lifestyles?
\
Let's look to making mass transit, alternative fuels and more prudent vehicle selection the real answers to our ""problems.""

Carpooling could save plenty
\
While we're waiting for light rail to come about, something can be done right now that will benefit many drivers today. With all the proposals brought forth in the last few weeks, nothing has been mentioned about carpooling. This can have immediate savings. Just think: Carpooling with two drivers can save you half the cost of gas.
\
With everyone having cell phones today, one can easily be in contact with the carpool gang for any deviations in scheduling.
\
I know carpooling works. I've done it for more than 30 years.

Our area needs reformulated gas
\
I completely agree with the June 21 editorial ""Gas price `stability' no cure."" We must stop this knee-jerk reaction of placing the blame for our gas prices on the Environmental Protection Agency and the reformulated gas requirement.
\
Yes, the June 1 deadline for RFG was a factor in the price spike, but the oil companies should have been prepared. It is incredibly irresponsible and short-sighted for politicians, including Gov. Tommy Thompson, to call for eliminating the RFG requirement.
\
Our environment needs RFG. I lived in Washington, D.C., when that area was first required to switch to RFG, and, yes, it did cause a spike of about 20 cents a gallon, which soon leveled off to less than 10 cents more. Nearly all major metropolitan areas are now under the RFG requirement, and the federal government knows that RFG really costs less than 10 cents a gallon more than non-reformulated gas.
\
I call on all of our politicians to stop attempting to blame Vice President Al Gore and the EPA for these prices. They must also stop trying to sacrifice our children's and grandchildren's environment and health for a short-term fix.
\
Wisconsin's tax on gasoline is 26.4 cents per gallon. Thompson could immediately reduce our prices by 20 cents or more a gallon by following the lead of Indiana's Gov. Frank O'Bannon and temporarily suspending taxes.

Governor should lift state gas tax
\
Wonder why ""Stick it to them Tommy"" is so quiet on the subject of the high gas taxes?
\
If you consider that the total state excises and surcharges add 29.4 cents to the price of a gallon of gas vs. the national average of 23.8 cents, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out Gov. Tommy Thompson's silence.
\
Maybe he should ""un-stick it to them"" and follow the Indiana governor's lead by lifting the tax for 60 days. Then at least Thompson should not have to worry about finding ways to spend the state tax surplus.

263,"Republican Dave Murphy, a three-term incumbent, faces a challenge from Democrat Diana Lawrence, who hasn't held political office but has been active in speaking out on environmental issues.\Murphy, 63, was first elected to the Assembly in 2012.\Lawrence, 56, is a former real estate agent. Her involvement with the Sierra Club sparked interest in environmental causes.\The 56th district includes Appleton, Neenah and Oshkosh.\USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin asked both candidates to respond to a questionnaire in advance of the Nov. 6 election. Answers were limited to 100 words.\1. In what way should Wisconsin improve its funding of road construction and repairs?\Murphy: Short term a small gas tax increase would give us some breathing room but raising taxes needs to be the last alternative, not the first. Five to 10 cents per gallon generates quite a bit of extra revenue. Improvement in the efficiency of the DOT is also important. DOT efficiency has improved but the recent contract overbilling on the Zoo interchange is unacceptable. With the increase in electric vehicles, other revenue sources will be necessary. This could include a fee per mile driven and possible tolling on major highways with high levels of out-of-state traffic.\Lawrence: There have been many tax breaks over the years but we can see the problems showing up in many corners of the budget. We have a serious problem now with transportation and it will get worse if we do nothing about it. The debt service in the transportation budget is increasing. I believe we need to stabilize the problem and then work on the preferred type of funding for the future. The answer, temporarily, may lie in more than one type of tax increase to spread it out: an increase in the gas tax and in the vehicle registration fee.\2. Should Act 10 be partially or fully repealed. Why or why not?\Murphy: Repealing Act 10 would be a bad idea. Property taxpayers have benefited dramatically through the use of the tools provided to local government by Act 10. The savings for taxpayers has resulted in much higher approval rate for local school referendums. No employees are happy to pay more for their health care and pensions, but the amounts are reasonable in comparison to what private sector employees pay. Legislators must also pay the same amounts toward insurance and pension. Since Act 10 we closed a $3.6 billion budget deficit and returned enough money to the ""rainy day fund"" for it to reach record levels.\Lawrence: I protested this bill in Madison on a handful of occasions. My daughter was going for a teaching degree and abandoned it after Act 10 was announced. Act 10 is a bit like Humpty Dumpty. How do you repeal and put all the pieces back together after the damage? The players on the field have changed, public employees retired. How would you make amends to those people if the Act is repealed? Going forward we need to think about whether we can put pieces back together in a fashion that appeals to most people.\3. What specific steps should the state take to ensure that it has an adequately skilled and prepared workforce?\Murphy: This problem is twofold. We must attract enough workers into the workforce and then prepare them for the work that we need done. We have done a very good job by dramatically increasing the number of apprentices in our state. We have also had a tremendous increase in the number of handicapped people that are working. This has been beneficial to these citizens and their self-esteem, but it has been great for their employers too. I would like to see us increase the number of teenagers in the workforce. This would help them to reduce their student loan debt while they learn valuable workplace skills.\Lawrence: Education, education and education. The State of Wisconsin needs to set priorities in which affordable education is a hallmark of our state. We will not attract new business without an educated workforce that is not breaking their backs on student debt. There is a basic solution. Rearrange the priorities in the state budget to put education back at the top. We need institutions that are flexible and can teach students of varying backgrounds, specific needs and styles of learning. I would like to see education elevated again as it is the keystone to success for both citizens and the state.\4. Is Foxconn a good deal for Wisconsin. Why or why not?\Murphy: Foxconn is good for Wisconsin because it's a pay as you grow system. Foxconn has purchased office buildings in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Eau Claire as well as making a $100 million gift to UW-Madison for research. All this was done without the state giving them a single cent yet. To get any money they must hire employees and their plan is to hire more than a thousand employees before the end of 2018. Foxconn is transformational to our state's economy and it will put us on the technology map. Make no mistake, other states are jealous of us.\Lawrence: No, Foxconn is not a good deal. It set a bad precedent. New companies looking to Wisconsin will come with their hands out. It is only natural that a deal just as good as Foxconn is wanted. I often hear people complain about socialism and that we are heading that way. What is the Foxconn deal if not corporate socialism? I can see assisting small startups that would not otherwise have had the leg up to even start. Large, established businesses should not need this help. Also, there is no excuse for the environmental exemptions.\5. Would you support legislation ending the so called ""dark stores"" loophole that allows stores to pay taxes on their properties equivalent to those of a comparably-sized but vacant building?\Murphy: I was a co-sponsor of the dark stores legislation in the state Assembly. This is not as easy an issue as it may seem. Retailing is a very tough business in the age of the internet. If we ask our local businesses to pay too much property taxes, we could see them go under, and don't forget online retailers don't pay any property tax at all. Fortunately, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a lawsuit that allows for the collection of sales taxes from online retailers, giving local retailers a better chance to compete.\Lawrence: Yes, I would support legislation to end this issue. The ""dark store"" loophole effectively gives a tax exemption that only works for big-box stores. From a sense of fairness, it doesn't make sense to increase homeowner's taxes. This is another example of corporate socialism. How much of an extra burden do we put on the average working person so another interest can avoid paying their fair share?\6. Would you support changing state law to legalize marijuana and/or cannabis products? If so, under what conditions? If not, why?\Murphy: I do not support recreational marijuana. Law enforcement, including our local sheriff and police chief, are against legalization and their experience in the community carries a lot of weight with me. Medical marijuana is a different matter. The best situation would be for the federal government to de-list marijuana as a schedule 1 drug. This would allow for much more research to help us develop true medical treatments from marijuana. I was a co-sponsor of the legislation that was passed to legalize CBD oil.\Lawrence: Yes, I would support legalizing marijuana for both recreational and medical uses. We tolerate a lot as a society when people drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes. We will tolerate marijuana as well. Legalizing it will prevent people from landing in jail or prison. Society avoids paying for the cost to house those prisoners. Families and lives are unnecessarily ruined as prison divides families and reduces incomes and employment opportunities.\7. Why are you running for office?\Murphy: I enjoy serving the people of the Fox Valley and the 56th Assembly District. My two children and my three grandchildren live in Wisconsin and I want to leave them a state where there are lots of opportunities. I look at states like Illinois and I know what I don't want for my family and our state. Our budgets are balanced and actually producing surpluses. Our pension program is fully funded, while Illinois is hemorrhaging funds with no end in sight. Illinois was one of only two states in the nation to lose population last year while we are attracting people with projects like Foxconn. This track record of success makes this job much more enjoyable.\Lawrence: I have been involved as a citizen advocate for the environment through Sierra Club and the Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters. Over the years I became more involved by writing letters, speaking with my legislators and sitting in on hearings. Since I did not like the direction we were headed in at the state level I decided to run for State Assembly. I knew I could bring my life experiences to the table and run for office. I want to be the representative for this district so that all people can be represented.\8. What makes you the better candidate in this race?\Murphy: I feel I am the best fit for the voters of the 56th Assembly District because I feel I have represented the majority of the people and their values. I've also listened to everyone to try as much as possible to find common ground. I have tried very hard to unite people. I also think my experience is very helpful. In my first term I was able to author and pass the bill that protected our Outagamie County Library system from huge bills that Brown County was trying to charge us. I feel somewhat lucky to have achieved that as a rookie legislator and I know how much easier and more effectively I could do that today.\Lawrence: The fact that I have a background that is not usually seen in people running for political office. My background in customer service administrative jobs has given me great insight into people. I've dealt with people in all types of situations and levels of distress. Politics, with its layers, ultimately is about people. Right now, people want to be heard. I have a lot of experience doing just that. A state representative job is ultimately about providing customer service to constituents. Good laws are outcomes of good service.\9. What are district residents telling you are their most important issues, and how would you address them?\Murphy: The people of the 56th are telling me they want jobs and the economy to keep rolling like it is now. They like the fact that their kids getting out of school have so many opportunities available to them in the workforce.

264,"EDITOR: Should Wisconsin increase the gas tax by 5 cents? And charge motorists 1.02 cents per mile? And jack up car registration fees by $20? And apply the sales tax to vehicle trade-ins? And boost registration fees by 73 percent for freight trucks? And rack up another $3.54 billion in debt over the next 10 years -- $618 for every man, woman and child?\You read that right: All six of these additional levies would be needed to pay for everything on the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's wish list.\But Gov. Scott Walker and Mary Burke aren't talking about it. Nor are the other candidates for state office. Even worse, they aren't telling voters how they would cut spending.\All we have is the highway lobby insisting Wisconsin needs a Constitutional amendment to protect its piggy bank from raids. Oh, and it needs a lot more revenue, too.\But throwing more money down a transportation black hole won't solve our problems. WisDOT is still steering by looking into the rearview mirror, and an awful lot of highway spending smells an awful lot like pork.\Will Wisconsin's next governor stop this billion-dollar boondoggle in Milwaukee? Will he or she put the brakes on other wasteful freeway expansion projects, adequately fund local road maintenance and invest in our growing needs for transit?\And speaking of transit, isn't it about time Wisconsin authorized regional transit authorities?\Voters have a right to know!\Hans Noeldner,\Move Wisconsin Alliance/Sierra Club Wisconsin - Clean Transportation Committee,\Madison\Farm lobby stands for Big Ag, not family farms\EDITOR: As a member of a fourth generation farming family, it's difficult to understand the utter disregard for Wisconsin's water. If we do not have quality and quantity of water available, there is no milk, cheese, butter or row crops in areas requiring irrigation.\Kewaunee County is creating legislation to limit the amount of manure that can be spread in their already stressed environment with its 16 Dairy CAFOs. The Dairy Business Association, true to form, has attacked these efforts with a press release filled with half-truth and innuendo attacking the science behind the evidence supporting the legislation.\The DBA is driving a wedge between dairy farmers and non-farming citizens. Where we previously enjoyed beautiful family farms run by caring multi-generational stewards of the land, we now deal with the stink of industrialized farming factories polluting our lakes, streams and groundwater while absorbing the subsidies initially intended for family farms. The DBA is a tool of these industrial farmers, spending $200,000 annually buying influence in Madison. They care little for the environment, ignore the science and generate much hyperbole to deflect and defer. Unfortunately, they have a number of our people in Madison fully in their control.\Coming from a farming family, it saddens me to see attitudes toward farmers worsening so quickly. Like the polluting factories of the early 1900s, these large agribusinesses are becoming a serious detriment to the environment. The mess made of our environment will be at a cost to all citizens for clean-up and the perpetrators take their money and run.\In its haste to reclaim the title of ""America's Dairyland,"" the Gov. Scott Walker administration is blindly ignoring the effect on our water. It's a short-sighted objective sure to result in long term irreversible problems. Remember this when you vote.\Rhonda Carrell,\Wisconsin Rapids\Education editorial hit the mark\EDITOR: I have just finished reading the ""Other View"" editorial commenting on Wisconsin's school report cards.

265," When six candidates for Dane County executive appeared at an Audubon Society forum last month, everybody claimed to be an environmentalist.\ Scratch a little deeper, however, and you'll find significant differences in the candidates' views on the environment, land use and transportation.\  The candidates are Phil Salkin, a supervisor and former Verona mayor; Donald Harbort, a town of Westport farmer and businessman; Michael Blaska, a supervisor and former County Board chairman; Kathleen Falk, an assistant attorney general and former public intervenor; Dick Wagner, a state budget analyst and former board chairman; and Dave Wiganowsky, a supervisor and tavern owner. The top two finishers in the Feb. 18 primary meet again in the April 1 general election. The winner replaces County Executive Rick Phelps, who is not running for re-election after nine years in office.\ The draft Vision 2020 plan released in January provided a starting point for the campaign's land use debate. The plan will provide a blueprint for Dane County growth and development in the next 25 years. Some said it placed too much emphasis on multi-family housing and didn't allow expansion of urban service areas in outlying communities. Others said it promoted too much highway construction. (See chart) Salkin, an archaeologist and member of the Regional Planning Commission, said his environmental experience is professional, not political.\ Although he often votes with the board's conservative bloc, Salkin sometimes strays from the fold on environmental issues.\ He voted against a two-lane alternative for Highway 12 but said his opposition was due to the process, not because he necessarily supports four-lane expansion. During the last budget debate, he proposed an infusion of cash to purchase land for preservation before prices increase.\ He supports a major investment study -- a comprehensive study costing several thousand dollars -- of a possible North Beltline highway. He said development should be allowed in the town of Middleton but perhaps not in the town of Vienna, where it isn't wanted.\ ""Land use has to be boiled down to economic and environmental factors,"" he said. ""Decisions must be made on actual conditions in the area.""\ Harbort, who has hands-on experience in snow plowing, excavation and construction, said he supports construction of a North Beltline. He said improved bus service could help Highway 12 congestion.\ He hopes to build apartments or duplexes on 25 of his 69 acres in the town of Westport. But Harbort, who enjoys hunting, said he also likes to build duck ponds because ""I love wildlife."" Protecting the environment is one plank of Blaska's five-point campaign plan. He said he supports increasing county park acreage and renewal of the state stewardship fund, scheduled to expire in 2000.\ On the County Board, Blaska has opposed increases in the county conservation fund above its original $750,000 annual level. A decade ago, he also opposed taxing authority for the Lakes and Watershed Commission but supported the commission itself. Several years ago, he supported an effort by towns to withdraw from county zoning.\ Blaska, a supporter of clustered rural development, said land use decisions must respect property rights and the county should stick to regional issues. He supports four-lane expansion of Highway 12 and the North Beltline major investment study.\ ""We've got to plan for our future,"" he said. ""We've got to identify a corridor and protect it.""\ Falk, former public intervenor and former director of Wisconsin's Environmental Decade, may have the strongest overall environmental credentials, although much of her experience does not involve Dane County issues.\ She agrees witha Vision 2020 survey question that showed over 80 percent of respondents want rational, planned growth.\ ""Citizens are ahead of the politicians, which is not unusual,"" she said.\ Another survey question, however, showed most respondents support a North Beltline. Here, Falk said, the county executive must provide leadership in educating people on alternatives. She supports lobbying for more state gas tax money to be used for highway maintenance.\ Wagner, who was co-chairman of a commission on commuter rail, proposed a nine-point transportation plan that includes promoting commuter or light rail, improving traffic flow and parking, making neighborhood streets safer, maintaining existing highways, planning for future roadway corridors and improving bicycle options.\ He said the green space plan, approved by the County Board several years ago, needs revival. He has proposed creating a conservation map of the county that would show which areas have a top priority for preservation.\ Wagner said the county needs to protect its forests. He supports transportation planning for the area north of Lake Mendota but not a major investment study. A major question about a North Beltline, he said, is who will build it.\ ""The county's not ready to build a four-lane road,"" he said. ""Our roadways work most of the time.""\ Wiganowsky, as Burke town chairman, has fought with Madison and Sun Prairie over annexations. He said a balance of local control is important in land use decisions.\ He said rural development should be clustered and developers should try to avoid viable farmland. He supports a North Beltline and four-lane expansion of Highway 12.\ Most other candidates say the county should study rail as a transportation alternative but Wiganowsky said he has doubts about commuter rail.\ ""It sounds like it's nice and I hope they can make it work but I don't really see it,"" he said. ""I don't think we're quite ready for the rail system."""

267,"Wolves still need federal protection\I oppose the bill in Congress that would eliminate all federal protection for wolves. \When wolves were taken off the Endangered Species List in 2012, the hunting that followed was incredibly harmful to the recovering species. The courts stepped in to restore federal protections, citing overzealous killing programs. Gray wolf populations are still recovering from centuries of persecution and habitat loss and cannot reach full recovery without federal protections. They have finally begun to repopulate and rebuild their pack structures. \According to a mail survey conducted in 2014 by Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources researchers, most Wisconsin residents - even among residents in the ""wolf range"" - support a wolf population at least as large as the state had at that time. \Wolves are key players in their native ecosystems, benefiting both flora and fauna. They cull weak, old and sick animals from populations and mitigate browsing on vegetation and bring great vitality to the entire ecosystem. \Please urge Congress to respect the Endangered Species Act and leave the wolves alone. \Gary Feest, Madison \Let wolves deal with park's beavers \A simple solution to end the problem of the beavers in Warner Park is to import several wolves from Vilas County. \Madisonians could then learn first hand how it is to live with vicious animals roaming around when they want to go for a walk or a bike ride. It would take less than a month and the beavers (and most other animals) would be gone. \The trees would be safe. \William King, Manitowish Waters \Beavers are more than 'tree-killers' \I must protest the characterization of ""tree-killing"" beavers in the April 4 State Journal story, ""City orders beaver traps removed from lagoon,"" about trap removal in Warner Park. \Beavers are nature's mighty landscapers and protectors of aquatic environments. The broad reduction of beavers to arboreal assassins is unfortunate and unfair. \Let's give the beavers their well-earned due, and celebrate the removal of those nasty traps. \Kitty Kocol, Madison \Money for missiles better spent here \At more than $1 million apiece, the 59 Tomahawk missiles fired into Syria last week cost more than $60 million. \Think about what $60 million might be used for in Madison or Dane County. \Brian Bostian, Madison \Call gas taxes a user fee and move on \Back in 2010 Gov. Scott Walker knelt at the altar of the powerful Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, and signed a pledge to never raise taxes. \Raising the gas tax is the obvious solution to the funding shortage of our crumbling roads but Gov. Walker has taken that option off the table with his loyalty pledge. \On the other hand, our governor has no qualms about raising user fees at our state parks because user fees are not taxes. So let's rename the gas tax as a gas user fee. \Let's raise the gas user fee, index it to inflation, and be done with it. \Pamela Midbon, Madison \Join Earth Day march for climate \Climate change is the most important challenge humanity has ever faced. \The 2015 Paris Agreement is an unprecedented global pact among nearly 200 nations to prevent catastrophic climate change and ensure a safe planet for our children and grandchildren.

269,"State transportation officials released a plan Monday to delay reconstruction work on southeastern Wisconsin's freeways and scale back road aid to local governments in hopes of closing a looming deficit in the state's transportation fund.\The fund is the state's major source of money for highway improvements and maintenance, aid to local governments for road work, the State Patrol and the Division of Motor Vehicles. Republican Gov. Scott Walker's 2013-15 transportation budget estimated the fund would finish fiscal 2015 with a $12.6 million deficit. \But the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau released projections late last week that showed a $63.5 million shortfall in the fund by June 30, 2015, thanks largely to dwindling gas tax revenue. \The state Department of Transportation, a Walker Cabinet agency, put out the new plan a day before the Legislature's powerful finance committee was scheduled to review the governor's transportation budget. DOT spokeswoman Peg Schmitt said the plan was meant as a guide for lawmakers as they grapple with the deficit. \Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, one of the committee's two co-chairs, said the suggestions look reasonable but acknowledged the state must find more stable ways to fund road building as more people turn to fuel-efficient vehicles and the gas tax declines. \""We're dealing with it by prioritizing,"" Nygren said. ""Within the environment in which we're living, it's the best possible scenario."" \The plan calls for saving $19 million by pushing back funding for an Interstate 94 interchange upgrade in Milwaukee County until the next budget. The interchange reconstruction is part of a larger multi-year project to upgrade the interstate between Milwaukee and the Illinois border. \The agency also wants to delay reconstruction work on a portion of Milwaukee's Zoo Interchange, saving $14 million; cut $7.3 million from a program that funds major highway projects in the first year of the budget; cut $4.3 million from road aid for local governments, also in year one; reduce funding for a Milwaukee-to-Chicago Amtrak passenger rail line by $1.1 million; and cut $900,000 from a program designed to reduce congestion. \The agency also suggested cutting $2.5 million from payments that go to municipalities for maintaining state highways and pushing back hiring 24 new State Patrol vehicle inspectors to 2015.\Credit: TODD RICHMOND Associated Press"

""This makes for better educational opportunities for everyone.""\Property taxes\The mayor of Seymour was skeptical of any state efforts to regulate local spending decisions.\Harold Pingel said he was uneasy about Madison's influence.\""We've done a pretty good job of keeping our spending in line,"" he said. ""It's my feeling that we don't really need the state coming in here and telling us how to run our business.""\Appleton homeowner Colleen Malkowski said she didn't know the details of Doyle's property tax plan, but likes the sound of it.\""It's always nice to get a break on your taxes,"" she said. ""I would probably approve of that.""\Paula Ashman, who owns a home in Ellington in Outagamie County, offered a similar assessment.\""I don't know a lot about it, but anything that saves us money is great,"" she said.\Gas tax down a cent\""A penny doesn't really mean much to me,"" he said. ""Anything helps, but if he cut the gas tax so that we weren't the highest paying state for gas that would be different. That ain't going to help us much, is it?""\Social Security tax break\Beginning in 2008, the state will stop taxing Social Security benefits, an idea that got a lukewarm response at the Thompson Community Center in Appleton.\""I think it would be great but you don't know what's behind it,"" said Venee Heimerl of Appleton."
271,"The temperature's getting hot, and so is the energy-policy debate. Gas prices are reaching new heights as anyone with a car knows. What are we going to do about it? Apparently, nothing serious.\Republican presidential candidate John McCain has taken out ads on the National Review Online site pushing his silly gas-tax holiday. A gas-tax holiday may be a fun, cheap marketing gimmick, but it's not a solution.\In fact, McCain, like the Democrat he will run against, opposes a real solution: Drilling here.\Unfortunately, it's largely those on the outside looking in who are most passionately advocating that we review our domestic resources. Drilling alone won't do it, but it's a practical start.\Thus far, the debate about accessing those resources closest to home has focused on Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR). Congress ridiculously refuses to green-light the project. I say ""ridiculous"" because concerns about preserving the vast swaths of nature and the caribou there are not serious: Congress would be giving a go-ahead to oil exploration on 2,000 - or 0.01 percent - of ANWR's 19 million acres, which can supply 5 percent of America's oil per year for 12 years, according to the U.S. Energy Department.\""Drill here"" has become a mantra on conservative talk radio. As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich puts it: ""Drill Here. Drill Now. Pay Less."" Gingrich is collecting signatures on a petition that reads, ""We, therefore, the undersigned citizens of the United States, petition the U.S. Congress to act immediately to lower gasoline prices by authorizing the exploration of proven energy reserves to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources from unstable countries.""\Meanwhile, we hear - and will likely continue to hear - sad high-gas-price stories such as that of Nevada's Clark County School District: With a 62 percent budget expenditure increase due largely to the price of gas, the school district has cut its bus route and stops to reduce costs. According to the Department of Transportation, Americans are (predictably) driving less.\It's no wonder that Gallup reports that a majority of Americans support ""drilling in U.S. coastal and wilderness areas now off limits.""\But don't expect Congress to pull out its power tools any time soon. Right now, the momentum is with America's Climate Security Act of 2007, a bill sponsored by Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia. According to the Heritage Foundation, the bill ""would likely be - by far - the most expensive environmental undertaking in history."" As Heritage describes it, the Warner-Lieberman Bill ""extracts trillions of dollars from the millions of American energy consumers and delivers this wealth to permanently identified classes of recipients, such as tribal groups and preferred technology sectors, while largely circumventing the normal congressional appropriations process.""\The legislation is a perilous road with high costs - costs Americans tell pollsters they don't want to pay. But Congress is poised to go its own way, skipping over simpler, more promising steps that cost less, such as unleashing America's reserves. Instead, we go on with the absurd scene of the president of the United States going to Saudi Arabia with his hands out. America is an entrepreneurial nation with resources. We should not be acting like helpless victims. We should not be punishing energy users and embracing regulation over ingenuity and incentives.\McCain, Lieberman, Warner and everyone else should take a deep breath and listen to Bjorn Lomborg, author of ""Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming"" (Knopf, 2007), who says the legislation before Congress ""looks set to be a massive subsidy-fest that would achieve very little for the environment, at great cost."" He warns: ""Wishful thinking is not sound public policy.""\In other words - drop the gimmicks. Stop getting freaked out by Al Gore. Let's be smart and think creatively rather than as a conventional pack of frenzied followers."
272,"Gas tax\Three Republican lawmakers recently proposed a ""holiday"" from the gas tax that might save drivers 15 cents a gallon.\State Reps. Robin Vos, R-Caledonia, Pat Strachota, R-West Bend, and Don Pridemore, R-Hartford, held a press conference to ask Gov. Jim Doyle to cut the tax in half for the rest of the year. They said the $180 million in lost revenue could be found in a budget transfer Doyle used to pay for a number of programs, including schools.\""Wisconsin has one of the highest gas taxes in the nation and some of the highest gas prices,"" Strachota said in a statement. ""As gas prices hit record highs, we need to provide some relief.""\Don't expect Doyle to hold a special session for the plan, as the lawmakers requested.\""Apparently they want property taxes to go up,"" Doyle said. ""The money they are taking is exactly the money that directly comes from property tax relief.""\Conservation agenda\In a Madison park Thursday, Doyle unveiled Conserve Wisconsin, a package of proposed laws and executive orders that he says are needed to protect the state's environmental legacy.\The proposals include a law to regulate ballast water in ocean-going ships to prevent invasive species, a requirement that the state gets 10 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2015, and the creation of a $1 million state forest legacy program to protect forests from development.\""Wisconsin's natural resources are not just part of our economy or what we do for recreation; they're a fundamental part of who we are, and we owe it to future generations to be vigilant in our protection of them,"" Doyle said in a statement. ""I don't think protecting our environment should be a partisan issue, and I'm willing to work with anyone in either party who will roll up their sleeves with me to get this done.""\Let there be light\Slow-moving trucks may be easier to see thanks to a bill Doyle recently signed.\The bill, authored by state Rep. John Ainsworth, R-Shawano, permits trucks with a gross rating of more than 26,000 pounds with flashing or rotating amber light.\The lights will only be allowed on roads with a speed limit of more than 35 mph on trucks that are traveling 10 or more miles below the speed limit, stopped or are backing up. The extra lighting is now allowed, but not required.\As a dairy farmer, Ainsworth said he has found there is a real need for additional motor truck lighting options in rural areas. For example, he said, a slow-moving stainless steel milk truck on a foggy morning can be very difficult to see.\Internet hunting\Bad news for hunters too lazy to pick up a gun.\Doyle on Monday signed a bill that would prohibit hunting via the Internet. The law followed an effort by a Texas entrepreneur to let people shoot animals on a game farm via their home computers.\State Sen. Neal Kedzie, R-Elkhorn, who co-authored the ban, said the practice would be an affront to state hunters.\""Like thousands of other Wisconsin hunters who understand and appreciate our hunting heritage, this Internet service is deeply disturbing to me,"" Kedzie said in a release. ""While I appreciate the advances of technology, hunting is a tradition of track and chase, not point and click.""\Frankenstein veto\Republican lawmakers announced they had 45 co-sponsors to a resolution to limit the veto power of the governor. Republicans were upset with Doyle's use of partial vetoes in the state budget that deleted numbers and words to come up with new language resulting in a number of changes, including more money for schools.\""The 'Frankenstein Veto' must come to an end,"" state Sen. Sheila Harsdorf, R-River Falls, said in a statement. ""It makes a mockery of the legislative process and turns everything we know about democracy on its head.""\Harsdorf also supported veto limits during the tenure of former Gov. Tommy Thompson. She was against the so-called ""Vanna White"" veto that allowed Thompson to veto letters to come up with new words."

274,"MADISON - Gov.-elect Tony Evers on Friday added four more faces to his Cabinet — including an advocate of raising revenue for Wisconsin roads to lead the state's Department of Transportation.\But the GOP leader of the state Senate cast doubt on Evers' pick for DOT just hours after his name was announced, putting the lobbyist's confirmation in jeopardy.\Evers named new leaders of agencies overseeing public utilities, insurance, agriculture and transportation. Among them is Craig Thompson, executive director of the Wisconsin Transportation Development Association, as DOT secretary.\Transportation has been a divisive and controversial issue in recent years and most recently set Evers apart from Gov. Scott Walker in the general election.\Thompson would take over an agency with recent turnover as officials there struggled to find common ground with Walker, who would not entertain the idea of raising the state's tax burden to pay for road projects.\""It's a daunting endeavor — I don't underestimate that. But I'm ready to get started,"" Thompson said at a Friday news conference in Madison.\Thompson was a vocal advocate of finding new revenue for road projects during a protracted debate during the last state budget cycle, during which disagreements over transportation funding prompted an impasse among Republicans and delayed passage of the 2017-'19 state budget.\Thompson has said raising the state's gas tax or increasing license plate registration fees would be necessary to find a long-term solution for road projects, and his organization is behind the ""Just Fix It"" campaign.\The ""Just Fix It"" campaign advocated during the 2018 election cycle for more revenue for roads, which was perceived by some as campaigning against the sitting governor.\Thompson could have a rough road to confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said in a statement Friday: ""Governor-elect Evers would be better served by nominating someone who worked in a less controversial role during previous policy debates.""\In an interview on WISN-AM (1130), Fitzgerald said some GOP senators have said Thompson's past role as a lobbyist ""seems possibly inappropriate or a little out of line with what they would expect when the Gov.-elect puts a name out there.""\Fitzgerald also said a group of Republican senators in southeastern Wisconsin will likely want to see a DOT secretary that is going to ""want to see efficiency within the transportation budget.""\Sen. Duey Stroebel of Saukville already expressed concerns about Thompson.\""This appointment looks like a political payback,"" Stroebel said in a statement. ""Rewarding one of the leaders of the full-spectrum campaign to attack Governor Scott Walker's transportation reforms with a top spot in state government is a generous, taxpayer-funded thank-you to a political ally.""\A spokeswoman for Evers did not respond to questions about the criticism.\Assembly Republicans in the past budget cycle sided with Thompson's view on revenue, while Walker refused to sign a budget that raised the state's tax burden, prompting Fitzgerald to reject the idea, too.\On Friday, Thompson said he and Evers have not yet decided whether an increase in the state's gas tax is appropriate and if so, how large.\Craig Thompson won the endorsement of former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson on Friday, who said Craig Thompson (no relation) ""understands the needs of our transportation system as well as anyone who has ever held the position.""\Evers also on Friday announced he has appointed Brad Pfaff to lead the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. Pfaff currently works for U.S. Rep. Ron Kind and previously oversaw the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency under the Obama administration.\Rebecca Cameron Valcq, an attorney at Quarles & Brady in the Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Practice Group, will lead the Public Service Commission. She previously worked as a regulatory counsel for We Energies.\And American Family Chief Legal Officer Mark Afable will serve as the commissioner of insurance.\CREDIT: Molly Beck; Daniel Bice"
275,"No one likes driving down a road riddled with potholes or getting stuck behind a semitrailer traveling through a congested intersection and over the Claude Allouez Bridge. (The truck drivers don't like it either.)\Beyond silencing our local road complaints, investing in roads, bridges, ports and airports provides a return on investment to our state and local communities through enhanced tax base, new development and a safe, efficient and reliable mode of transporting raw materials, finished products and people.\Delays or inefficiencies in transportation cost consumers and businesses money. Each minute a delivery truck is sitting idle in traffic or, even worse, involved in an accident, has a cost associated with it. Constructing and maintaining a safe and efficient transportation network is the most basic way for a government to grow the economy.\Strong roads and bridges are particularly important in Northeastern Wisconsin. Manufacturing, agriculture and trucking are the top three sectors in Wisconsin and they are heavily dependent upon roads.\Statewide these sectors account for about a quarter of all wages paid. In Brown County, those same sectors account for about half of all wages in the county. If roads are left to deteriorate, how will this impact jobs and the economy?\Even though transportation funding is critical to our economic progress, our state and federal governments have struggled to adequately fund it for years. Fuel-efficient vehicles have been good for our environment and bank accounts but have caused part of our transportation funding problems. The further you can go on one tank of gas means fewer trips to the gas station and a smaller amount of fuel tax being deposited in the segregated transportation fund.\Combine that with interest payments consuming a large share of the already lagging segregated transportation fund (about 19 percent) and our roads, ports and airports (and eventually our economy) are in trouble.\So how do we solve this problem? We could cut or delay the number of projects, but that will end up costing more in the long run and harm our ability to attract and retain businesses. We can cut out the waste in projects (which we should have done years ago), but that won't generate the almost billion dollars in savings we need. We could bond for our shortfall, but paying back that debt is already taking a hefty sum out of the transportation fund and pushes this responsibility to pay for these projects to future generations. Or, finally, we could raise additional revenue.\Raising additional revenue for roads is not something we at the chamber take lightly. We understand that businesses and families operate under tight budgets and adding more expense doesn't always fit in the budget. However, roads that are in poor condition will have a more significant negative impact to the budgets of area businesses and families in increased costs of goods, maintenance and repair of vehicles and fewer new businesses moving here.\The state gas tax has stayed at 32.9 cents per gallon since 2006 and the federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, unchanged since 1993. Without additional revenue our state will lag behind those who invest in this infrastructure. We know from experience that new businesses are attracted to areas that have easy access to highways that are well maintained and meet the demand in volume of traffic.\For the future development and prosperity of the region, this problem needs a solution. This is a conversation the Greater Green Bay Chamber has been engaging our lawmakers for some time now. We encourage you to join in, too.\Jayme Sellen is government affairs director for the Greater Green Bay Chamber."
276," Republicans adopted a key part of Gov. Jim Doyle's proposed transportation budget Friday, but with a major twist Democrats said will pit money for roads against schools.\ The plan builds on the Democratic governor's budget proposal to transfer $530 million from the transportation fund - supported by the gas tax and motor vehicle registrations - to the state's general fund. Most of the money would be used to help pay for aid to local governments and schools over the next two years.\ Like the governor, the Republicans would then sell bonds to pay for road projects that would have been funded with that money. But rather than repay the bonds out of the transportation fund, the GOP plan would pay them off using general tax revenues.\ The plan, which was approved by the Legislature's Republican-led budget committee, is intended to safeguard future road projects in the event the transportation fund runs short, supporters said. Such projects are critical to stimulating the state's economy, they said.\ ""This budget is built on a 5 percent growth (projection),"" said Assembly Speaker John Gard, R-Peshtigo. ""If we don't achieve that, schools, hospitals, shared revenue, roads, everybody's at risk.""\ Democrats said the plan shifts the burden of paying for road projects from motorists to everyone else.\ ""I understand how important transportation is to our economy,"" Doyle said in a statement. ""But at a time when we have a $3.2 billion deficit, Republicans are ... diverting precious resources away from education, health care, the environment, economic development, local governments and other key priorities.""\ Republicans said their plan is more honest than the governor's, arguing that, because the general fund needs the money, that fund should be used for paying the interest on the loans.\ Using gas tax money to make payments on the loans risks tying up transportation funds, threatening safety and putting off road projects ""for years and years,"" said Rep. Mike Huebsch, R-West Salem.\ By transferring the annual debt payments to the general fund, the Republican plan frees up about $40 million in the transportation fund over two years. The plan shores up the fund in other ways, notably by freezing highway payments to local governments and mass transportation programs at current levels. Doyle sought to increase both.\ Republicans also endorsed Doyle's proposal to raise motor vehicle registration fees from $45 to $55.\ Gard said the proposal should allow the state Department of Transportation to complete all of its scheduled highway projects over the next two years. Under Doyle's plan, 99 of 634 projects would have been delayed.\ The plan also allows improvements to the mammoth Marquette interchange in Milwaukee to go ahead without competing with road projects in other areas of the state, lawmakers said.\ Under Doyle's plan, public schools would have received $100 million from the transportation fund over the next two years, while $400 million would have gone toward shared revenue, the state's billion-dollar-a-year aid program to local governments. The remaining $30 million was to go for general state operations.\ Republicans preserved the transfers. But while Doyle would have continued to move $60 million a year to schools from the transportation fund, the GOP plan ends the transfer after June 30, 2005.\ Democrats said that will create a $60 million hole in school funding in the next budget. And the freeze in local highway aids will force communities to choose between raising property taxes or cutting essential services, they said.\ The plan, which must be approved by the full Legislature and signed by Doyle to become law, also diverts 20 percent of the sales tax on new motor vehicles from the general fund to the transportation fund beginning July 1, 2005."
277," There's something for nearly everyone in the bipartisan statebudget deal announced by Assembly leaders this week.\ Tax cuts for the middle and upper classes. Low-cost health insurance for the working poor. More money for local transportation efforts and road construction. Property tax cuts for businesses.\ But the biggest winners may be local governments and school districts.\ Meeting separately, Assembly Republicans and Democrats tentatively approved the deal Thursday afternoon. The Assembly is scheduled to take up the budget early next week, possibly as soon as Tuesday.\ However, the fate of the budget in the Senate, where it was stuck for most of the summer, remains uncertain.\ While Senate Majority Leader Chuck Chvala, D-Madison, hailed the bipartisan agreement, he said the final Senate package would likely require leaders of both houses to iron out differences through a conference committee.\ Items in the Assembly budget that would assist municipalities and school districts include: Continued state funding of recycling programs into the next century.\ Major boosts in state aids for local transportation projects and mass transit systems.\ A pledge to continue two-thirds funding statewide of school building projects.\ The deal would mean millions of dollars of additional state money, although no precise estimates are available yet.\ ""It's exceeded our expectations,"" said Ed Huck, director of the Wisconsin Alliance of Cities, which represents the state's largest communities. ""There's a lot in this budget to help city governments, and it really, truly is a bipartisan budget. Both sides went to bat for the cities, and they did a hell of a job for us.""\ One item in which local governments and school districts lost, however, was a move to exempt computer equipment from personal property taxes.\ According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the change will result in a $59 million shift in taxes from personal property to the real estate property tax. The change won't take effect until the year 2000, and the budget deal calls for the state to cover at least the initial revenue loss for local governments and schools. Some schools and municipalities were disappointed because money from computer equipment was a growing revenue source.\ A boost for local governments in the budget comes in the form of an $8.6 million increase in Youth Aids to counties. Counties use the money to help pay for services to abused and neglected children and for treatment and incarceration of young lawbreakers.\ Assembly Republicans wanted to limithow much new construction school districts could have and state aid they could continue to get, but the budget compromise maintains the state's pickup of two-thirds of the costs of schools.\ Other details of the budget deal include: TAXES: All of the state's income tax rates would be cut by 1 percent a year, starting in 1998 and potentially ending in 2002, for a maximum 5 percent cut.\ In the 1998 tax year, the state's top rate would drop from 6.93 percent to 6.87 percent; in 1999, the top rate would drop to 6.79 percent. Additional tax cuts would need to be approved by future sessions of the Legislature.\ The so-called ""marriage penalty"" for couples filing jointly also would be eliminated by the year 2001. Currently, some couples who file jointly pay higher taxes than if they filed individually. Families that earn less than $18,000 annually would pay no state income tax at all.\ The state's gas tax would rise by a penny per gallon, and there would be a $5 hike in the vehicle registration fee. There would also be changes to the formula used for setting the gas tax to allow future increases for inflation.\ The Lottery Tax Credit would be restored, but all property taxpayers would be eligible for it.\ ENVIRONMENT: Cities would continue to get $24 million a year in state recycling assistance through the year 2000 with a commitment by the state to expand the program into 2004.\ BADGERCARE: Low-cost health insurance would be available to an estimated 42,000 ""working poor"" parents and their children. The budget proposal cuts the amount families would pay for premiums, but reduces the number of people eligible for the program.\ WISCONSIN WORKS: Former welfare recipients in publicly subsidized jobs would not get an increase in their monthly grants, as Gov. Tommy Thompson proposed. Instead, the monthly grant for workers in Community Service jobs would be $555, and $518 for workers in W-2 Transition jobs."

Administration wasting efforts on wrong issues
\
Regarding Fred Krupp's April 2 Crossroads article urging us to do our part to stop global warming, I'm sure that will all help and I hope people listen (""What you can do right now to slow down global warming"").
\
But I think the bigger problem is our government's refusal to pass laws that would force big industry to stop releasing toxic fumes into our atmosphere, poisoning our waters with toxic waste and pillaging our forests and laws that would force car manufacturers to produce environment-friendly vehicles.
\
The current administration is wasting precious time pandering to the religious right in order to keep in power by trying to get laws passed that dictate who we can marry, whether women have the right to end an unwanted pregnancy and whether we have the right to end our lives when we no longer have quality of life. These are all personal issues that should be decided by individuals.
\
After all, how important will those personal issues be when there are no living human beings on the planet?

City can do better in valley redevelopment
\
The long-awaited redevelopment of the Menomonee Valley has held the promise of reinvigorating what was once the economic heart of our city with new, living-wage jobs that would employ Milwaukeeans from some of the most densely populated and underemployed neighborhoods in our state, those surrounding the valley.
\
Instead, it seems, according to an April 1 article by Tom Daykin on new opportunities in the valley, Milwaukee leadership is willing to settle for ""seasonal"" employment, or ""work full time from two to six months"" (""Extended Canal St. offers new opportunities"").
\
In a city with significant social issues rooted in economic depravity, one would hope that our economic development strategy would reach beyond a land sale to a part-time industry, snuffing the hopes of our struggling population that the right people are in charge and are making the best decisions for our citizens.
\
Milwaukee can do, and ought to demand, better.

We need to build a strong economy

The Journal Sentinel reported on March 31 the loss of Tower Automotive (""Tower Automotive plant reaches end of the line""). What attracted people to Milwaukee in 1965, Rick Romell wrote, was ""good jobs were to be had at one of the city's booming manufacturers.""
\
I find it ironic that on the eve of the Menomonee Valley redevelopment director leaving to join Cleveland's mayor to build a strong regional economy, our mayor is pushing a mega warehouse in the valley with 600 part-time, non-living-wage jobs not the ""good jobs"" we had at Tower and not the good jobs available in suburban industrial parks.
\
This move by the city is the equivalent of subsidizing a Wal- Mart with the supposed goal of helping working families.

TRANSPORTATION
\
So just where is that money going?
\
Once again, I seem to be missing something.
\
Now, our state Department of Transportation tells us that, without the automatic annual April 1 gas tax increase, the state's highway and bridge building and maintenance program may be in dire straits (""Crisis ahead, DOT warns,"" March 27).
\
We in Wisconsin have one of the highest gasoline taxes in the United States. Wisconsin's gas tax has increased approximately one penny a gallon every April 1 for some years now; this year was the last automatic increase.
\
Why is it that other states with substantially lower gasoline taxes have fine roads and bridges? Obviously, Wisconsin's collected gasoline tax fund, quite like our federal Social Security program, gets robbed on occasion to relieve other budgets in the state system.
\
Where, exactly, do these gasoline taxes go? Who can answer that honestly?

Cheer up, though, because taking out the garbage could become easier at least on you, not the environment. Soon there may be no more sorting bottles, cans, newspapers and plastic because local recycling programs are in peril.
\
These changes in your life and others are on the horizon thanks to the work of a powerful group of state lawmakers. The Legislature's Joint Finance Committee is working on ways to raise and spend money in the two years to come, what the Capitol crowd otherwise calls the 1997-'99 biennial budget.
\
Actually, it's Gov. Tommy Thompson's budget bill, but the 16 members of the finance committee have been poring over its 2,100 pages for the last few weeks passing some provisions, rejecting or modifying others, and rewriting entire sections of the document.
\
The Legislature has to pass the budget by July 1, the start of a new fiscal year. The committee was supposed to finish its work Thursday and send the proposal on to the Senate, but there was a small problem: It was $72 million short of balancing the checkbook.
\
After laboring over the $37 billion document, the committee had only $143 million to spare in the wee hours Friday.
\
A one-time tax break for renters and homeowners was on the table. But so was a bill for $215 million, the amount to settle a longstanding dispute with state retirees over a pension fund raid during Thompson's first term.
\
The committee will try to resolve that cash flow problem when it returns to work Monday.
\
As state budgets go, this has been a yawner for the most part. Two years ago, Thompson and lawmakers were struggling to find $1 billion to keep a promise of property tax relief by funding two-thirds of local school costs.
\
If the argument wasn't over budget cuts to achieve that goal, it was over issues such as religious school choice or raising the gas tax increase.
\
But there's been less rancor during debate of this budget.
\
""It's hard to characterize the budget as having a theme this time around,"" said James Buchen, lobbyist for the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state's largest business group. ""It's kind of a `steady-as-she-goes' budget in many ways.""
\
While the budget may lack dramatic themes, the finance committee action thus far has not been without controversy. Take UW tuition increases, for example.
\
Thompson proposed giving the UW Board of Regents flexibility in meeting the UW System's budget priorities. Specifically, regents could boost tuition beyond what the Legislature has allowed in the past to pay for faculty salary increases.
\
The committee didn't go as far as Thompson proposed, but it did grant regents authority to use tuition revenue to pay for faculty pay increases of 4% each year. The bottom line for students and their parents is that tuition will go up roughly $200 in the coming year and $440 the next year.
\
""That's outrageous,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Chvala (D-Madison). ""That's basically a $640 tax increase on working families that have kids in college.""
\
That's one change Chvala said Democrats controlling the Senate will make when the finance committee advances the budget.
\
The Democratic floor leader has changes he wants to make to the budget when it's in the Senate, and Thompson has amendments he wants fellow Republicans controlling the Assembly to make when the budget eventually gets to that house.
\
One of those changes is the finance committee's vote on prison industries, said Administration Secretary Mark Bugher, the governor's top aide. Thompson wanted inmates working for private industry in all prisons to earn their keep and make restitution. But that plan failed in committee essentially on a party-line vote. The committee is made up of eight Democrats and eight Republicans.
\
""The governor's very disappointed in that and intends to make that a very high priority during the course of budget deliberations,"" Bugher said. With that exception, the committee generally earned hig marks from Thompson for its work on the budget, Bugher said.
\
If there's one area in which all sides appear satisfied at least for now it's the transportation portion of the budget.
\
The 1-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax and $5 increase in vehicle registration fees would add $200 million for road construction and maintenance.
\
""They put together a pretty responsible package under the circumstances,"" Buchen said.
\
That and other bipartisan agreements in the finance committee led some to suggest budget approval with little rancor. But that ignores one battle certain to come over the state recycling program.
\
The committee voted to extend state aid for recycling programs through 2000, but end it after that. Local officials said that would leave them essentially with one of two choices: raise property taxes to continue recycling programs or end recycling efforts.
\
""In a real surprise, basically, the Republicans gutted the recycling program, one of the most popular programs in this state,"" Chvala said. ""There's a lot of work to be done in the Senate. We're definitely going to revisit the recycling issue, and a number of other issues.""

Gore races for lead in gas debate
\
He announces energy plan, attacks Bush's oil ties
\
By CRAIG GILBERT
\
of the Journal Sentinel staff
\
Wednesday, June 28, 2000
\
Washington -- Vice President Al Gore waged a political offensive Tuesday over high gas prices, announcing a new, long-term energy plan while hammering at his opponent's oil background.
\
Gore proposed a multiyear, $80 billion package of tax incentives and other measures to cut pollution and foreign oil dependence.
\
But in a telephone interview from Philadelphia with four Midwestern newspapers, Gore stepped up his efforts to paint Republican George W. Bush as the candidate of the oil industry.
\
Gore said oil companies were supporting Bush because they think ""he would be the best person to help them bring about higher oil prices.""
\
""Now he's on the hot seat,"" Gore said of Bush, ""and trying to distance himself from people who have provided such overwhelming support for his campaign.""
\
Gore also called on the Federal Trade Commission to make public hearings part of its investigation into possible price-gouging by oil companies.
\
For its part, the Bush campaign dismissed Gore's energy proposals and challenged Gore in kind over oil ties, citing a Gore family trust with large holdings in Occidental Petroleum.
\
""Today's proposals are more about Al Gore trying to avoid paying a political price because of high gas prices than they are about reducing gas prices,"" said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
\
The ongoing rhetoric over gasoline prices underscored not only the issue's political salience, but also some important policy differences between the candidates over energy.
\
In Tuesday's conference call with four reporters from Wisconsin, Illinois and Ohio, Gore reiterated his strong opposition to oil drilling on the East and West coasts and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.
\
In the case of Alaska, ""What you're talking about is the possibility of a few days of oil consumption at a cost of spoiling an environment that is valuable to the country,"" Gore said.
\
Bush has attacked the Clinton administration for failure to encourage domestic energy production. He supports what he calls ""environmentally responsible"" exploration of the Alaska wildlife area, an aide said.
\
Some Republicans also have called for federal gas tax relief during the price crisis, but Gore said, ""I have not advocated it and . . . I think it is doubtful that would be passed on (to consumers) in any case.""
\
Gore was asked again Tuesday about waivers from reformulated gas mandates sought by political leaders in Wisconsin and Illinois, but so far denied by the Environment Protection Agency.
\
Gore said EPA Administrator Carol Browner was bound by certain legal rules in weighing a waiver, but ""if there's leeway she ought to use it.""
\
Gore, however, questioned whether the RFG requirement was driving gasoline prices in the Midwest, saying prices in Detroit -- which doesn't have the mandate -- have climbed above Milwaukee's.
\
""How do they explain that?"" he asked.
\
""That tends to imply there are other factors,"" he said. ""A 500 percent increase in big oil company profits in the first part of this year may not be coincidental. Their ability to affect the market with pricing decisions made without sufficient competitive pressure may be the real cause of this.""
\
Gore vs. Bush
\
Gore's comments about Bush were among the most pointed he has made on this issue. Gore aides have pointed to the roughly $1.5 million Bush has received in oil and gas company contributions to his presidential campaign.
\
Asked Tuesday about his campaign's efforts to link Bush to ""big oil,"" Gore responded:
\
""Governor Bush's experience in the private sector was primarily as an oil company executive. . . . When the oil companies decided to support him overwhelmingly this year, they wrote in their own trade publication that they thought he stood for higher oil prices and he would be the best person to help them bring about higher oil prices. Back in the Bush-Quayle administration, he lobbied the White House on behalf of higher oil prices.""
\
To back up those claims, the Gore campaign cited an editorial last year in World Oil Magazine, pointing out how the Texas economy is tied to energy prices. But in the same column the writer pointedly questioned whether Bush would do anything to help oil interests.
\
On the charge that Bush lobbied his father's White House for higher oil prices, Gore aides cited a letter the junior Bush wrote to the president's chief of staff, Samuel Skinner, in 1992, saying, ""We have trouble in the oil states because the president is viewed as favoring cheap energy.""
\
But asked in Tuesday's interview about the election implications of the price spike in gasoline, Gore said, ""I don't look at it primarily as a political issue, but as an issue for American consumers.""
\
The response of the Bush campaign to all this was to suggest Gore is guilty of hypocrisy because of his own ties to oil.
\
""When is Al Gore going to sell the upwards of a million dollars in stock in a major oil company his family owns?"" asked McClellan, of the Bush campaign.
\
Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the holding in Occidental Petroleum was ""held in trust for his mother, which he has no control over.""
\
""He doesn't own any stocks, to avoid conflicts of interest,"" Hattaway said.
\
More broadly, the Bush camp accused Gore of pursuing damage control, saying imports of foreign oil had gone from 50% to 56% of U.S. consumption during the Clinton administration.
\
""Al Gore takes credit for the current prosperity but refuses to shoulder any of the responsibility for the dramatic hike in gas prices under the Clinton-Gore administration,"" McClellan said.
\
Gore's Energy Plan
\
Gore's speech Tuesday in Philadelphia marked the first stage in a three-day rollout of his new energy agenda.
\
The vice president proposed, among other things: a trust fund that would provide tax breaks and incentives for renewable energy, natural gas exploration, and cleaner, more efficient energy technologies.
\
The campaign said the proposals were aimed especially at modernizing the country's old power plants.
\
In his speech, Gore said ""the challenge we face is even broader than soaring gasoline prices.""
\
""It's an old, timid way of thinking to say that we have to trade off our economy and our environment,"" he said.

282,"Arnold's track photos were brilliant\Thank you for publishing so many of State Journal photographer Amber Arnold's photos from the state track meet last weekend. As we photo hobby-ists know, good action photos are a lot harder than they look. Arnold's coverage of the event was brilliant. We subscribers are lucky to have her. So thank you. \Matthew Coan, McFarland\Next governor needs statewide appeal \Please don't do it, Paul Soglin. Don't run for governor. Most of the state doesn't consider ""77 square miles surrounded by reality"" a compliment. \If we want to defeat Gov. Scott Walker, we need a Democrat who isn't from Madison or Milwaukee to run. Having ties to either of those two cities will hurt the chances of any candidate in a significant portion of the state. \Find a candidate who will be popular in the northern two-thirds of the state. Madison and Milwaukee will vote overwhelmingly for any Democrat to replace Gov. Scott Walker, so please find a candidate who is popular in the areas that tend to vote Republican. \Kerry Tobin, Madison\""999"" motion is a sneaky move \Rep. John Nygren says the Legislature's finance committee will probably employ a ""999"" motion in a limited way this year. This is the method used to slip last-minute major policy changes into the state budget with little or no public scrutiny. It was used two years ago to try to limit most public access to government records. \Do not use the ""999"" motion. Any policy that cannot stand public knowledge and debate for a reasonable time prior to a vote should not be part of any bill - let alone a budget process. \The ""999"" budget motion is a sneaky maneuver that cannot be part of the democratic process. \Patricia Wildgen, Madison\Pave the way in renewable energy \President Donald Trump made the wrong decision for our health and planet in pulling the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Losing Paris will compromise our nation's position in the international arena. And casting aside our emissions goals could have serious consequences in Wisconsin. \The Great Lakes are the largest source of surface water in the United States, encompassing almost one-fifth of the available surface freshwater on the planet. This beloved, recreational sanctuary many Wisconsinites call home is under threat from the rapidly warming of our earth. \Though an increase of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius may seem minimal , it has potentially detrimental effects to our wildlife. Risk of invasive species, rapid algae bloom growth and increased agricultural runoff threatens Wisconsin's environment. \If Washington won't lead, we need our mayor to continue to step up. It's time for Mayor Paul Soglin to lead Wisconsin toward a 100 percent renewable energy future. It's time for U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, to stand up and defend important climate-friendly measures. \Monica Begley, Madison\Don't blame Walker for road problems \The State Journal's editorial June 7 blaming Gov. Scott Walker for Wisconsin's transportation problems is wrong. \Wisconsin would not have a transportation budget problem if former Gov. Jim Doyle had not removed more than $1 billion from the transportation fund to finance his pet projects. That money came primarily from gas tax and vehicle registration revenue and was to be used for road work projects. \Gov. Walker is keeping his promise not to raise taxes or fees. Borrowing to replace the money removed by Doyle is appropriate. The loan can be repaid with current and future registration and gas tax revenue. \I hope Madison Mayor Paul Soglin decides to run against Walker for governor. Soglin will easily win the Madison vote while Walker will win Wisconsin's vote. \Dick Greffin, Cross Plains\Post Office provides valuable service \The May 23 letter to the editor ""Drop postal delivery on Saturdays"" mischaracterized U.S. Postal Service finances. Given the Postal Service's importance to Madison's residents and businesses, I'd like to offer some information. \The Postal Service, which delivers to 155 million addresses six and increasingly seven days a week, doesn't use taxpayer money. By law, it earns its revenue from stamps and related products and services. It's the centerpiece of the $1.3 trillion national mailing industry, which employs 7 million Americans in the private sector, including 180,238 people in Wisconsin. \The Postal Service has averaged a $1 billion annual operating profit. The red ink you hear about stems from congressional politics. In 2006, lawmakers mandated that the Postal Service pre-fund future retiree health benefits. No other entity has to do this even one year in advance. The Postal Service must pre-fund benefits decades into the future. That $5.8 billion annual charge produces the ""red ink."" \The Postal Service, postal unions, lawmakers and industry groups are working to address pre-funding. \If Wisconsin's representatives in Washington act on targeted reform legislation, the Postal Service can continue to provide all Americans with the industrial world's most affordable delivery services. \Fredric Rolando, president, National Association of Letter Carriers"
283,"Free college is not an empty promise\I disagree with Steven Durlauf's column in last Sunday's State Journal. President Barack Obama's call for free tuition for two years of college is most certainly not an empty promise. \More emphasis on education is needed for both the very young and those becoming ready for job. \President Obama promoted early childhood education at the beginning of his presidency. Now he is using his bully pulpit to promote what we all know ? the higher the level of education, the higher the salaries and the better the economy. \For decades, New Zealand has offered free tuition to all of its students for a bachelor's degree, realizing a high school degree is no longer sufficient for a proper education in a complex job market requiring a multitude of skills. \The people of New Zealand are willing to tax themselves for this endeavor because they know the education of their young is a critical investment in the future of their country. \Of course, considering the regressive, uneducated minds controlling Congress, this important concept will not be implemented in our country at this time ? but eventually, it will. Then, most people will wonder why it did not happen sooner. \- Jane Licht, McFarland\Tuition was a wise investment for society \In 1981, I earned a degree from Madison Area Technical College. My tuition for the two-year program was about $2,000, paid for with federal grant money. \I was a minimum wage earner paying little in taxes prior to my degree. Since then my wages have had significant increases due to my degree opening opportunities. \I pay several times that $2,000 every year in taxes. I have ""repaid"" that grant money many times over. Society made a great investment. \- Robert Clifford, Madison\Drug testing is discrimination \Gov. Scott Walker is proposing drug testing for recipients of state aid, with an emphasis on testing ""able-bodied"" adults. \Let's see, able-bodied adults receiving state aid? I guess that means he'll recommend drug testing for every UW student who receives a scholarship, athletic or otherwise. And don't forget about the business owners and developers who get tax breaks from the state. I'm sure there are able-bodied adults aplenty in those categories who should be screened as well. \Gov. Walker's proposal is nothing more than thinly veiled discrimination. To call it anything else is to insult the intelligence of every able-bodied ? and able-minded ? citizen of Wisconsin. \- Dennis B. Appleton, Madison\Let's see budget before we cry wolf \The left is screaming about the projected $2.2 billion budget deficit facing the state of Wisconsin. Let us all be reminded the dollar amount mentioned is simply projected and not actual. \The projected deficit is based on requests from various agencies throughout the state based on their ""wants"" and not ""needs."" There is a huge difference. \Many private companies hold off on expenditures due to revenue not providing enough cash flow to enable the ""wants"" of the company. They continue to use existing equipment, staff and facilities to satisfy ""needs."" \The same principle applies to your household budget. If your income does not provide enough extra cash to buy that new car or curved high-definition TV, you continue to use what you have. \Let's hear state leaders explain their budget before crying wolf. \- Bob Hartwig, Madison\Long-term thinking solves problems \Many folks look at our world through the prism of conservative vs. liberal or Republican vs. Democrat. We might better understand our problems if we see them as short-term thinking vs. long-term thinking. \Highway funding illustrates this point. At the federal level, we stopped raising the gas tax decades ago. In Wisconsin, the gas tax is the same as it was a decade ago. The dollars brought in are short of what is needed. These are indisputable facts that both parties accept as true. \So what do we do about it? We shift money from the general fund (which is already running a deficit), and we borrow. And this is what ""we"" do, whether we are Republicans or Democrats. We cannot continue to borrow from our future. It's not sustainable. \I would ask you to consider viewing other issues through the ""short-term vs. long-term"" prism: the environment, welfare, social security, education and health care. In some cases, you might find your current opinions validated. In other cases you may find you are challenging some of your long-held beliefs. \Regardless, pointing fingers at the ""other"" side isn't working. Perhaps if enough of us start to look at problems in a different way, we can move to solutions that will work in the long run. \- Mike Wolf, Monona\God should send Walker an eclipse \I'm not entirely satisfied to learn from our governor that he will wait until he hears from God before deciding whether to run for president. The clear implication, if he announces he'll run, would be that the governor has heard from God, and that God has chosen Scott Walker from all the eligible candidates. \But it is only reasonable to require some indication of God's thinking that is more readily verified. Let's settle on a holy signal discernible to everyone. A solar eclipse in the next six months, on a day other than March 20, would do the trick for me. \Meantime, the governor should commit to keeping his famous ""laser-like focus"" on Wisconsin. God knows we have enough problems here to keep busy. \- Kurt Stege, Madison\House state lawmakers in a rehabbed building \It seems strange that, in this era of outrage over any government expenditure, the proposal to raise legislative per diems wouldn't generated more buzz from the tax cutters out there. \We are thinking about this all wrong. The proposal to go to $138 a day for expenses for lawmakers amounts to a lot of money. Why doesn't the state consider buying and rehabbing a building that can be used as legislative residences? The building could be equipped with a dining room or make use of the university's dining hall, further reducing expenses when the Legislature is in session. \- Derek Popp, Mount Horeb"
284,"Walker speaks in safe venues\Dear Editor: Scott Walker is ready to take on the Islamic State with boots on the ground. Is he another ""chicken hawk"" like Dick Cheney?\Why does he give speeches in safe venues like corporation factories where everyone is ordered to give him a polite reception? Could he at least show his face in public?\Fred Middleton, Madison\Fitzgerald illogical on gas tax\Dear Editor: Small wonder the dire straits of our state economy if what passes for Republican reasoning is espoused in Sen. Scott Fitzgerald's recent Wisconsin State Journal column ""Protect middle class from increase in state's gas tax."" Using his figures of the average household using 1,200 gallons of gas per year, and the current lower fuel cost translating into a yearly savings of $1,000, he states ""that savings would be reduced significantly with a new per-gallon hike"" in fuel taxes. So if the tax/gallon was raised 1 cent, that would be a mammoth $12/year cost; a 3 cent increase would be a colossal $36/year. How is this ""significant""? Our roads are falling apart and we need money to pay for them. With a small fuel tax increase, out-of-state visitors would also pay. Republican plan: Borrow the money so we have to pay much more in the future paying off the loans. How witless is that?\Roger Stoffel, Windsor\Walker actions hurt seniors\Dear Editor: You may have heard that growing old is hell. Scott Walker wants to make it more hellish by changing SeniorCare, a highly effective and cost-efficient prescription drug program.\Walker wants these people to figure out how to apply for Medicare Part D, which is complicated, more expensive and doesn't provide reliable coverage.\What possible purpose would these changes serve, as they would result in less efficiency, greater cost and harm to a vulnerable population?\This comes at a time when Dane County's social workers are seeing an alarming rise in hunger, homelessness and mental health problems in our swelling senior population.\True stories: A 76-year-old widow outlives the lifetime savings she and her husband had worked for all their lives, faces homelessness and asks the case manager ""What do I do now?""; a 67-year-old woman is threatened with eviction due to a mental health problem; an 80-year-old blind and wheelchair-bound man is destitute as a victim of financial abuse. The needs of seniors are increasing while resources to aid them are decreasing.\Social workers and advocates struggle to handle more and more complex problems. Walker's proposed changes to SeniorCare will only inflict greater confusion and harm to those least able to deal with them.\Diane Walder, Madison\ALEC's voice loud in Wisconsin\Dear Editor: The recent state budget and right-to-work-for-less bill are direct attacks against the people of Wisconsin.\These actions are not based upon the needs and concerns of most Wisconsin citizens. Instead, they are taken from scripts crafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a national membership group that pushes model legislation that furthers their agenda.\Walker and his lackeys in the Legislature are following the orders of their corporate bosses who fund ALEC's operations. It's clear they don't care about the damage they're doing to the people, wildlife, environment, economy and reputation of our state.\Walker's outrageous comment comparing protesters in Wisconsin to ISIS terrorists further shows his contempt and disregard for the people of his own state, no matter how he tried to spin his comment later.\It now seems to be a sad fact that, unless your name is ALEC, you no longer have a voice in Wisconsin.\Barbara Burczyk, Deerfield\Gov's 'world experience' shallow\Dear Editor: John Nichols' assessment of Scott Walker's weaknesses as a governor, leader and person is spot on. Walker disregards Wisconsinites who defend their livelihoods, communities and state.\Walker is pitifully unprepared to provide national leadership or global judgments. His ""world experience"" ranges as far west as Iowa, as far south as northern Illinois, and as far north as Minocqua. It is as shallow as his personality. Walker's world-view comes from the prejudices of the tiny well-heeled set that owns him.\In the rare moments when Walker goes ""off script,"" he likens Capitol protesters to overseas terrorists. He refuses to view Wisconsinites with liberal or even more moderate leanings as ""hardworking taxpayers."" He casts them as his enemies and tilts at imagined political windmills. He is a self-delusional Don Quixote, but of course has not read Cervantes.\I hope that I live long enough to once again see sunshine, reason, fairness, compassion and sensibility restored to Wisconsin.\David L. Sperling, Madison\Arnold right for Fitchburg\Dear Editor: Steve Arnold has my vote to be the next mayor of Fitchburg. Steve and I worked together at the state Department of Natural Resources on community sustainability and climate adaptation projects. He is a ""natural"" at inclusive and respectful conversation with community decision makers, engineers, planners and the public who we dealt with during the course of our work. He knows the elements of community planning relative to how it's done, who is involved, and how it will impact the whole community. He is technically brilliant with data management and new technology. I hope you'll join me in supporting and voting for him.\Sally Kefer, Fitchburg\Fitchburg needs Pfaff\Dear Editor: Speaking with Mayor Shawn Pfaff in 2011, we asked: ""Are you for or against Act 10?"" Pfaff was emphatic: ""Act 10 is anti-family, anti-worker. No one is calling for this, it comes from out of state."" \Since Pfaff was elected, he has kept his promises to guide a growing city, working with all the stakeholders in the project that is Fitchburg. City services, public safety and a $2.6 billion tax base we rate Fitchburg No. 1 in quality of life.\In 2015, we told Pfaff that we hate the so-called right-to-work bill. Shawn blasted it, was at the Capitol on Feb. 25, and denounced this newest Scott Walker bomb.\What we want from our local government is a safe, progressive city with a high quality of life where everyone gets a say.\Shawn Pfaff has delivered; we urge his re-election.\Jackie Captain and Michael Leon, Fitchburg"
285,"Address: 715 Olive Tree Court, Howard\Age: 47\Family: Married to wife, Jennifer, and father to son, Steele\Relevant experience: After serving as a municipal and county elected official for eight years, I was elected to the state Assembly in 2014. I was the lead author of many bills over my four years including: 1. Returning $17.7 million in Lambeau Field sales tax to Brown County communities; 2. Decommissioning the Allouez prison (GBCI) to provide $150 million in savings to the state, create a new, safer facility for prison employees and unlock $100 million in re-development opportunities for Allouez; 3. Honoring and supporting the families of fallen officers through the Law Enforcement Memorial Fund license plate program; and 4. Creating the state's first Premiere Economic Development District to assist with future projects in the Titletown District.\To continue the growth of our booming state economy, we need to maintain our roads. The gas tax has always been an efficient, effective and user-based method of funding the needed repairs. Even a very modest increase in the gas tax can provide a tremendous impact on maintaining our state's infrastructure. This option should be seriously explored immediately after we finish instituting the efficiency and waste reduction outlined in the recent DOT audit.\The passage of Act 10 put local school boards and principals back in charge of our children's education. More importantly, student achievement and curriculum innovations are now the focus in our classrooms. Keeping union business out of the classrooms has been a refreshing, positive change for our schools. This change also laid the foundation for a historic $630 million increase in school funding, plus an additional $12 million for the four 4th Assembly school districts. These positive state funding increases, along with over $100 million in recent referendum funding, have been instrumental in helping area schools achieve their goals.\Developing and preparing the next generation of our workforce has been one of the greatest successes in Madison over the last four years. Many of the barriers that existed between the K-12 system, tech colleges, universities and the economy have been removed or retooled to ensure our workforce piping is responsive to the needs of workers and employers. I will continue to expand upon this positive reform trajectory in the next session.\The largest investment of dollars and family-supporting jobs in United States history should be celebrated by everyone, regardless of political party. Forty-nine other states wanted this opportunity but only one succeeded – Wisconsin. Sadly, Foxconn is being used as a political wedge issue to mislead voters and influence elections. If Gov. Scott Walker was a Democrat, every Democrat politician would be supporting this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our workforce and the economic future of our state.\Absolutely! I was the lead co-author of this legislation last session and worked with the Village of Ashwaubenon to host the first ""Dark Store Day"" to bring state-wide awareness to the problem. There are few issues more important to the taxpayers of Ashwaubenon, Howard and Green Bay than the dark store loophole. This issue significantly impacts the constituents of District 4 and I will continue to be a leader on this matter in Madison.\Last session, I supported the legalization of the cannabis derivative CBD oil. CBD oil is non-addictive, marijuana-based product that provides proven relief to those suffering from chronic pain, seizures and related medical conditions. However, the topic of universal access to marijuana has been met with strong concerns and opposition from those who deal with this issue on a daily basis, namely those in our health care community, law enforcement officers and educators. Until there is a consensus from those on the front line of this issue in Wisconsin, I will not support this initiative.\Serving my community as a state Assembly representative has been the most rewarding professional opportunity of my life. I've been able to deliver positive results for individuals struggling to work their way through the government machine, provide my district with reforms and economic development opportunities and taken the lead on larger, statewide issues that benefit all of Wisconsin. However, my work in Madison is not done. I still have many impactful, positive initiatives to get across the goal line. For this reason, I am sincerely and respectfully asking voters to allow me the honor of continuing to serve them.\I believe I'm the stronger candidate for two reasons: 1. I have delivered real results that are benefiting residents — from individual constituent case work to economic development projects to lower taxes, I have gotten things done for those whom I serve; and 2. I believe my core principles of limited, responsive government and reduced tax burdens for working families reflect the principles of 4th Assembly District voters. We can continue to deliver a high level of necessary government services without breaking the bank or removing freedoms from the people. This is a guiding force in my thoughts and votes in Madison.\I've knocked on over 6,000 doors in the district, and one issue is clearly a top concern for our residents — affordable health insurance. As a small business owner, I spent years paying 100 percent of my insurance premiums or being uninsured. I know the fear and anxiety that comes with limited or no coverage. For this reason, I've worked with both parties to address this issue. I was a vocal supporter of bi-partisan legislation guaranteeing pre-existing condition coverage in Wisconsin. I've also worked to pass other cost-reducing measures, including the Premium Stabilization Act that provides the first premium reduction ever for Obamacare policyholders.\I am thankful that my opponent is focusing on policy issues and not negative attacks. I am committed to the same philosophy. Our political environment, especially at the federal level, has become so toxic that it has become harmful to our democracy. While we can't easily change these forces in Washington, my opponent and I can each do our part in Wisconsin.\Steffen"

"
287," Recently we asked for your views on how to deal with rising gas prices and America's insatiable appetite for fuel. Here's a sampling of reader responses.\ Raise gas tax monthly\ What is the best way to reduce our trade deficit, national deficit, national debt, air pollution and increase the supply of money for education and public transportation? Why not have the gas prices go up and help our country instead? Raising the gas tax 2 cents each month, until we no longer import any oil, makes these goals attainable. At this rate it would take 10 years before we matched Europe. Revenue could go to state and federal education and transportation funds and to reduce the deficit and national debt.\ Over time, companies would be able to produce more fuel- efficient vehicles. Alternative fuel sources would be more fully explored and public transportation would be subsidized most by those not conserving our fuel. People would drive fewer miles, resulting in lower pollution rates and less wear, tear and congestion on our highways.\ - Bill Keen, Verona\ Need innovation\ Nearly two-thirds of the world's oil comes from countries in the Middle East, some of which use the proceeds of the oil we buy from them to fund religious schools which teach their students to hate Americans and to further corrupt economies which don't provide jobs for their young, educated citizens, making them ripe for recruitment into terrorist groups.\ Of course we should figure out how to cut our demand and focus on finding alternate sources of energy. The idea that there isn't something better than oil out there is defeatist. This is America for heaven's sake - inventing new things is something we are really good at.\ - Susan Lewandowski, Madison\ We won't stop driving\ As a new driver and consumer of fuel, I believe that it is ludicrous to increase the cost of gas prices thinking it will make people drive less often. I have to drive to school everyday, or make the occasional trip to the grocery store. We shouldn't be punished because we don't live close enough to walk, should we? I know that I am going to drive wherever I want to drive, no matter what the cost. If the cost goes up, it will only put more rage on the road.\ I think the more reasonable and environmentally friendly thing to do is to make all new models of vehicles hybrid. I believe that if this were to take place, there would be no reason for anyone to complain about sport utility vehicles.\ - Joni Adams, Madison East High School\ Fund more research\ I believe that we need to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel, through the development of alternative fuel sources and conservation. With much of the oil not coming from America, we've become dependant on other countries to supply a critical national resource. With a high demand for oil, the primary oil countries can charge extreme prices and still sell. If we find alternatives to fuel, not only will we decrease our dependency on the Middle Eastern sources of energy, but our economy will receive a big boost.\ Finding alternatives will take a lot of people to research and experiment. That means more jobs. If we try to find ways to keep driving affordable, it would be the quick and easy way out of a jam, but cutting demand and finding alternatives makes us less self- dependent and helps both the environment and the economy.\ - Corey Van Lone, Madison\ Force the issue\ I think if auto manufacturers won't investigate new fuel- efficient cars, then it is up to Congress to cut pollution. Congress needs to heighten gas prices in order to get rid of pollution and the huge Bush deficit. Maybe then more people will look to carpooling and Metro buses as transportation. Look at European countries: Most of them have high gasoline prices and great mass- transit options along with low pollution rates. If we really want to cut pollution rates we can urge Congress to lower quotas on emissions.\ - Lydia Roussos, Madison\ Long-term fix needed\ What are we going to do about the rising price of gas in America and the fact that there is an oil war in Iraq right now? I believe that there are many ways to use less instead of always searching for more. Try out hydrogen-, solar- and electric-powered vehicles. There are car co-op share programs where a group of people purchase a few cars, pay a membership and sign out to use the cars. Start designing communities with houses and stores close by so we can all use our legs to get around like Middleton Hills was designed to do. To save money, car pool with co-workers and friends.\ Instead of having the mindset that we need to have, get and use more, why don't we think about using less? Share and be creative with what we have before it's too late to take the issue into our own hands. Think about the long run and what we can do to help.\ - Eilish Connor, Madison\ Pressure Detroit\ I think that instead of cutting the high demand for fuel, people need to focus on new ways to keep driving affordable. I feel this way because there are many families that have only one car and paying off the gas alone is tough. It angers me to hear that some car companies complain about achieving higher gas mileage while the new Ford Escape can get 38 miles to the gallon. My own car gets around 15-20 mpg. Try greater production of the hydroelectric car. Congress should stop letting off Detroit so easy.\ - Brian Braun, Madison\ Try fossil alternatives\ Each year, Americans use an average of 30,000 years worth of fossil fuels. There are alternatives to fossil fuels - why aren't we using them? It is clear that the Detroit auto manufacturers have the technology to build gas/electric ""hybrid"" cars, even SUVs. Why don't we push for them to be used?\ Lenore Skenazy's article April 18 stated, ""Detroit devoted all its energy to lobbying Congress not to raise the miles-per-gallon requirements."" Doesn't the privilege of democracy apply to us, who buy the cars and the gasoline? If Detroit invested more time and money into conserving energy, they might end up seeing more cars sold, and a better planet, to boot.\ - Maggie Richardson, Madison\ We need to catch up\ There are plenty of ideas to reduce demand for gas: ethanol, biodiesel, hydrogen, methanol etc, but there needs to be major government funding for these to work. If work on converting cars to alternative fuels can be done soon, we don't have to risk scrambling to build alternative fuel vehicles when the fossil fuels run out. The best way to do this would be first converting the giant gas- guzzling monstrosities to alternative fuels and then go down from there until all vehicles are using alternative fuels.\ If necessary, I think the government should force car companies to build alternative fuel vehicles, but even if American companies don't, foreign companies like Toyota will build them. My guess is that foreign companies will build the alternate fuel vehicles first just like they did with hybrid cars and American companies will start to lose business so they also will build them.\ - Eli Cizewski-Robinson, Madison\ Ask the Europeans\ I think that Americans in general, not just Wisconsinites, should try to cut our ""seemingly insatiable demand for fuel."" Fuel won't be around forever so we need to start preserving it and learning new ways to get around without it. Battery-operated cars are a good idea; or riding a bike or walking.\ We need to start using fuel for more important things than just driving. While I was in Spain, I learned about all the different types of cars there and the gas mileage they get is awesome.\ - Emma Bohrod, Madison"
288,"
State officials who drank deeply from the bottle of Old Property Tax Relief over the last two years are likely to wake with a financial hangover Monday, the first day of the 1997-'98 session of the new Legislature.
\
As legislators and Gov. Tommy Thompson begin to chart the 1997-'99 state budget, they're going to have to find some aspirin for a red-eyed state treasury.
\
With $1.2 billion in state taxes funneled into schools to control local property taxes in the last two years, and with $610 million more needed to accomplish the same goal in the next two years, the state budget that must pass by July 1 will be painful.
\
How painful?
\
Well, estimates of the amount of spending cuts or a combination of cuts and increases in fees or taxes needed to balance the budget by mid-1999 range from $400 million to $700 million.
\
Assembly Democratic Leader Walter Kunicki, of Milwaukee, said the financial picture may even force Republicans, who control the Assembly and governor's office, to work more closely with Democrats this year than they did in the last two years.
\
""Fiscally, (Republicans) are in a corner, and if I'm the governor, I want bipartisan support,"" Kunicki said. ""When you're in a jam, you want all the help you can get.""
\
By law, the state budget must be balanced. But how to balance it is a question that will absorb the governor and Legislature during the next six months.
\
""The budget will be overwhelming, at least during the first half of the year,"" said Assembly Speaker-elect Ben Brancel (R-Endeavor).
\
The budget, and the thousands of details in it, will dominate everything else, added Democratic Senate Leader Charles Chvala, of Madison.
\
Thompson and his top deputy, state Administration Secretary Mark Bugher, acknowledge that the potential budget shortfall or ""pinch,"" to use Bugher's term is more than $500 million.
\
For comparison purposes, $570 million is what would be raised if the 5% state sales tax were raised to 6% a tax increase that will not occur under any circumstances, Thompson and Bugher promise.
\
Bugher promised the budget that Thompson will present to the Legislature in a few weeks will include no increases in the sales tax or personal or corporate income taxes. And Thompson has made it clear that he will veto any such increase passed by the Legislature.
\
The governor also is unlikely to propose any increase in the state's 23.7 cents-per-gallon gasoline tax or other vehicle fees as he has in the past to provide much-needed additional revenue for transportation, Bugher added.
\
In addition to waiting for and responding to the governor's budget recommendations, legislators also will be consumed by a number of other tough issues in the upcoming session. Those include:
\
Transportation: One of the most hotly debated issues will be transportation funding, which will trigger the highways vs. mass transit fight in Milwaukee.
\
""We want to make sure transportation programs are efficient and then argue what extra revenues are needed,"" said Brancel, who has endorsed a gas-tax increase of 2 or 3 cents a gallon.
\
Republican Rep. Scott Jensen, who becomes co-chairman of the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee on Monday, said it is ""far too early to talk about gas tax increases.""
\
The issue was so controversial in 1995 that it split Assembly Republicans in a way that blocked any tax increase. The state Department of Transportation then delayed dozens of highway projects statewide.
\
Chvala said he is unlikely to propose raising any transportation taxes, if the governor does not do so first. ""The governor would have to take a leadership role,"" Chvala said.
\
Prisons: The state's bursting-at-the-seams prison system will be another tough budget issue legislators will deal with this session, forcing lawmakers to attempt to balance the need for public safety against the reality of growing costs, Brancel said.
\
""It's a case where we're spending too much and not spending enough, depending on how you look at it,"" he said.
\
But adding 4,000 to 5,000 new prison beds which experts warn will be needed will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, he said.
\
Still, Jensen said, ""ensuring the safety of the public is an essential service of state government, and state government has to focus on its core business, which is increasingly becoming prisons, schools and roads.""
\
Senate Republican Leader Michael Ellis, of Neenah, has a bolder idea: He wants state vocational-technical colleges to open what amount to ""mini-campuses"" at each prison, so every inmate has trade skills that lead to a job when they are released.
\
""We can't keep building prisons, and leave other reforms unattended,"" Ellis said. ""We need to reduce recidivism.""
\
Welfare reform: A central part of Thompson's budget will be refining the ""Wisconsin Works"" program, or W-2, the welfare-reform plan scheduled to start in September that will replace traditional welfare benefits with a work requirement.
\
Chvala said major support systems required to make W-2 work including education, job training, child care and transportation will require the Legislature's attention.
\
Kunicki said Assembly Democrats will try to make changes to W-2 this year to fix up what many of them believe is a flawed and underfunded program. ""A lot of questions about W-2 remain unanswered,"" he said.
\
But Thompson and other Republicans say any plan as bold as W-2 will require modifications.
\
""We're wiping out 60 years of history, and we're likely to find some flaws in the plan,"" Jensen said. ""But the significant improvements to W-2, like adding more money for child care, have already been proposed by the governor.""
\
Ellis said transportation and W-2 go hand-in-hand. W-2 won't work if welfare recipients can't get from where they live to where there are jobs, said Ellis. He called for new ""socialized mobility"" programs to make sure those commutes will occur.
\
Gambling: There is likely to be considerable rhetoric but little action on gambling issues this session, including the renegotiation of Indian gaming compacts and a proposal to repeal the state lottery, leaders said.
\
""The compacts will be an issue, but the governor pretty much has unilateral authority,"" Kunicki said. ""And I think the lottery still has a lot of popular support.""
\
Chvala and Brancel said the Legislature is very unlikely to grab back the exclusive authority it gave the governor to negotiate new agreements with tribes over casinos, although Attorney General Jim Doyle has urged legislators to do so.
\
Thompson and the Legislature must also try again to find a legal way to get lottery profits to homeowners. A $100-per-home tax break scheduled to be paid weeks ago was wiped out after a judge ruled that it would illegally have gone only to resident homeowners.
\
Gay marriages: After a judge ruled that Hawaii's state constitution allows gay marriages, some liberal Democrats have said they will propose legislation to legalize gay marriages in Wisconsin. But leaders of both parties say that bill will not be approved.
\
""Our house will easily pass legislation defining marriage as a contract between a man and a woman,"" said Jensen.
\
Environment: Chvala and other Democrats promise to try to pass a bill for a mining moratorium to block the plan of an Exxon subsidiary to open a mine near Crandon. The state environmental agency is now researching whether to issue a permit for the mine.
\
Chvala also said he will push a bill to re-create the state Office of Public Intervenor, which independently monitored environmental issues and sued polluters, until Republican legislators all but killed the office in 1995.
\
Land use: Brancel, a farmer, strongly believes that land use planning is a subject the Legislature must get involved in soon.
\
As development continues to chew up suburban farmland and weaken the tax base of large cities, some type of new land-use law is also a priority of Bugher.
\
Also set to come before the Legislature this session are recommendations from the Department of Revenue on how to implement a controversial new law that cuts the taxable value of farmland, if the law survives a state Supreme Court challenge.

GAMBLING
\
This serious problem needs more attention
\
I applaud the article on compulsive gamblers (""Compulsive gambling fuels criminal habits,"" May 9). Compulsive gambling is 40 years behind alcohol in public awareness. I, too, started gambling at Potawatomi Bingo Casino in Milwaukee and retired to Keshena in 1999, where I continued to gamble at the Menominee casino.
\
This is not to bash casinos. Most people can and do gamble responsibly. However, for the compulsive gambler, it destroys our lives.
\
I ""borrowed"" money from my employer to feed my gambling addiction. I worked for 45 years to end up broke and spent one year in the Huber work release center in Shawano. This is not how I planned retirement.
\
Gambling is a serious problem for many seniors. Again, thank you for bringing this problem out in the open.
\
Patricia Brunker
\
Keshena
\
Don't expect sympathy from our lawmakers
\
What a surprise to find that there are people who have a gambling problem. However, don't expect our governor or Legislature to do anything about it. Through the governor's deals with the casinos, they will expand more, as he has found them to be a golden goose, providing money!
\
Do you have a problem with an addiction to gambling? Just go to the ATM in the casino to get yourself more money and notice the fliers sitting there, telling people where they can go to stop themselves from going to the ATM to get more money to further the habit.
\
Let's face it. Allowing gambling is an easy way for the state to get money for programs it wants to keep going, including the ones to make people stop doing what it is making it possible for them to do.
\
Rose Marie Reynolds
\
Waupaca
\
Such problems shouldn't come as a surprise
\
I found the May 9 article regarding the problems with in-state gambling rather troubling. I wrote a letter to the editor in 1998, prior to the Potawatomi Bingo Casino opening, that was printed in the Journal Sentinel's editorial section. This letter despised the city for allowing the Potawatomi to build, and it described the problems that come with gambling.
\
It's unfortunate that we knew this was coming and very little was done to stop it.

\
WAGES
\
Raising the minimum not in state's best interest
\
Why are lawmakers proposing to raise the minimum wage to only $6.50 per hour? Why not $650 per hour? (""Doyle, GOP agree on wage increase,"" May 12)
\
Because unemployment goes up when it's more expensive to hire people. This is obvious with a ridiculously high minimum wage. After all, how many people would one hire if one had to pay each of them $650 per hour?
\
What's less obvious is that the same principle is still subtly in effect even at $6.50 per hour.
\
Given Wisconsin's already high unemployment rate, it is not in our best interest to raise the minimum wage. Better to make $5.15 than $0.

\
GAS PRICES
\
Bush energy policies are not the real issue
\
While I appreciated the May 8 articles on ""Pump pain,"" I take exception to a few of the issues raised by Brett Hulsey (""Bush energy plan is nothing more than highway robbery,"" Crossroads).
\
To blame the Bush administration for our current overconsumption of fuel is misguided logic at best. While President Bush's energy policies may not be the best, let's not argue them because they are not the issue. To rely on the government to institute fuel economy standards and blame it for higher prices is like blaming McDonald's because I eat too many cheeseburgers. Oh, that's already been done.
\
The reality is the American consumer has to become accountable. There have been fuel-efficient autos out for 20-plus years now. People have chosen not to buy them. There are diesel autos that average 48 miles per gallon and run cleanly.
\
Don't blame the government when people buy gas guzzlers because fuel is inexpensive. Blame the consumer who ignores the fact that gasoline isn't a renewable resource. America has known for years that this was coming, and to blame the government is utterly irresponsible.
\
While Hulsey may have a legitimate axe to grind with the Bush administration on other ecological policies, this isn't one of them.

\
We need to separate oil fiction from reality
\
In the movies, oil gushes from a wildcat hole on a rundown Texas ranch, giving new hope and wealth to some hard-working family. Everyone goes home happy. In real life, living on a world-class oil field is no blessing. Just ask the Iraqis, whose lives, families and homes have been destroyed beyond hope. They won't even be remembered once corporate America establishes full ownership of Iraq.
\
In real life, being the oil-addicted nation forced to wage war is no fun, either. Largely reacting to disrespectful corporate behavior in the Middle East, a virulent anti-Western religious mood has taken root and Americans are the hapless targets. To deter terrorism and keep oil flowing in a ""democratic"" manner, America had to invade Iraq, at great cost.
\
In reality, petrol-burning cars are nuisances. They pollute; they are too heavy and fast, causing needless death; and they are indirectly responsible for a variety of social and physical ills, such as obesity and family disintegration.
\
The price of gas at the pump does not include the cost of human lives, health hazards, social problems or America's tarnished world reputation. Therefore, it is fiction. Like in the movies.
\
Anthony C. Jaszewski

\
Readers deserve a more thoughtful discussion
\
I was enticed by the May 8 headline ""Pain at the pump."" I thought I finally would get the lowdown on who is driving up gas prices. The teaser on the front page read, ""What's behind the soaring gas prices at the pump.""
\
Instead of an objective expos on what drives the oil industry, I was served not one but two plates full of the environmentalist agenda. Two articles came to the same conclusion that we should curb our oil consumption. This is true; I walk to work whenever possible to save on gas. To my disappointment, little was said about the forces at work.
\
I think that using this difficult time in the American economy to exploit public opinion is unethical. We all have personal responsibility to the environment, but we still need to hold business and public officials accountable to fair practices. By focusing on vehicle maintenance and ignoring other factors, the writers have said nothing more than the line from the Wizard of Oz: ""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.""
\
Konrad Koch
\
Germantown
\
Time for some new strategies
\
Wisconsin is particularly vulnerable to increasing gas prices because we have no energy resources in the state. Yet there are several easy strategies easy technically, but probably not politically that would reduce energy consumption and thus costs.
\
Ethanol is one idea being pushed in Wisconsin. However, it takes more than one gallon of gas or diesel fuel to produce one gallon of ethanol. A better strategy is to give farmers 5 cents a bushel and urge them to grow less!
\
We could also take gradual steps in metro areas by placing a small ""impact"" tax on each parking space in the city centers. This tax money could be used to subsidize existing bus service and implement an expanded program of car pooling.
\
Another idea is to start diverting gas tax money to mass transit. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation receives all gas tax money now but is primarily interested in building more freeways. A separate agency is needed to administer public transit projects that would not have the conflict of interest inherent in the Department of Transportation. Creating a Department of Public Transportation would go a long way toward getting efficient mass transportation.
\
If these steps were taken, the demand for fuel in Wisconsin would drop significantly. Since the oil market is highly sensitive to demand, the price of gas would drop.

290,"After watching their parties install historically big majorities Tuesday, Republican leaders of the state Assembly and Senate pledged to pursue an ambitious conservative agenda while also diverging on key issues for the upcoming legislative session.\Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald outlined their priorities for the upcoming 2017-18 session, agreeing to consider toll roads to boost transportation funding and a breakup of the state Department of Natural Resources into smaller agencies.\But the two also were notably apart on key issues like how to fund school districts and the University of Wisconsin System for the two years starting July 1 and the possibility of medical marijuana being legalized in Wisconsin.\The GOP now controls the executive and legislative branches of state and federal government for the first time in nearly five decades, and Republicans now hold near-unprecedented majorities in the Capitol, with a 64-35 seat majority in the Assembly - the largest since 1957 - and 20-13 in the Senate - the biggest since 1971.\Assembly leaders and Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, on Tuesday were optimistic about the prospect of President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress devolving government functions back to the states.\""We're obviously excited about the prospects of more power being distributed or devolved back to the states,"" said Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna. ""That's something that we look forward to.""\Vos, R-Rochester, also said he plans to do a better job of ensuring broad public support exists for controversial proposals - like allowing concealed carry permit holders to bring weapons to college campuses - before the bills hit the floor.\Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, said the pledge was welcome news but expressed skepticism all legislation would be passed with more public support given the way Republicans have pushed significant changes through in the past.\""I think it would be fantastic,"" said Barca. ""If they hold true to their commitment.""\Vos' pledge comes as the GOP has kept its control of state government for six years, during which lawmakers have passed a number of sweeping changes - notably Gov. Scott Walker's signature law known as Act 10, which all but eliminated collective bargaining for most public employees and enacting a right-to-work law.\Barca said ""if history is any guide,"" Republican lawmakers are not talking about the biggest measures they will pass this session.\Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, called for increased education funding and policies to strengthen the middle class.\Campus carry\Vos' pledge for more transparency and to find broad public support for legislation came when asked by reporters on Tuesday whether he supports controversial legislation that would allow concealed carry permit holders to bring weapons to college campuses.\""I think it's incumbent upon the legislators who have an idea to spread across the state, find people to support it, get groundswells of support to bring an idea here, not just convince a bunch of people in our caucus to pass a bill without making sure the public is where we are,"" said Vos on Tuesday.\Fitzgerald said GOP senators would ""take a look at"" campus carry legislation but was noncommittal about its odds of passage. Vos said he's open to the idea, but that the caucus hasn't discussed it.\Rep. Jesse Kremer, R-Kewaskum, introduced the bill last legislative session but it failed to get a hearing and drew significant opposition from college students and faculty. The Republican lawmaker has said he would like to bring the proposal back, prompting opposition on the UW-Madison campus. On Tuesday, Kremer said it was not his first priority.\""This bill itself - campus carry - isn't something I've even been promoting the last few weeks,"" Kremer said. ""It's something UW has been doing a great job of promoting for me."" Kremer said if the legislation comes forward this session he will make sure he has enough support, but that members of his caucus are already discussing other bills related to the Second Amendment. Kremer noted that the previous piece of legislation addressing concealed carry on college campuses ""went through the Speaker's office."" He said he had supporters ready to testify on the bill, but a hearing was not scheduled.\School funding\Also Tuesday, to reporters and in a speech to the Assembly, Vos said a top priority for the upcoming session is to revise the way the state funds school districts. But Fitzgerald said such an effort wouldn't be successful.\""The age-old discussion around here has been trying to change the school aid formula,"" said Fitzgerald. ""But because that doesn't seem like something that is going to happen - the reality of getting that piece of legislation through either house, I think, would be very difficult.""\Vos said because more than half of school districts are experiencing losses in enrollment, the current way the state sends schools money - on a per pupil basis - isn't working.\He said he plans to convene a committee to look at ways to change school funding but didn't commit to the change taking place this legislative session.\""We just need to step back and not rush into a quick solution,"" said Vos.\State Superintendent Tony Evers has proposed several times to revise the state's funding formula, also in part to address declining enrollment and school districts' finances, but Republicans have rejected his proposal. Evers said he looks forward to the work.\""It's very difficult to make changes - fundamental changes - in the funding system during a budget and having some time to think through some good ideas is appropriate and I agree with him,"" Evers said.\Transportation funding\Fitzgerald expressed skepticism at the odds of passing a gas-tax increase in the Senate - an option Vos has stressed should be on the table to resolve the state's transportation-funding shortfall.\""Gas tax, I just don't have a handle on that right now, whether or not that's palatable,"" Fitzgerald said. ""I certainly have an idea that the caucus is somewhat divided on that.""\Walker has said any tax increase would need to be offset by a tax cut of equal size elsewhere in the budget.\Fitzgerald said Tuesday ""that seems to be the model"" for any plan to boost transportation fees and taxes in the upcoming session. He added that implementing toll roads - the subject of a recent Department of Transportation study - should be considered as a long-term option.\Vos previously indicated he would consider that option as well.\Medical marijuana\Vos also said on Tuesday he isn't personally opposed to legalizing medical marijuana, but that his caucus is instead focused on passing ""right-to-try"" legislation, which would allow people with terminal illnesses to gain access to experimental drugs and getting Senate approval for a bill that would allow parents to purchase CBD oil, a marijuana extract, to treat epileptic children with limited options for treatment.\Fitzgerald said lawmakers in the Senate may have found compromise in passing a bill allowing use of CBD oil, but also said he's not eager to consider legalizing medical marijuana.\""I wouldn't support it right now,"" Fitzgerald said, adding that he has ""no idea where (GOP senators) would be"" on the issue.\Breaking up the DNR\Vos and Fitzgerald both said they are open to the idea of breaking up the DNR, spreading oversight of parks, forestry, environmental, hunting and fishing programs among three existing agencies and two new ones.\""If the idea is to make sure we have a more responsive agency in a way that does not harm the environment, I think it's worth looking at,"" Vos said.\Credit: MOLLY BECK and MARK SOMMERHAUSER Wisconsin State Journal"
291,"Incumbent Republican Mike Rohrkaste is facing a challenge from political newcomer Dan Schierl, a Democrat.\Rohrkaste, 60, of Neenah, was first elected to the Assembly seat in 2014 after a long career as a human resources administrator. He was reelected two years later. He's a member of the Joint Finance Committee.\Schierl, 64, of Clayton, is a retiree who said he has entered the race to try to take some of the partisan bickering out of state politics.\The 55th Assembly District includes Neenah, Clayton, Greenville, Grand Chute and Fox Crossing.\USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin asked both candidates to respond to a questionnaire. Answers were limited to 100 words.\1. In what way should Wisconsin improve its funding of road construction and repairs?\Rohrkaste: Since most road revenues are from a cents-per-gallon gas tax and given that cars continue to become more fuel efficient (hybrids, electrics and better combustion engines), we need a reliable long-term funding solution to address new road construction and maintenance needs.\We need to evaluate the best option to increase road funding revenue sources and continue to limit borrowing beyond our ability to cover the required debt service.\Schierl: As a government, we should work together to figure out ways to fund our roads. An idea might be to use the gas indexing that was abandoned many years ago.\Maybe we prioritize our roads and only repair roads and not start new projects. But whatever we do we must stop borrowing to fix our roads. I cannot be a long solution.\2. Should Act 10 be partially or fully repealed. Why or why not?\Rohrkaste: Act 10 gave local school boards and governments more control over budgets that prior to Act 10 were causing significant increases to property taxes without taxpayer approval. Last session, we provided $636 million of additional state funding to public schools and increased the limits on ""low spending"" school district's ability to raise property taxes for education needs without a referendum, which will help the Neenah district.\Act 10 should continue as most people have supported its results in keeping property taxes from growing at unsustainable rates.\Schierl: Act 10 was a direct attack against our state employees. If the state felt it was paying the public sector too much it should have negotiated contracts that the state previously had approved. Just making Act 10 law was not a good thing for our district or our state.\3. What specific steps should the state take to ensure that it has an adequately skilled and prepared workforce?\Rohrkaste: There are two areas to address: we need to continue to recruit people to move to Wisconsin, and we need to expand opportunities for people at all levels to go into high-demand fields like health care, engineering, welding and others.\We need increased funding to attract people from border states, veterans and Wisconsin college graduates currently not living here to join our workforce and raise their families here.\For the second, we need to work with employers and the four-year, technical and K-12 schools to expand apprenticeship programs, internships and other job-training programs that ensure everyone has the right education and skills to secure good-paying careers.\Schierl: I think we should be talking more about tech institutions and make those jobs attractive to those seeking good-paying and skilled jobs.\We need to make funding available or find ways to make college and tech institutions affordable to all people of economics. Without a higher education, all economic levels will suffer and will make it harder to be successful in life.\4. Is Foxconn a good deal for Wisconsin. Why or why not?\Rohrkaste: Foxconn is a game-changer; it brings a new industry that is developing screens for televisions, healthcare, autos and other industries. The state incentives are only awarded after documented capital investment, up to $10 billion, and hiring up to 13,000 employees.\Foxconn has exceeded expectations by purchasing a headquarters building in Milwaukee, starting technology centers in Green Bay and Eau Claire, and donating $100 million to UW-Madison.\Foxconn construction has already impacted the Fox Cities with contracts awarded to Boldt Company, Neenah Foundry and Werner Electric.\Schierl: Foxconn is a bad deal for Wisconsin residents. I do not approve of giving them taxpayer money for a private industry with a track record not proven.\And technology changes so fast, what will happen if their industry is not viable in the future? I do not think we as a state should be providing welfare to a company with a bad track record for the environment. This project was rushed through with little thought or discussion.\5. Would you support legislation ending the so-called ""dark stores"" loophole that allows stores to pay taxes on their properties equivalent to those of a comparably-sized but vacant building?\Rohrkaste: Yes, I would support a solution to this issue, and we worked toward one in the Assembly last session. We need a better balance of property tax distribution between homeowners and businesses that have used this tax strategy.\Currently I believe too much burden is being placed on the homeowners and counties.\Schierl: I will not support this as I call it corporate welfare. When is enough we give to private industry on the backs of working people of Wisconsin?\6. Would you support changing state law to legalize marijuana and/or cannabis products? If so, under what conditions? If not, why?\Rohrkaste: Certain cannabis products have shown medical benefits, which is why we legalized CBD oil last session.\I support continued research and evaluation of expanding cannabis products for regulated medical use. Through discussions with mental health care professionals and reading studies about marijuana's use, I am concerned about how it can lead to other addictions like opioids, limit brain development in youth, and impair safe driving and work practices.\I would not support legalizing recreational usage.\Schierl: I support legalization of medical cannabis and also strongly feel we should be looking at full legalization for a tax revenue and also I do not think we should be giving a green light for big pharm to make synthetic cannabis and charging outrageous prices like they do on all of their drugs.\And cannabis is a natural plant with no man-made chemicals. Legalization also will create small businesses throughout the state, which would be good for our economy.\7. Why are you running for office?\Rohrkaste: I'm running to continue serving the residents of the district. I will build off my HR experience and legislative successes to continue addressing family health care needs around cost and access, and to better improve services for dementia and mental health.\I want to continue the positive climate of opportunity in the state that has led to record levels of employment and a balanced state budget with over $200 million in reserves.\We can now make new investments in education that better prepare our kids for tomorrow's workforce, improve our infrastructure, and provide tax relief for Wisconsin families.\Schierl: I am running for office because I know in Wisconsin we can do better and felt our current administration has failed the people of this state in favor of corporations over people. There must be some balance with industry and workers.\We need both to be a great state again. If you make the work environment good in Wisconsin then the jobs will come. I also believe in a clean environment and would love to see Wisconsin go greener energy for our future generations.\8. What makes you the better candidate in this race?\Rohrkaste: I've achieved results with problem-solving legislation and state budget amendments. My HR career and community service help me address needs in workforce training, mental and physical health, and the future needs of Wisconsin.\I've built positive relationships with legislators from both parties, legislative houses and advocacy groups that can turn good policy into law.\Schierl: My ideas are not partisan issues. These are issues we should be sitting down with and both parties need to be involved in long-term solutions. Big dark money in our politics has created problems with representation. I feel we do not have representation that will listen to the people and I am not doing this for money.\I feel we need to end Citizens United, which allowed big money in our system This has caused many problems we see today in Wisconsin and throughout the country.\9. What are district residents telling you are their most important issues, and how would you address them?\Rohrkaste: The two most frequent comments are health care and the shortage of workers given record-low unemployment levels.\For health care I will continue finding better methods to improve outcomes at lower costs, particularly through wellness, early diagnosis and better access to health care providers.\For the worker shortage, I would invest more funding into attracting workers to Wisconsin and for training workers to be able to fill high-demand jobs in manufacturing, health care, etc. This would include additional educational grants to students who are going into high-demand job fields.\Schierl: Money in politics, health care, which some do not even have anymore, funding for our schools, even to the college levels.\I ask them why we are not talking about these issues and I promised them I would bring them up and would talk to all parties and find real solutions to long-term problems we all face.\Some things should not be for profit. Health care, schools, prisons, roads, police and fire protection, and almost all I talk to agree with me on these subjects.\10. What is something positive you could say about your opponent?\Rohrkaste: During my door-to-door campaigning I've heard he has worked hard to take his message and platform to voters by also going door-to-door in the district and has done so in a positive manner.\Schierl: My opponent is a really nice guy to talk to and he always calls back if I have a question or need an answer. But his policies are not mine and that is why I challenged him in this election.\Mike Rohrkaste, left, s facing a challenge from Dan Schierl in the 55th Assembly District.\Submitted"
292," If it seemed strange last week to read aboutglobal warming talks in Kyoto, Japan, and then go out and shovel the snow off your sidewalk, you are not alone.\ Yet what happened in Kyoto last week will eventually make a difference in our everyday lives here in Wisconsin. Exactly what kind of difference? It depends on whom you talk to.\ Environmentalists and others who applaud the Kyoto accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- the main culprits in trapping excess warmth in our atmosphere -- say the agreement will have a noticeable beneficial impact on Wisconsin life. The Sierra Club released a report last week in which it said that cutting down on emissions as agreed upon in Kyoto will reduce killer heat waves (like the one that killed more than 700 people across the Midwest two years ago), help clean up air pollution, and lessen damage to forests and agricultural crops.\ Others, however, argue that the Kyoto accord's call for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2010 will be costly, especially in states like Wisconsin that rely so heavily on coal for generating electricity. This view is heard often from business groups, especially corporations involved in the production of carbon-producing fuels like oil.\ There is, for example, a report released last week by Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates. Commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute, the report says that paying for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will require a fuel tax that could cost as many as 66,400 jobs in Wisconsin, drive down wages in the state by 3.2 percent, and increase dramatically the amount residents here pay for home heating oil, natural gas, electricity, and motor gas. Environmentalists disagree and label such reports as little more than scare tactics from profit-hungry corporations.\ ""All those dire predictions are false,"" said Brett Hulsey, Midwest representative for the Sierra Club.\ Such disagreements run deep on this issue. They start with long-running quarrels over whether global warming is evena problem. Climate scientists who warn of global warming base their predictions on complicated computer models of the climate in the future. There is no dispute that humans have increased the buildup of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons -- by burning more and more fossil fuels over the years. Nor is there much dispute about the heat-trapping properties of these gases.\ The dispute lies in discerning the impact of this trapped heat. Proponents of the global warming theory argue that, unless we slow greenhouse gas emissions, we will see noticeable changes in the next decade in everything from average global temperatures to sea levels and precipitation.\ A report from the federal Environmental Protection Agency listed these specific impacts on Wisconsin: An increase in the average temperature by about 4 degrees Fahrenheit in winter, spring, and fall, and by somewhat less in summer.\ An increase in precipitation by about 15 to 20 percent in winter, summer, and fall.\ An increase in the frequency of extreme hot days in summer. Higher temperatures and the increased frequency of heat waves could raise the number of heat-related deaths and the incidence of heat-related illnesses. In Milwaukee, one study projects, a 3-degree Fahrenheit warming could almost double heat-related deaths during a typical summer; the elderly, especially those living alone, would be at particular risk.\ Skeptics question the science behind such dire predictions. They quarrel particularly with estimates of temperature increases, which they say are based almost completely on unreliable computer models.\ ""It's all based on uncertain science,"" said Pat Stevens, a specialist in environmental issues for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce.\ But the dramatic meeting in Kyoto seems to have moved the global warming debate beyond science. Now, instead of spending time debating the science, people on both sides of the issue are talking more about how to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and what such cutbacks will mean to the average person.\ Stevens points out, first of all, that the Kyoto accord is by no means a done deal. It still has to be approved by Congress, he said. And Congress, Stevens said, might be dubious about giving developing nations an edge by requiring them to make lower reductions, as the agreement does.\ ""What you don't do in light of the uncertainty over the science,"" Stevens said, ""is put the U.S. at a disadvantage to developing nations.""\ The real differences arise when the talk turns to specific methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\ Everybody agrees that the only way to do it is to cut back on the use of fossil-producing fuels. Wisconsin uses a lot. According to the state Department of Natural Resources, fossil fuel consumption -- transportation and electric utilities consume the most -- produced 89 percent of the state's greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. By 2010, according to the agency, that figure will have climbedto 90 percent.\ The business lobby, much in evidence at Kyoto, argues that the only way to reduce energy consumption is to impose taxes on the fuels that cause greenhouse gas emissions -- coal and oil, for example. For consumers, this would most likely mean a gas tax that would show up, say, on the gas pump down at the convenience store. The theory is that the more expensive it becomes to drive, the less we drive.\ But imposition of such a tax, Stevens said, would cause all sorts of economic problems, from the loss of jobs at manufacturing plants strapped for energy costs to increased government costs.\ ""Once you get to that point,"" Stevens said, ""name your impact."" But others say reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished for little or no money simply by encouraging energy efficiency by both individuals and businesses.\ In a report due out soon from the DNR, climate change specialist Eric Moser writes that Wisconsin can come very close to reducing its greenhouse gas emissionsto the required levels by encouraging more efficient use of electricity -- by finding ways to get individuals to do things like replace their electric water heater with a natural gas water heater, or by throwing out that old second refrigerator in the basement.\ ""We can make significant reductions,"" Moser said, ""at really no cost.""\ The best thing about all of this, said the Sierra Club's Hulsey, is that such measures make sense whether or not you believe that global warming is a problem. ""There's a whole bunch of other reasons for us to do the right thing,"" Hulsey said."

Vote for Nader isn't a waste
\
I'm voting for Ralph Nader. I'm not ""throwing away"" my vote. I would be if I were to vote for someone I didn't believe in.
\
Whether the Republicans or Democrats win the presidency, the party in power will continue a reckless use of the Earth's resources in the interests of a growing economy and ""prosperity."" We need foresight, and to actually budget and nurture our natural resources.
\
I also feel that no matter who wins, George W. Bush or Al Gore, each will do a poor job as president and will not have a strong mandate. The thought of either representing the United States in the world arena embarrasses me. So we will have much stronger third party support in the next presidential election.
\
Finally, the press and other media seem to support the status quo. They've been covering Gore and Bush as if there were no other candidates or options.
\
I believe that by supporting the status quo, they support the greatest good for the greatest number -- but we must acknowledge the greatest number now includes all the people of the world and future generations.

Christians shouldn't vote for Gore, Kohl
\
Catholics and other Christians should not vote for Al Gore, Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl.
\
Their special-interest paid TV ads tell us they care about your children's welfare. But all three of them support partial-birth abortion, which is parents killing their sons and daughters. Could there be anything less caring for children?
\
These candidates are against prayer in school, against school choice -- except for their own kids -- and against more take-home pay for wage earners.
\
Gore has been lecturing us with the same stuff as he did in 1992 and 1996. What has he been doing for eight years, besides raising the gas tax and voting for taxing Social Security benefits?
\
Kohl has had 12 years in office. Where has he been? No one sees or hears from him, except prior to each election. He should step aside and resign so that our beliefs can be represented.
\
It's time for Catholics and Christians to vote for passionate conservatives who truly believe in you and me.

Nader will tell the truth
\
""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" So spoke Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of America's greatest Democratic presidents.
\
How ironic that, nearly 70 years later, Democrats are encouraging us to vote our fears; to cast an anti-Bush vote for Al Gore rather than a pro-democracy vote for Ralph Nader.
\
Afraid of an ultraconservative Supreme Court? The Democrats say they are, but in 1986, every Democratic senator voted to confirm Antonin Scalia, the most conservative justice now sitting on the Supreme Court.
\
Not one Democrat challenged Scalia's nomination. The Senate record states, ""No arguments were voiced in opposition to the nomination (of Scalia)."" Among those voting to confirm Scalia was then-Tennessee Sen. Gore.
\
If you want democracy, justice and a president who tells the whole truth and not just that part of the truth that makes him look good, vote Nader for president on Nov. 7.

Bush, Yankees have lots in common
\
George W. Bush may have once owned a piece of the Texas Rangers, but after seeing the Oct. 17 debate and baseball game, I've realized that W. is a lot more like the Yankees.
\
Both spend more money than anyone else.
\
Both have inherited expectations of an easy victory.
\
Both are slightly favored to win at the moment.
\
Both are morally reprehensible -- Bush for his opposition to gun control and the Yankees for George Steinbrenner.
\
Both wear navy blue pinstripe suits.

GOP did nothing in last eight years
\
The last eight years have been amazing. We're on an upward spiral and could have done even better had the Republican Congress spent less time and money pointing fingers and more time doing its job. Had Republican congressmen cooperated one iota with the president, a good health care system would already be in place.
\
A focus group member watching the debates said that George W. Bush gave simple answers to questions about foreign policy. Well, there are no simple answers. This is an extremely tough issue, as are Social Security, health care, education, safety and the environment. Our new president better be ready with the knowledge to address these issues.
\
The state of Texas is in deplorable shape. The judicial system is flawed. The education, environment and health systems are substandard.
\
Bush has never dealt with a foreign policy issue. The Republicans wasted eight years of our tax dollars doing nothing. Why is Bush even considered presidential material? Now, that's going to take more than a simple answer.

Bush abandoned statesmanship
\
On the day after the Middle East situation broke, I was most appreciative of George W. Bush saying we must ""speak with one voice.""

Good economy due to Clinton-Gore
\
Of the two candidates, Al Gore will continue the plan followed over the last eight years.
\
The Republicans told us that the Clinton-Gore budget would plunge the country into debt, raise interest rates and inflation and ruin our economy. They repeated this lie so often and loudly that the American voters threw out many Democratic incumbents in 1994.
\
Republicans were not, however, able to overturn the Clinton-Gore economic plan. A good thing, because the plan worked exactly as Clinton-Gore said it would. America went from huge debt to surplus; from high interest rates and inflation to low; and from high unemployment to our lowest rates in 30 years.
\
Bankruptcy rates dropped, poverty rates fell to their lowest levels in more than 30 years, real income rose and the cost of government, as a percentage of the GDP, dropped to its lowest level in more than 50 years.
\
The Bush economic program promises big tax cuts for the wealthy and tiny tax cuts for most people, but a tax cut for all. However, this plan is exactly what we got from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan-Bush ""trickle-down"" economics.
\
Results? Massive debt, two recessions, unemployment, inflation and lower real wages overcome by inflation and interest rates.
\
Why go back to that?

Maybe Bush needs remedial courses
\
If George W. Bush cannot coherently and intelligently stand up to Al Gore in a friendly town hall debate, how can we rely on him to coherently and intelligently stand up to and negotiate with other world leaders?
\
When he evades their questions, smirks inappropriately and sits back making clown-like gestures and facial expressions while his opponent is speaking, are we going to say, ""Oh poor George, that Arafat is such a bully""?
\
When hit with hard questions from foreign leaders, will slow- thinking George hem, haw and eventually sputter out an evasive, grammatically incorrect, less than cohesive answer or will he simply sit there dumbfounded, roll his eyes and rely on Dick Cheney to bail him out?
\
What will poor little George do when a memorized speech is not appropriate and a TelePrompTer is not on hand?
\
Many seem willing to dismiss Bush's inability to think on his feet and express himself in a grammatically correct manner. I, for one, find this an inexcusable flaw for the most powerful leader of the free world.
\
It seems a bit hypocritical for one so lacking in linguistic skills to profess to be an expert on how to improve our educational system. Perhaps Bush should go back to school and master the English language before attempting to tackle the position of America's chief spokesperson.

Gore put politics over national security
\
In the third debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush, I was wishing I could be there. I would have asked the vice president to explain why, in 1996, he pressured the Immigration and Naturalization Service to make sure aliens were naturalized speedily without being qualified.
\
This infamous voter mill produced 75,000 voters who had arrest records, 115,000 whose fingerprints were unclassified and another 61,000 who were given citizenship without being fingerprinted. The FBI was sent a list of 100 of these new citizens who had committed heinous crimes prior to naturalization, and 20% were arrested for serious crimes after citizenship was granted.
\
Another question I would have asked him is why he jeopardized our national security by overruling the objections of national defense analysts and arms controllers to allow the Clinton-Gore administration to send U.S. weapons technology and McDonald-Douglas machine tools related to the B-1 bomber and MX nuclear missiles to communist China.
\
I would like to hear his answers because it sure looks like crooked politics and placing politics above national security.

Gore's claims have little to do with the truth
\
In a letter to the editor, Paul Smith joins the legions of apologists across the country who have become enablers for Al Gore's serial exaggerations -- if not his outright lies -- that have seriously damaged his presidential campaign (""Thompson should know better,"" The Morning Mail, Oct. 16).
\
Smith states that Gov. Tommy Thompson ""surely . . . is aware that the vice president never claimed to have invented the Internet."" Yet, not only have the facts been confirmed repeatedly by the media, even Gore pokes fun at himself about his ""role"" in ""creating"" the Internet.
\
Smith also apparently believes the fairy tale Gore likes to share about his romance with Tipper being the basis for ""Love Story."" Again, it's not true. The author came out and said the characters were not based on the Gores.
\
It's interesting that Smith stopped at the Internet and ""Love Story."" The vice president's exaggerations and lies continue to this day: touring Texas disaster areas with Federal Emergency Management Association Director James Lee Witt, when in fact Gore was in the state for a fund raiser; claiming credit for welfare reform; and making up horror stories about drug costs for his family and his dog.
\
Perhaps if Gore were more like Thompson and more straightforward with the facts, he wouldn't find himself in this predicament. The vice president's unfortunate and frightening relationship with the truth has been well-documented by the national media, which is overwhelmingly sympathetic to him and his campaign.

Gore would deepen distrust
\
I believe that most people understand that an election is a sales pitch. Each candidate tries to make known his position on issues. The positions are fine-tuned during the campaign season to maximize his standing on election day.
\
The voter needs to investigate these positions to make a informed decision on election day. The voter needs to believe that the position stated by the candidate will be the same when the candidate assumes office.
\
When the candidate begins to lie reflexively, and even pathologically, about trivial and significant matters, it may be time to look beyond the issues to see if he is fit to hold any public office.
\
Al Gore has proven that he will lie when he needs to, and even when he doesn't. This isn't a recent development. The media is just beginning to report the multitude of lies and half-truths.
\
The American public's loss of trust in government is a vital national issue. We don't need another president to further deepen the people's cynicism.

It's difficult to see President Clinton in that role when he's visualized throughout the world with his pants around his ankles or wagging his finger and lying to the American public.
\
Perhaps the voting public should reconsider the notion that character doesn't matter -- it's the economy, stupid. People are paying with their lives in the Middle East because of a lack of strong leadership. There could be more American blood spilled before it's over.
\
Keep that in mind when deciding who to vote for president.

How can the big four -- George W. Bush, Al Gore, Dick Chaney and Joe Lieberman -- take so much time off from their jobs to run for office? Aren't we paying these individuals to do a job, or do they not have enough work to keep them busy?
\
Gore is vice president of the United States, Bush is governor of Texas and Sen. Lieberman should be on duty representing his state.

I wish I could get paid for my full-time job and be there only occasionally to actually do any work. While running for office, shouldn't the candidates be required to take leave of office with suspended salaries and duties?

If their respective offices were important enough for them to run for, should they not be there to fulfill their responsibilities?

It's not complicated; decide and vote Nov. 7
\
After reading the Sunday Symposium on The Morning Mail page of Oct. 15 -- ""Who will get your vote?"" ""Readers cast ballots for president"" -- I was amazed at how so many could say so little in so many words.
\
Here is the short and accurate version:
\
Taxes: Bush cuts more taxes, Gore pays off more debt.
\
Spending: Bush would spend $520 billion, Gore would spend $770 billion.
\
Social Security: Neither candidate's proposals will save Social Security; Gore's plan does less immediate damage.
\
Medicare: Neither of their plans helps enough people; Bush would privatize more, Gore would spend more.
\
Prescription drugs: Neither plan meets the needs of the projected number of retirees; Bush privatizes coverage, Gore puts it under Medicare.
\
Patient's bill of rights: Gore supports, Bush opposes.
\
Increase in minimum wage: Gore supports, Bush opposes.
\
Foreign policy: Gore has experience. Bush has no experience but is learning.
\
Gun control: Gore supports, Bush opposes.
\
Abortion: Gore supports, Bush opposes.
\
Leadership: Gore has higher-level experience, Bush's record in Texas is questionable.
\
Truthfulness: Gore exaggerates and makes false statements, Bush makes contrary remarks and has falsified his record and stance.
\
Military: Gore would spend more, Bush would deploy less.
\
Energy: Bush for further exploration, Gore for reducing consumption and finding alternatives.
\
Education: Bush supports vouchers, Gore opposes them.
\
Environment: Gore is a proven leader, Bush's record is suspect.
\
Economy: Both are putting too much emphasis on predicted surpluses.
\
It isn't complicated. Make up your mind and vote on Nov. 7.

294,"
I am writing in response to your Oconomowoc reader who suggested an additional tax on gas-guzzling vehicles (""Drivers of gas-guzzlers should pay special tax,"" The Morning Mail, Dec. 18). Gee, what a novel idea. If there is a problem, get the government involved, tax someone else and throw money at it. Yeah, that always works.
\
Although it appears that he gave the idea a lot of thought, the writer's rationale falls short. People with gas-guzzling vehicles already pay additional taxes for their vehicles' energy inefficiency. They use more gas and, as a result, pay more taxes due to the gas tax.
\
His suggestion also fails to take into account how much one drives. If he drives his Ford Focus twice as many miles as the person in an Expedition, doesn't he in effect pollute the environment just as much? Maybe we should have a mileage tax.
\
I used to drive a subcompact that averaged 31 miles per gallon. I had my fair share of near-collisions with semitrailer trucks and soccer mom minivans. My fuel-efficient, tree-loving vehicle was no match for the so-called gas guzzlers.
\
Did I get the government involved? No. Did I suggest a tax or ban on semis and soccer moms? Well, yeah, but not on semis. But I recognized that you can't beat soccer moms, so I bought a Toyota 4 Runner.
\
I know that my family now stands a much better chance of surviving a collision with a Ford Focus, a soccer mom or those pesky trees than it would have with my old subcompact.
\
I am more interested in child safety and health care than the environment. I think all subcompacts should have a child safety tax. They aren't as safe for children as gas guzzlers.
\
Inventions and a free market society are what made this country great. Whining and taxes only destroy what others have built.

295,"The top two candidates for governor took paths to this point as divergent as the directions they want to take Wisconsin over the next four years. \Those paths hint at what the future may bring under Republican Gov. Scott Walker or Democratic challenger Tony Evers. The candidates for governor, including four others who trail substantially in fundraising and polling, face off in the Nov. 6 election. \Walker, 50, faces what appears to be the re-election fight of his career, which began 25 years ago when he was elected to the state Assembly at age 25. Polls show the race to be close, and some have shown Evers leading. \Evers, 66, spent most of his career as a public school administrator and made few foes since 2009 serving as state superintendent. Governor would be the first partisan office Evers has held, and he says he never thought seriously, until last year, of seeking it. \Now Evers who professes to enjoy polka music and the card game euchre, and who some have likened to the TV host Mr. Rogers wants to enter the pressure cooker of the state's top office and become Wisconsin's top-ranking Democrat. Supporters say Evers beating a near-fatal bout with cancer shows his steeliness shouldn't be sold short. \""Sometimes (Democrats) and others get frustrated with me because they can't pigeonhole me. My goal is to be a pragmatist and solve things for the people of Wisconsin,"" Evers said in an interview last week. ""I'm not running for president. I have no other ambitions."" \Walker, meanwhile, says his third term as governor would be his last. Some supporters say that could free him to pursue an even more ambitious agenda than in his first two terms. \Walker, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has said his priorities the next four years would include continuing to hold the line on taxes, maintaining a tuition freeze at public colleges and universities, and bolstering the state's workforce. \""My ask is to have a third term, a final term, to finish the job off, and that is to grow the workforce,"" Walker said on WISN-AM radio last week. ""We unleashed the ability to grow in this state like we haven't grown at least in my lifetime. And we want to keep doing that."" \Observers say Evers' lack of a political pedigree could present a learning curve but also free him to buck his party and lead him to appoint state staffers on merit, not party allegiance. Another challenge for Evers would be working with a Legislature that almost certainly will be controlled, at least in part, by Republicans. \Evers says his priorities would be bolstering a state public-school system that he says faltered under Walker, ensuring access to affordable health care and fixing the state's roads and bridges.\?That's why he wants to be governor' \Evers said his desire to be governor came from chafing at the limits of what he could accomplish as state superintendent. \Amanda Brink, a Democratic operative who managed Evers' most recent bid for state superintendent in 2017, recounted an Evers interview during the 2017 campaign in which he highlighted Milwaukee public school students who move frequently and thus need extra support. \""Tony Evers, the state superintendent, can't fix that, and he knows that,"" Brink said. ""And I think that's why he wants to be governor."" \Evers began his career as a teacher and principal in Tomah schools. Then he was superintendent at Oakfield and Verona schools, followed by a stint at an Oshkosh-based cooperative that serves member school districts. He joined state government as a deputy state superintendent in 2001, then was elected to the top post in 2009 and was re-elected twice since. \Former Verona School Board President Gregg Miller, a self-described independent voter, helped hire Evers as the district's superintendent in 1988. ""Tony was very good about inclusion in decision-making,"" Miller said. ""He's not afraid to listen to other people and thoughts from other sides and incorporate that into his vision."" \Former Verona Superintendent Bill Conzemius, who worked under Evers when he led that district, became close friends with him. Conzemius said Evers, while leading a school district and later in state government, eschewed partisanship despite his own Democratic- leaning views. \""He respected and worked hard with Republicans,"" said Conzemius, a self-described political independent. ""It is, frankly, one of the reasons I'm so supportive."" \Evers' life changed drastically when he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, an often-fatal form of the disease that Evers has said he thought would kill him. Radical surgery in 2008 to remove Evers' esophagus and part of his stomach caused him to lose weight and permanently changed his eating and sleeping habits. But now he has been cancer-free for a decade. \Conzemius met with Evers, his wife Kathy and a few other close friends shortly after Evers got his cancer diagnosis. \""He was in for the battle of a lifetime and he didn't know how it was going to end up,"" Conzemius said. ""As he will tell you, it also motivated him from the standpoint of: 'We have one life to live and I was right on the edge of losing it. I'm going to finish my life advocating for what I believe in.'""\In Walker, some see ambition, others, service \A preacher's son and Harley motorcycle rider who touts his daily lunch ritual of ham sandwiches and cranberry juice, Walker is a keen political strategist and a tireless campaigner. \Since becoming governor in 2011, Walker gained national stature for confronting labor unions and winning re-election twice afterward, including as the first governor ever to survive a recall attempt in U.S. history. \Then came Walker's ill-fated run for president in 2015, which caused his home-state popularity to flounder before partially rebounding. \Most recently four of Walker's former Cabinet secretaries have stepped forward to criticize him, with three endorsing Evers and saying Walker's presidential run shifted his focus away from Wisconsin. Even now, some say it remains unclear how his post-governor plans could affect a potential third term. \Anne Genal, a family friend of Scott Walker and his wife Tonette for about 20 years, said she has long known Walker as someone anchored by religious faith and a close circle of family and friends. She bristles at suggestions during this campaign that Walker is motivated only by political ambition. \""Scott is someone who has dedicated his personal and professional life to public service, and that speaks volumes about a man's character,"" Genal said. \Genal said Walker is likely to have fresh ideas if voters give him four more years as governor. But as a person and a leader, Genal said Walker amid the ups and downs of his governorship and a White House bid hasn't really changed from the young father she met two decades ago. \""The thing about him is he really is steady,"" Genal said. ""I don't see him as fundamentally changing who he was.""\Evers' challenge: Politics \Former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who worked with Evers starting when he became deputy state superintendent, said the difference between Evers and Walker is in what motivates them. \""Scott Walker's always been trying to get to the next office,"" Doyle said. ""I've known Tony Evers for many years, and I have never seen him act out of any personal political interest. \""There won't be a lot of politically doctrinaire decisions being made,"" Doyle added. ""He'll look at a problem head-on and make a decision based on what's best for the people of Wisconsin."" \Even among top Wisconsin Republicans, it's tough to find harsh words about Evers. \""He does listen to people and is a person who tries to find the best answer,"" said state Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon, who leads the Senate Education Committee. \Scott Jensen, the former GOP Assembly Speaker who's now a lobbyist for a group supporting private school vouchers, described the state superintendent as ""pleasant and easy to work with."" He said Evers is someone who has been comfortable delegating major tasks to staffers, which contrasts with Walker, who likes to manage big initiatives more closely. \Either candidate almost certainly will work with a state Assembly led by Republicans, who are virtually assured of maintaining control of it after the election. Republicans currently control the state Senate and are favored to retain it, though Democrats hold out hope of flipping it. \For Evers, that means anything he proposes would need to be negotiated with at least one legislative chamber led by the opposing party. \""That'd be (Evers') greatest test: figuring out how to advance his agenda,"" said Bill McCoshen, a Republican lobbyist and former chief of staff to Gov. Tommy Thompson. \Ed Miller, a political scientist at UW-Stevens Point, noted a potential point of common ground might be on the state's roads and bridges, to which both Evers and GOP Assembly leaders are open to giving a revenue infusion something Walker resisted. \Jensen said Walker excels at ""communicating to people where he's trying to take the state."" He said it's unclear how, or if, Evers would use the bully pulpit of the governor's office to do the same. \""They say you campaign in poetry and govern in prose,"" Jensen said. ""I think (Evers) is having trouble shifting from his governing prose to his campaign poetry, and that's an important skill for a leader.""\Walker's dream job \The only other Wisconsin governor to serve a third four-year term, Republican Tommy Thompson, has campaigned with Walker this cycle. In a recent interview, Thompson predicted ""the third term of Walker is going to be his best term."" \""When you announce you're not going to run again, you're pretty much a free person,"" Thompson said. ""It just takes a burden off you that you have to toe any line."" \McCoshen said it's conceivable that plans to restructure state aid to local governments or further restructuring of the University of Wisconsin System could be considered. \There remains some question for Walker about another White House bid after his 2016 run grew his national following that germinated during the recall. But that doesn't look like a near-term possibility: Republican President Donald Trump is angling for re-election in 2020, and Walker recently told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he will not run in 2024. \Walker lacks personal wealth, and some expect he'd seek lucrative private-sector opportunities after leaving office. \Stephan Thompson, a GOP consultant who managed Walker's 2014 campaign, said the aftermath of Walker's presidential bid triggered his realization that ""at the end of the day, he loves being governor."" \""It's his dream job,"" Thompson said.\ON THE ISSUES\Here's a look at where Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger State Superintendent Tony Evers stand on key issues:\K-12 schools\Evers: Increase state funding for school districts by nearly $1.7 billion over the next two years, with a boost of more than $600 million for special education and fully funding 4-year-old kindergarten for all children. The plan would renew a now-defunct commitment for the state to fund two-thirds of school districts' per-pupil cost to educate students. The plan would not cause an overall property tax increase statewide, though taxes could go up in wealthier districts and down in poorer ones.\Walker: Renew a now-defunct commitment for the state to fund two-thirds of school districts' per-pupil cost to educate students, a move expected to cost at least $130 million a year. Keep pushing to freeze or lower property taxes, a key source of funding for schools and local governments.\Higher education\Evers: Continue for two years the University of Wisconsin System tuition freeze for in-state students, but unclear what would happen after that. ""Increase investments"" for the UW System and state technical colleges.\Walker: Continue the UW System tuition freeze for in-state students he implemented and has maintained since 2013. Create a new tax credit of up to $5,000 over a five-year period for college graduates who continue to live and work in Wisconsin.\Health care\Evers: Remove Wisconsin from a national coalition of states suing to overturn the federal health care law known as Obamacare. Expand Medicaid in Wisconsin under Obamacare, which would extend coverage to an estimated 80,000 low-income Wisconsinites and save the state an estimated $190 million a year by bringing more federal funds to the state.\Walker: Authorized Attorney General Brad Schimel to participate in lawsuit to overturn Obamacare. Staunchly opposed expanding Medicaid in Wisconsin under Obamacare, arguing the federal government could one day leave the state on the hook to keep funding the expansion if it cannot. Would support state legislation to help people with pre-existing conditions get health coverage if Obamacare were repealed, though the bill doesn't provide the same level of protections as Obamacare to people with serious health conditions.\Economic development\Evers: Eliminate the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. created by Walker in 2011, and move economic development functions to another agency. Criticized Walker's $3 billion subsidy package for electronics maker Foxconn to locate near Racine, saying the deal was poorly negotiated.\Walker: Created WEDC and has said it's helping fuel job growth in Wisconsin. Chief architect of the $3 billion state subsidy package for Foxconn, which he has argued will have a transformative impact on the state's economy by bringing as many as 13,000 direct jobs.\Taxes\Evers: Cut state income taxes by 10 percent for individuals making no more than $100,000 a year and families making no more than $150,000. Would pay for most of the cut by rolling back a state tax break for manufacturers and farmers by capping it at $300,000 of annual income.\Walker: Maintain the full tax break for manufacturers and farmers, which he says has aided the state's economic comeback. New tax credits for seniors to defray property tax costs, recent college graduates who stay in Wisconsin and to offset child care costs for families.\Criminal justice\Evers: Cut the state's prison population in half, though no time frame specified. Supports medical marijuana and would back legalizing marijuana for recreational use if approved by voters in a statewide referendum.\Walker: As a state lawmaker, authored Wisconsin's ""truth in sentencing"" law that restricts early release of prisoners. Opposes legalizing marijuana for medical and recreational use.\Environment\Evers: Accused Walker of allowing corporate and political interests to influence environmental regulation. Would rely on science to guide natural resources policy and join other states in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\Walker: Curtailed a range of environmental regulations and protections to make the state more business friendly. Opposed federal rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.\Transportation\Evers: Open to tax or fee increases, including a gas-tax increase, to repair the state's roads and bridges, which studies have shown to be among the worst in the nation.\Walker: Won't increase the gas tax without an offsetting tax cut of equal or greater value elsewhere. Has pushed the state to maintain its roads and bridges by operating more efficiently and forgoing the reconstruction of large interchanges near Milwaukee.\CANDIDATE BIOS\Scott Walker\Age: 50\Party: Republican\Address: Wisconsin Governor's Mansion, 99 Cambridge Road, Madison\Family: Married with two sons.\Job: Governor.\Prior elected office: Governor since 2011; Milwaukee County executive, 2003-2010; state Assembly, 1993-2002\Education: Delavan-Darien High School.\Website: scottwalker.com\Tony Evers\Age: 66\Party: Democratic\Address: 125 N.

296,"One-time Madison mayoral candidate and longtime Milwaukee journalist James Rowen, who now writes a popular blog called Political Environment, accused Gov. Scott Walker last week of ""brain-dead"" budgeting.\Unfortunately for us Wisconsinites, it was an accurate assessment. \The governor once again has shown that he has no regard - or is it just plain ignorance? - for how the state's transportation future and its environment can and should relate to each other. \Last week, the governor announced that he wants to delay some highway projects because the state's road budget is facing a $63.4 million shortfall over the next two years. He said he will push the huge expansion of I-94 north-south and the Zoo Interchange projects in Milwaukee to the next biennium. \Those two projects, along with postponing the widening of the Ryan Road Interchange on Milwaukee's south side and deferring some other zoo work, will not be enough to cover the shortfall. \Walker could have delayed some other new highway projects, but chose instead to take money from the pot that repairs and repaves highways and roads - $12.3 million from state highway maintenance and more than $4 million from transportation aid to local governments. And just for good measure, he plans to take $1.1 million of the state's contribution to Amtrak's successful Hiawatha line between Milwaukee and Chicago to help with the highway shortfall. \Rowen noted that several towns, because of lower state transportation aid in recent years, have already resorted to tearing up deteriorating blacktop from their rural roads and replacing it with gravel, just like the roads we had in rural New Glarus during the 1950s. A loss of another $4 million for local governments can only make the situation much worse. \But that has been this administration's transportation plan. It jumps in with both feet when it comes to adding two more lanes to a four-lane interstate or paving over more farmland so that automobile drivers can save a couple of minutes on their commutes or the big trucking companies can add even more semis to the already dangerous mix on our superhighways. \When it comes to fixing what we have, though, it's another story. Potholes, ribbed concrete and failing asphalt have become more commonplace because we're not paying enough attention to maintaining the infrastructure we have. \And what's even more brain dead is reducing Wisconsin's already paltry contribution to passenger rail. If anything can help reduce highway congestion and save a few dollars at the same time, it's getting people out of their cars and onto environmentally friendly passenger rail. \That's been happening big time with the Hiawatha route from Milwaukee to Chicago, which has been setting passenger records and is considered one of the most successful Amtrak routes in the country. Among its 800,000-plus riders are thousands of businessmen and women from both cities who find they can do work on the train instead of sitting in traffic on I-94. \But instead of helping fund upgrades to the Hiawatha, which could use technological and comfort improvements, Wisconsin will pull the plug on another million dollars to make the train ride less pleasing than it could be. \No, this administration would rather spend hundreds of millions more on building highways, forget local road maintenance, and cut back on helping the one transportation mode that actually reduces the wear and tear on the highways. \Plus the governor refuses to even look at how, in light of the decreasing revenues from the gas tax, we're going to fund transportation needs of the future. Instead, he's hellbent on using what dollars he can for more super roads at the expense of everything else. \Brain dead, indeed.\Credit: DAVE ZWEIFEL , The Capital Times editor emeritus , dzweifel@madison.com"
297,"Scott Walker has five more days in office. He'll leave Monday, Jan. 7, the day Tony Evers will be inaugurated and take his place as the head of Wisconsin government.\Like most politicians 1st District Congressman Paul Ryan being one example Walker is riding into the sunset claiming to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.\He and many of his Republican colleagues point proudly to the state of Wisconsin's economy, low unemployment and an $85 million drop in the state's tax burden since he took office back in 2010. They claim that Walker's signature anti-union legislation, the infamous Act 10, alone saved Wisconsin taxpayers more than $3.5 billion.\Tax breaks and tax credits for some corporations, outright grants to others and, of course, the $3 billion in subsidies to convince the giant Foxconn corporation to build a big factory in southeast Wisconsin are all credited with bringing jobs to the state.\And, indeed, there's no question that the state's economy is better off than it was back in 2010, Democrat Jim Doyle's last year and the year of Walker's victory in the fall.\Let's not forget, though, that Scott Walker was the beneficiary of a national economic recovery that followed the disastrous Great Recession Barack Obama inherited from George W. Bush. Wisconsin has done well following those troubled times but so has most every other state.\To claim that killing public unions and crippling those in the private sector with a so-called rightto- work law were big contributors to Wisconsin's recovery is nonsense. Most states didn't resort to onerous attacks on workers and their turnaround has been just as good, if not better, than Wisconsin's.\The Badger State now ranks 27th among the states in business growth and the state of its economy is also 27th in other words, about the middle of the pack.\Only a couple of weeks ago, Walker pointed to a new study showing that the tax burden on Wisconsin citizens has fallen to its lowest point in 50 years. It is now at 10.5 percent of a taxpayer's income, dropping from 10.6 the year before.\Neighboring Minnesota, which has continually outperformed Wisconsin in recent years, still ranks among the highest in burdening its taxpayers, all of which shows that states can lower tax burdens simply by cutting taxes and then squeezing services. Kansas did just that under now-departed Gov. Sam Brownback. Its citizens saved big money on taxes, but the schools, for one, have imploded.\It isn't as severe as Kansas, but under Walker, Wisconsin too has regressed the past eight years.\Our infrastructure, especially roads and highways, has been neglected all in the name of making sure we don't raise the gas tax. Some Republicans blame local governments for not fixing their streets, but much of that is due to no significant help from the state.\One of Walker's early blunders was his insistence that Wisconsin not take federal money to expand passenger rail at a time when economic development and the need for public transportation were expanding. Denying public transportation to the working poor only exacerbates the inequality so prevalent in the state.\Meanwhile, we no longer rank among the very best in our public schools and universities. Flagship UW-Madison has fallen a couple of notches in attracting research money, state universities are having to cut majors and being forced to lay off faculty to make ends meet. Our prisons and correction facilities rank 44th in the country.\What's worse, though, is how far the state has fallen in protecting what's crucial to the future of Wisconsin its natural resources. For the past eight years the first time since John Muir, Aldo Leopold, Warren Knowles and Gaylord Nelson led the way to preserve our beauty, protect our water and air, and write rules for responsible development? Walker's record on the environment has been awful.\Under Walker, Wisconsin government made the crucial decision that encouraging unfettered development is more important than protecting the environment and that the interests of business supersede the need to preserve the state for generations to come.\Scientists were dismissed from the DNR. Developers were exempted from many of the state's longstanding environmental regulations, the worst being at the Foxconn plant, where the corporation not only received unprecedented subsidies, but was allowed to ignore rules protecting vital wetlands and water quality.\Environmental advocates are concerned that the damage to the state's natural resources and scenic beauty from Walker's tenure will take decades to fix.\The last eight years haven't been pretty. Scott Walker has left a formidable challenge for his successor, not to mention the same, old GOP-led Legislature is here to make the challenge even greater.\Nevertheless, let's hope for better times in 2019.

298,"Dear Editor: On Sept. 30, Investors' Business Daily stated that the Organization for Economic Cooperation has concluded that ""corporate taxes are most harmful for growth"" and that ""investment is adversely affected by corporate taxation."" IBD then asks, ""Perhaps that's why in the last year and a half, nine of the 30 most developed countries and 20 countries worldwide have cut their corporate tax rates.""\So why do we have a corporate tax at all? Politicians know that it's a hidden tax on consumers. But, they have trained their electorate well. They say business is evil and must pay a tax. We know that businesses provide us with jobs and a future. IBD adds, ""Corporations get their money from the purchasers of their goods and services.""\In November 2008 Kiplinger.com said, ""The best thing Washington could do to supercharge private savings would be to tax consumption rather than income. The Byzantine U.S. tax code (all 60,000 pages of it) should be scrapped.""\""At every income level, big spenders would pay a lot of taxes, super savers much less. Poor people would get all their sales taxes rebated. (For more information on one version of a consumption tax, visit www.fairtax.org.)""\It looks like Investor's Business Daily and Kiplinger have realized the intrinsic value of the FairTax. How about you? Please join Chuck Norris, Sean Hannity and Mike Huckabee in their support of the FairTax.\Al Ose Americans for Fair Taxation Wisconsin Rapids\Wisconsin would be hurt under Cap Times trade stand\Dear Editor: Your editorial on Oct. 11 calling for radical trade policies with Beijing comes to a conclusion that is harmful to Wisconsin and Wisconsin workers.\The editorial completely ignores U.S. exports to China, and the good, high-paying jobs those exports create. Did you know that China is now America's third largest export market, behind only Canada and Mexico? That Wisconsin alone exported almost $1.2 billion in goods to China last year, up 564 percent from 2000? Machinery made up $484 million of Wisconsin's total, and computer and electronics goods another $245 million. Even closer to home, the Madison area exported $225 million in goods to China, also up over 500 percent from 2000, with manufactured goods leading the way.\Another key piece of history missing from the editorial: Much of those imports from China used to be imported from other overseas suppliers that have shifted their operations to China over the past decade. In short, if we didn't import it from China, we'd likely import it from somewhere else, not make it here. Sony TVs, for example, are now imported from China, but previously were made in Japan.\Retreating into an isolationist shell will serve no purpose other than punishing those companies and workers that are succeeding, increasingly, in exporting to China. That's the wrong policy, especially in these difficult times.\There are problems in our trading relationship with China, but the right way to level the playing field is through good, smart, tough negotiations and enforcing our existing trade agreements.\John Frisbie US-China Business Council Washington, D.C.\Raising bus fare is wrong approach in these times\Dear Editor: We like to think of Madison as an environmentally aware and responsible community. The Natural Step was adopted by the City Council in December 2005 as the city's guiding sustainability framework. The mayor has signed on to the Cool Cities program. The mayor, the council and the citizens of Madison can be proud of the steps we have taken toward preserving our environment.\It is important to remind ourselves, however, that there is much more to be done. The cost of gasoline has gone down over the last weeks, but we all know that it will go back up, and keep going up. It is essential that alternatives to driving cars, such as Madison Metro buses, continue to be available.\Increasing bus use and availability helps the environment, reduces our contribution to global warming, and provides a viable travel option to the increasing number of us who will find driving private cars too expensive.\The proposal in the mayor's budget to increase the bus fare is absolutely the wrong thing to do at the wrong time. If anything we should reduce the bus fare, to encourage more use. Times are tight and hard decisions have to be made, but raising the bus fare or cutting bus service should not be on the table. Instead, let's look at raising parking fees, maybe instituting a county gas tax or a tax on gas stations that they would pass on to customers. Perhaps it is time once again for the city or Dane County to look at a wheel tax. A huge chunk of Madison's budget goes to services and infrastructure for car driving. It is time that the beneficiaries of those services pay closer to their fair share, and give a break to the bus riders.\Ken Lawrence Madison\Monona Grove's Lori Nahirniak is master choral teacher\Dear Editor: Monona Grove High School is blessed with (at least) one master teacher. Lori Nahirniak's Oct. 13 Fall Choral Concert was a very impressive authentic assessment of teaching and learning. Each of her four choral groups, a total of 190 Monona Grove High School students, performed their memorized music with virtually flawless timbre, intonation, balance, blend and impeccable musicianship.\Nahirniak's expressive conducting drew out the subtleties of their ingrained musicianship, obviously developed during her masterful rehearsals. The freshman choir was no less competent than the senior choir in terms of the musical qualities of their performance. I was even more impressed when the audience learned that the concert was the result of just 14 rehearsals, block scheduling, no less!\Her choices of literature gave her students a broad range of style - from indigenous Australian to the poetry of Robert Burns to Palestrina (in Latin) - not only to study in their own rehearsals and perform onstage, but to experience as audience members from each of the other three choirs' performances.\I wonder how many of her students appreciate the rare privilege it is to have a master teacher in front of them. While Nahirniak's rehearsal routines are perfectly ordinary and normal to them, they're the unknown to far too many other high school musicians. Monona Grove musicians will be prized as members of their future university choirs.\Congratulations to Lori Nahirniak and of all of the Monona Grove choral musicians for a beautifully crafted performance!\Loren Palmer Newport Public Schools Newport, R.I.\10/19/2008 7:28 am"
299,"Is Alliant Energy's plan for a coal-fired power plant in Cassville a good idea?\Costs a factor, but energy plan needed\The controversy over the proposed coal-burning power plant in Cassville has many pros and cons.\Sunday Forum columnist Louis Okey recognized both in his support of Alliant Energy's proposal. He also explained his analysis of why the benefits of a new facility outweigh the costs.\Columnist Charlie Higley also recognized the cons, but that's all. His best argument against the plan was the increased cost. His best alternative was to suggest we follow Gov. Jim Doyle's hope that Wisconsin becomes a ""national leader in energy efficiency and renewable energy.""\Such a broad, vague suggestion demonstrates that Higley, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, opposes the Alliant initiative in Cassville on cost issues alone. And he gives us no plan as to how to achieve the governor's goals.\I don't want energy costs to rise any more than anyone else does, and I'm willing to work at conserving what energy we have available. But I also know that change comes with a price. A planned change for the better will be worth it.\- Steven C. Bernhardt, Cuba City\Plant would fill today's energy needs\I support building the Cassville power plant. There is no such thing as ""the good old days."" People need electricity now.\Although alternative power sources are being researched and explored, they are not widely available and cannot meet current customer needs. People want to ""go green"" but they also want to use their air-conditioners, TVs, washing machines, and so on.\The Cassville power plant has to stay. The livelihood of Cassville depends upon it, and the state will share in some of the benefits.\- James Vogt, Cassville\Focus on nuclear waste storage issue\To my knowledge, we have not invested significant grant money in our universities or research institutions for the study of the diffusion of nuclear waste.\Nuclear waste has been a storage problem for over 50 years. We have sent people to the moon - we certainly can spend money to try to reduce this threat to our planet.\- William P. Rowe, Madison\Coal plants cleaner than most think\Regarding the photo of a coal-fired plant used on the Sunday Forum cover, how many people know the stack emissions shown are a high percentage of steam and water vapors? Coal can burn clean.\The public needs to be educated. Claims of increased construction cost can be linked to delays caused by environmentalists. Alliant has already spent more than $1 billion for mercury monitoring. When students spill an ounce of mercury in the high school lab, they evacuate the building. But if you break a CFL bulb in the home or office, so what?\Some want us to follow Gov. Doyle to become a leader in energy. Isn't Doyle the one dipping into the Department of Transportation gas tax fund? Hybrid cars are coming, but where will we plug them in? The outlet in the garage requires power.\We import lots of power from out of state. Why doesn't CUB and Clean Air Wisconsin inform the public of this fact? If you really want to scratch your head about clean energy, do a ""Google"" search for Stanley A. Meyer and the water fuel cell.\- Dennis Blackbourn, Beetown\Build now to support future energy needs\Yes, build the plant. Electricity generation capacity must be expanded by 2010 due to all the plug-in electric cars that will be produced in the future.\I believe the electric car will be needed for our country to achieve energy independence, and I fully support renewable energy. But how many windmills would it take to generate 300 megawatts of electricity, and how much space would be needed to build them?\Alliant is taking the steps needed to make this plant as green as possible and is able to protect our environment by fueling the plant with renewable fuels.\- William Pickett, Monroe\Wisconsin needs energy/climate czar\The Cassville coal-fired plant poses a dilemma because we lack credible alternatives. I am as fervent as anyone for strong action against the threat of climate change. But I am afraid that many experts are correct: Policies against climate change will not succeed without simultaneous attention to energy security.\While better alternatives are theoretically available - such as wind power and nuclear power - we lack realistic alternatives to coal power. Our state government needs a responsible, high-level focus to reconcile energy and climate concerns - some kind of energy-climate ""czar.""\Under the elected state leadership, this office would have the responsibility to plan for adequate power generation and transmission, and have the power to do the tough work of expediting the selected alternatives.\This would combine many of the powers of the Public Service Commission, which is now focused on raw capacity and rates, and the DNR, which looks at a narrow range of conservation issues. Such focus ought to be considered in the report of the Governor's Global Warming Task Force.\Likewise, legislation to attack climate change should propose an adequate state structure to ensure adequate power resources as it protects the environment.\- David Knuti, Madison\Windmills offer short-term solution\Nuclear power is the elephant in the room when discussing long-term solutions to producing the power we need and reducing greenhouse gases. There is no other choice.\The supposed problems with disposal or reclamation of spent fuel should be dealt with while building new nuclear plants. Since this will take decades, we need an interim solution to mitigate rising fuel costs and competition for limited resources.\We must stop worrying about renewable energy sources that cut into other vital resources and dive headfirst into removable sources.\We have the ability to produce electricity almost anywhere using windmills. They are too dependent on weather patterns to be viable as a total replacement, but they can produce some power most of the time.\They are big and ugly, but the technology is fairly easy to manufacture. Unlike solar, they don't require a lot of ground space and sunlight, and they work day and night. Every town should have one or two. Don't worry about ruining the view or a few birds getting hit by the blades - they won't be there forever.\If we proceed with the production of nuclear plants now, windmills won't be needed in 20 years. Then just tear them down, recycle the materials, remove the bases and you'll never know they were there.\The infrastructure to construct and distribute thousands of windmills is already in place, as is the manpower. So, all you nay-sayers - what's the problem?\- Charles Phipps, Lodi\Coal pollution causes health problems\My motel business and residence are near the WPL/Alliant Power Plant in Columbia County, near Pardeeville. Over the years, we have experienced difficulties with our air quality.\Oxygen levels in our lungs have decreased because of the poor air quality caused by the coal pollution from the power plant. Guests asks us what's wrong with our air, because they often find it hard to breathe.\Our white lawn chairs are black in the mornings due to coal dust mixing with tree sap and evening dew. This oily film has also settled on our outdoor refrigerator and vending machines, windows and vehicles.\I became sick three years ago. Doctors claimed I had a bacterial infection caused by the poor air quality in our area. I am still suffering from this, and recently my wife has also had problems.\We have presented these problems to the DNR, Public Service Commission and Alliant. Not one of these organizations have responded. Our health is at risk because of these coal-fired power plants, but most people don't recognize this problem until it happens to them.\We don't need any more coal plants in Wisconsin or in the world. We need our health back. We need some protection. We don't need any more expenses or hazards due to the construction of the Cassville pant. Please help us keep Wisconsin clean.\- Ray W. Voss, Portage, chairman, Columbia County Citizens Committee\Coal outdated, but still only choice\Coal-fired power plants seem archaic for the 21st century, but in the absence of nuclear power, they're the only other choice capable of supplying the electricity modern society demands. Unfortunately, that is the choice that has been made.\- Frank Fleres, Madison\Don't cut growth for climate paranoia\Coal, natural gas, nuclear power and oil are available to us now. And now is when we should be using them - not offering people $1,000 to offset costs while mandating mileage increases for car manufacturers who are losing jobs.\This is not a plan, it does nothing to lower the price of oil or improve our economy. Quit supporting ethanol and let it stand on its own. Drill anywhere and everywhere that makes sense. Build refineries on closed military bases and put people back to work.\You don't see China or India backing off growth, so why should we? China's gross domestic product is growing at 9 percent while we limp along at 1 percent. China adds thousands of new drivers a day while we make it almost impossible to drive or vacation in our own country.\Quit this hand-wringing over global warming, which is nothing but junk science at best. Why should the average American suffer and lose jobs and hope while Congress worries about a wilderness that no one can enjoy because they can't afford it? Remember they work for us, not the other way around.\- John Adams, Brodhead\Plant would hasten global warming\I agree with columnist Charlie Higley that building a coal-fired power plant near Cassville is a bad idea, mainly because it will contribute to producing significantly more carbon dioxide pollution and thus hasten global warming.\Scientists tell us that excess carbon dioxide in the air is the largest global-warming culprit and that the United States is the largest source of emissions. This is shameful.\If a new plant would take care of Wisconsin's energy needs well into the future at a reasonable price, it might be worth considering, but this plant won't. Midwest governors and other leaders agree that coal will become more and more expensive and penalties for producing carbon dioxide could also help to break the bank.\Serious energy conservation, greater energy efficiency and alternative sources must be exploited - now.\The same arguments apply to American Transmission Company's plan to build a new 345-kilovolt line across Dane County. It will pollute more and require more power from coal-fired plants, but ATC will earn more profits and ratepayers will foot the bills. Remember, there is no such thing as clean coal.\- Jacqueline Kelley, Madison\Nuclear power best to reduce emissions\Coal is a bad choice for electric power. But 80 percent coal and 20 percent ""biomass"" is hardly better, especially if the ""biomass"" means cutting trees or diverting land from growing food to growing fuel.\Forum columnist Louis Okey says that 20 percent biomass ""will require tens of thousands of new acres under till."" And what are those acres doing now, growing food or enabling recreation? Are we to fill in more wetlands to grow that biomass?\One of the problems with biomass is that it competes with other uses for the land. And how much diesel fuel and gasoline does it take to plant, harvest and transport biomass? It may actually increase carbon dioxide emissions relative to ""non-renewable"" natural gas, oil or even coal.\Price is not the main issue. Electricity will become more expensive and rates will rise no matter which options we use to generate more power.\Conservation will not relieve the need for additional electric power because our population is expanding and high gas prices increase the demand for plug-in hybrids. So we will need more base load power - available at night and when winds are calm.\As long as nuclear remains off the table, we will continue to expand the use of coal or natural gas and emit more carbon dioxide.\- Jim Blair, Madison"
300," Wisconsin is under invasion - by armies of non-native plants, aquatic species, insects and diseases.\ The Department of Natural Resources is retaliating, but it's a tough battle.\ More than 140 exotic plants, animals and pathogens have entered the Great Lakes since the 1840s, said Laurie Ostendorf, DNR land division administrator.\ Free from natural predators and pathogens that keep them in check in their native environments, some of these species rapidly take over, at significant cost to the state's environment and economy, Gov. Jim Doyle added.\ Plants such as reed canary grass, buckthorn and garlic mustard hurt forest regeneration. Vines such as Oriental bittersweet climb and kill mature trees. Poison parsnip and thorny thistles wreck recreational experiences, and leafy spurge degrades wildlife and agricultural values, according to DNR officials.\ These and other harmful invaders were explained to the Natural Resources Board by DNR staffers and a written report Wednesday, although the board was also told the department doesn't have enough financial or human resources - or in some cases the authority - to go into all-out combat.\ The agency has a new ally, however, in a recently appointed Governor's Council on Invasive Species, which includes representatives of state agencies, other public interests and the private sector. The DNR also cooperates with federal agencies in many ways.\ For now, much of the emphasis is on education - getting information about invaders and how to fight them to Wisconsin residents through conferences, public presentations, Web pages, publications and radio and television shows.\ That includes information about gypsy moths, which are currently defoliating oaks and aspen as they spread through Wisconsin. Diseases like butternut canker and Dutch elm disease have killed large numbers of trees. The DNR and USDA-Forest Service will cooperate to fight the gypsy moth and will survey this year for the emerald ash borer - a treacherous beetle from Asia that is already attacking trees in Michigan.\ The DNR has been especially active in trying to stop the spread of aquatic invasive species. Particularly worrisome species include purple loosestrife, Eurasian watermilfoil, curly leaf pondweed, zebra mussels, rainbow smelt, common carp, rusty crayfish, round goby and reed canary grass.\ Annual state funding of $550,000 from the motor boat gas tax has helped establish a program to manage aquatic plant and animal species. The funding has been used to establish a watercraft inspection program at boat access sites and develop monitoring and education programs. Additional annual funding of $500,000 will be available to local units of government starting this year for education and outreach and a biocontrol program in which beetles are used to battle purple loosestrife, the DNR board was told.\ Another $500,000 in grants will be available to local governments this year to help battle zebra mussels, Eurasian watermilfoil and other aquatic species.\ But the need for such efforts may pale compared to what lies ahead, according to Ron Martin of the DNR. Kudzu - a dreaded vine native to Japan and China that will cover almost any fixed object near it, including buildings and other plants - has reached Evanston, Ill. And giant hogweed - a toxic newcomer - is in Michigan.\ E-mail: aweier@madison.com"
301," There was plenty of irony last week in the State Capitol as politicians focused on taxes and spending.\ First, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the chief lobbying arm of corporate Wisconsin, was denouncing the idea of higher cigarette taxes, something that might reduce smoking and future health costs.\ Most Wisconsin corporations have adopted smoke-free environments. Their employees must smoke outside the building or in restricted areas.\ Most companies would like their workers, spouses and dependents to stop smoking. It could help their future health insurance costs. Higher cigarette taxes also would discourage smoking by teenagers, including those in families insured by corporate Wisconsin fringe benefits.\ Of course, one of the big corporate players in WMC ranks is the Philip Morris Co. So the lobbying arm of big business has now positioned itself against increasing the state's cigarette tax. The tail may be wagging the big corporate dog.\ Opposition from grocers, convenience stores and tavern owners is easier to understand. Taverns think they'll lose profit-making sales of cigarettes. Of course, if the tax increase were only the 9 cents suggested by the Joint Finance Committee, you can bet prices would increase by a dime. Someone will make an extra penny per pack when the price goes up.\ Wisconsin may have higher than average cigarette taxes, but its beer tax is among the lowest, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The beer tax hasn't increased since 1969. That reflects the state's beer-drinking heritage, and the fact that there once were a number of major breweries in Wisconsin.\ The grocers and convenience stores are most concerned about border area residents crossing into neighboring states to buy their smokes. The same border-crossing argument is heard about gasoline taxes, but then the opposition is muted - the road-building industry and its unions thrive on the gas tax revenues.\ There's also a touch of racism in the cigarette tax debate. Opponents say it would give an advantage to smoke-shop sales on Indian land. The tavern industry already thinks Indian casinos are taking away their patrons.\ Central to the politics of cigarette tax increases is the fact that only 25 percent of Wisconsin adults are still smokers. The other 75 percent of citizens will not be livid if cigarette taxes are increased. Indeed, if the tax increase were to reduce smoking, the 75 percent may think it's a nifty move.\ ""Don't tax me, don't tax thee, tax the man behind the tree"" is an old political saying. This year the man behind the tree may be smoking a cigarette.\ Opponents of the cigarette tax hike suggest that it would be unfairly penalize the poor. Their statistics suggest that the average smoker makes less than $30,000 per year. It's nice to see the Republicans worry about these people.\ This week the Democratic-controlled sate Senate will be reviewing the budget bill produced last week by the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Chvala, D-Madison, suggests his Democratic colleagues may increase the size of the cigarette tax to help provide a better prescription drug plan for lower income senior citizens.\ The following week the budget bill will be in the Republican- controlled Assembly, and Speaker Scott Jensen, R-Waukesha, is talking about reducing spending and eliminating any tax hike in the budget.\ That should delight grocers, Philip Morris, and the Tavern League.\ But the next few weeks will set the agenda for the 2002 legislative elections, and cigarette tax action could be a centerpiece for both parties."
302," RISING\ JIM DOYLE PRAISED FOR SETTING AGENDA\ The Democratic governor continues to reap the benefits of what fans call a well-planned media leak and announcement campaign surrounding his State of the State message last month and his budget address Tuesday night. Coverage in the state's largest market is wide and positive following announcement of his Milwaukee aid package. Even conservative commentators give Doyle props for setting the agenda. A lot of the positive atmosphere likely will dissipate, however, following the release of budget details on Tuesday when it will be clear how Doyle intends to pay for all the goodies. Critics are getting ready to pound him for veering to the left and embracing a host of tax increases. There's also criticism of Doyle's tobacco money re-bonding scheme.\ CAMPAIGN SPENDING SETS RECORDS\ Spending records fell like dominoes last fall as state candidates raised - and spent - big bucks. The top four candidates for governor - Jim Doyle, Mark Green, Scott Walker and Nelson Eisman - spent more than $19.3 million on their race, just topping the 2002 mark. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign estimates spending by their running mates and outside interest groups pushed the total tab on the race to $32.3 million. That's 38 percent higher than the $23.5 million candidates and third parties spent four years ago, according to WDC. The race for attorney general didn't disappoint, either. The candidates alone spent $4.72 million with outside groups pushing the total tab to more than $8.3 million; four years ago, in a race for an open seat, total spending on the race was just $1.65 million.\ SOME HOPE FOR MILWAUKEE?\ The reputation of the state's largest city has seen better days after a series of violent outbursts, problems in the schools and other dysfunctions. But Gov. Jim Doyle may be offering some hope in a package he released calling for $80 million to boost education, fight crime and revitalize the city.\ PRIVACY ADVOCATES HAVE NEW AMMO\ A couple of high-profile government gaffes give privacy advocates plenty of new ammo for reining in access to personal information. First, a Department of Revenue contractor mistakenly printed taxpayers' Social Security numbers on more than 170,000 tax booklets. Then, papers with the Social Security numbers of about 110 lawmakers and legislative aides were stolen from the car of a legislative staff member.\ MIXED\ SMOKING BAN: DOYLE WILL TAKE '95 PERCENT'\ Just a couple of weeks ago, the governor said Wisconsin should implement a statewide smoking ban in all workplaces, including bars and taverns, because it was the right thing to do. He predicted smoke-free environments would be the norm 10 years from now and mocked those who thought otherwise. Then last week, Jim Doyle said he's a realist and is willing to get ""95 percent"" of what he wants, even if that means an exemption for bars and taverns.\ UW ADMISSIONS POLCY MAY BE CHALLENGED\ Despite continuing controversy and contentions it will have little effect, the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents approved a freshman admission policy that takes into account factors such as race. But the delayed policy comes with improved rhetoric and support via public hearings. Maintains UW System President Kevin Reilly: ""Academics trump all other factors in this policy."" But UW critic Rep. Steve Nass, Assembly Colleges and Universities chairman, calls it a willful violation of state law, asks for an attorney general's opinion and raises the specter of a citizen lawsuit.\ FALLING\ STATE INFRASTRUCTURE GETS A C\ The American Society of Civil Engineers gives Wisconsin's infrastructure a C, down from a C-plus in 2003, the last time the organization issued a report card. ASCE report card committee chairman John Goetter says the main reason for the drop is a lack of funding. Various transportation groups have complained the state's transportation funding will be inadequate in future years because the state eliminated the automatic indexing of the gas tax.\ THE FRANKENSTEIN VETO LIVES\ Wisconsin governors have one of the strongest veto pens in the country with the ability to strike out individual words to stitch together new sentences (known as the ""Frankenstein veto""). Republicans howled after Gov. Jim Doyle used the authority to move around millions in the last budget battle. They immediately stepped in with a proposed constitutional amendment to rein in that power, and it passed through both houses on first consideration. But now that Democrats are back in control of the Senate, it looks unlikely the Legislature will curtail the governor's power any time soon.\ PER DIEM PAYMENTS DOWN\ Lawmakers charged state taxpayers $950,719 in per diem payments for 2006, down more than $40,000 compared to 2004, the last non- budget year. Still, the regulars continue atop the list. Democratic Rep. Marlin Schneider of Wisconsin Rapids continued his streak atop the Assembly's list, claiming $13,640 on 155 days, the most allowed under Assembly rules last year. On the Senate side, Democrat Roger Breske of Eland topped last year's list with 143 days claimed and $12,584 in payments.\ Wispolitics.com is a political news service.

303," Dear Editor: Land use is the talk of the town, and Madison citizens are learning firsthand that a transportation system that is highway heavy and transit weak is a rip-off in more ways than one.\ Madison legislators, led by Spencer Black and backed by thousands of citizens, did the right thing in the recent transportation budget debate. They deserve praise for their fight to save state aid for the Madison Metro bus system. They didn't let themselves get fooled by a gas tax increase which was nothing more than a smokescreen for more highways.\ Unfortunately their efforts were upstaged by partisan politics, and the result was a $300,000 cut in bus service for the state's second-largest city. This pro-highway budget is a step backward. It is anti-environment, pro-sprawl and an irresponsible use of taxpayers' money. Sadly, it will hurt those who rely on our bus system the most -- seniors, the disabled and those who can't (or don't wish to) afford a car."
304,"IOWA CITY, Iowa - President Trump's nominee to lead the Federal Highway Administration has withdrawn from consideration for the post, a surprising development given his widespread support and qualifications, the U.S. Department of Transportation confirmed Monday.\A DOT spokesperson said Paul Trombino III was stepping away from the federal appointment for family reasons. Trombino told colleagues in an email Friday that he had decided to stay in Iowa to take care of his ailing father, whose condition has recently deteriorated. \Trump announced Trombino's nomination in September, and he received bipartisan support. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee endorsed Trombino in October, with members calling the 51-year-old a talented administrator who would help rebuild the nation's highways. He had been awaiting a vote from the full chamber to lead the agency within DOT, which has a $44 billion annual highway aid budget and 3,000 employees. \Trombino was a favorite of road builders who successfully helped push for Iowa's 10-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase in 2015. \The Wisconsin native had spent most of his career at the Wisconsin DOT as an engineer and administrator. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad picked him to run the Iowa DOT in 2011, and he was considered a visionary leader fluent in everything from self-driving cars to shipping policy. Trombino served as president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials for 2015-2016, a prestigious position in the field. \Trombino surprised Iowa officials when he announced plans to step down the day after the November 2016 presidential election, saying he wanted to look for jobs in the private sector. He soon became president of McClure Engineering Co., an Iowa-based firm. \He told employees in an email Friday that he intends to stay there, saying he looked forward to continuing to work with a ""wonderful team.""\Credit: RYAN J.

306,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."

308,"Federal money for transportation projects is drying up fast.\That means state and local officials can't afford to waste time as they discuss and assess a possible commuter rail line in Dane County.\A rail line from Sun Prairie through Madison to Middleton would require a lot of federal money to be feasible.\A state legislative committee is to meet Thursday to begin work on legislation allowing local officials to create taxing districts to run and pay for regional transit systems.\The Legislature needs a well-thought-out bill in hand when it returns to the Capitol early next year. And here in Dane County, local officials need to get on the same page with a smart and feasible proposal.\An unprecedented drop in motor vehicle driving is occurring across America. High gas prices mean many people are driving less in more fuel-efficient cars.\That's good for the environment and energy conservation. It also reduces demand for overseas oil.\But a negative consequence for Washington is falling income from an 18.4 cents-per-gallon gas tax at the pumps. The feds are collecting less money to dole out for regional transportation projects, including commuter rail.\Driving has fallen the most - 4.5 percent - in north central states including Wisconsin, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That makes it harder for Wisconsin government to pay its own transportation bills.\Yet all that's being asked of state lawmakers this week is legislation allowing local communities to create regional transportation authorities if they make sense.\Dane County communities are still exploring that question while applying for federal aid. Balancing urban and rural interests will be key to forging local consensus. And key to gaining state permission will be open minds at Thursday's meeting.\Everybody needs to get busy before the opportunity for federal help slips away."
309," Road builders are urging the state to use vehicle sales taxes to help pay for badly needed roads, buses and trains.\ A state highway plan adopted last year calls for spending $20.4 billion over the next 21 years - $5.1 billion more than current state gas taxes and vehicle license fees will raise.\ The state's 5 percent sales tax currently has no specifically designated purpose, but the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association wants some of it set aside, said Tom Walker, the group's executive director.\ The road builders' plan also would allow local governments to levy special sales taxes to support public transit systems, Walker said.\ Others worried that dividing the money could lead to local streets and transit lines being shortchanged to finance highways.\ Environmentalists, local governments and bus systems are urging lawmakers to devise a plan forecasting spending needs for all forms of transportation.\ Rick Stadelman, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association, said lawmakers are unlikely to support a measure taking sales tax dollars from other needs, such as schools, courts and shared revenue for local governments.\ This week, the Joint Finance Committee is expected to consider state Department of Transportation spending in the 2001-'03 state budget and the Assembly Transportation Committee will hold two public hearings on long-range transportation funding.\ Rob Kennedy, senior policy analyst for Citizens for a Better Environment, said he's concerned a funding plan would focus on state highways while ""local programs, including transit, are going to be scrambling for the crumbs.""\ He said an additional $4.7 billion could be needed over the next 20 years to maintain local roads and bus systems as well as commuter rail systems.\ Walker said transportation money could be divided into three funds - one for state highways and local roads, one for airports and one for public transit, railroads and harbors.\ The road fund would get all gas tax and license fee revenue, plus half the sales tax on vehicles, while the transit fund would get the other half of the sales tax.\ Under Walker's plan, cities and counties would be able to levy local sales taxes to pay for bus systems and future rail plans. That's similar to mechanisms used around the country, including the Chicago area's Regional Transportation Authority, he said."
310,"With the opening of fishing season approaching, anglers once again can pause to appreciate Wisconsin's bountiful resources. Most residents live within 10 minutes of a good spot to drop a hook or cast a fly, whether on Great Lakes waters or an inland trout stream.\For $14, you can fish a season that lasts about 150 days. Because of the state budget crisis, Gov. Jim Doyle is proposing to increase the annual fee to $20.\That's neither an outrageous fee hike nor an outrageous proposal.\Doyle says it's needed to help cover a projected $17 million shortfall in the $74 million needed by the Department of Natural Resources to pay for programs in 2004 and 2005.\Wisconsin's fishing and hunting privileges are still a bargain even with the proposed fee hikes, Natural Resources Secretary Scott Hassett told the Press-Gazette Editorial Board recently.\Hassett said hunting and fishing license fees usually are raised every four years, but Wisconsin hasn't raised them in seven years.\Sometime down the road, the state should consider implementing fees for nonconsumptive users of the outdoors.\It's not unfair to ask kayakers, canoeists, hikers or birdwatchers to help pay for using the state's resources.\Charging fees for wildlife watching, in turn, would give those enthusiasts the right to ""sit at the table"" and offer their views on resource management.\A mechanism for collecting and enforcing a nonconsumptive outdoors fee will require more discussion. Proposals have been floated for charging a ""Heritage Card"" or dedicating a fraction of the state sales tax or gas tax to conservation and the environment.\For now, the immediate goal is to cut costs without jeopardizing DNR services. In 2002, license fees raised $58 million, or about 65 percent of fish and wildlife spending. The DNR's total budget was $462 million in 2002.\We urge legislators to work with Doyle on ways to solve the state's $3.2 billion budget deficit, including cutting expenses in the DNR. If legislators who oppose the fee hikes have better ideas, let's hear them.\Issue\Raising fees for hunting, fishing licenses\Our view\Shelling out an extra $6 for a fishing license would still be a bargain\License fees\Here are current and proposed fees for some of Wisconsin's most popular hunting and fishing licenses. If enacted, the higher fees would take effect in March 2004.\Current Proposed Change\Fishing $14 $20 $6\Senior fishing $7 $10 $3\Small game $14 $20 $6\Deer $20 $32 $12\Patron $110 $140 $30"
311," ""We are realistic at the Department of Natural Resources,"" announced DNR Secretary George Meyer in a letter dismissing an idea by an agency employee that Wisconsin could pay people to drive less instead of building more highways. A DNR transportation specialist - assigned to critique the Department of Transportation's long-range highway plan and come up with alternatives - floated just such an alternative when he suggested offering people gas tax rebates for voluntarily limiting their driving. When the DOT weighed in, however, Meyer caved in, saying ""the idea is, at the very least, controversial, but was offered as a trial balloon to help spark public consideration for a wide variety of ideas.""\ No, George, it wasn't controversial - it was creative. That's the kind of thinking that should be encouraged, the kind of thinking Wisconsin's citizens need if we are ever to curtail the DOT's penchant for paving over the state.\ The DOT's 20-year plan calls for building 2,800 miles of highway lanes and 35 new highway bypasses, which will eat up 25,000 acres. DOT gets to decide which transportation alternatives it will study and it has already nixed the rebate idea.\ Meyer says DOT's plan will result in a transportation system that ""in two decades substantially increases congestion . . . continues to facilitate poor land use and harms Wisconsin's environment, economy and quality of life in numerous, irreparable ways."" But he must stand up for his own department's ""trial balloons"" if we are to believe his concern is genuine and that his department's alternatives will actually challenge the DOT's road-building mentality.\ The DOT will hold a public hearing on its highway plan in Madison Wednesday - tomorrow - where citizens can see if they have any ideas that don't use concrete."
312,"Local lawmakers said stimulating the economy and drawing business back into the state will dominate the 2009 agenda for the state Legislature, which heads back into session next week.\""It's hard to say which way the Assembly will go but I wouldn't be surprised if the Assembly brings up the issue of raising taxes in some way or other,"" said Rep. Dick Spanbauer, R-Oshkosh.\Wisconsin has an estimated $5.4 billion budget deficit.\The area delegation will see two new members since long-time lawmakers Sen. Carol Roessler and Rep. Carol Owens did not seek re-election.\During a pre-session meeting and caucuses in the past month, Spanbauer said members from across the state tossed around the idea of raising the beer tax, retail sales tax and gas tax. He said it will be important for Democrats and Republicans to work together on figuring out if any tax increases are necessary.\""That might need to be considered by all of us,"" Spanbauer said. ""Politicians don't typically care to raise taxes but we are in a severe shortage of funds that has caused this deficit.""\Spanbauer said the state first needs to cut programs that are not being utilized before considering tax increases.\""We need to roll up our sleeves and find out what programs work and which ones don't work,"" he said.\Gov. Jim Doyle has repeatedly said he wants to balance the budget with a mixture of spending cuts and targeted tax increases, like ones on large oil companies and hospitals.\Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, said raising taxes would be counterproductive to stimulating the economy and drawing businesses into the area.\""We need to create an environment that will get people working and putting money in their pockets,"" Hopper said.\Hopper said one of the first bills Senate Majority Leader Russ Decker is expected to introduce in 2009 will look at increasing the minimum wage and making it increase automatically along with inflation. Decker also has said a main priority will be to pass an economic stimulus package that gets people back to work.\In considering ways to balance the budget, much hinges on whether federal assistance will be given to states and if so, how much. At President-elect Barack Obama's request, Doyle has come up with a list of $3.7 billion worth of construction projects that could get rolling within four months.\Oshkosh City Manager Mark Rohloff said he will be encouraging city staff to get designs for infrastructure improvements and public buildings completed as soon as possible in 2009 in case federal assistance becomes available for such projects.\""We want to be in the right position in case those opportunities present themselves,"" Rohloff said."
313,"The spotlight has been on Kathleen Falk over the past several months as the enterprising Dane County executive has launched her initiative to save the region's landscape from the blight of development.\Falk is boldly and concretely attempting to put county resources where her campaign promised they would be directed: to the preservation of what is left of this county's agricultural traditions and its natural splendor.\For those who believe that Dane County is and should remain one of the most beautiful places in Wisconsin, Falk's efforts are both welcome and deserving of strong support.\But how do believers in Dane County make that support a reality? Let's start by endorsing the county executive's efforts to expand the county's Conservation Fund.\This year, the fund contains $1.3 million in tax dollars. With her ""Design Dane"" plan, Falk seeks to raise that figure to at least $4 million annually - or $40 million over 10 years to secure more greenspace.\The expanded fund could be used to unpave the way for more Ice Age Trail and extra E-Way - the belt of land in south Madison that stretches from Dunn's Marsh to Lake Waubesa - and to protect water bodies, wetlands and the rest of our natural, life-sustaining environment.\At some point Falk is going to have to put a referendum to the people to authorize this level of spending, and we hope that she gets the public support she needs.\For proof of the wisdom of such support, voters can look to the success of the state's Stewardship Fund, which has similarly been used to keep Wisconsin green with spending of $25 million each year for 10 years.\So far, the $250 million program - which runs through next year - has helped protect the lower Wisconsin River and nearby Devils Lake State Park along with lesser-known naturescapes.\Rep. Spencer Black, D-Madison, who helped create the Stewardship Fund in 1989, called last week for the fund to be reauthorized for another 10 years. In addition, Black wants to double the amount of money in the fund.\Although he is not on the task force that will formulate a new program, Black has a lot of pull as the father of the successful Stewardship program and as the Legislature's leading environmentalist.\Doubling the size of the fund is crucial, argues Black, who notes that land prices in Wisconsin have skyrocketed since the program went into effect in 1990.\The renewed program, dubbed ""Stewardship 2000,"" would invest about a quarter of 1 percent of Wisconsin's budget in land protection, Black estimates.\It seems even more practical when compared to a drastic initiative in New Jersey, where Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman hopes to preserve a million acres in her ""Garden State.""\Whitman intends to spend nearly $2 billion for a 10-year preservation plan that includes a statewide gas tax hike and a car rental surcharge.\The Republican governor realizes that natural landscape, even in a state as maligned as New Jersey, is a region's best currency.\Wisconsin's scenery gets a much better exchange rate. It's important that we have leaders who know that green is worth a lot more in its natural form."
314,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
315,"MADISON - Gov.-elect Tony Evers on Friday added four more faces to his Cabinet — including an advocate of raising revenue for Wisconsin roads to lead the state's Department of Transportation.\But the GOP leader of the state Senate cast doubt on Evers' pick for DOT just hours after his name was announced, putting the lobbyist's confirmation in jeopardy.\Evers named new leaders of agencies overseeing public utilities, insurance, agriculture and transportation. Among them is Craig Thompson, executive director of the Wisconsin Transportation Development Association, as DOT secretary.\Transportation has been a divisive and controversial issue in recent years and most recently set Evers apart from Gov. Scott Walker in the general election.\Thompson would take over an agency with recent turnover as officials there struggled to find common ground with Walker, who would not entertain the idea of raising the state's tax burden to pay for road projects.\""It's a daunting endeavor — I don't underestimate that. But I'm ready to get started,"" Thompson said at a Friday news conference in Madison.\Thompson was a vocal advocate of finding new revenue for road projects during a protracted debate during the last state budget cycle, during which disagreements over transportation funding prompted an impasse among Republicans and delayed passage of the 2017-'19 state budget.\Thompson has said raising the state's gas tax or increasing license plate registration fees would be necessary to find a long-term solution for road projects, and his organization is behind the ""Just Fix It"" campaign.\The ""Just Fix It"" campaign advocated during the 2018 election cycle for more revenue for roads, which was perceived by some as campaigning against the sitting governor.\Thompson could have a rough road to confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said in a statement Friday: ""Governor-elect Evers would be better served by nominating someone who worked in a less controversial role during previous policy debates.""\In an interview on WISN-AM (1130), Fitzgerald said some GOP senators have said Thompson's past role as a lobbyist ""seems possibly inappropriate or a little out of line with what they would expect when the Gov.-elect puts a name out there.""\Fitzgerald also said a group of Republican senators in southeastern Wisconsin will likely want to see a DOT secretary that is going to ""want to see efficiency within the transportation budget.""\Craig Thompson won the endorsement of former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson on Friday, who said Craig Thompson (no relation) ""understands the needs of our transportation system as well as anyone who has ever held the position.""\Evers also on Friday announced he has appointed Brad Pfaff to lead the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. Pfaff currently works for U.S. Rep. Ron Kind and previously oversaw the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency under the Obama administration.\Rebecca Cameron Valcq, an attorney at Quarles & Brady in the Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Practice Group, will lead the Public Service Commission.

316,"As the Legislature moves closer to approving Gov. Scott Walker's deal to bring a large Foxconn factory to the state, many in state government are lauding the move as the best thing to hit Wisconsin since cheese and crackers.\We all want to see more jobs for our state -- no one wants less employment -- but the Foxconn deal has so many question marks, we'd be foolish to rush into it without getting some answers first.\Patrick Durkin's Aug. 12 column in The Post-Crescent covered the environmental questions perfectly. It's recommended reading, asking if we should abandon 150 years of land and water stewardship just to entice the Taiwanese corporate giant into building a factory in southeast Wisconsin.\I suppose it's been coming for some time: Walker has lowered the environmental bar more than any governor in my lifetime, but this move is especially dangerous. Giving Foxconn a free pass on dredging, discharging and construction near wetlands and rivers risks permanent wetlands loss and pollution that not only will foul local rivers and streams, but also will make its way into Lake Michigan.\The financial aspects of the deal are no less disconcerting. Foxconn will be given $3 billion in incentives to locate here, and if that holds, Wisconsin taxpayers won't get to the break-even point until at least 2042.\Additionally, the deal includes another $250 million in borrowing to upgrade Interstate 94 between Milwaukee and the Illinois border. We've been at a stalemate for years on how to fund road construction and repair, because the governor refuses to consider raising the gas tax. The apparent answer is to borrow more money. The interest on that loan alone will add another $400 million to the bill by 2042.\Make no mistake, this deal is as much about politics as it is about jobs. Walker will use this deal as his ticket to a third term. Foxconn will get him closer, supposedly, to his goal of adding 250,000 more jobs in Wisconsin -- except that was supposed to be done by the end of 2014. He's guessing you've forgotten about that promise.\Borrowing the money allows him to say he's done everything without raising taxes, even though fees for state park admission have increased, while the DNR, public schools and the UW System have suffered debilitating cutbacks.\Foxconn has a record of promising jobs that never come to pass. Four years ago, Foxconn said it would build a factory in Pennsylvania and hire 500 workers. Pennsylvania was understandably elated.\But nothing was ever built.\In 2014, Foxconn announced a $1 billion investment in Indonesia. And nothing happened.\Walker is promising 13,000 jobs, but the deal with Foxconn doesn't guarantee that -- the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported the company plans to employ 3,000 people with no guarantee it'll go higher.\We've been told that the average salary will be $53,000 per year, but Foxconn says wages will be $13-$15 per hour, which comes to about $30,000 per year.\And what happens when these jobs are replaced by technology? In China, Foxconn is currently replacing 60,000 workers with machines. What happens to Wisconsin workers when their jobs are taken by robots? Will Foxconn pay for their retraining? Will the state?\Let's hope the Legislature doesn't rush into a deal that may leave us with a permanently scarred environment, or our children holding the bag on a one-sided financial arrangement.\Along with jobs, Wisconsin taxpayers need some guarantees and solid financing -- not just more borrowing and promises.\Tom Clementi is an Appleton resident.

The prestige of the party leaders is on the line.""\Among the key parts of the two-year, $58 billion state budget agreement reached by leaders of the state Senate, Assem-bly and Doyle on Friday are:\Tobacco tax: Cigarette taxes will increase $1 to $1.77 per pack.\Gas tax: The deal rejects a plan to charge oil companies a 2.5 percent tax on oil sold in the state.\Hospital tax: Hospitals will not have to pay a 0.8 percent tax on their revenues.\University: The University of Wisconsin System will receive a funding increase of $159 million, which is $21 million short of what Doyle and the system wanted. Republicans wanted to spend $120 million less.\Property taxes: The cap on local property tax increases will remain at 2 percent.\Health care: Allows all parents to buy state-subsidized health care for their children, regardless of income, as well as 70,000 low-income adults to buy into such programs.\Wisconsin Covenant: The deal authorizes the program, which promises eighth-graders who meet certain goals during high school a slot in the UW System or at a technical college.\Financial aid: A $32 million increase in financial aid for low-income students over two years. Includes an additional $12 million to pay for a free tuition benefit for Wisconsin veterans.\Environment: The deal authorizes $85 million in bonding per year for the Stewardship program, which enables the state to purchase land and distribute grants to conservation groups and local governments to buy land to protect wilderness.\Sex offenders: Serious sex offenders will be tracked for the remainder of their life with GPS technology.\Autism: The plan rejects a proposal to require health insurers to cover autism.\Real estate fee: A plan to double the real estate transfer fee, paid by people selling their houses, is not included.\Tax cuts: Residents will be able to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums from their state income taxes starting next year.

318,"Thumbing through WisPolitics' impressive new almanac on who's who in state government and how to reach them, I ran across a big ad by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the powerful statewide lobby that protects the interests of manufacturers and other business owners.\The ad touts a Chief Executive Magazine rating of the states, which puts Wisconsin among the top 20 pro-business states in the nation, thanks, presumably, to Scott Walker and the Republicans who hold sway in the state Capitol. \Obviously, that's not good enough for the corporate powers that WMC is beholden to because the ad excitedly proclaims ""10 ways Wisconsin can break into the top 10 business states in the nation!"" \Just so you know that it's time to hold on to your hats while the current Legislature is in town, let me tell you what those 10 ways entail: \1. Reduce the individual income tax rate by repealing the new 7.75 percent bracket created in 2009 for income greater than $230,000. \2. Reduce the corporate income tax rate by lowering the current 7.9 percent rate to the new top individual income tax rate. \3. Reduce income taxes paid by manufacturers by fully phasing in the manufacturers' income tax credit, which virtually eliminates income taxes paid by manufacturers. \4. Pass the iron mining reform bill that's in the Legislature. \5. Change Wisconsin's environmental and human resources regulations so they are never more excessive than federal regulations. \6. Enact comprehensive lawsuit reform and ensure transparency in our legal system. \7. Improve the quality of labor market data and use it to identify and align education and employment in today's economy. \8. Ensure our educational systems are adequately preparing and counseling our students with the skill sets and information necessary to be gainfully employed in good-paying careers. \9. Keep highway construction projects on time by preventing delays and the ensuing cost overruns. \10. Ensure transportation infrastructure is adequately funded by providing sustainable revenue streams. \See the pattern? \Make sure that those ""poor"" folks who make more than $230,000 a year get a tax cut along with the corporations, which already have a basketful of tax breaks and taxpayer-financed incentives to reduce their tax loads. Guess who will have to make up for all those tax breaks for the big guys to keep state government functioning? The little guys, of course. \You might think that behind those 10 goals is the big business community's deeply held belief that government needs to be reduced. \Perhaps that's the case, especially for programs that aid the poor and elderly, protect the environment or regulate unfair and unethical business practices. But it's not so when it comes to programs that corporations hold dear. \That's when the government should play a bigger role in making sure the education system churns out graduates who suit the business community's interests. Heaven knows, it doesn't want to have to pay for training workers itself. \And, of course, road building (those construction companies are big WMC members) must continue unabated and needs to be ""adequately funded"" by ""sustainable revenue streams.""

319,"
President Obama says we must improve it. Gov. Scott Walker is committed to funding it. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos says we must come up with new revenue sources for it. ""It"" is our transportation infrastructure.
\
The debate is red hot in Wisconsin. I read with interest the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's April 30 editorial, ""State needs to build better transportation budget,"" which seems to support funding for projects that benefit Milwaukee but not for others outside the 414 area code. The paper appropriately cited projects such as the Zoo and Marquette Interchange improvements as ""needed"" while questioning the need to widen I-39/90 from Madison to the Illinois border.
\
Really?
\
Businesses that the I-39/90 NOW Coalition represents wholeheartedly disagree with limiting improvements to the greater Milwaukee area. That editorial said Wisconsin is ""putting too much into new or expanded highway construction,"" implying it's unnecessary during these tough budget times.
\
We've waited years for the highway projects planned in our region. They're vital to safety, job creation and an improved business environment in communities we serve. Rather than new roads, these are improvements to corridors that are also nearly 50 years old, have crumbling pavement and bridges, and are congested and unsafe. As they're rebuilt, it makes sense to incorporate additional capacity--at fractions of overall costs--given that they must serve the state's economic and travel needs for the next 50-75 years.
\
We also take issue with the editorial's position that this budget is unbalanced, in that it emphasizes new or expanded highway construction over transit and maintaining highways and local roads.
\
For starters, the highway construction budget for projects outside the Milwaukee area is actually declining under the governor's proposal. At the same time, funding for highway maintenance would increase more than $50 million and state aid for local roads would largely be maintained. We understand the value of transit, and we support shifting its revenue source from the declining Transportation Fund to the more stable General Fund.
\
In fact, under Walker's budget, transit aid isn't cut; it's shifted in the second year to the General Fund, which should see natural revenue growth. In our view, this isn't an unbalanced proposal.
\
We agree that it's time for a discussion about adequate transportation funding and applaud Speaker Vos for recommending a dialogue on tolling to help raise revenue. The Transportation Finance & Policy Commission spent most of 2012 examining the state's transportation needs and funding issues over the next 10 years.
\
While the commission issued some reasonable financing recommendations, including a 5-cent increase in the gas tax, the Legislature has shut down any discussion of raising revenue to help cover critical needs anywhere--highway improvements, road maintenance or transit.
\
We believe that, in spite of the recently identified budget deficit for transportation funding, cutting more from highway spending is a bad idea. The governor is making budget changes that maintain commitments to highway maintenance and shift funding sources for the benefit of stronger transit systems. We support these changes.

320,"
A trainload of public officials and business leaders took a ride into Amtrak's possible future Tuesday and found a vehicle to promote some of their own transportation causes.
\
Amtrak and the state Department of Transportation chartered the high-tech, Danish-made Flexliner for a trip from Milwaukee to Glenview, Ill., and back to demonstrate the latest in passenger rail service.
\
The Flexliner will be running four of six daily round trips on the Milwaukee-to-Chicago Hiawatha line from Friday through June 29, and again in September.
\
Railroad and state officials emphasized the train's comfortable seats, panoramic windows and smooth, quiet ride, along with audio systems at each seat, outlets for laptop computers and public cellular telephone booths. Passengers reacted enthusiastically to those features.
\
""I think it's great,"" said Dester Martin, president of the African American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Milwaukee. ""The ride is smooth. The view is nice.""
\
State Railroad Commissioner Rodney Kreunen said the train's amenities create ""a friendly environment that encourages the business rider to use it.""
\
The demonstration also gave some officials a chance to push for increased funding for Amtrak, passenger rail service to Waukesha County and Watertown, and an Amtrak stop in Kenosha. It also gave them a chance to rap highways.
\
Gov. Tommy Thompson said he would like to see the Flexliner running permanently between Milwaukee and Chicago and between Milwaukee and Watertown. Then he urged anyone who agrees to lobby Congress to earmark 0.5 cent per gallon of the federal gas tax for Amtrak.
\
The half-cent would raise $700 million a year, which could be used to buy modern trains like the Flexliner and upgrade railroad stations in Milwaukee and elsewhere, Amtrak President Thomas Downs said.
\
Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist, a rail advocate and highway critic, noted that Amtrak's operating budget of $200 million a year is less than half the $460 million estimate to rebuild the Marquette Interchange in downtown Milwaukee.
\
High ridership this summer would be crucial to justifying purchase of the Flexliner, which costs $5 million to $6 million, state Transportation Secretary Charles Thompson said. Flexliner seats sold out almost every day during a recent demonstration in Missouri, Downs said.
\
Thompson and Downs also said they have been negotiating through conference calls with the chief executive officer of Canadian Pacific to use the freight railroad's tracks to extend the Hiawatha run for commuter service. Canadian Pacific has been reluctant, but Thompson and Downs expressed optimism.
\
Meanwhile, Kenosha officials aboard the train cornered Thompson and Downs to lobby for adding a Kenosha stop to the Hiawatha, which stops only at Sturtevant and Glenview between Milwaukee and Chicago. Downs called their interest a sign ""that rail passenger service is back,"" and told his staff to look into the idea.
\
Chicago's Metra commuter railroad already serves Kenosha. However, Kenosha County Executive John Collins said Kenosha business people want faster service to Chicago and rail access to Milwaukee.
\
The Flexliner operates without a locomotive. Instead of turning around at Glenview, engineers walked to the other end of the train and activated the controls there.
\
For the demonstration, Amtrak linked two 140-passenger Flexliners into a single six-car train. The trains are on loan from the Israeli national railroad, and their light switches are labeled in English and Hebrew.
\
In addition to Israel, Flexliners now operate in Sweden and Denmark and soon will enter service in Spain. The Hiawatha demonstration is part of a two-year North American tour set up by the manufacturer, Adtranz.

""Mike's a member of the do-nothing Legislature,"" Conn said of Powers.\ Bergum also was critical of the Legislature's session. ""There should have been a ban on same-sex marriages and there should be something done to make it easier for a farmer to market agricultural products,"" he said.\ Powers defends his time in office.\ ""I was very happy, in my first term, to be part of a process that delivered the largest property tax reduction ever. I support the governor's budget. I opposed increases in the sales tax, increases in hunting and fishing licenses, increases in vehicle registration costs and increases in the gas tax,"" Powers said. ""I want the government to continue to deliver as much property tax relief as possible.""\ Powers said he believes, from his travels through the district, that one of the things people are most concerned with is affordable health care.\ ""The state has underfunded several key provisions concerning health care, and that and, especially, the costs of long-term care need to be addressed,"" Powers said.\ ""I see in the upcoming term a need for a continued push for higher educational standards and a measure of that achievement. We need to implement state standards and a graduation test,"" Powers added.\ Conn said a top issue for him is rearranging the priorities of state government.\ ""The real problem is the balance in state government.

Two environmental groups Thursday accused Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of giving road builders and other special interests preferential treatment in return for more than $2 million in campaign contributions, a charge Thompson's aides flatly denied.
\
The Sierra Club and 1000 Friends of Wisconsin said that in the last eight years, Thompson received $2.3 million in contributions from special interests that benefited most from what they described as the administration's road building binge.
\
""The governor has never said `no' to a major highway expansion project,"" the environmental groups say in their report, ""Pothole Payback."" ""The road builders and developers get the payback while we get potholes and more traffic on our local streets.""
\
According to the report, the Thompson administration gives greater weight to economic development and traffic flow in approving highway projects. Driver safety is secondary, and community concerns, environmental issues and land receive even less priority, it says.
\
The report also recommends a shift in funding to make local streets safer and help provide property tax relief.
\
In accusing Thompson of rewarding his contributors, the groups cited among their sources a recent analysis of the governor's campaign contributions by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a non-partisan campaign finance watchdog.
\
Since 1999, Thompson has received more than $285,000 from road builders, $397,000 from transportation interests, $555,000 from Realtors and more than $1 million from construction interests.
\
""Why would Governor Thompson and the DOT put developer interests and traffic flow ahead of concerns about safety, sprawl, community and real property tax relief,"" asked Brett Hulsey, a Sierra Club leader and co-author of the report. ""Just follow the money.""
\
But Transportation Secretary Charles Thompson and Bob Wood, the governor's campaign manager, disputed the environmental groups' findings. Wood maintained that road builders, developers and others received no special treatment in return for campaign contributions.
\
""Absolutely not,"" he said. ""The governor is committed to developing a strong infrastructure that is producing one of the strongest economies in the country, while still preserving our pristine environment.""
\
Wood said that under Gov. Thompson, the state has preserved more than 200,000 acres, including the Turtle-Flambeau Flowage in Iron County.
\
""Yet the Sierra Club hasn't contributed $1 to his campaign,"" Wood said. ""Wonder how that happened?""
\
Charles Thompson defended the administration's highway priorities.
\
""As our economy has changed from a rural agricultural economy, it's been necessary to develop all-season highways to all communities across the state,"" he said. ""The past 12 years have seen significant increases in the number of jobs, and most of those jobs have occurred in rural communities that have changed from an agricultural to a manufacturing based economy.""
\
The report notes that this year, the state will receive $169 million in additional gas tax money under the new federal transportation bill. Instead of spending 70% of that on state and federal highways, more should be spent on local road repairs to make streets safer, the groups urged.

323,"McCausland live in Waunakee\ Today's topic\ Should Wisconsin raise the tax on cigarettes?\ Background: The Healthy Wisconsin Council, convened earlier this year by Gov. Jim Doyle to study health care, has suggested adding $1 to the state's 77 cents-per-pack tax as a way to pay for programs that reduce the cost of health insurance and the number of uninsured.\ Viewpoints:\ Higher cigarette tax would reduce tobacco use and increase funding for treatment.\ Cigarette taxes and the lottery only take money from the poor.\ Reasons given for raising the tax are dishonest.\ Tobacco users already are taxed at too high of a rate.\ The recent editorial in support of raising the cigarette tax is just plain wrong.\ No matter how hard you try, supporting such a tax increase is simply rationalizing a bad idea. To add a bit of perspective please consider the following:\ The cigarette tax is a ""sin tax.""\ Governments love to tax ""sin"" because such taxes are relatively easy to enact, and the governing class can feel righteous in doing so. They are actually helping the sinners by taxing them. Sinners, of course, are in a very poor position to fight back.\ Sin taxes are unique in that they are simultaneously effective and non-effective, with government doing well in both cases.\ These taxes work well in that they generate serious amounts of money for state coffers. They work very poorly in that the supply of sin and sinners never seems to diminish. Thus, the sinning goes on while the money flows in - a true legislative coup.\ If you really think the Legislature and governor will not appropriate the $228 million of additional funds and use it to prop up spending programs unrelated to smoking, then you are being naive. They have done it before (tobacco settlement money, transportation fund, etc.), and they will do it again.\ The idea that it is somehow merely a matter of smokers' paying more to underwrite their health-care costs is poor public policy.\ We do not require it of alcoholics, compulsive gamblers or bad drivers, so why is it fair for smokers? After all, the roughly $200 million in annual tobacco taxes already being collected by the state of Wisconsin more than covers smokers' added health-care costs.\ Tobacco taxes disproportionately impact the poor and minorities, particularly in Wisconsin. So how is it proper to balance the budget on the backs of those least able to afford it? These folks don't have much to begin with. Why can't we let them enjoy their cigarettes?\ This, of course, is also the reason why roughly 75 percent of Wisconsin residents accept this tax - they don't smoke. Please be honest. Support the cigarette tax increase if you want, but do not claim to do so as a benefit for smoking-cessation programs or to pay for added costs imposed by smokers.\ The only rationale for increasing cigarette taxes is to generate an additional $228 million in revenue, because there is no fiscal discipline in Madison and the state needs more funds.\ Generating that revenue from a group that cannot effectively oppose the additional taxation is simply an easy means to the desired end.\ Best way to take money from the poor\ Certainly - raise the cigarette tax. The cigarette tax and the lottery are the best way for the state to get money from the poor.\ - Roger Rulseh, Madison\ Smokers already paying high taxes\ Perhaps we should attach a sugar tax to the cigarette tax bill. That way we could use some of that money to help pay the costs associated with obesity.\ Then we can add an additioal gas tax to help cover costs of highway maintenance and reverse the effects of pollution on our environment. Obviously people can afford it, since they don't need sugar to live on and so many of them drive SUVs.\ Or we could accept the fact that cigarettes are legal and provide a steady source of income for a lot of family farms in Wisconsin.\ Well targeted taxes are an essential part of our government funding, but it seems that tobacco users are already taxed at an extremely high rate.\ - Derek A. Stone, Hager City"
324,"Mike Ivey is a business reporter at The Capital Times. His e- mail address is mivey@madison.com.\As president and CEO of the Placon Corp., Dave Boyer brought the concept of sustainability to a local manufacturing company.\Under Boyer's guidance, Placon now stands as one of the better examples of a local company doing business with an eye on reducing its impact on the planet.\By taking a close look at what came in the door at 6096 McKee Rd., the company was able to limit what went out the other end.\Placon - which manufacturers plastic packaging containers - now recycles virtually all its scrap material. Things that can't be recycled were eliminated from the operation.\""About the only garbage we throw out is food from employees' lunches . . . I guess we could compost that if we really wanted to,"" said Boyer, who estimates the company saves $500,000 a year just on landfill tipping fees.\Boyer recently left Placon after 15 years and is now ready to apply his interest in sustainability to another local company. He and business partner Joan McNulty, a former Placon colleague, are about to close on the acquisition of a Madison-based manufacturing company.\""It's something I've wanted to pursue for a long time,"" says Boyer, 44.\Boyer will also be in the spotlight this Saturday when he delivers the keynote address at a conference on sustainability at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\Titled ""Sustainable Wisconsin: How We Can Make It Happen,"" the event runs Friday through Sunday and includes an array of workshops on topics from energy and transportation to business and health.\Sustainability is perhaps best described as a way of living that leaves the world in a better condition for the next generation.\""Given the structures in our society and our economic and political systems, that hasn't been an easy thing to do,"" says David Liebl, a faculty associate in the UW-Madison School of Engineering, who is organizing the conference.\Sustainability has traditionally been considered an environmental concept, a way of reducing the use of natural resources and the human impact on the planet.\But the concept is being applied more frequently within the context of the entire business community, fostering a new way of assessing economics and commerce. It's even being used to argue for better wages and working conditions for employees, with the understanding that people are the most vital resource of all.\Nationally, one of the best examples of a business committed to sustainability is Interface Inc., the Atlanta-based commercial carpet company.\When carpet wears out or becomes soiled, it is usually tossed into a landfill. But Interface has completely changed the way it thinks about floor covering.\Rather than selling carpet for offices and other large buildings, the company leases its carpet, which allows it to control the product from beginning to end. Old carpet is recycled into new stuff.\Instead of selling carpet itself, Interface now sells ""the service of carpet"" - its warmth, texture and color.\""They have completely redefined their business,"" says Boyer.\That kind of creative thinking will likely determine what businesses thrive in the next century. As the supply of natural resources dwindles and the price increases, companies that figure out new ways to do business may also find their bottom line improved.\The Sustainable Wisconsin conference will attempt to bring out some of those ideas. To register call 263-1672.\No free ride: A new report estimates that each household in southeastern Wisconsin spends $10,500 annually on private automobile ownership and maintenance. That also includes the costs of roads, accidents, pollution and congestion.\The study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a Washington D.C.-based non-profit research group, was conducted in cooperation with Citizens for a Better Environment.\While the study looked at seven counties in southeastern Wisconsin, Rob Kennedy of CBE in Madison notes that the costs are likely higher per household in Dane County because of the lower percentage of low-income people here.\Kennedy says the most striking finding in the study is that 22 percent of local gas taxes and fees are exported outside the county where they were collected. This revenue loss, he says, is largely a subsidy for rural road building programs.\""If Dane County was able to get all of its gas tax money back, we'd have had a light rail system here 15 years ago,"" he says."
325,"Globalization clash will define future\The Western world is setting up for a clash between nationalism and globalization. \Nationalism carries negative and positive connotations - somewhere between parochial isolation and justifiable national pride. So, too, does globalization. Initially it was protested by skinheads and anarchists, now globalization is defined by the social culture of Europe and its project, the European Union. \Add in the issues of the day, such as immigration, the environment and economy, and see how the aspects of each split between nationalism and globalization. \Conservatives are uncomfortable with border-less countries and an absence of vetting, the environmentalism that leads to higher energy costs and a regulatory smothering of the economy. \Liberals seek the globalization of governance by world courts and the United Nations, global climate treaties, open borders and a Utopian control of all aspects of the economy, society, education, medicine and private markets. \Given the sub-tribal nature of most humans, the pendulum may be swinging toward more, not less, local control and nationalism. \Brad Taylor, Madison\We need new ideas to fund highways \I'm disappointed again to see the governor and Legislature can't get together to solve another transportation budget dilemma. \It once was common, even for divided state government, to come together in bipartisan agreement on this issue. \Wisconsin's interstate highway system is in dire need of attention. \It's time to change its funding structure to maintain and repair our infrastructure now, and to plan and prepare for the future, which will call for a vastly different fleet of vehicles. We must plan for smart cars and trucks, which will improve safety and provide even more efficiency in moving people and commerce. We may see separate trucking lanes to carry automated trucking in closely spaced vehicles, moving safely alongside of - and not impeding - other travelers. \The entire interstate system should eventually be funded directly by its users via tolling. Nationally, that should happen as soon as possible. \I would further suggest that the federal gas tax be completely returned to state jurisdiction with strings attached that states would be required to spend the 18 cent windfall on their state and local highway systems, without reducing existing state driver and vehicle fees. \These two actions would solve the highway funding dilemmas that all states are facing while providing sustainable, fair and equitable funding for the long term. \Thomas Carlsen, Scottsdale, Arizona, former Wisconsin Department of Transportation secretary\Column was regular tea party fare \Nancy Milholland's column May 7, ""Time to finally pass tax reform,"" is right out of the tea party playbook. \She claims the Tax Foundation is in favor of the Better Way agenda. Sounds good if you didn't know they are a right-wing ""think"" tank. \She states that our corporate income tax rate is the highest in the world at 35 percent, and the tax code consists of 75,000 pages. In reality, most corporations don't pay anywhere near 35 percent because those 75,000 pages include myriad tax breaks designed to reduce their tax liability. \She applauds the idea of removing the ""death tax,"" which is the way her ilk describe the estate tax that only affects a fraction of the top 1 percent and is designed to prevent financial dynasties from growing too powerful. \She mentions that Grover Norquist thinks the new tax plan is a good idea. He is the guy who once said, ""I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub."" \His acolytes, one of whom is our governor, have done major damage to their states. \Art Naebig, La Valle\It's getting harder to respect presidency \When a Russian photographer is allowed into the White House and the American press was barred, we should be rioting in the streets. \The White House is our house. It belongs to us, not the president. \We allow him to live there with our votes, but he does not have the right to treat us with such disdain. \I always try to treat the office of the president of the United States with a decorum of respect, but this administration is making it difficult. \Karen Manogue, Sauk City"
326,"Both parties failed to fix health care\I'm disgusted with Congress and health care. \Let me start with the Republicans. They had seven years to formulate a health care alternative to the Affordable Care Act that both House and Senate Republicans could agree on. \What did they do? Nothing. \They waited until President Donald Trump was elected, then they got into multiple battles over what the legislation should look like without a clue over how to come together with a viable proposal. In the end, they have nothing. It is pathetic. \Now for the Democrats. They had seven years to fix the terribly flawed Obamacare legislation and did nothing. Neither Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Black Earth, nor Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, did anything meaningful to improve Obamacare. It seems the Democrats were too worried they might sully the reputation of President Barack Obama if they tinkered with his signature piece of legislation. It is pathetic. \In the end, I wish we could vote out the entire Congress and start over with representatives who were willing to work for the good of the country and not spend time spinning their wheels worrying about getting re-elected and dumping on the other party. Our country is really in a mess right now. \Joseph Tripalin, McFarland\Let religious groups help refugees \President Donald Trump's travel ban, which is still working its way through the court system, should make allowances for long-established religious organizations to sponsor refugees, whether or not they are coming from a restricted country. \Many of these organizations have a long history of providing humanitarian aid throughout the world. Religious groups would be responsible for refugees socially, financially and legally, ensuring they comply with requirements for their visa or refugee status during their stay. \For decades, if not centuries, many members of religious communities have put their lives on the line providing humanitarian aid throughout the world. Those same organizations should be able to provide a secure environment for refugees whose lives are on the line simply because they are living in the wrong place at the wrong time. \Craig Schultz, Madison \Teens need good parents, not curfew \The malls in Madison want to enforce a curfew for teens. Parents would have to accompany anyone under 18 on weekend evenings. This has been done in the Milwaukee area for several years. \Let me tell you, if my boys (who are now in their 30s) had caused trouble at a mall as teens, they would still be grounded. \Parents, do your jobs. \There is no excuse for raising ill-behaved people. Quit complaining and learn to be good parents. \Sue Veeder, Madison\Johnson should investigate hacking \U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, is chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security. \Considering the reports of Russian hacking of our election system, you would think he would be concerned about the integrity and security of our national political system. Apparently, he's not. Or maybe he figures other committees are sufficient. We do not know because he hasn't said much of anything about the issue. \I am not involved in the election process beyond voting, so I do not know enough to tell if there is any real problem. But others have listed them. It could be just sour grapes from the losers, but the hacking and collusion are worth investigation. \I am guessing that Sen. Johnson and others who should be dealing with this are stonewalling because their team won. They can call the shots, and they do not want to rock the boat. \They are putting party before country, even though their oath of office says something different. \Joe Brockert, Madison\GOP continues to be hypocritical \Well, there they go again. \The party of fiscal conservatives and small government wants to borrow money for roads and dictate to UW what procedures resident physicians should be taught. \The solution to our poor roads is obvious: Raise the gas tax. Of course they don't want to be accused of raising taxes, so let's just call it a user fee. I don't ever want to see a toll road in Wisconsin. \They don't want government involved in health care, yet they propose a law that would cause OB-GYN residents to lose their program's national accreditation.

To get your free can, just show up at the Packers Hall of Fame, 1109 Lombardi Ave. between noon and 5 p.m.\ I'll bet some fans from Madison even party right on through and make the drive to Green Bay Monday to get their free Coke.\ Great hangover remedy. Wisconsin's Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. has ""claimed victory""in the battle between Wisconsin and Massachusetts, home of the New England Patriots, over which state produces the most cranberries and hopes it carries over to the Super Bowl. According to the USDA's cranberry report released this week, Wisconsin produced 1.93 million barrels of cranberries in 1996, compared with 1.75 million in Massachusetts. Together that is 80 percent of the nation's total crop.\ ""Growing cranberries in Wisconsin and Massachusetts requires much effort and year-round dedication, similar to both state's successful football teams,"" says an Ocean Spray grower from Wisconsin Rapids.\ You might also add that growing cranberries degrades natural wetlands and is one reason Wisconsin has lost 95 percent of its native wetlands to development.\ Speaking of wetlands, the state's environmental groups have also jumped on the Packer bandwagon. Their ""Green and Gold Agenda"" released this week aims to alert citizens to continuing threats to the quality of life in Wisconsin.\ ""Our goal isto protect Wisconsin's families, our environment and our future -- and protect Brett Favre in the pocket"" says the report.\ The report then launches into a list of Gov.

Of course, Gov. Thompson's well-oiled public relations machine has been cranking it up as well. This past week, visitors to the new Agriculture Department building could have gotten their foam cheeseheads stamped with a ""Grade AA Wisconsin Cheese"" stamp.

328," On the theory that you can't keep a bad idea down, the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce is planning a statewide summit to re-open the idea of transforming the state's freeways into feeways.\ That's right. The charging of tolls, an evil practice that most of us associate only with despicable states such as Illinois, once again has powerful backing from the business community.\ A right-wing group funded by the Bradley Foundation first floated the idea of tollways two years ago as the perfect way to pay for the $1 billion rebuilding of Milwaukee's Marquette Interchange, the state's busiest freeway intersection, without raising taxes.\ At the time, some of us raised a few niggling objections to toll roads, such as the way they would enrage everyone who drives a motor vehicle, destroy our entire regional transportation system and drive traffic racing away from Milwaukee at high speeds, leaving downtown a desiccated, abandoned shell.\ Gov. Jim Doyle declared his unwavering opposition to tollways in Wisconsin, and not even Republican legislators firmly in the pocket of the road builders succeeded in getting a bill to the floor of the Assembly or Senate.\ That doesn't mean we can let down our guard. Never underestimate the power of a terrible idea. Wisconsin wisely abolished the death penalty more than 150 years ago, and we always seem to be one media- sensationalized murder away from reinstating it.\ The best arguments supporters can come up with for reconsidering tollways sound like really good arguments against them.\ They tell us not to worry about the inconvenience of stopping hundreds of thousands of cars at toll booths, backing up traffic to approximately Iowa.\ Modern technology has taken care of all that, they say. Under the speed pass systems that now exist, electronic devices can be installed on all cars so the government can track them whenever they use freeways.\ For cars that don't have such handy government tracking devices, cameras can be installed on freeways that would take pictures of the license plate of every motorist. After our every move has been added up by the government, we will receive a convenient monthly bill in the mail.\ You don't have to be planning to drive a getaway car or be a member of a right-wing survivalist group paranoid about black government helicopters to oppose a Big Brother system of constant surveillance. You just have to believe in America.\ Logically, the current system seems much more fair by simply spreading the cost of freeways equally across everyone who drives in the state through gasoline taxes.\ Freeways don't just benefit those who drive on them. They benefit those who drive on local streets as well by diverting high volumes of traffic. That benefit would be destroyed if freeways charged tolls and, let's say, 18 billion cars began using neighborhood streets every day.\ Since tolls could have serious unintended consequences for our transportation system and they are so unpopular with the public, why would any politician ever consider the idea?\ Part of it goes back to the political demonization of taxes. Politicians really believe they can posture as heroes for cutting gasoline taxes. They think voters aren't smart enough to realize that tolls have to be paid with the same legal tender.\ There is another recent cultural development that has added a secret political appeal to reducing the ""burden"" on those who pay gasoline taxes. Quietly, in recent years, the gas tax has become a much more progressive tax.\ It turns out that wealthy, white, suburban voters - those who are most able to pay - now pay a much greater share of gasoline taxes. That is because they've begun driving mammoth SUVs such as the Chevrolet Suburban Subdivision or the Ford Himalayan Mountain Range, which are large enough to be seen from space.\ That is why gas prices are such a hot political issue these days. Anything that annoys people of privilege is automatically of enormous importance to politicians. The things that bother poor people - like where their next meal is coming from - are of very little concern to politicians.\ * I f politicians really wanted to protect our natural environment - something they all make speeches about on Earth Day - they would double gasoline taxes to discourage the trend toward gigantism in internal combustion vehicles.\ Oddly enough, that also might be the best thing they could do for the American automobile companies. Anyone with any sense of history can see another industry crash coming.\ The last time Detroit switched all its production lines over to building enormous boats, it got stuck with an extinct species of dinosaurs with tail fins. The public suddenly wanted smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. All it takes is another oil crisis, which could happen any hour.\ The good news is that will reduce everyone's gasoline taxes. Tolls, on the other hand, are forever.\ Joel McNally of Milwaukee writes a weekly column for The Capital Times. E-mail: jmcnally@wi.rr.com"

As the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee scrambles this week to finish up its work on 1997-'99 state budget, the panel has approved and rejected a variety of measures that had been included in Gov. Tommy Thompson's budget plan.
\
While some of the action taken by the committee such as increasing the gas tax or approving mandatory high school graduation tests has grabbed headlines in recent days, the group also has voted on dozens of smaller items as well.
\
The measures approved by the committee will be included in the state budget bill that still needs to be passed by the Senate and Assembly by July 1.
\
Here's a look at some of the recent action taken by the Joint Finance Committee:
\
Miller Park: Spending to cover construction costs for garages, parking lots and other projects related to the new Milwaukee Brewers stadium was backed Monday.
\
The panel voted, 11-5, to provide $12 million over two years. The money would go to infrastructure items, such as roads, parkings lots and bridges, that would be a part of the $250 million project.
\
In 1995, lawmakers approved more than $160 million to pay for the stadium itself. The new ballpark is scheduled to open for the 2000 season.
\
Senior deductions: Many senior citizens might become ineligible for a $25 income-tax credit, under a plan approved last week.
\
The committee voted, 13-3, to end the seniors' tax deduction for couples with incomes exceeding $40,000 a year, for individuals earning more than $30,000, and couples filing separate returns with incomes over $20,000 apiece.
\
The changes would save the state treasury an estimated $4.3 million in the 1997-'99 fiscal period that begins July 1, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau said.
\
DNR fees computerized: A computer system that would handle boat, snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle registrations in Wisconsin was approved last week.
\
The committee recommended, 16-0, paying $288,600 for the project in the two-year fiscal period that begins July 1.
\
The system would be run by the DNR.
\
Fugitive team: Convicts who flee from parole or probation in southeastern Wisconsin could be pursued by a special law enforcement unit under a proposal approved last week. The committee approved, 15-0, a proposal that would give $1.7 million over two years for the unit.
\
Halfway house warning: Plans to create halfway houses for ex-convicts in residential neighborhoods would need advance warnings to residents under a plan approved last week.
\
It would require the state Department of Corrections to notify law enforcement agencies, elected officials and news media of proposals to open the halfway houses.
\
The measure would let local officials publicize the plans as they see fit.
\
Wheel tax limits: Cities and counties that enact a ""wheel tax"" on motorists would be required to use the money for transportation-related purposes under a measure approved Monday.
\
The finance committee approved, 14-2, a proposal that would keep cities from using an annual registration fee or ""wheel tax"" for purposes other than transportation items.
\
Currently, wheel taxes don't have to be earmarked for specific purposes, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.
\
Snow removal: A program that would help Wisconsin cities and counties with snow removal was approved Monday. The panel voted, 11-5, to spend $100,000 a year to reimburse cities for costs related to emergency snow removal.
\
Snow removal emergencies would occur as a result of ""extraordinary or unusually large"" snowstorms, according to the measure.
\
Crime sign fees: A waiver for permit fees charged for anti-crime signs along state highways was backed Monday. The committee voted, 16-0, to waive permit fees for state Crime Stoppers signs.
\
The measure also prohibits the Department of Transportation from removing the signs unless they violate federal regulations.
\
Salvation Army exemption: Property owned by the Salvation Army in Wisconsin could be exempt from taxes under a proposal approved Monday.
\
The Boy Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts of America, the Boys Clubs of America and the Camp Fire Girls also have property-tax free status.
\
Most properties owned by those groups are camps, said Rep. Scott Jensen (R-Town of Brookfield), co-chairman of the committee.
\
Environment education: A state board that gives money to fund environmental education programs was recommended Tuesday for transfer to the University of Wisconsin.
\
The committee voted, 15-1, to approve a measure that would switch the Environmental Education Board from being a part of the state Department of Public Instruction to the UW System.
\
If approved by the full Legislature, the UW-Stevens Point Center for Environmental Education would assist the board in giving grants to fund environmental education programs to public and private schools as well as government agencies and non-profit corporations.

330,"State worked hard to cut spending, taxes, and raise wages\The holidays are a time to spend with family and friends. They are a time to reflect on the past year, and look ahead with optimism and hope to what the New Year might bring.\This past year in Wisconsin, we have experienced some great successes.\In July, I signed the state budget into law, cutting spending, cutting taxes, protecting education and implementing the tightest controls on property taxes in state history.\While there is variation from house to house and community to community, the property tax freeze I signed means that the typical Wisconsin family will see their property tax bill stay virtually the same even if their assessment went up significantly. And many families across the state from Eau Claire to West Allis to Wausau to Green Bay are actually seeing their bills go down, sometimes by hundreds of dollars.\My budget also eliminated the tax on Social Security benefits, cut the gas tax by 1 cent, and provided new tax breaks for veterans, as well as an expanded tax deduction to help families pay the cost of college.\We've had other successes this year as well.\In June, minimum wage workers in Wisconsin got their first raise in seven years, and they will get another raise next year as well.\November 2005 saw more people working in Wisconsin than any November on record.\This year, Wisconsin was selected as the nation's Stem Cell Bank, reaffirming our leadership in this incredibly promising field of medical research. As governor, I will not allow Wisconsin to fall behind in stem cell research, or give in to forces in the Legislature who want to put a stop to the important work of our scientists.\But the real successes this year happened because of the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin, who though their own determination and effort created new jobs, opened new businesses, built new homes, educated their children and contributed to our communities.\As a state, we witnessed low points throughout the past year as well.\For me, the saddest moments of the past few years have come as we have said good-bye to 51 of our brave men and women in uniform who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have been to most of these funerals and met so many great Wisconsin families. These families have sacrificed so much, but they are a constant reminder to me of what is good and honorable about Wisconsin.\Everyone is entitled to their own opinion when it comes to U.S. policy, but in Wisconsin, we stand united in our respect and admiration for these fallen soldiers. And during this holiday season our hearts go out to the families mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, wives, husbands and children whom they have left behind.\This year, we also saw the passing of two favorite sons of Wisconsin: Gaylord Nelson the founder of the modern-day environmental movement and father of Earth Day, and William Proxmire the people's advocate for transparent and honest government.\These two men were not only successful politicians, they were great statesmen. They gave true meaning to the spirit of bipartisanship, and they loved Wisconsin and the people who live here. Nelson and Proxmire left rich legacies, and all of Wisconsin mourns their loss.\And of course, the Green Bay Packers' season has not been what we hoped it would, but like most die-hard fans, I'll continue to cheer them on to the end.\As we look ahead to 2006, there are many things left undone, and so much yet to accomplish.\We must continue to focus on the things that truly matter to the people of this state. We must continue working to move Wisconsin's economy forward. We must continue to create jobs and maintain our investments in education. We need to face the challenges of health care and protecting our environment.\As governor, I'll keep working every day to make this the best state it can be, and I know the people of Wisconsin will do the same.\I look forward to working with all of the people of Wisconsin to ensure that life in this great state is filled with all of the things that make the holidays so enjoyable.\Jim Doyle has been governor of Wisconsin since 2003. His office can be reached at 1-608-261-2162."
331," An environmental assessment of proposed Madison-Milwaukee high- speed rail service found no major difficulties that could threaten to derail the project.\ The service could begin as early as 2003, with six daily round trips, if Congress enacts the $12 billion High-Speed Rail Investment Act this year. Service would later be extended to Minneapolis-St. Paul.\ Rebuilding the existing track to accommodate higher train speeds would cost an estimated $176 million with federal funds paying up to 80 percent of the cost. That amount doesn't include stations, which would be in Madison, Watertown, Oconomowoc, Brookfield and Milwaukee.\ By 2010, the report projects 872,000 riders a year will pay $20 to $33 per one-way trip to ride the train.\ ""High-speed rail is a sound public investment and a vital component to meeting our future transportation needs,"" said state Transportation Secretary Terry Mulcahy.\ The rail service would ""return direct, convenient and attractive passenger rail service between Milwaukee and Madison,"" according to the report. ""Passenger rail service can provide an additional passenger travel alternative to congested highways and weather- sensitive airports.""\ The 317-page report examines the impact of high-speed rail on the environment, property values, farmland and neighborhoods along the route.\ But opponents of high-speed rail service said a full-fledged environmental impact statement is needed for the project.\ Dan Yeh of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation said it's likely the 2003 starting date can be met if Congress approves high- speed rail funding this year. He said the funding legislation has bipartisan support.\ ""We are pretty confident with where our project stands in the planning process,"" he said. ""If the program is not passed this year, then we would have a very difficult time meeting the 2003 deadline. We think there is sufficient national leadership to get this done.""\ Yeh said the loss of former Gov. Tommy Thompson as a cheerleader won't sidetrack the project. Thompson resigned as Amtrak chairman earlier this year when he became U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.\ ""Clearly, he was a national leader for passenger rail and it is a challenge to lose that leadership,"" Yeh said. ""On the other hand, there are (other) very strong supporters of the rail program.""\ Dick Rhody of the Stop the Train Coalition said the environmental assessment is no substitute for an environmental impact statement, which would offer a more comprehensive analysis.\ ""My biggest question is whether they're going to pawn off the environmental assessment as an environmental impact statement,"" he said. ""It's like saying we've done the laundry, but we haven't bothered to use soap.""\ Rhody, who lives next to the proposed route in Sun Prairie, said he doesn't think the service ever will break even and it's unfair for car owners to subsidize the trains with the gas tax.\ But he said he believes Dane County commuter rail service is ""a great idea.""\ Despite the opposition of Rhody and others, local officials in Dane County, Sun Prairie and Madison have endorsed the high-speed rail plan.\ Here are some report findings:\ * Bypassing certain communities was considered but rejected due to added costs or negative environmental impacts.\ * The service will cause ""minimal neighborhood disruption"" because an existing rail corridor will be used where rail service predates housing development. Safety fencing ""may give the perception of severing neighborhoods.""\ * Three potential train speeds between 79 mph and 120 mph were considered and the 110 mph speed was recommended.\ * Gates that prevent vehicles from driving around crossing barriers would be installed at all grade crossings. Of 164 grade crossings on the route, 22 are recommended for closure.\ * Over half of current Madison-Milwaukee bus riders and fewer than 2 percent of those who drive are expected to ride the train.\ * Air quality could improve slightly due to a decrease in auto traffic, but there would also be a slight increase in particulate emissions due to passenger trains.\ * About 13.5 acres of wetlands would be affected by the track upgrades and would be replaced through the DOT's mitigation program.\ * A woven wire fence installed in rural areas would allow small animals to pass through it. Larger animals such as deer could jump over it. Medium-sized animals such as foxes and coyotes could dig under the fence and then get trapped on the tracks.\ If you go\ * What: Public hearings on the environmental assessment\ * When and where: 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. June 27 at Madison East High School, 2222 E. Washington Ave., and at the same time June 28 at the Riverside Middle School cafeteria, 131 Hall St. in Watertown.\ * Summary: The executive summary of the assessment is available on the Internet at www.dot.state.wi.us. Copies are available at public libraries in Madison, Marshall, Sun Prairie, Waterloo and Watertown. They also are available at town, city and village offices.\ Printed copies can be purchased from the DOT for $16 including postage or for $5.50, including postage, on CD-ROM."
332,"
A healthy economy and a taste for sport utility vehicles could stop major highway projects in southeastern Wisconsin if the state isn't careful in drawing up its anti-pollution plans, officials warned Thursday.
\
Road-builders, planners and the state Department of Transportation fear that the Department of Natural Resources will ignore economic trends and set unrealistic goals for cutting air pollution from driving. And if the area misses those goals, they're worried that the federal government could order a halt to all road expansion in a six- county area.
\
But environmentalists say more must be done to cut pollution from cars -- even if that means reviving a controversial idea to pay people to drive less.
\
The battle lines are forming as the DNR faces a federal Environmental Protection Agency deadline to come up with a plan for reducing smog in the Milwaukee area. And with utilities and other industries on track to reduce their emissions, the focus is turning to transportation.
\
If the area misses the goals set in the plan, the EPA could order a halt to all road and public transit projects that affect transportation capacity -- from widening a suburban street to tearing down the Park East Freeway or building a light-rail system, said Ken Yunker, assistant director of the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.
\
At issue is an ""emissions budget,"" due Dec. 31, in which the DNR will set limits for pollution from cars, based on forecasts of how much driving will increase in future years. Those forecasts, developed by the DOT and planning commission, come in three versions, based on whether local economic growth is high, moderate or low.
\
Economic growth is the key factor in whether people drive more because a strong economy means more workers driving to jobs and more companies shipping goods, said Phil Scherer, executive director of the Transportation Development Association.
\
The DNR is currently using the high-growth projection, but leaning toward a mix of high and moderate growth, DNR spokesman Greg Swanson said.
\
Still, the DOT, the planning commission and pro-highway forces are worried, because they think southeastern Wisconsin's economy could outpace projections and trigger sanctions. They want the DNR to pad the projections with a margin of error, said Ernie Wittwer, DOT investment management administrator.
\
Rob Kennedy, senior policy analyst for Citizens for a Better Environment, agrees the projections must be realistic but says ""every industrial sector must do its part"" to cut pollution, and transportation should follow the lead of smokestack industries.
\
That means investing more in public transit and providing more incentives for people to carpool or live closer to work, Kennedy said.
\
Some environmentalists want to go further. The New Transportation Alliance, 1,000 Friends of Wisconsin and Bicycle Federation of Wisconsin want to keep alive a proposal to pay people for driving less, even if it doesn't take the form of annual gas tax rebates of up to $2,800, said Andrea Broaddus, transportation alliance campaign director.
\
A DNR employee on Monday suggested the rebates as an alternative to building more highways. But DNR Secretary George Meyer quickly disavowed it Tuesday as ""a trial balloon"" meant to stimulate discussion. The agency is more likely to stress voluntary programs to encourage people to share rides and use public transit, said Lloyd Eagan, DNR air management director.
\
""I am not going to force anyone out of their cars,"" Eagan said.
\
Tom Walker, executive director of the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, and Ernie Stetenfeld, spokesman for the American Automobile Association of Wisconsin, said it's not fair to blame drivers for air pollution. They said environmentally friendly vehicles have contributed to a major decrease in Milwaukee-area air pollution.
\
That contention angered Broaddus, who said road-builders have a vested interest in building more highways. She pointed out that light trucks and sport utility vehicles, now the top sellers, are exempt from federal fuel-economy standards.
\
In fact, a 1993 DNR projection vastly underestimated the number of sport utility vehicles that would be on the road today, throwing off pollution forecasts, Yunker said. That's another reason to add a margin of error to the projections, he said.
\
As for industry, Eagan said his agency has been talking to companies about lowering their emissions, especially for nitrogen oxide, for more than a year. Among those planning to cut emissions are electric utilities.
\
Wisconsin Electric Power Co. of Milwaukee, for example, estimated it will spend $250 million to $300 million to install emission equipment at its coal-burning plants. Those efforts are geared to help Wisconsin and 21 other states meet EPA goals of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by 60% to 70%.
\
""We support these regional . . . reductions,"" said Wisconsin Electric spokesman Margaret Heffernan. ""This is not a big shocker for us. This is stuff that we are already working on.""
\
The DNR is required to file its plan with the EPA by Dec. 31, 2000. Polluters must meet requirements no later than 2007, although the DNR plans to be in compliance by 2005, Eagan said.

333,"Gov. Scott Walker's era of divisiveness was over, several Democratic candidates for governor agreed during a Sunday night forum at Madison La Follette High School.\""For the last eight years, Scott Walker has treated us like enemies,"" said former state Rep. Kelda Roys of Madison. ""He used the words 'divide and conquer' and that is a poison on our state. And that's going to end when one of us is governor."" \""This race has got to be about treating people with dignity. Divide and conquer is gone,"" State Superintendent Tony Evers said later in the forum. \There wasn't much division Sunday, as candidates largely agreed with each other and never directly attacked statements from each other. Even in a race with a double digit number of candidates and no clear frontrunner, much of the discussion centered on issues that united them. \Evers, Roys, Andy Gronik, Matt Flynn, Mike McCabe, Mahlon Mitchell, Paul Soglin, Kathleen Vinehout and Dana Wachs spoke at the forum. Hundreds attended the event, organized by the Madison East Side Progressives and moderated by state Rep. Melissa Sargent, a Madison Democrat. \Among the areas of general agreement: open up Badgercare for all, fully fund K-12 and post-secondary education and make major changes to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and the state corrections system. \Candidates also agreed on the importance of refinancing student loans and recommended raising the gas tax as a way to solve the state's transportation issues. \Education funding was a major theme of the night, and candidates said they were unimpressed with Walker's recent increase of almost $650 million for K-12 funding, pointing to his cuts in previous years. \""That's like taking a knife, sticking it eight inches in my back, pulling it out four inches,"" said Mitchell, president of the Professional Fire Fighters Association of Wisconsin. ""I'm supposed to say, 'Thank you'? You can't do that. We have to adequately fund education."" \Many candidates painted a picture of returning Wisconsin to its former glory, with good roads, a strong university system and a clean environment. Asked about his environmental priorities, former chairman of the state Democratic party Flynn talked about restoring the independence of the Department of Natural Resources and regulating and heavily zoning large farming operations, or CAFOs. \""I would be an environmental governor, and I'm sad I even have to say it, because we were at one time the environmental state,"" Flynn said. \This general agreement among candidates was thrown into sharp relief during a ""lightning round,"" when candidates had one sentence to respond to the idea of legalizing medical and recreational marijuana. \In just a few minutes, every candidate had declared they would support both measures, except Evers, who said he would support medical marijuana and let voters decide on recreational marijuana through a referendum. \The night wasn't devoid of unique ideas: Wachs, a state representative from Eau Claire, talked of forming an office of retention in the Department of Commerce to help keep businesses like Oscar Mayer in the state. McCabe, former head of the campaign finance watchdog Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, said he wanted to make Wisconsin the first state fully powered by renewable energy. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin was the only candidate to highlight the issue of housing, and pointed to Madison's goal to build 1,000 affordable units of housing in five years. \The question that drew the most diverse answers asked candidates to describe a successful experience outside their home culture. Stories varied from volunteering with the Peace Corps in Africa (McCabe) to working with Republicans across the aisle (Roys) to a childhood experience living in Mexico (Flynn) to representing discrimination cases as a lawyer (Wachs). \Mitchell, an African-American who grew up in Delavan, said he ""had a lot of time working with people outside of my culture. Like every day."" His more serious answer described his experience with at-risk youth as a street outreach coordinator with Briarpatch and Youth Services of Southern Wisconsin. \In their closing remarks, the candidates made the greatest effort to distinguish themselves from the others on stage. Gronik, a Milwaukee businessman, highlighted his role as a political outsider, Flynn as an aggressive candidate who could call out Walker on the ""lies and fraud of his administration."" Evers pointed to his significant lead in a recent poll, and Vinehout, a state senator, said she knows what it's like to grow up on food stamps or without health insurance. \Mitchell said Walker has faced elected officials and business leaders before, but ""Governor Walker's never seen anyone like me head to head."" McCabe said that while no campaign would raise more money than Walker's, he was prepared to run a grassroots effort to reach forgotten places and people. \Candidates said reaching voters who feel left behind by politicians will be crucial to a 2018 Democratic win. \Roys said Walker and Republicans have used the idea of an urban/rural divide to exploit Wisconsinites. Instead, she said, Democrats need to talk about the issues these areas have in common, like poor infrastructure and lack of funding for schools.\McCabe talked about the importance of connecting with rural Wisconsin, saying that Democrats can't win with just Madison and Milwaukee. \""There are too many forgotten people living in too many forgotten places around our state,"" he said. ""We have to make them a better offer than they've been made in a very long time, and that's how we take the state back.""\Credit: By Lisa Speckhard Pasque"
334,"Andre Jacque, Terry Ostrander and Jeff VanStraten are seeking to be the Republican Party's nominee for the 2nd State Assembly seat.\Rep. Ted Zigmunt, D-Francis Creek, is the first-term incumbent. The GOP primary winner on Sept. 14 will face off against Zigmunt in the fall general election set for Nov. 2.\The 2nd Assembly seat represents the city of Two Rivers, northern portions of Manitowoc County and areas in the southern part of Brown County.\The Herald Times Reporter has asked the three candidates several questions to help educate voters before the primary.\What should be the state's role in spurring job creation and business development?\Terry Ostrander\The Two Rivers resident stated: ""Much has been made about 'leveling the playing field' to spur economic and business development in the state. My view is that leveling isn't enough.\""We should be tilting that playing field in our direction. One example is to look to Delaware with regard to corporations. Not that this is the best system, but a close copy, with some tweaks and improvements. It's not just luck that over 50 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware.\""I believe that to really spur growth of business in Wisconsin, we need to find out, exactly, why a particular business left, or find out why they're contemplating that move, and fix those problems.\""We need to be more proactive in finding 'What will it take to make you stay?' as well as 'What will it take to make you locate here?'""\""First item -- reduce corporate tax. I'm not proposing elimination, but making our state a tax-friendly home for corporations seems to make sense.\""I believe it's short-sighted thinking that by increasing the amount of business taxes, we will see our personal taxes reduced. I feel the opposite is more accurate. Having more businesses located here will only add employees to fill those positions -- hence, more working people filing income taxes.\""Second item -- reinstate the Qualified Economic Offer. Seeing increased property taxes to fund salaries and benefits not only hits the individual, but is a major expense for any business already here, or a deterrent to those investigating locating here.\""Next would be to provide incentives to employers who voluntarily retrain workers utilizing our world-class universities and colleges.""\Jeff VanStraten\The Ledgeview resident stated: ""The state's job in spurring job creation and business development should start with getting rid of unnecessary mandates and lowering the tax burden on businesses.\""As a business owner myself, I know that if the state made it easier to do business and lightened the tax burden, I could afford to hire more employees.\""The state seems to want to run businesses by passing mandates and tax every aspect of business to help pay for the state's abuse of spending. We need to stop this, and I am willing to do whatever I can to change this.""\Andre Jacque\The Bellevue resident stated: ""The way for state government to assist in job creation is by getting out of the way of individuals in the private sector that are actually trying to create jobs.\""We need to cut taxes on people and businesses alike to compete regionally and nationally to spur the job growth needed to solve the state's fiscal mess.\""It's not just the national economic situation -- while Wisconsin lost more than 4 percent of our employers over the last three years, Illinois gained almost 8 percent.\""We need to repeal the new tax on employers who have created jobs here, as well as other states, and I support reversing last year's capital gains tax increase, which directly relates to business investment and retirement savings.\""I oppose the recent phone and utility tax hikes, the proposed gas tax hike that Rep. Zigmunt backed, and state mandates that go right on our property tax bill, including the garbage tax and mandated cost increases for repairing and building local government infrastructure.\""Wisconsin's regulatory environment is among the worst in the nation. Many of our restrictions on businesses to build, sell products, operate production lines and hire employees are several times stricter than comparable regulations federally and in neighboring states.\""We need to listen to what entrepreneurs and job creators in our community are saying about the obstacles they face, and as state representative, I will work tirelessly to cut taxes and enact policies that give them the opportunity to compete, to grow and to succeed."""
335,"Act of kindness greatly appreciated \While waiting to be seated at an IHOP in South Lake Tahoe recently,
we chatted with some friendly people from near Madison, a family of
four who appeared to be dad and mom and two adult daughters. \Sitting in a booth across from us, we exchanged smiles. After
breakfast, I looked for our check and assumed my wife had taken
care of it, but she said no. I asked the waitress and she said it
had been paid, but she said she didn't know who paid it and then
she smiled surreptitiously. \ So it became obvious that our newfound friends from Wisconsin had
paid our bill. Though certainly not needed, we so appreciated their
unexpected gesture. This act of random kindness confirms our faith
in the goodness of so many people in our great country. \ Unfortunately, we don't know their names, so we hope perhaps they
will remember this encounter and know what a blessing it was. \ Bobby Skelton, Dallas, Texas \
Thanks for featuring Del-Bar supper club \ I really appreciate the great article in Sunday's State Journal on
Jimmy's Del-Bar in the Wisconsin Dells area. \ I grew up in the Wonewoc area and have enjoyed going there since I
took my prom date there in 1954. Always top food and service. \ It is wonderful the restaurant will continue to be in the Wimmer

pleased. \ Larry Larson, Madison \
Mr. Rogers is the opposite of Trump \ Letters to the State Journal are not usually film reviews, but I
saw the documentary about Fred Rogers, ""Won't You Be My Neighbor,""
and feel inspired to mention the film's meaning in today's social
and political environment. \ The film is about Mr. Rogers, the creator and main character of his
eponymous PBS show. As I watched the documentary, I could not help
but feel and see the unpleasant, gaping contrast between Mr.
Rogers' neighborhood and our own. \ Fred Rogers, a registered Republican and an ordained minister,
would be appalled at what we have become. Whereas he gently stood
for acceptance and inclusion, we are now a country that separates
parents and children, and then rationalizes it. Whereas Rogers
advocated for TV that nourished empathy and human connections,
today most programming for children is about special effects and
blowing people up. Rogers tried to slow the pace of life, to create
a thoughtful, caring milieu - today's media is about action and
product placement. \ I walked out of the theater with the realization Mr. Rogers and
Donald Trump are antithetical people - one kind and wise, the other
a successful con artist. \ Andrea Thalasinos,
Madison \
Look inward to find freedom and peace \ This letter is dedicated to the suffering and the downtrodden in
our society. \ I encourage you to listen to my words and take them to heart. We
live in a time where things may seem like they are not going to get
any better. We may think that we are on a path that we can never
change. But the truth is, we all have the power to change the
course of our stories. \ What I want you to do today is examine yourself. Take a deep look
into your mind and soul and think about how happy you really are.
You must find ways to free yourself from your suffering. So you
might do things that you enjoy, or you might reach out with your
spirit and find happiness. \ The key to being free is not found within material things, but it
is found within ourselves. We humans are not permanent, our
suffering is also not permanent. Becoming free is one thing mankind
tries but often fails at accomplishing. \ We must train ourselves to let go of what ails us to find peace.
Peace is a real thing we can awaken. Try it my friends. \ Samuel Ludke, Wisconsin Rapids \
Bicyclists improve commuting for all \ Those who think bicyclists are getting a free ride should consider
the benefits that bicyclists bring to motor vehicle commuters and
also be aware of the misconception that bicyclists are not paying
anything. \ Bicycles decrease wear and tear on roads, thus decreasing road
maintenance costs. For car commuters, more bicycles means fewer
cars in that long line at the traffic light. More bicycles
translate to savings because UW-Madison and the city of Madison
don't need to provide as many parking spaces and parking ramps.
Finally, bicycles also provide benefits in terms of improved air
quality and decreased fossil fuel usage. \ As for finances, Madison has a bicycle registration fee. The
reality that Madison police have to address more urgent problems
than fee collection does not erase that fact. And, all state
bicycle trails are subject to a $5 daily or $25 annual fee. \ Anna Shen, Madison \
Use new revenue to repair our roads \ A solution for highway and road repair is right in front of the
state legislators. \ Take the new revenue from the internet sales tax and the upcoming
revenue from sports betting and designate it all to road repair.
The revenue should then be granted to and matched by county and
local governments for road repair only. \ This new funding should go a long way without raising the gas tax. \ Kent Napralla, Montello \"

In-state tuition went up 7.9 percent at Madison this fall. The maximumaverage increase in tuition next fall is projected at 7.4 percent.\ Provide $3.4 million in new state funding for the Wisconsin Higher Education Grants program for low-income students in the UW and Wisconsin technical college systems.\ Allow the UW to remit either a portion or all tuition and fees for graduate students who are fellows or are employed in the UW System."
337,"Republican actions a slap in the face\In Thursday's State Journal, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, argued for no increase in the state gas tax. In the same issue, other Republican lawmakers were calling for the end of Wisconsin's Prevailing Wage Law. \Both of these ideas are continued slaps in the face for the shrinking middle class and the expanding working poor. Wages have been stagnant, and the gap between rich and poor is expanding. Many economists from the right and left have stated a wage increase is needed. \The marketplace (business) will determine wages, argues the GOP. If we left that to business, we might still have the conditions we had in the early 20th century. Worker safety laws, the 40-hour work week, paid vacations and overtime were not ideas touted by business. \I'm not wild about taxes. But I realize they are necessary to pay for infrastructure. Republicans would rather pass costly voter ID laws. They cut programs that keep our water and environment clean, and programs that help the poor and elderly. \We need a fair tax policy which may call for some increase. Government, unlike business, should not post a sign that reads ""we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone."" \- Robert Montgomery, Madison \Thanks to protesters for helping Walker \Saturday's State Journal cartoon by Phil Hands depicting one of the Solidarity Singers or protesters or activists or whatever they choose to call themselves as best supporting actor in Gov. Scott Walker's rise to national prominence is spot on. \While the position the protesters took might have had some self-serving popularity on the Isthmus, the majority of the state agrees with the governor, as evidenced by his three election victory mandates. More importantly, the idea of personal responsibility, reigning in out-of-control government spending and balancing budgets is very popular on the national stage. \I appreciate the Solidarity Singers' role in helping to point that out in their own special way. \- Dean Veneman, Wisconsin Rapids \Cartoon about protesters is a fail \Congratulation to State Journal cartoonist Phil Hands for Saturday's cartoon libeling about a million decent Wisconsin citizens who dared sign the recall petition and participate in legal protests. \I'm just wondering if he comes up with his own ideas or gets them straight from the headquarters of the American Legislative Exchange Council - you know, ALEC, the guys who wrote the ""Right to Work for Less"" bill, also known as the ""Right to Sponge"" bill. \I realize it's the cartoonist's job to stick his finger in the eye of various deserving lunatics, but this cartoon denigrates too many undeserving people. It's a fail. \- Don Johnson, Madison \Right-to-work could be bad for business \The usual pretext given for right-to-work legislation is it liberates the worker from unfair union domination. In fact, it is more likely to weaken or destroy union protection of workers from unfair labor practices and be a depressant to worker pay and benefits. \However, there is also a very pro-management factor involved with mandatory union membership and/or mandatory union dues payments. With either union or agency shops, unions are assured a strong measure of security. Such security enables union leadership to be more responsible and considerate of employer interests. \With right-to-work laws, union leadership would be more responsive to radical or irresponsible worker interests who threaten to withdraw from paying union dues if they don't get their way. \Perhaps the anti-right-to-work stance of a significant number of Wisconsin employers reflect their understanding that the law can contribute to irresponsible or radical union leadership. Those Republican legislators who are less enamored by right-to-work should consider this factor and other negative consequences before finalizing their stance on the issue. \- Ed Garvoille, Madison \Right-to-work needs referendum \Do you vote for something because you know you can win, or do you vote for something because you know it is right? \My first concern with this bill is the usage of the term ""right-to-work."" Everybody currently has a right to work in our state, so this seems like an effort to conceal something. You should probably say what the bill is really about: the ""right to work without joining a union."" \Another concern is with the speed of this process. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, is very confident he knows the will of the people. If the senator is so positive about how the people think, why does he need to push something through so fast? \Why not hold a referendum by asking the people what they think. This would seem like the most democratic thing to do. Holding one public hearing prior to voting hardly seems like a good way to determine the will of the people. \- Tom Poppe, Madison"
338," Gov. Jim Doyle's latest biennial budget proposals rally around the cutting of 10 percent of state employees as a way of balancing the budget. Two questions linger: First, do you expect your taxes to go down as a result of this? If so, you need a reality check. I will never see a politician effectively reduce taxes. When employees are cut in all state agencies, services you and your families rely on are cut as well. What services are you willing to do without, how long are you willing to wait for services? Most folks would say they wait too long already.\ And consider the families that will be affected by these layoffs. The whole premise behind this move by the governor's office was to fulfill a promise he made to get elected. No studies were done to show benefit from his promise when it was made. State employees' salaries make up less than 1 percent of the total state budget, and the perceived gain in money saved will be quickly allocated to pet projects. For a governor who is pushing hard to ""Grow Wisconsin,"" I fail to see what laying off people will do for the economy.\ - Adam Clayton, Madison\ Understand Christian inclusion\ Professor Roger Williams in his Sunday guest column grasps from thin air that it's the ""religious right"" who are feared by the big media networks. I didn't hear about that one in the news concerning the decision not to air the ""God is Still Speaking"" ads. One would never know this fear exists judging by the networks' programming, reporting and lack of interest in things religious.\ He is correct in believing that NBC's advocacy ads policy is ludicrous. I'd suggest he seek a clearer understanding of Christian inclusion and love. The ""conservative"" Christian denominations I know serve, include and demonstrate love to - impartially - all who attend. And it's the intent of Christ, through his church, to preach his truth that it may transform everyone who hears it from the inside out into a new creation. That may be uncomfortable for Williams to grasp, but that's real inclusion.\ - Rich Kuckkahn, Sun Prairie\ Mainline churches show hypocrisy\ The decisions by NBC, CBS, and ABC not to air the ads developed by the United Church of Christ may or may not have been flawed. However, Roger Williams' use of those decisions to attack Christians who don't subscribe to liberal politics demonstrates the hypocrisy of many mainline churches.\ I have seen one of the ads in the context of a discussion item, and to me it was deplorable. It involved apparent minorities, homosexuals and others being turned away at the door of a church. The inclusion issue Williams mentions is overshadowed by the second message, that of the UCC using the disenfranchised to provide the basis of an attack on churches that don't subscribe to its liberal social views. Before the liberal left makes accusations, I think they should look in a mirror.\ - Tom Thomsen, member and past moderator, Windsor United Church of Christ\ Revenue caps work well\ ""WEAC survey slams revenue caps,"" what a surprise! The Wisconsin Education Association Council - don't let the name fool you - is the largest teacher's union in Wisconsin. Their first and foremost reason for existence is to get the most in wages and benefits for their members, at the same time doing whatever it takes to increase their membership.\ There is a method in place to exceed revenue caps; it's called a referendum. Madison, along with many other districts, has used this to cover budget shortfalls. What the unions and teachers want is a blank check. No matter how you cut it, the money comes from the taxpayers.\ One has only to look at the cost-saving actions taken by school districts. Conspicuously absent is any reduction in wages and benefits. Most workers would be happy to get an annual raise based on inflation, just ask anyone who works for the state of Wisconsin. Revenue caps are working.\ Our governor claims that our ""progressive tax system"" is working just fine. Has he questioned the average Joe on the street? The fact is that we have had it! The state, local governments, and school districts need to do zero-based budgeting instead of just adding to the previous year's numbers.\ - Norman Sannes, Madison\ Raise gas tax instead of fees\ Contrary to popular belief, the Department of Transportation plan to raise the annual motor vehicle license fee to $70 doesn't mean those who benefit most from using the highways pay most for their use. People who drive 30,000 miles a year pay no more to license their vehicle each year than those who drive only 7,000 miles a year. People who drive 30,000 miles per year put more ozone and soot into the air and emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. They also add more to traffic congestion and motor vehicle-related safety conflicts with pedestrian, bicyclists and other motor vehicle drivers.\ Raising motor vehicle license fees is also a regressive tax that charges individuals who earn $20,000 a year the same amount to register a car as individuals who earn $100,000 year.\ If taxes have to be raised at all for improving and expanding the state highway system, the gasoline tax at the pump is a more fair and environmentally sound way to raise money. Or maybe the DOT and the state could find a way to reduce to encourage a reduction in the demand for an expanded highway system in the first place, thus saving us all a lot of money and benefiting our environment instead?\ - Michael Neuman, Madison"
339,"Hybrids shouldn't have to pay more\Wisconsin Department of Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb says the average driver will pay $27 a year under his proposal of new gas taxes. So my small SUV is going to cost an additional $27 a year, and my hybrid that gets twice the mileage would be around $14 a year in gas tax and an additional $50 in fees.\Totaling $64 a year.\Can someone explain to me why I should have to pay more in new taxes and fees to run my hybrid that is using less energy, promoting a clean environment and doing less damage to the road than my other vehicle'\I smell Koch in the air.\- Steve Tenney, Verona\The working homeless need more help\Tuesday's guest column by Dave Glomp, ""Deal with root causes of homelessness in Madison,"" makes some good points.\His suggestions for better addiction and mental health treatment are good, and I hope they are implemented.\I have another suggestion.\Years ago the Dane County Bar Association sponsored a program where lawyers volunteered to spend an evening at the men's shelter every month to listen to the legal problems described by the homeless men and advise or refer them to appropriate resources. My husband and I took part in this program, and I was surprised at the number of homeless men who were employed and reported workplace problems. Some described hiring discrimination and harassment. But the main complaints were related to wages and hours.\An employee would be discharged and could never obtain that last paycheck. Tips were retained, and overtime was not paid. Or employees were charged for mistakes.\Our state agency for the enforcement of workplace statutes and rules needs to be more accessible for homeless workers, do more employer education, and see that employee protections are enforced.\- Eunice Gibson, Madison\Like unions, campaign money corrupts\Jay Ambrose's column in Sunday's paper, ""Walker was right to fight public unions,"" makes some good points about our political system. Based on his statements about how unions distort democracy and cheat children out of the kind of education necessary for them, we could also apply this to the current system of financing our candidates. Money talks and grants the contributor access to the elected official.\Ambrose mentioned that while ""office holders are more or less honest, they can be irresponsible, neglecting to think through the ramifications of the deals they make.""\This can also be said about our elected state officials. Will they think through the ramifications of their bills on the general public or just follow the money trail.\- Allan Wessel, Madison\E-cigarette ban not about health\This was never about smoking, was it'\I have known from the beginning that smoking wasn't the only benefit or privilege that liberalism was after. This has been made very clear by recent events unfolding all over Wisconsin.\The city of Baraboo has been trying to ban smoking in public parks. That isn't about health.\The city of Madison is trying to ban electronic cigarettes because they don't know enough about them. How is that about health'\And why are liberals always saying it's for the good of the public? Who died and left them in charge'\- Russ Rataczak, Cambria\Be sure budget serves state, not governor\I hope Republican legislators in the Wisconsin Assembly and Senate take their time and look closely at the budget Gov. Scott Walker puts in front of them.\The goal of the governor is to ram through a budget that cuts spending and makes him look good as a presidential contender. The quicker the budget gets approved, the more he will point to this as something he will do at the national level.\We can already see the $500 million tax cut he pushed through last session should have been used to back-fill the Department of Transportation's funding needs. He has a goal of lower property taxes, more vouchers and drug testing for aid recipients. I would hope our legislators on both side don't get sucked into a budget that serves the governor's personal plans.\The governor is using Wisconsin as an experiment in his quest for the presidency. We can't be shortsighted. Make sure the budget addresses the needs of our state. Take your time and make sure that money is used for the long-term good of our state and adequate funds are raised in a fair manner.\- Gene Bier, Milton\Raising minimum wage would help all\One hundred years ago, in 1914, Henry Ford doubled his factory workers' wages to an unprecedented $5 a day because he correctly assumed he could make and sell more cars if more people could afford to buy them.\Today, we have adults with children trapped in minimum wage jobs that don't pay them enough to cover their bills. Those people are forced to depend on government agencies for assistance paid for with your tax dollars. We are actually subsidizing the profits of their employers.\If we have a whole class of working people whose wages can hardly cover food and shelter.\How can they afford to buy cars, furniture and home appliances, among other things? They can't.\Fewer buyers mean that fewer manufactured items are made, and consequently, fewer jobs in manufacturing, transporting and selling those items are created.\Cities and states that have raised the minimum wage have not seen mass layoffs. In fact, as the U.S. Department of Labor reported in July, those states that had increased the minimum wage actually saw greater job growth.\An increase in the minimum wage would benefit everybody.\Think about it, Gov. Scott Walker.\- Art Naebig, La Valle"
340," In the latest of a recent string of Republican loyalists who are ranting defensively, a column Wednesday by David Blaska is calling those of us who believe reports of voter suppression and potential fraud wacky (""That isn't Karl Rove. It's Rod Serling"").\ While Blaska cites isolated incidents of individual vandalism by those who appear to be loyal to the Democratic Party, reports of voter suppression of people likely to vote for John Kerry are widespread and well documented. As close to home as Milwaukee, there were reports of black people receiving flyers stating that if they had voted in any other election this year they were ineligible to vote and if they did they could go to prison and lose their children. The next logical step after voter suppression is fraud.\ - Colleen Cerasani, Madison\ D'oh! I'm an idiot\ I am depressed. After reading so many of the post-election editorials and letters talking about how it's hard to live in a country so full of stupid people and how can 59 million Americans be so dumb, I realized they were talking about me.\ Thank you, Madison liberals, Democrats, intellectuals, elites, brainwashed (and often unwashed) university students, and self- appointed keepers of the public consciousness. Without your keen insight, I might never have recognized myself as a stupid person.\ I confess my pea-sized, white male, conservative, religious Republican brain can never begin to understand or appreciate the subtlety and nuance of the Kerry world view (""Iraq . . . a colossal failure""), or the statesmanlike use of language (""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."").\ I guess I just voted for the guy who lives his faith, says what he means, and does what he says. Too simple, I know, for those who are out to save me (and the country) from myself.\ Thanks, lefties, for watching out for me and pointing out my shortcomings as a (non)thinking American. I believe I'm on the road to recovery now. Can't wait for 2008.\ - Christopher J. Rodel, Sun Prairie\ New old' lights waste energy\ The photo of ""old-fashioned lighting"" in Wednesday's paper really made me cringe. This form of lighting is quaint, cute and stupid. The fixtures typically throw over half of the light upward. Such light is useless, pollutes the sky and wastes energy. These fixtures do not put the light where it is needed and cost twice the power to operate; which is all money wasted.\ Unfortunately it is only too common for small towns, especially, to put in such costly and wasteful lighting. The people who make these decisions should have a consultant who has some knowledge of lighting fixtures and good lighting practice.\ - R. A. Greiner, emeritus professor, electrical and computer engineering, Madison\ Students cheated in ticket fiasco\ The UW Athletic Department reneged on its offer to students selected in the first drawing for men's basketball season tickets. The university should be held liable.\ The fiasco began when it was discovered that a lottery to award 2,100 season tickets to students was tainted by a computer error that left out 625 students who applied. The Athletic Department proposed to settle the problem by giving tickets to all lottery applicants, with most getting only four-game packages. But a majority of the lottery applicants voted to re-do the whole lottery. That meant those originally selected were cheated. Instead of having 625 upset students, you have 900 upset.\ The university is saying it had no choice, that students made the final decision. But an offer was made for tickets: in exchange for your name being drawn, you'll get tickets. The university should honor that contract, especially to the small group that got in line immediately and waited for two days to get the best seats.\ What if you won the lottery, and they tried to take your winnings away because of a technical error?\ University officials should make whole those who, by no fault of their own, didn't get tickets the second time, but had them the first time. How unfortunate they chose not to.\ - Carmen Fiorelli, Sun Prairie\ Learn to self-ration gasoline\ Many environmentally minded people advocate boosting the gas tax to reduce consumption with the goal of rationing our use of this finite and dwindling resource. If the proper levy is chosen, ""the market"" will naturally produce the desired level of consumption.\ I propose a radical alternative, that we the people choose to ration our own gasoline without waiting for government action, national plans or laws that force us to do what we already believe to be right.\ Will a people who cherish personal freedom, a people whose collective numbers and technological might have rewritten the landscape of a continent and now threaten whole ecosystems, choose a level of personal responsibility commensurate with our globe- encircling power? Or must we smack into a wall before we learn the wisdom of foresight? I pray that our use of resources is not dictated by a depleted nature, and that we need not be saved by a more powerful, centralized government - one with the means to enforce collective rationing.\ - Hans Noeldner, Oregon\ Try these morals instead\ I voted according to my moral values too, but my values include personal rights and freedoms, tolerance for other value systems, respect for our threatened environment and concern for how this country is perceived by the rest of the world. I don't think you can argue that I voted against the historic principles as envisioned by our Founding Fathers, and Founding Mothers.\ - Nancy Rathke, Madison"
341,"Incumbent Frank Lasee, a Republican from De Pere, was elected to the 1st Senate District seat in 2010 and had previously served 12 years in the Assembly. On Tuesday, he faces Democratic challenger Dean DeBroux, a special education teacher from De Pere.\Here, we rate each candidate on the important issues in the race, based on their stances and our views of the issues, and offer a recommendation. You may have different views on what issues are most important and what you want candidates to do about them. We hope our analysis and opinion give you something to consider -- to scoff at, cheer on or simply think about. And we encourage you to vote.\FRANK LASEE\State budget - 25 points maximum\Lasee portrays himself as a budget hawk and it's an accurate portrayal as both a senator and an Assembly representative. One particular budget idea he's advocating is to address transportation needs by moving sales-tax revenue from cars, tires and other automotive products to into the transportation fund. That's an estimated $560 million a year -- but it's also money that's taken out of the general revenue fund, which will create a budget problem elsewhere. That's a concern. Lasee also proposes that any administrative rule that costs the state at least $10 million or has a negative impact of at least $10 million on the state economy be voted on by the Legislature. That merits consideration. 16 points\Jobs and economy - 20 points maximum\Lasee calls this a top priority and points to legislation he's authored to streamline regulations to help businesses. In a largely rural district, he's particularly critical of the Department of Natural Resources, even under Secretary Cathy Stepp, saying it can't keep being an agency of ""no."" That's OK, as long as the environment isn't put at risk at the same time. He proposes an evaluation of the state's new venture capital fund to determine if it's working before devoting more money to it. 14 points\Education - 20 points maximum\Lasee recognizes the particular challenges of K-12 school districts with declining enrollments and proposes giving them some revenue-cap relief. He also supports continuing the University of Wisconsin tuition freeze. Those are plusses. On voucher expansion, he says he's generally supportive but wouldn't commit to a position on how far to take it. He says he's open to all possibilities. On the issue of Common Core, he refers to it as a ""Washington one-size-fits-all teaching method,"" which shows a lack of understanding of what the standards do and don't do. School districts already have local control to use the standards or not. 10 points\Helping those in need - 15 points maximum\Lasee opposes Medicaid expansion and increasing the minimum wage. He offers no particular suggestions about how to manage medical assistance costs. 9 points\Other factors - 20 points maximum\Maintaining the budget and reducing regulations as a driver of business growth are what Lasee is about. Aside from school funding details, his positions on other issues lack depth. That's not bad. It's just that he could do more. 10 points\Lasee's total points - 100 points maximum: 59\DEAN DEBROUX\State budget - 25 points maximum\This is the crux of the issue with DeBroux's campaign. He proposes increased spending on K-12 education, the K-12 school finance formula, venture capital, technical colleges, the UW System, transportation infrastructure and shared revenue to municipalities. In return, he proposes cutting the private-school tax deduction, closing corporate tax loopholes and exemptions and re-indexing the gas tax. It doesn't sound like a realistic plan to pay for the increased spending. 10 points\Jobs and economy - 20 points maximum\The technical-college and venture-capital proposals are targeted to this area, as is transportation spending. DeBroux also wants to hold the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. more accountable, which is a work in progress. 12 points\Education - 20 points maximum\DeBroux opposes the voucher program as unfair\to taxpayers, rightly points out the proper perspective on Common Core and supports allowing the refinancing of student loans -- positions we support. As a teacher, it's natural that he wants Act 10 repealed, but he loses us when he advocates for not just increasing, but removing, revenue caps for school districts. Established two decades ago as a response to numerous years of 8-plus percent increases in property taxes, revenue caps may be an evil, but they're a necessary one. 10 points\Helping those in need - 15 points maximum\DeBroux supports the state accepting the federal Medicaid expansion money and gradually increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. 12 points\Other factors - 20 points maximum\DeBroux has ideas we agree with on a lot of issues, but we just can't get past the unrealistic spending advocacy. On K-12 school spending, which is largely personnel pay and benefits, he not only wants to take us back to before Scott Walker became governor, he wants to take us back to the mid-1990s, a rosier economic time when the teachers union thrived, working with compliant school boards, but it eventually led to revenue caps and the Qualified Economic Offer for teachers compensation in response. 10 points\DeBroux's total points - 100 points maximum: 54\OUR RECOMMENDATION\As you can see, the overall score isn't particularly high for either candidate. But given the choice, we recommend Lasee as the better option because of his more realistic view of the state's finances."
342,"
State Rep. Sue Jeskewitz's decision not to seek re-election to a seventh term has touched off a free-for-all among Republicans hoping to replace her in the 24th Assembly District.
\
Daniel Knodl, Jason LaSage, Michael Moscicke and Randall Ryan Melchert are running in the Sept. 9 primary, hoping to advance to the Nov. 4 general election to take on the winner of the Democratic race between Charlene S. Brady and Torrey Lauer.
\
The sluggish economy, taxes, state government spending and education are among the key issues, the contenders said.
\
Knodl, 49, a Washington County supervisor and owner of Reef Point Resort in Hartford, said he would propose a hiring freeze across all state departments and then not replace people as they retire as a way to reduce government spending. Downsizing government ""simply has to be done,"" he said, but added that he would not advocate laying off workers to achieve savings.
\
""I would really like to bring a business sense to politics of Madison,"" Knodl said. ""I've had 23 years in small business. I can bring budgeting experience, spending savvy and the ability to say no to unnecessary spending.""
\
LaSage, 28, of Menomonee Falls, said he is running because he feels the Republican Party has lost its way on holding the line on taxes and spending.
\
""We need to lower taxes on individuals and business because it is the right thing to do. It would be a better situation for the economy,"" said LaSage, a former Germantown School Board member.
\
LaSage, a licensed mortgage broker and securities representative, said he would work to end state ethanol subsidies, which he contends are driving up the costs of food and fuel; reduce the state gasoline tax; repeal the minimum mark-up law on gasoline; and fight to remove the federal mandate requiring the use of reformulated gasoline in the Milwaukee metro area. Motorists in southeastern Wisconsin pay an average of 14 cents more per gallon for that gasoline, billed as cleaner for the environment.
\
Melchert, 23, of Menomonee Falls, said he would propose measures that would cut the costs of a gallon of gas about 10%. He said he would push to lower the state gas tax to the national average, which would save 4 cents a gallon; stop the use of reformulated gasoline; and eliminate the minimum-markup law.
\
The 1939 Unfair Sales Act mandates a minimum markup on certain products, including gas, to protect against predatory pricing that could force smaller operations out of business. The law adds about 8 cents to a gallon of gas, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a Thiensville think tank, says.
\
Melchert, who owns a radio station in the Quad Cities, said he also would hold the line on state spending.
\
""We can't be able to have an annual increase in the state budget of 4, 5 or 6 percent,"" he said. ""If I'm elected, I will not vote to raise taxes. I've been talking with people who have lived here 10, 20, 40 years. They've put up with snow and the Brewers losing, but they are starting to look to get out of Wisconsin because of the cost of living, taxes.""
\
Moscicke, 26, of Menomonee Falls, said taxes are a huge issue for people. ""They really do dig into people's finances,"" he said. But along with controlling taxes, Moscicke said he would propose legislation to control fees, which governments are adding as funding gets tight under state-imposed levy limits. Among the fees being added are those for garbage collection and storm-water control.
\
Moscicke, who left his state job to campaign full time, also noted that people are frustrated with state officials who raised car registration fees and driver license renewal fees.
\
If elected, Moscicke, a former office manager with what is now the state Department of Health Services, said he also would work to make attending University of Wisconsin schools more affordable. He said he would propose legislation to reduce tuition. ""We need to go back to making the universities accessible -- they should be open and accessible to everyone in Wisconsin,"" he said.
\
The 24th Assembly District includes all of Germantown and Butler and parts of Menomonee Falls and Richfield.

343,"Three candidates are on the ballot for the 9th State Senate seat in the Nov. 7 general election.\Constituents in the district reside in Brown, Calumet, Door, Kewaunee, and Manitowoc counties.\Alan Lasee, the Republican Party incumbent, faces Democratic challenger Charlie Most and Green Party candidate Jill Bussiere.\The Herald Times Reporter asked the candidates a series of four questions, and the responses, as submitted by the candidates, will appear each Wednesday leading up to the general election.\Question: ""Would you change current tax collection ratios, as they relate to property, income and corporate taxes?""\Charlie Most\If elected to the office of State Senator for the 1st District, I would work to review the current system of how the State of Wisconsin collects its revenue from all sources including the sales tax and user fees.\A basic tenet of any form of taxation is that it should be fair and the current tax collection model for the State of Wisconsin is out of balance.\In the 1970s the property tax burden was shared equally between commercial property owners and residential property owners. Today, residential property owners are paying over 70 percent of the property tax.\Small politically popular tax decisions, a credit here and an exemption there, without much thought to the impact on the overall tax collection system ignores the basic tenet of tax fairness, an ability to pay.\Tax exemptions and credits reduce revenue available to provide funding for services mandated by the state. To fill the funding gap, local governments use the property tax.\By shifting the cost of State programs to the property tax young families trying to buy houses and senior citizens on fixed incomes trying to hang on to their homes are hurt the most.\The same logic applies to the state income tax and corporate tax. Credits and exemptions reduce the collection pool and actually raise the tax rate to produce the revenue needed to fund state programs and services.\I would push for a Legislative Fiscal Bureau review of the current tax collection system with an emphasis on fairness and an ability to pay.\I would favor low cost loans for economic development over tax exemptions and credits.\Last, an overhaul of the tax collection system would not be complete without a thorough review of the programs and services provided by the state and mandated services provided by local governments.\Alan Lasee\The only ratio we have to change in regards to tax collections is to lower the burden on Wisconsin taxpayers.\According to the U.S. Taxpayer Network, Wisconsin residents pay the sixth highest taxes as a percentage of their income.\Our businesses are consistently ranked in the top twenty highest taxed in the Untied States. High taxes are driving our employees and businesses to move to other states for higher paying jobs and lower taxes.\The Senate Democrats have a tax plan called HOPE that is nothing but a tax gimmick. They state that they are going to lower property taxes by raising other taxes, such as taxing food, medicine, and home heating fuel, which are all examples of the sales and use tax exemptions the Senate Democrats plan to raise.\Only the Senate Democrats would come up with a plan that raises taxes to lower them.\I do not believe in gimmicks and have fought to lower taxes by: eliminating the state tax on social security; enacting a property tax freeze; eliminating the automatic gas tax increase; supporting a property tax credit for disabled veterans; eliminating the jobs tax to stop the onslaught of jobs leaving Wisconsin; and authoring a bill to freeze technical college property taxes.\I do not think shifting the tax burden from the sales tax to the property tax to businesses and job creators is the answer.\A better solution is to find ways to reduce the taxes for the property owners, sales tax payers and businesses that support the livelihood of Wisconsin residents.\I am confident that my record proves that I have fought for lowering the overall tax burden. I will continue to fight for the reduction of all taxes and not just the gimmicks of shifting the burden to someone else.\Jill Bussiere\Wisconsin taxes take the same share of income now as they did 15 years ago. When all taxes and fees are considered, Wisconsin has the 15th highest tax burden in the nation.\Poorest households pay a higher share of income than those with higher incomes.\Families earning less than $44,000 a year pay between 12 and 15 percent of their income for state and local taxes, while families earning over $254,000 pay just over 9 percent of their income for state and local taxes.\Wisconsin property taxes are among the nation's highest --ranked 11th.\Wisconsin's business taxes are lower than those in surrounding states. The corporate tax share has dropped from 11 percent in 1979 to 5 percent in 2006.\I will lighten the load on working families by: changing the current income tax so that it is fairer -- so those who have more will pay more, instead of the current system where those who have less pay more; relieving property taxes.\Business' fair share of contributions to the community ensures adequate resources to provide a well-educated workforce that wants to live a quality life in Wisconsin.\I will ensure a healthy economy by: implementing universal single-payer health care to lighten the burden on businesses, families, and government; ensuring the tax climate for working families is favorable so businesses can maintain and attract a capable workforce; ensuring that businesses contribute their fair share of taxes; closing loopholes so businesses can no longer shift profits out of state to avoid taxes; capping corporate income tax deduction for compensation paid to any employee at 25 times the compensation paid to the lowest paid full-time employee; encouraging ""green taxes"" on activities that attempt to shift costs onto the state that are a danger to the environment or the community's health."
344,"Solar project deserves support\For years, fossil fuels have polluted our air and water, and the public has paid the human and capital costs.\These costs have never been factored in when deciding to build fossil-fuel power plants because we had no other choice. Nor was the impact on jobs created in Wisconsin factored into the analysis.\Meanwhile, tax credits fostered the development of alternative energy sources and helped get us to where the cost of producing energy through wind and solar is equivalent to producing it from fossil fuels. And now, at last, we have a choice.\It's time to develop a new metric for determining how to choose our future power sources, and it should include these external costs and benefits. The projections are that wind and solar costs will continue to drop, making it even cheaper to produce renewable energy than energy with fossil fuels.\We need to continue this trajectory by approving the Badger Hollow solar project in southwest Wisconsin. If we don't, what was the point of fostering the development of alternative energy sources in the first place?\Ross DePaola, Madison\Trump, GOP are the real emergency\Democracy no longer seems the default form of government. I fear the default form of government may be totalitarianism. Democracy is hard work.\The presidency of Donald Trump is living proof of the fragility of democracies. In his first few years of office, he has tested democracy's boundaries in a variety of ways, from his close connections to totalitarian governments, especially Russia, to his undermining of democratic institutions, such as the courts, the rule of law and the press. President Trump has inexorably been leading us away from our democratic traditions.\Now, with his declaration of a state of emergency, President Trump is crossing the threshold into a totalitarian regime. No emergency is on our southern border. In fact, arrests for illegal crossings have steadily declined over the last two decades.\But when President Trump desperately needs to fulfill an absurd campaign promise to build a wall (funded by Mexico), he quickly sidesteps Congress, the legislative body that funds such projects, and finds a loophole to please his uninformed base.\The real national emergency is having a president who consistently undermines our democracy and having a political party that consistently enables his treasonous behavior.\George Savage, Madison\Trump deserves negative coverage\In the Feb. 11 letter to the editor ""The media is unfair to President Trump,"" the author spelled out all the ways he feels President Donald Trump is being unfairly treated by the media. The author claims if the media simply pointed out the positive things President Trump does and ignored all the horrible things, he'd receive a lot better coverage.\But here's the problem this is the most racist, misogynistic, despicable, bigoted person we've ever had sit in the Oval Office. He degrades the office he holds on a daily basis. This is the person who mocked a disabled reporter, bragged about sexually assaulting women, and said good people were in the crowd of white supremacists where Heather Heyer was murdered by one of those ""good people.""\President Trump spelled Adam Schiff's last name on Twitter in a derogatory manner. I would have grounded my kids for doing that. Need I continue?\The list grows daily. The damage this man is doing to the country will take the country years, and possibly an entire generation, to repair. You feel the media is treating President Trump unfairly?\You can spare me the crocodile tears. Change the channel to Fox News and pretend everything is fine.\Brian Kline, Fitchburg\Evers must clean up Walker's mess\We are experiencing the results of Gov. Scott Walker's era, and we need to learn the lessons those results teach us.\Act 10 demeaned public employees, especially teachers, and focused anger and criticism against that group. They were characterized as overpaid and underemployed. Gov. Walker was even willing to compare public employees to ISIS as he advertised himself as a presidential option. We all know how that turned out.\Wisconsin now finds itself short of teachers and is forced to relax qualifications to keep classrooms running. It will take years to solve this problem.\Gov. Walker cut taxes and ignored Wisconsin roads. We are now scurrying to find funds to rescue road projects and keep us safe. Even a gas tax increase will leave us short. We are looking at toll roads and every other option.\Relaxing environmental regulation is starting to yield results. Water shortages in the central sands region, contaminated drinking water and relaxed air quality standards to lure Foxconn are results. A clean environment has always been a Wisconsin ideal. Sacrificing our air and water for a tax cut or monetary gain is shortsighted.\Let's support Gov. Tony Evers as he tries to put us back on track.\Gene Bier, Milton\Green New Deal endangers dairy\Everyone in Wisconsin should take note that our representative in Congress, Mark Pocan, D-Black Earth, co-sponsored the Green New Deal bill. This bill was discussed in last Sunday's State Journal column ""The war on cows,"" by Michael Graham.\While the bill is softened from the real goals of the group, I believe their desire is to shut down the dairy and meat industries in Wisconsin and everywhere.\I think the Green New Deal is scary. It doesn't look at the work that might already be in progress. Having someone in Washington who associates with this group is absurd. Can we impeach Rep. Pocan?\Merle Lebakken, Stoughton

346,"It's amazing what a little compromise can accomplish. Whether it was Gov. Jim Doyle's threat to start shutting down parts of state government, the attention Rep. Tom Nelson was getting for his legislative sit-in or perhaps simply an overdue sense of responsibility, Doyle and the leaders of the Legislature finally came up with a state budget proposal all of them could agree to.\Friday night, they announced the deal, nine months after Doyle's first budget proposal and 111 days after it was supposed to go into effect. Now, the Republican leaders of the Assembly and the Democratic leaders of the Senate will have to sell it to their colleagues.\While each side can point to some victories and try not to acknowledge their losses, Wisconsin residents also can point to some victories - but they will have to face their losses, too.\The budget negotiations had boiled down to two major sticking points - how much the cigarette tax should be increased and whether there should be a tax on hospital revenue.\On the cigarette tax, Doyle wanted a $1.25-per-pack increase; the Republicans' latest offer was 75 cents. On the hospital tax, Doyle and the Democrats wanted a 0.8 percent tax on revenue because they could use it to get matching funds from the federal government to, in part, increase hospitals' Medicaid reimbursement. The Republicans were vehemently opposed to the tax.\After Friday's compromise, the cigarette tax increase is $1 and the hospital tax was dropped. But to make up for the hospital tax both sides agreed to a provision that will end up costing the state more in the long run - if it survives a court challenge.\The budget will include a transfer of $200 million from the Patient Compensation Fund, a pool of money funded by doctors and used to pay for large medical malpractice claims. The Wisconsin Medical Society said it will sue to stop the transfer.\That's one of the areas in which Wisconsin residents will lose with this budget. It's a one-time transfer of money, which means that, in the next budget, the state will have to find a different way to raise that $200 million. And it's a move that has gotten us into this constant state of structural deficit.\There's a similar problem with a $150 million property tax credit in December 2008 that won't be funded until the 2009-11 budget.\Likewise with the Wisconsin Covenant, Doyle's guarantee to find a college spot - and financial aid help - for state eighth-graders. We have no idea how much that's going to cost in future years.\Then there's the additional bonding, or borrowing, the state will do to fund more highway projects, instead of a tax on oil companies that Doyle proposed but Republicans opposed.\Yes, there are victories in this budget deal: K-12 school funding will help hold the line on property taxes, the cigarette tax as a necessary evil to fund our growing medical assistance needs, a stronger commitment to the University of Wisconsin System and an expansion of the Family Care program, which can keep senior citizens in their homes longer and save the state in long-term nursing-home costs.\But these moves that help fund the budget now - without a concern over the burden they will cause in the future - will cost Wisconsin. At least the hospital and gas taxes would have been more honest.\It's been a long road to get the budget to this point. This process can't continue to drag on. But legislators need to finish with a plan that will strengthen the state over the long run, not just get by for the next two years.\State budget highlights\From The Associated Press\Key parts of the two-year, $58 billion state budget agreement reached by leaders of the state Senate, Assembly and Gov. Jim Doyle on Friday:\TOBACCO TAX: Cigarette taxes will increase $1 per pack.\GAS TAX: The deal rejects a plan to charge oil companies a 2.5 percent tax on oil sold in the state.\HOSPITAL TAX: Hospitals will not have to pay a 0.8 percent tax on their revenues.\UNIVERSITY: The University of Wisconsin System will receive a funding increase of $159 million, which is $21 million short of what Doyle and the system wanted. Republicans wanted to spend $120 million less. The new money will allow some campuses to expand enrollment and research programs.\PROPERTY TAXES: The cap on local property tax increases will remain at 2 percent.\HEALTH CARE: Allows all parents to buy state-subsidized health care for their children, regardless of income, as well as 70,000 low-income adults to buy into such programs. Also includes $30 million to fight smoking.\WISCONSIN COVENANT: The deal authorizes the program, which promises eighth-graders who meet certain goals during high school a slot in the UW System or at a technical college.\FINANCIAL AID: A $32 million increase in financial aid for low-income students over two years. Includes an additional $12 million to pay for a free tuition benefit for Wisconsin veterans.\ENVIRONMENT: The deal authorizes $85 million in bonding per year for the Stewardship program, which enables the state to purchase land and distribute grants to conservation groups and local governments to buy land to protect wilderness.\SEX OFFENDERS: Serious sex offenders will be tracked for the remainder of their life with GPS technology.\AUTISM: The plan rejects a proposal to require health insurers to cover autism.\CAR RENTALS: The deal rejects a plan to allow Kenosha, Racine and Milwaukee counties to levy a $15 tax on car rentals to pay for a commuter rail system connecting those cities.\REAL ESTATE FEE: A plan to double the real estate transfer fee, paid by people selling their houses, is not included.\TAX CUTS: Residents will be able to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums from their state income taxes starting next year. Similar tax breaks for child care and college tuition costs will be phased in."

Gas cost may remain high, analyst warns
\
Trend signals permanent boost, he says
\
By LARRY SANDLER
\
of the Journal Sentinel staff
\
Saturday, July 1, 2000
\
The short-term furor over the price of reformulated gas is masking a long-term worldwide trend that could result in permanently higher gas prices in the range of $1.50 to $1.75 a gallon, a prominent oil industry analyst said Friday.
\
If George Gaspar, managing director of petroleum research at Robert W. Baird & Co. of Milwaukee, and other analysts are right, the normal price of gas in Wisconsin would be higher than the level that set an all-time record just a few months ago. And the days of $1-a- gallon gas -- and maybe even the days of $1.30-a-gallon gas -- could be gone forever.
\
Furthermore, Gaspar argues, cutting gas taxes and encouraging energy conservation won't do any good if OPEC nations remain determined to hold the line on crude oil prices. He said the only solution would be to break the cartel's grip on oil supplies by freeing oil companies to find and develop new sources of oil.
\
None of this talk is likely to comfort motorists and politicians clamoring to drive down prices quickly by calling for a waiver of Environmental Protection Agency requirements for reformulated gas, a Federal Trade Commission price-fixing investigation of the oil companies or a cut in state and federal gas taxes.
\
But the record gas price levels haven't stopped people from driving, and that demand helps keep prices high, Gaspar said. The American Automobile Association predicts that 4% more Americans will travel 100 miles or more from home this holiday weekend than a year ago. Nationwide, demand for gas is up 2.5% so far this year, and 4% to 5% in the last six to eight weeks, Gaspar said.
\
""When things have settled down, we'll see this as a period of price adjustment -- painful adjustment,"" but still the same kind of price increase common among other consumer products, AAA Wisconsin spokesman Mike Bie said.
\
During the last 20 to 30 years, inflation has boosted the price of other products, while gas has lagged behind, Bie said. Now it seems a long-term price shift is under way, he said.
\
Industry spokesmen were more cautious about issuing predictions, but they agreed that a continued hard line by OPEC would likely keep prices high unless new oil sources were found.
\
""I don't like buying $1.75-a-gallon gas in Madison, but that's unfortunately the world we live in,"" said Erin Roth, executive director of the Wisconsin Petroleum Council, which represents major oil companies. ""We all got used to $1, $1.10-a-gallon gas prices, but I can't tell you when we're going to see them again or if we're going to see them again.""
\
""It's unrealistic to think we'll have retail gas under $1 anytime soon,"" agreed Bob Bartlett, executive director of the Petroleum Marketers Association of Wisconsin/Wisconsin Association of Convenience Stores.
\
According to data compiled by AAA Wisconsin, the average price of regular unleaded gas at self-service pumps statewide stayed in the range of $1.06 to $1.34 a gallon for most of the past six years. The major exception was last winter, when the average dropped to 98 cents a gallon for four months.
\
OPEC Responds
\
Meanwhile, the price of crude oil was often less than $20 a barrel, and sometimes as low as $11 a barrel, during those years, Bartlett and Roth noted. The low prices of winter 1999 energized the OPEC nations ""to do something they never had the resolve to do before -- hold the line on production,"" Bie said.
\
The production limits clamped down by OPEC sent crude oil prices above $30 a barrel. At Wisconsin pumps, that translated into record- breaking prices of $1.43 a gallon in February and $1.58 a gallon in March, falling back temporarily into the $1.40 to $1.50 range before shooting up again and peaking at $2.08 a gallon in the Milwaukee area last month.
\
Until this year, the record price was $1.38 a gallon, set in October 1990, amid the tensions leading up to the Gulf War.
\
Prices in the Milwaukee and Chicago areas rocketed ahead of prices in other parts of Wisconsin and Illinois after the May 1 start of tougher requirements for cleaner-burning reformulated gas. As the gap grew to 20 cents a gallon, politicians started calling for a waiver of the EPA requirements and of state and federal gas taxes.
\
But the price difference between reformulated and conventional gas has already closed, and although prices have dropped, they're still at levels never seen before this summer. As of Friday, AAA reported, the average stood at $1.81 both statewide and in the Milwaukee area. The Journal Sentinel's informal survey of 11 stations found the local price averaging $1.80.
\
The national average -- calculated at $1.64 a gallon by AAA on Friday and $1.66 a gallon by the federal Energy Information Administration on Monday -- also is far above previous levels.
\
Gaspar said OPEC ministers seem determined to defend a $25-a- barrel average, within OPEC's targeted range of $22 to $28. After the summer driving season, that's likely to translate into prices below the recent peak but above February levels, he said.
\
In that environment, ""lowering gas taxes is not the answer,"" because it plays into OPEC's hands, Gaspar said. OPEC wants lower gas taxes because that would pump up demand and help keep prices high -- ""a fast way to $35 or $40 a barrel oil,"" he wrote in last week's Oil Week in Review newsletter.
\
And Wisconsin figures suggest that higher gas taxes haven't resulted in higher gas prices. During the 1990s, the state gas tax rose gradually from 21 cents a gallon to 26 cents a gallon, while the pump price bounced between extremes of $1.38 in October 1990 and 98 cents in late 1998 and early 1999.
\
Prices would fall if demand fell, but ""there's no evidence it's falling,"" Gaspar said. Demand would decrease if the economy went sour in a major part of the world -- like the Asian downturn that contributed to last winter's low prices -- but the world economy continues to grow, said Gaspar, Roth and Bartlett.
\
Conservation measures imposed during the oil crisis of the 1970s also failed to stem demand, Gaspar said.
\
Gaspar believes that the only way to restrain the growth of oil prices would be to find new sources of oil in the United States.
\
""We have to keep seeking new sources of crude oil to satisfy the insatiable demand in the market,"" Gaspar said.

Wolbert will work hard and carry forward our district's progressive values and priorities on the Dane County Board.\- Lynn Glueck, Madison\Controversy involves Adler Planetarium\Here's an example of hoping that by telling a lie often enough, people will believe it: John McCain and Sarah Palin are repeating the nonsense about Barack Obama getting ""pork"" for his native Chicago in the form of millions for an overhead projector.\Well, it is a projector and it does project overhead, but it projects the solar system and is an expensive piece of equipment that will cost much more than the millions Obama secured for it.\Of course, if we simply want to sit back and watch China, Japan and Russia do the space exploration for us because we haven't bothered to excite our young people about science and space, then McCain has the right idea in calling it a waste.\- Richard K. Brewer, Montfort Choose McCain as moderate Republican I'm a conservative who's been uncomfortable with the Republican Party for the last seven years because they have represented the extreme far right. Why anyone wants another four years with the extreme far left is beyond me.\We are tired of a government dominated by party affiliation that does not reflect the views of our people. It's time for a third party in this country to represent the people.\Obama is not a moderate candidate. John McCain is moderate. The Republican Party does have moderates. Obama says it will be four more years of the Bush administration. No, it won't.\McCain is a fine man who has served the traditional values of our country for years. Why does he not have everyone on his side?\I had a McCain sign in my yard, close to the house, but someone in my community does not believe in free speech, came onto my property and stole my sign.

That Joe needs our attention as well.\- Herbert M. Kliebard, Madison\Bus fare hike wrong move at wrong time\We think of Madison as an environmentally-aware, responsible community. The mayor, City Council and citizens of Madison can be proud of the steps we have taken toward preserving our environment.\We must remind ourselves, however, that there is much more to be done. The cost of gasoline has gone down over the last weeks, but we all know that it will go back up and keep going up. It's essential that alternatives like Metro Transit buses continue to be available.\The city budget proposal to increase bus fare is the wrong thing to do at the wrong time. If anything we should reduce the fares to encourage use. If our environmental and social awareness is more than lip service, we must find ways to make our budget reflect it.\Let's look at raising parking fees instead, instituting a county gas tax or a tax on gas stations that they could pass on to customers. Perhaps it's time to reconsider a wheel tax.\A huge chunk of Madison's budget goes to services and infrastructure for car driving. It is time that the beneficiaries pay their fair share and the bus riders get a break.\- Ken Lawrence, Madison\Questions remain on library referendum\The Cottage Grove Library Board president defended their site choice in a Thursday letter to the editor, but she's not telling the complete story.\She says they ruled out free land requiring a road, but the chosen site will require costly road and infrastructure expenses. She says they rejected free land with ""unacceptable contingencies,"" but didn't explain what they were.\The library board had a vision of the ""cathedral"" they wanted to build and ignored opportunities that did not fit this vision, such as a multi-story structure on free land.\The board president says that businesses near the chosen site will benefit from the proximity of a library. Yet when one stands in the middle of the corn field that they now own, the only business anywhere in sight is a dental office.\She says the site ""will always be next to the school"" but ignores the fact that this may not be good news. Sun Prairie, for example, had behavioral problem with middle school students hanging out at their library and had to hire additional staff to control it.\The strategy appears to be to get as much in place as they can to make it difficult for the village to say ""no.""\- Richard Kerr, Cottage Grove\Save ad money; talk to bishop instead\What was the point of the ""open letter"" to Bishop Morlino by the 40 or so individuals in last Sunday's paper?\It was intended to publicly criticize Bishop Morlino and it was yet another attempt to denigrate the Catholic church. This type of display is misguided and destructive.\If you feel alienated and are questioning the Catholic faith, I encourage you to save your money and simply ask for a meeting with Bishop Morlino. Better yet, attend one of his masses at St. Patrick's Downtown.\He is a compassionate teacher who certainly does speak about the poor - and reaches out to the poor in spirit. He would welcome the opportunity to teach you the tenets of the Catholic faith that trouble you.\A bishop's job is to teach the faith, not change the faith. Those of us who are trying to live and teach our children the truth of the Catholic faith deserve nothing less.\- Nora Statsick, Madison"

That vote cost him his seat in Congress. \Peter deserves to be forever honored for that choice. It was historic and salvaged the country's economics. Sadly, it led to the election of Paul Ryan to that same congressional seat from which he is today looking for every opportunity to cripple Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. \I salute Peter for his lifelong willingness to make the hard and sometimes conflicting choices that public life often requires. If Congress and the Legislature had more leaders like Peter Barca, politics would not be in the state of disrepair we see today. \Rep. Dave Obey (ret.), Wausau\Invest in roads, not Foxconn \Dear Editor: Two related topics have dominated Wisconsin's political news lately: the state budget and the Foxconn ""deal."" To me, I don't see much of a deal. Taxpayers will be paying for this $3 BILLION agreement for 15 years. It sure seems like a tax on citizens of Wisconsin with a low return on investment. Experts say that in the best case scenario, we'll break even in 2043. That's 26 years! \On top of the lousy return, part of the ""deal"" is that we won't hold Foxconn to the same environmental standards we have for other companies in the state. Who pays for the cleanup when the factory causes health hazards? Wisconsinites do! \If we want a good return on investment, raise our taxes a few dollars a year, pay for road construction projects we need now, and increase funding for universities and public schools. Those investments provide a much better and quicker return. That would be a ""real"" deal and would impact all of us across the state. \Rachel Hart-Brinson, Eau Claire\Fringe science pieces do disservice \Dear Editor: I see Steven Elbow has written another poorly documented hit piece on glyphosate herbicide. Decades of research have shown glyphosate to be practically nontoxic to people, to the extent that replacing it with people manually pulling weeds could result in more documented short-term and long-term physical harm to those workers! No new arguments are advanced in this piece, just a vague implication that ""herbicides are bad."" \With regard to the recent op/ed column by Catherine Kleiber that you ran on ""electromagnetic sensitivity,"" is there any aspect of fringe science that The Cap Times will not lend credence to now in the name of page views? \I would have thought that in an educated town like Madison, in which many real scientists live and work, Elbow might have consulted a few. There are real environmental issues that pose real risk to people, climate change not the least. Focusing on fringe science only confuses and distracts attention from these real risks and provides the anti science movement more ammunition against real environmentalists basing their concerns on real science. \Colin MacDiarmid, Madison \Base fee on mileage, weight \Dear Editor: Our legislators are so biased toward anything that preserves our environment, it's beyond ridiculous. Why should my wife have to pay $75 more for her hybrid vehicle, which averages 39 mpg in highway driving and only 34 mpg in winter months, when someone driving a non-hybrid and getting 36 mpg pays nothing more for registration? We do not save $75 in gas tax per year. Since we are retired, we are penalized for not commuting to work every day. Most days the hybrid car doesn't leave the garage, yet I need to subsidize the drivers who use the roads daily. \It's time our government evens the field. Base the fee on odometer mileage and vehicle weight, including the trucks that do the most damage to our roads. \Adolph Krantz , Cottage Grove \We must all act on climate \Dear Editor: We need more columns like Margaret Krome's (""Will skyrocketing disaster spending will sway climate deniers'"") in newspapers nationwide. We need substantive and sustained print and broadcast coverage of climate change itself - the science, the cause, and what can and is being done to limit it. Thank you, Cap Times, for doing your job. \However, I'm not sure that deniers are the problem. It may be complacency. Too many Americans are preoccupied with things that seem more immediate or more important. Too many are uninformed. Also, too many think they haven't felt the damage caused by the many faces of climate change because they personally haven't been burned, flooded, or stricken by drought, heat waves, or encroaching seas. They notice when the price of gasoline rises but don't make the connection, and don't realize that climate change is relentlessly collecting its toll at more than the pump. \It can't all be blamed on Donald Trump, Scott Pruitt, or even Exxon. The buck stops with us. \Carol Steinhart, Madison \Nightmares for Dreamers \Dear Editor: On the campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump told the Dreamers not to worry. He said he loves the Dreamers. Then as president, he announces an end to the DACA program and passes the buck to Congress. Despite both houses being controlled by Republicans, our broken Congress finds it difficult to assemble a majority to resolve almost any problem. \The president says he will act if Congress doesn't. Despite this attempted reassurance, the Justice Department tells the Dreamers to prepare to leave - all 800,000 of them. No concern is expressed on how this will affect their personal lives, their families that include children born here who are citizens, or the important jobs many Dreamers perform. \The president's announcement will drive Dreamers into the shadows where they will struggle to survive on the margins with minds filled with worries. Their lives have been upended by the madness of confusing, contradictory, and capricious statements by the president, the attorney general, and legislators in Congress. Although the president still says he loves the Dreamers, it would be nice if this was reflected in his actions or the actions of his Cabinet members and Congress. \Larry Eriksson, Madison"
350,"Instead of hurting bees, we should be helping them \Dear Editor: Have you ever really stopped to consider bees? If you haven't, it's a great time to start thinking about these buzzy little creatures. What you may or may not know is that bees are in great danger. And it's mostly our fault.\You may not realize it, but without bees it would be a very different world. And not in a good way. For one, we'd probably eat a lot more bread, because that's one thing we can make without bees.\But there are things we can do to help bees. We can plant gardens with bee-friendly plants such as ivy, crocus, lavender, mint and many others. If you're not ready to plant a garden, you could take some smaller steps to help bees, like not using pesticides on your lawn and garden.\Since it's us who are hurting bees, it's time we start helping bees! \Kelsey Henderson, a concerned fourth-grader. Madison \Euchre-playing, polka-dancing Tony Evers is not bland \Dear Editor: I was both annoyed and disappointed with the cover (""Bland vs. Bland"") of last week's Cap Times. Why can't we decide for ourselves whether we think the candidates are bland?\I don't know Scott Walker, but I know Tony Evers, and I don't think he's bland. Anyone who plays euchre and likes to polka is not bland. Besides that, Tony has worked hard as an educator at all levels. He has practical experience and he cares passionately about children, families, communities, our environment, and our taxpayers. As a native Wisconsinite from a small community, he knows our state well.\Let's give him the vote! Our state will be better off. \Jane Lepeska Grinde, Madison \Current Trump policies are working let's keep them \Dear Editor: If you follow the numbers, you'll see the American dream is alive and well.\In Wisconsin, unemployment is at 3 percent. As The New York Times pointed out, our hourly earnings are up 5 percent from last year. Locals are finding jobs, and getting paid more for them.\The success is largely a product of President Trump's deregulatory and tax reform agenda. By removing barriers to success such as lowering the tax rate so small businesses can invest their money where they need it most these policies have helped Main Street and those who work on it to thrive.\Those who remain concerned about the thought of ""eroding the federal safety net"" should consider this: Wisconsin is among the most charitable states in the nation, and ranks number two in volunteering. It seems success and giving back go hand in hand, and giving locally ensures that dollars and time are spent most efficiently.\We should keep the policies that allow this synergy to continue. \Michael Simmons, Franksville \Ladies, grab 'em by the midterms \Dear Editor: This November I hope and pray that the millions of women that Donald Trump insulted during the 2016 campaign get out and vote! I'd like to see a blue wave sweep across the country. Then we can cut this bigoted, racist, arrogant, narcissistic, autocratic, five-deferment draft dodger off at the knees.\Get out and vote ladies! Grab 'em by the midterms! \Ron Nachtwey, Black Creek \This nurse is voting for Tammy Baldwin for Senate \Dear Editor: Nurses are members of a respected profession and viewed positively by the public. Leah Vukmir's ads tout her as a nurse who cares. Yet, Vukmir is not trying to get our votes for a job as a nurse. She wants to be Wisconsin's U.S. senator, a position that requires a much broader kind of caring rooted in equity, fairness and quality. We are voting for a senator who will look at public policies through a broad lens of what is good for all Wisconsinites.\I am a nurse and will be voting for Tammy Baldwin because she fights to protect the Affordable Care Act. She champions health insurance plans that cover pre-existing conditions and provide essential health care benefits.\Baldwin is a champion for Medicare and Social Security. Virtually all nurses have invested in these programs during their careers. Nurses, like other workers, deserve to get the rewards of their investments as they retire.\If you or family and friends have benefited from the ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid, please think carefully about the qualifications of a senator who will not only protect what we have, but work to make the system stronger. \Ann E. Conway, Madison \Tony Evers among most decent to ever run for governor \Dear Editor: If you have ever lamented the fact that you have to vote for the ""lesser of two evils,"" this is the year you don't have to. We have a candidate for governor who is one of the most decent people who has ever run, Tony Evers.\Scott Walker has run one of the most dishonest campaigns we have ever seen. No, Tony Evers is not soft on sexual predators, because he didn't do something that he had no authority to do. No, he does not want to raise the gas tax by $1. Walker is promoting these myths with a massive ad buy, much of the money coming from out-of-state billionaires Charles and David Koch.\Walker brags about increasing state aid to schools last year, but doesn't want you to know that he decreased it every other year he was in office. He has not maintained the roads, and then spent $818,000 of your tax money flying around the state, sometimes taking flights of only 40 miles.\We have the opportunity to elect a really good and decent man as governor. Please, get to the polls and elect Tony Evers governor. \Dick Schultz, Fort Atkinson \Leah Vukmir's good at interrupting and not much else \Dear Editor: I watched the final debate between U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and state Sen. Leah Vukmir. What I saw was a dignified senator representing all of the people in the Wisconsin incredulously listening with disbelief to Gov. Walker's protege while Vukmir desperately tried to remember her talking points, which were laced with malicious lies and insidious half-truths. The only thing Vukmir seemed to have command over in the debate was her annoying penchant for interrupting Baldwin's thoughtful and knowledgeable answers to the questions she was asked something Vukmir does not do very well. \Mark Collins, Madison

351,"RISING\High-capacity wells \Last session, Republicans couldn't get on the same page to overhaul regulations of the wells, which can pump more than 100,000 gallons of water a day. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, singled out high-capacity wells legislation early on as a priority and signed onto the new version of the bill as a co-author. Then he gets it through his chamber on a party-line vote and sends it to the Assembly, where Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, is shooting for an early May vote. Dems weren't happy with last session's bills, and don't like this one, either. Under the bill, the DNR would not review the impact of the wells when they are replaced or the property is sold. Senate Dems sought several changes to the bill, including a review every 10 years. But Republicans shot down the amendments as Dems complained the legislation privatized the state's waters and would allow some to ""steal"" their neighbor's waters in perpetuity. \Tammy Baldwin \The Madison Dem knows she's going to be a top target for Republicans next year. And she's firing up her finance operation as she tries to amass enough resources to defend herself from the coming onslaught. Baldwin's campaign says she raised $2.2 million over the first three months of 2017 and finished the quarter with $2.4 million in the bank. That puts her ahead of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson's pace before the Oshkosh Republican's successful re-election. Baldwin is likely benefiting from the energy on the left unhappy over President Donald Trump, so it should be easy for her to raise money in the current environment. But there are plenty of landmines ahead of her between now and next fall. Republicans may have a crowded field right now, but conservatives argue that's because of the opportunity the GOP sees to pick up a Senate seat next fall and continue turning Wisconsin red. They also argue Baldwin has serious vulnerabilities on the Tomah VA, saying that issue is ripe for attack ads. \MIXED \School spending issues \School districts get a boost at the polls April 4 as some two-thirds of the 65 referenda questions on the spring primary ballot gain voter approval. Of the $964.8 million in district requests, $699.7 million passed, with the biggest spenders coming from the Green Bay and Verona school districts. Verona's taking advantage of a unique situation, as its funding capabilities are boosted by Epic following the closing of a tax incremental finance district last year, meaning the medical software company is absorbing millions of dollars in construction costs for the district. But Republicans are hoping the referendum gains in the future will decrease. Gov. Scott Walker told reporters in Waukesha he expects the number of referenda passed ""goes down dramatically"" if his nearly $650 million boost to K-12 education stays in the budget. \Turnout \The Elections Commission isn't in the game of predicting turnout anymore. But statewide, the 16 percent of voters who cast ballots in Tuesday's election falls pretty much in the middle of the 13 percent to 18 percent range the agency projected based on recent spring elections. Turnout surged in liberal Dane County, where 97,049 voters showed up, compared to 85,142 four years ago. \FALLING \Local transportation money \The Joint Finance Committee's decision to work off the guv's budget except for DOT is seen as a good sign for K-12 education. Not so much for the boost in state aid local governments were going to see under Walker's plan. In announcing his budget, the guv touted a $77 million increase in the money local governments would get between general aids, the road improvement program and local bridge improvements. The guv sold it as a way to prioritize the state's needs in a fiscally responsible manner - which also happened to fit within the parameters of not raising the gas tax or registration fee. But that doesn't mean it made GOP lawmakers happy. In fact, some Republicans members of the Joint Finance Committee wanted to start with the base for the entire budget. The argument for some was that as they made changes to the budget - and likely tried to free up money to pump into transportation - lawmakers could focus on how much they put into things like K-12 education, not how much they cut from what Walker had proposed. But other Republicans wanted nothing to do with that plan. Among other things, they saw Walker's call to pump $649 million into K-12 as a winner, particularly after largely holding school spending flat over the last several budgets. The question now, some say, is how the committee will re-work transportation. Budget vets note even if lawmakers leave the $649 million more for K-12 alone, there's still money to be moved around in this budget. But who will get nicked, and how will they use it in transportation? GOP Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a member of the Finance Committee, promises he'll have his transportation package in May. \ADCC \Timing is everything in politics. And Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca acknowledges his caucus was a little off when it sent a fundraising appeal in the middle of the debate of opioid legislation. The email came as Republicans rejected a series of Dem amendments, including some that would've required the state to take the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The email led Assembly Speaker Robin Vos to say it was ""disgusting"" that Dems are ""using this as a political issue to raise money."" Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, the author of the bills, said he was ""appalled on behalf of"" families affected by the opioid addiction. The bills largely passed on a voice vote or unanimously, but Nygren said lawmakers' previous bipartisan cooperation on the issue was ""dealt a serious blow"" with the fundraising email. Barca acknowledged the email probably ""could've been better timed."" Barca told reporters he often signs off on ADCC appeals, but didn't see the appeal before it went out. But he insisted ADCC didn't make a mistake in sending out the email ""because the majority of the people in this state"" believe the state should take the Medicaid expansion."
352,"State budget headlines have focused on massive cuts to the University of Wisconsin System and an attack-then-retreat on the Wisconsin Idea, which, we must infer, is that rare concept still popular across both blue and red Wisconsin.\Republican Gov. Scott Walker, the instigator, believes he's brimming with bold and fresh ideas, but his preeminent idea seems to be turning from his prime first-term villain, public K-12 education, to a second-term one, our public university system. \As much as Walker jauntily yearns to go big, his proposed budget is filled with provisions that are small and conniving. Walker's central organizing principle is to permanently cripple Wisconsin government at every level and to undermine public education by manufacturing a budget crisis despite an improving economy. Simultaneously, he is burdening future leaders with unknowable financial crises once Walker is done exploiting the state to bolster his tea party credibility. \In marketing terms, that is what you might call his ""brand promise,"" one that resonates with his far-right confidants, funders and, presumably, GOP presidential caucus-goers in Iowa. \So let's examine several parts of Walker's budget, ones that have not received much attention, and suggest his rationales. \Let's start with agriculture, the environment and natural resources; Walker's budget makes key boards in those areas advisory, diluting the role citizens play in rule-making and policy-making, ostensibly to streamline decisions. It's more likely that he wants to consolidate his control and reduce public input, probably on behalf of special interests. \He also wants to eliminate scientist positions from the Department of Natural Resources, arguing they are not part of its core mission. Without scientific input, we could get a more random, anti-science style of decision-making by politicians. That certainly sounds good. \Walker wants to raise state park vehicle fees by $2 per night for campsites and $3 for annual passes, but none of the extra money would go to parks because he is also cutting the general budget allocation. But remember, you outdoor enthusiasts, that's not technically a tax increase. \Under the arcane heading of budget management, Walker is continuing to permit a thin budget balance through the remainder of his term (should he complete it). In four years, that required minimum budget balance would quadruple, just in time for the next governor to grapple with finding new money or extending the too-narrow buffer. In the past, the technique was reserved for especially difficult budget periods, but Walker has apparently institutionalized it. \Another cynical accounting trick he employs is balancing the budget by requiring that money appropriated but unspent be returned, or ""lapsed"", into the general fund. For example, a program meant to be self-supporting and paid for by license fees would be forced to return money to balance the overall budget rather than keep it. These are de facto budget cuts, easing short-term pressure on Walker, even if it takes an accountant to understand the process. Again, this is not unprecedented, but in the past was done only after the budget had been passed and in crisis situations. \Elsewhere, the governor wants to eliminate state prison guards who occupy towers on the late shift. Won't that make prison neighbors feel warm and fuzzy? \On education, there would be new and more money for private schools, but public schools would have less in real terms than six years ago. There also are devious manipulations, such as a plan to give urban school boards less influence over students wanting to move to charter schools than boards have in less-populated areas. \Meanwhile, Walker would help rural districts by increasing spending for programs related to ""sparsity"" of students and the distance they are transported. Perhaps that money is justified, but for Walker, it apparently never gets old helping his rural base and not urban critics. \The governor also wants to ease regulation of 244 for-profit, post-secondary schools such as Globe University, the University of Phoenix, ITT Technical Institute and other schools that train everyone from welders to truck drivers, by eliminating the Educational Approval Board. The board handles complaints about graduation rates, job placement rates and costs from students who are often part-time and low-income. The board is self-funded through fees from licensed schools, so there is not even tax savings. \Walker also wants to permit a pathway to teaching for those with no teaching credentials, only ""real-life"" experience. It does not include money for the three positions requested by the Department of Public Instruction to reduce an existing backlog in teacher certification licensing, one that would certainly be exacerbated if teaching credentials became more of a free-for-all. \On taxes, even though there is no track record that Walker's previous tax cuts led to job creation, the budget continues the phase-in of $185 million in business-tax reductions that were approved previously. \Predictably, Walker wants no increase in shared revenue for local governments, just state-imposed levy limits. Now Walker also wants to further intrude on local government by requiring more detail on property-tax bills, with the apparent intent of making it more difficult to pass referendums. When it comes to strangling local governments and schools, Walker is a master. \Meanwhile, Walker wants to merge the Department of Financial Institutions, which regulates banks and credit unions, with the Department of Safety and Professional Services, which licenses people such as funeral home directors and plumbers. A merger will not save tax dollars and appears illogical unless your first interest is creating a facade that you have constrained and consolidated ""big government."" \Walker also wants to dilute the power of the state Building Commission by increasing the threshold for projects requiring commission review and permitting approval of some plans without meetings. Contractors are no doubt delighted. \For Walker, it apparently felt so good to stick it to public workers last time, he aspires to do so again by including a tobe- determined cut of $25 million for their health-insurance costs. Last term such a cut forced employees to pay a higher share of premiums. Walker also proposes a $2,000 stipend for employees forgoing state insurance coverage. So, you right-leaning Madison business leaders, how do you like having Walker driving health insurance costs toward spouses in your employ? \Down in the weeds, Walker wants to eliminate a local government property insurance program, which has helped cities, villages, towns and school districts get low-cost insurance as part of a pool. That efficient, consolidated approach is unpopular with insurers who prefer to write more separate policies, and Walker is there to help. \On transportation, instead of a small gas tax increase for roads, Walker proposes borrowing $1.3 billion. It's the quintessential two-faced Walker, paying back the road-building lobby that helped elect him while appearing to ""hold the line"" on taxes. His budget even has arcane provisions that appear to help freight-rail interests, perhaps Walker backers who want to cheaply transport frac sand. \As he started preparing his budget, one can imagine Walker with two lists: one with ideas to bolster his national tea party cred, the other to reward campaign donors expecting a return on investment. \Walker, it appears, has neglected neither.\Credit: PAUL FANLUND, editor"
353,"As he enters his second year in office, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said he hopes to find more common ground with the GOP majority in the Legislature something hard to come by in 2019.\The former educator's first year in office came with its share of partisan battles, including disagreements over his appointed cabinet heads and efforts by Republicans to limit his power. Divided government stalled attempts to appease constituents on both sides of the aisle: Republicans refused to take up gun control measures and marijuana legalization; Evers vetoed GOP-driven anti-abortion bills and tax cuts.\Evers said he has ""partially delivered"" on his campaign promises so far. He pointed to the budget, which included an increase in spending on K-12 education and a Republican-supported 10% income tax cut for the middle class, as a positive step.\While some expected a divided government to delay the budget process as Evers and GOP leadership came to a consensus, the 2019-20 budget was signed July 3, with Evers issuing 78 line-item vetoes, including a move to boost school spending by about $65 million.\""I feel good about that,"" Evers said in an interview with the Wisconsin State Journal. ""I think our budget was a great down payment. The issues that I ran on schools, roads and health care I think the first two we had great success with. We set a high bar.""\The budget also included more funds for public transit and increases to vehicle title and registration fees to boost spending on roads, although Evers had preferred a gas tax increase. Republicans ditched his plan to accept federal Medicaid expansion dollars, which Evers had pledged in his campaign.\Evers' first day in office was Jan. 7, after his victory in November 2018 over incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was seeking his third term.\""I think the governor has had a challenging year because he's entered an environment that, first of all, is divided government the first time Wisconsin has experienced that in eight years, and it's divided government where parties are pretty hostile towards one another,"" said Barry Burden, political science professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""I think the possibility of him as a Democrat and Republicans in the Legislature working cooperatively was pretty low from the outset.""\Outside the budget, Burden said there were few examples of bipartisanship in 2019.\""There hasn't been much else in terms of cooperative action between the branches that actually produced legislation,"" Burden said.\Many initiatives pushed by Evers in 2019 were met with resistance from the GOP majority, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle accusing the other of refusing to meet halfway.\""I just feel like (Evers) is intentionally picking these arguments as opposed to saying where can we come together and find common middle ground,"" Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, told the State Journal. ""In the budget, he basically chose to do a repeal of Scott Walker's entire tenure.""\Evers said he does not view his role as an ""anti-Walker"" position.\""I don't view this as a veto on Walker. Do I believe that Scott Walker wasn't adequately providing leadership around the issues of schools and roads and health care? Absolutely,"" Evers said. ""Certainly we're different people and have different priorities.""\Liberal proposals fall flat\Some of Evers' more liberal policy pushes, including marijuana decriminalization and gun control measures, have landed with a thud among Republicans.\Despite Evers' call for a special session for a debate and vote on red flag laws and expanded background checks, leadership in the Assembly and Senate adjourned their respective sessions without discussing the proposed items.\A bill to increase funding for homelessness services passed the Assembly, but it failed to reach fruition before the close of 2019. The topic came to a head with Evers again clashing with Republicans over how to fund the measure.\Democratic lawmakers have argued Republicans have taken strides to minimize the governor's successes starting with sweeping lame-duck legislation aimed at limiting Evers' power. The legislation, which was signed by Walker in late 2018 before Evers took office, has yet to see a final resolution in the courts, while the taxpayer cost has surpassed $2.1 million.\""They're obsessed with power,"" Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, said of GOP leadership. ""They're obsessed with petty politics and control, even when they lose the governor's office.""\All told, Evers signed 69 bills into law and vetoed 11 in their entirety in the 2019-20 session. An average of about 360 bills were signed into law annually between 2003 and 2018, a period that featured split government and both Republican and Democratic control.\More than 240 acts were signed in the 2007-08 session, the last time Wisconsin had split government.\In addition, a WisPolitics.com analysis found Evers' 61 executive orders in 2019 was more than any Wisconsin governor in more than 50 years.\?Playing goalie'\Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, who had described his role as ""playing goalie"" on Evers' initiatives, described the year as ""a rocky road.""\""I think this last year was probably framed up, first and foremost, by trying to develop a relationship with the new governor,"" Fitzgerald said in December, adding he had only met with Evers three times but planned to meet again in early 2020. The governor met with Vos about six times last year, according to Vos' spokeswoman Kit Beyer.\Fitzgerald said it's possible some of Evers' appointed cabinet heads may not get approval from the Senate before it adjourns this year. The Senate already took the unprecedented step in November to fire Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection secretary Brad Pfaff. A governor's appointee has not been denied by the Senate since at least 1987, as far back as records go on the sub-ject, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau.\Soon after Pfaff's firing, Evers referred to the Senate's vote as ""absolute (expletive),"" but he later walked back his comments.\""Sometimes I guess I probably voice myself in a way that maybe I shouldn't or using the wrong words occasionally, but at the end of the day I will remain to be someone that is calm and try to keep civil,"" Evers said in December.\Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, said there have been ""flickers of bipartisanship,"" in the Senate's meager nine meetings in 2019. She noted a bipartisan bill to expand Medicaid reimbursement for telehealth services as one example.\""Trying to find out those areas of common ground has been difficult, unfortunately,"" Shilling said, citing ""the pettiness that has been exhibited by the majority party.""\Evers said he has hopes for more bipartisanship in 2020, but acknowledged it will take an effort from both parties to achieve.\""We've got an agenda we're trying to accomplish, and hopefully we can strike some deals with the Republicans to make that happen,"" Evers said. ""We really need to find a way to be better than Washington, D.C. It's going to take both sides to accomplish that.""\\CREDIT:

354,"'Galloping Ghost' cheers not so loud at Kaukauna High School Editor, The Post-Crescent: Although your Jan. 26 article about the upcoming Kaukauna High School ""Galloping Ghost"" statue may suggest that there is a consensus satisfaction with the statue, that is not necessarily the case at our school. Many students still feel the statue too closely resembles a member of the Ku Klux Klan, specifically an early Klan member at a time when the members dressed in simple sheets and attempted to terrorize local blacks and Catholics by appearing as ghosts. Other concerns include the fact that there are many other useful needs for money in our school, including critical department upgrades, and also the ""galloping ghost"" represents only a football ritual, perhaps not a fair embodiment of KHS as a whole.\The real concern to me is the presence of a concern at all, yet no students or faculty members have been allowed input, and this statue will be a permanent fixture at our school without a chance for us to provide a voice. To me personally, the KKK reference is a small stretch and there is some overreaction. I question the fact that a ""ghost"" has shoes and is holding his arm out in what resembles a white supremacist gesture, but I could live with the current design.\I feel the statue is very well done and I also recognize that, as a student, this isn't my money nor is it the money of anyone but the alumni association and other private contributors. I feel their hearts are in the right place when trying to construct a symbol of spirit and tradition.\However, with this controversy, it will be very difficult to embrace this as a generator of school spirit and appreciate the kind donation. J.R. Radcliffe, Sherwood 'Cavalier' to blame victimized animals Editor, The Post-Crescent: I would like to applaud The Post-Crescent's courage in running the recent story about the high rate of euthanization of the animals coming into the Fox Valley Humane Society.\One comment I found troubling was Lewis' justification for putting so many animals down by saying, ""the nature of the business requires (we) work with animals that (come) to the shelter for a reason.""\Most people in the animal welfare business know that rarely is it the animal's fault, but rather the fault of irresponsible owners. When Ms. Lewis says that ""animals come to the shelter for a reason"" she is engaging in fallacious thinking. It is called ""blaming the victim."" And yes, then putting it down. That is not humane. It is cavalier. Maria C. Kirylo, Playing Again Sams of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Pokemon death sounds suspicious Editor, The Post-Crescent: I don't mean to sound hard-hearted, but as a card-carrying cynic this reader is skeptical about a 4- month-old baby suffocating on a Burger King Pokemon ball. Yes, it has happened before, when an 11-month-old infant did the same thing. But a baby of that age is capable of putting such an object to its face, whereas a relatively newborn baby usually lacks that kind of coordination. A radio news account says the mother of the baby involved in the most recent case had never heard about the other death, therefore the 15-year-old mom didn't realize that she was giving her child a dangerous toy. Say what? My intuition tells me that the police should look very carefully into the latest case. There might be a double-motive for a copycat crime on the heels of a legitimate earlier tragedy. A teen-age girl dragged into motherhood gets rid of her unwanted child and reaps a multimillion dollar settlement from a deep- pocketed corporation; does it sound reasonable to suspect such a thing? It does to me! Thomas F. Stoeger, Appleton Neenah streets will get a little more salt Editor, The Post-Crescent: I greatly support your effort to regain control of ""It's Your Call Line"" (734-5678) and strongly urge Ameritech to immediately acquiesce to your request. But with regards to your example of a typical call ""people wanting to complain about Neenah's unplowed streets,"" I take exception.\Our streets are not unplowed. In fact, I feel our crews do an admirable job of responding to snowstorms. We are, however, as a community ""lightly salted"" in response to several citizens, who have suggested we not salt at all. In fact, 10 years ago, Neenah passed a referendum to that end.\In an effort to respond to the citizens who have taken exception with our policy, we are now increasing our use of salt slightly and concentrate on our intersections. I hope Neenah citizens will see a positive result without a negative impact on our environment or autos.\I still believe good government, like good journalism, is the art of striking a balance. Kenneth Harwood, Mayor, City of Neenah Political football played with elderly Editor, The Post-Crescent: The Coalition of Wisconsin Aging Groups is trying to get the powers that be in Madison to look at the rising cost of drugs for the elderly. This group needs the Packers organization as its advocate. When Bob Harlan talks, the governor agrees. We have been hearing, ad nauseam, plans to renovate their playground at Green Bay.\Remember how well the grass and stock sold? With former players great and small urging us that this is our future, they will have the politicians bringing them the gold, incense and myrrh. These same politicians who love the mentality of ""take from the working class and give to the wealthy"" are indeed charged with your future. Yes, fans, check the insurance coverage at work. How long will it cover after you retire? Eighteen months is the COBRA requirement. Do you plan on living 18 months after you retire? Get prepared for the shock that those life- sustaining drugs are not covered by Medicare. This comes before the Legislature and the governor will be kicking drug costs around. Do I smell a political football? Carol Rasmussen, Appleton Taxes are taking too much of his life Editor, The Post-Crescent: I did my taxes the other day, realizing that after paying Social Security tax, Medicare tax, state and local tax, and federal tax, that added up to 52 percent of my income. That is not including the taxes we all pay, gas tax for our cars, telephone tax, hotel tax, entertainment tax, taxes for heating our house, real estate tax. We all are taxed for everything. Do you get the message? I make a good income, but my living is being controlled by taxes. I'm living in poverty. Maybe the Green Bay Packers should find a way to support themselves.

Madison The 1995-'97 state budget bill approved by the Assembly Thursday and sent to the Senate includes these major provisions:
\
Delivers school property tax relief by pumping an additional $1.2 billion into public schools and freezing school tax levies.
\
For example, the owners of a median-value home who paid $2,106 in property taxes in the 1994-'95 fiscal year would pay an additional $50, or $2,156, in 1995-'96 but then see a reduction to $1,913 in 1996-'97, or $193 less than their 1994-'95 tax bill.
\
Increases the state's gas tax by at least 1.4 cents a gallon next year with revenue going to pay for highway projects.
\
Increases the annual auto registration fee from $40 to $45.
\
Increases the vehicle title registration fee for new cars and vehicle transfers from $12.50 to $15.
\
Increases the cigarette tax by 5 cents per pack from 38 cents to 43 cents.
\
Increases state park vehicle admission fees for residents from $15 to $18 for an annual pass, from $4 to $5 for a daily car pass and from $6.50 to $9 for an annual senior citizen pass. Non-resident annual auto fees will increase from $24 to $25 and from $6 to $7 for a daily sticker.
\
Calls for a 10-year phase-in of a property tax break for farmers under which agricultural land would be assessed based on its current farm use instead of the land's market value if sold for development. Critics of the plan, including Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist, say the new farm assessment method will increase taxes in cities and villages.
\
Raises the fee to obtain a copy of a birth certificate from $10 to $12, and uses the $2 increase to fight child abuse and child neglect.
\
Raises fees paid when civil suits are filed by $10 for small-claims action, by $80 for most civil court suits and doubling from $20 to $40 the forfeiture on traffic violations and other civil violations in Circuit Courts.
\
Changes voluntary $1 checkoff for state campaign fund on income tax forms so that marking the box would add a dollar to the taxes owed, or decrease the refund on the taxpayer's return. Critics of the move say this will kill the fund.
\
Modifies the minimum wage law so the state may consider factors affecting the state's general economy in setting the wage. A court ruled in March that the state could not do this and must base the wage solely on the law's ""living wage"" criteria.
\
Extends from 23 years to 27 years the payback period for tax incremental financing district bonds and allows municipalities with more than one TIF district to shift surplus revenue from one district to another.
\
EDUCATION
\
Lets any public school student drop out at age 16, if one parent approves and if the student has a full-time job, works as trade apprentice or takes vocational college courses full time. Now, students must be in school until age 18.
\
Reorganizes the State Department of Public Instruction into a State Education Department in January, and lets the governor appoint the new education secretary.
\
Creates an 11-member education commission to be chaired by Public Instruction Superintendent John Benson. The governor and legislative leaders would name eight of the nine voting commissioners.
\
MILWAUKEE
\
Expands the Milwaukee school choice program so that up to 7,000 Milwaukee students from low-income families now in public schools could attend private schools, including religious schools, at state expense during the next school year, and up to 15,000 students could participate in the following year.
\
Delays funding for one year for the Lake Parkway, which would link downtown Milwaukee with the southeastern suburbs by carrying traffic from the southern end of the Hoan Bridge to E. Layton Ave.
\
Requires the state or a third-party private group to operate Milwaukee County's foster care system by 1998.
\
Subsidizes Milwaukee's Truancy Abatement and Burglary Suppression (TABS) program for one more year, but requires Milwaukee Public Schools to pay for it in the 1996-'97 school year.
\
Cuts, from $400,000 to $350,000, a staff development subsidy for Milwaukee Public Schools. Instead, the $50,000 would pay for counseling programs that urge young women between 12 and 14 years old to abstain from sex.
\
Cuts in half from $375,000 to $187,500 the state subsidy for poison-control hot lines at Children's Hospital in Milwaukee and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Hospital. Milwaukee legislators say the cut could force one of the hot lines to close.
\
Cuts funds to test children statewide for lead poisoning. Milwaukee legislators say the worst problem is in Milwaukee, where lead from paint in old homes is found in the blood of one out of every three poor children tested.
\
Eliminates a $5.1 million subsidy for mass transit that is shared by Milwaukee County and the City of Madison.
\
STATE GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION
\
Creates these new departments: Tourism, to market parks and other tourism sites and programs; Commerce, to centralize some inspection and permitting functions; and Financial Institutions, to centralize regulation of banks, savings and loans and other financial organizations.
\
Transfers all but one function out of the secretary of state's office reducing the office's staff from 50 to about six.
\
Merges, over the objection of Attorney General James Doyle, now separate consumer- protection divisions of the Justice and Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection Departments in the Agriculture Department.
\
Gives the governor new power to appoint state secretaries of the Natural Resources, Agriculture and Education Departments. Part-time citizen boards would continue to set policies for those agencies.
\
Abolishes two public intervenors, independent state-employed lawyers whose jobs were created to protect the environment.
\
Creates a quasi-public authority to run University of Wisconsin Hospital & Clinics, requires that the authority make a one-time, $15 million payment to acknowledge past support by taxpayers statewide.
\
Shifts state welfare and vocational rehabilitation programs to the State Industry, Labor and Human Relations Department.
\
Ends the two-year-old Cost Containment Commission that has been regulating major hospital expansions, mergers and equipment purchases. As requested by the governor, the agency would be eliminated July 1.
\
Cuts the Legislature's budget and its support agencies by 10% in the budget year that begins July 1, which would save $2.4 million next year.
\
Eliminates dozens of state councils, boards, commissions and offices, unless the lieutenant governor formally recommends by Jan. 1 that they be continued.
\
JUSTICE
\
Gives State Department of Corrections a major funding increase, to nearly $450 million a year, largely to open and run new prisons. Lets the state charge inmates fees for medical care.
\
Lists a 1,200-bed ""supermax"" prison that would confine inmates up to 23 hours daily in the official building program, if the federal government pays $50 million of its $75 million construction cost.
\
Lets private businesses begin to hire inmates, who would work in a new building on a prison ground. The state would take about half their wages to offset housing costs.
\
Gives the adult prison system jurisdiction over offenders as young as 17, instead of the current 18. Moves juvenile offender programs from social services to the adult corrections departments.
\
Creates a new class of misdemeanors with no jail time and therefore no right to state paid public defender. Class includes roughly 500 offenses, including forgery, petty theft and disorderly conduct.
\
GAMBLING
\
Makes the lottery a division in the State Revenue Department.
\
Creates a new, part-time Gaming Board to set policies for the lottery, greyhound racing, charitable gaming and Indian gaming.
\
Allows greyhound racetracks to hold unlimited numbers of ""simulcast"" races, if the track holds at least 200 racing cards a year, and to keep all ""breakage,"" the amount left when prize payouts are rounded down to the nearest dime.
\
Raises the commission paid grocers and other businesses that sell lottery tickets from 5% to 5.5%, which will cut the average annual $112-per-home tax credit by about $2. Lottery retailers want 6%.
\
HEALTH CARE
\
Cuts the state subsidy for the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) child nutrition program. The governor recommended eliminating the state subsidy, but the Joint Finance Committee decided to let $1.2 million in unspent state funds be spent after July 1.

356,"
From New Berlin to Elm Grove to Ottawa, candidates for County Board are challenging incumbents on issues such as development, spending and government downsizing.
\
In New Berlin, Matt Thomas said incumbent Karl Nilson ""is more likely to spend the taxpayers'"" money and blasted Nilson for supporting a contract between the Sheriff's Department and the Village of Merton for police services that will cost the county about $6,000 this year.
\
Nilson, however, said he works hard to make responsible spending decisions. He said that approving the Sheriff's Department contract was ""the fiscally responsible thing to do,"" because the county is required by state law to provide coverage for smaller municipalities if they choose not to provide their own police.
\
In Ottawa, Scott Simon suggested incumbent Sandra Janisch has failed to police development in the rural area.
\
""We need to have someone stand up for our rights . . . and maintain our rural integrity,"" Simon said.
\
Janisch said that she has supported responsible planning strategies because ""you can't stop development.""
\
In Elm Grove, Jim Williams clashed with incumbent Joe Griffin over the size of county government.
\
""There's no question about it. There's way too many (supervisors),"" Williams said.
\
Griffin said that shrinking the 35-member board would put too big a burden on part-time supervisors.
\
""You almost have to have full-time supervisors, and then the budget would really escalate,"" Griffin said.
\
Voters in all 35 districts will choose supervisors April 7. There are contested races in just nine districts, however.
\
County Supervisors serve two-year terms and are paid $7,792 per year.
\
In separate interviews, candidates in three different parts of the county talked about issues facing county government and their desire to serve on the County Board.
\
Elm Grove, District 12: Griffin said he wants to ""finish what I've started.""
\
He pointed to his involvement in a study of a consolidated emergency dispatch system now under way and ongoing debates over what to do with the county's Expo Center and how to deal with a jail expansion.
\
Williams said he has been asked several times by other board members to run. ""It's my civic duty to do that,"" he said.
\
Both Williams and Griffin support an increase in the gas tax or vehicle registration fee to raise additional revenue for roads because it is a user fee.
\
Both oppose giving the county too much control over development issues. Development decisions, they say, are best left to local governments.
\
New Berlin, District 30: Nilson said he wants to make sure the New Berlin Senior Taxi ""gets off to a good start."" Nilson is a founder of the new service for senior citizens.
\
Nilson said that watching out for the environment and the taxpayers will continue to be a priority for him. ""Nobody has worked harder,"" he said.
\
Thomas said residents do not know who their supervisor is and vowed to ""open the lines of communication with the residents"" by going door-to-door before and after the election.
\
A member of Wisconsin Right to Life, Thomas said he would also encourage the County Board to ""adopt a resolution against abortion.""
\
Nilson and Thomas disagree on several issues, including the size of county government. Thomas would like to see the board reduced to ""seven to nine members."" Nilson called that unrealistic and said a smaller board would ""give voters a smaller voice"" and cost more in the long run.
\
Nilson said a proposed land division control ordinance that would give the county more control over development ""is a good plan."" Thomas opposed it, saying ""the rights of the property owners are most important.""
\
Ottawa, District 19: Janisch, who is seeking her fourth term, said she is dedicated to the job.
\
""I have time, and I have sincerity,"" she said. ""When I get on something, I don't let it go.""
\
Simon said he wants to ""handle county government as if it were a business and make it more responsible to the residents, not only as if they were a customer, but as if they were a shareholder.""
\
Both oppose new taxes for road improvements.
\
Simon said that money should be diverted from other areas such as parks to pay for roads. Janisch said the county needs to work harder to obtain more funding from state government or eliminate road projects from the budget.
\
Both agree that the county needs to work harder at developing affordable housing.

"
357,"Post-Crescent Assistant Editor/ Community Conversation\Since being appointed to the job by Gov. Scott Walker in January, Department of Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb has had his hands full.\Walker made jobs a priority for his administration and transportation is a key part of his budget proposal. In addition to the ongoing highway construction projects around the state, Walker announced he'd like U.S. 41 to be upgraded for inclusion in the interstate system.\Gottlieb, a former Republican Assembly member, explained in a Newsmakers interview at postcrescent.com what that means for northeast Wisconsin. Here's an edited transcript of the interview:\The governor announced he wants U.S. 41 upgraded between Green Bay and Milwaukee to become part of the interstate system. Why is that important to Wisconsin?\We think it's really important for economic development in the state. We've found, and there's a lot of evidence that indicates, that if you have a business or an industry and you're considering locating someplace and might want to be coming to Wisconsin, obviously access to transportation a really important part of that.\The interstate system, if you think about it on a national level, is kind of like a brand. When people know that they can locate a facility in close proximity to an interstate highway, they know that means certain things to access, safety, speed, convenience. We think by being able to sign U.S. 41 as an interstate between Milwaukee and Green Bay will create great economic opportunities for the Fox Valley.\What's involved with the conversion?\The conversion process started some years ago, and as I'm sure you're very well aware, there's a lot of work going on up and down U.S. 41 to expand capacity but also to make some improvements to bring it up to interstate standards. As we go forward, the department is going to be involved in some environmental processes and we will be involved in some negotiations with the federal highway administration about what additional types of upgrades we may need to have to bring the highway up to interstate standards with the ultimate goal in several years that we would be marking the highway with interstate signs.\What are some of the standards we have to achieve?\There are some things related to shoulder widths, median protection, vertical clearance at bridges and some things off the roadway that need to be talked about, such as signage and things like that.\The work going on now fits into that plan?\Sure, absolutely. We have a major project going on on U.S. 41 right now in Brown and Winnebago counties. That's ongoing and that will all be bringing the road up to interstate standards. In other areas, there may be some changes that need to be made. We think the estimated cost here, over and above the work that we're doing already, is not more than $15 million to $20 million, which we think will certainly pay off in significant economic development benefits for northeast Wisconsin.\What timeframe are we looking at?\Now, with the governor's direction, we are looking toward starting to do some of the public involvement and environmental processes. We'll be talking later this year about what number we would be using, and that will ultimately will be something that the federal government will be involved in deciding, but our hope is that, sometime around 2015, we would be signing the interstate.\What types of funding changes are involved?\It's really not a funding issue. It's more of an economic development thing. It really doesn't change a lot.\We get our funding for the state highway program from a variety of different sources: a significant amount federal dollars and state dollars that are generated by people's gas taxes and motor fuel fees and also bonding that we do, so that's not going to change.\Can you update us on the status of the $390 million U.S. 41/State 441 interchange project?\Just a little bit of background -- I served in the Legislature before I was appointed by the governor to this position. I recall, back in the middle of the last decade, coming up to Neenah for a public hearing where we talked about transportation needs and I distinctly remember folks from the business community talking about how important it was to do that interchange at 41 and 10.\What has happened there is the Transportation Projects Commission, which is the state entity that's responsible for recommending these large-scale projects, met in October pursuant to a recommendation made by the Department of Transportation at that time. The commission supported that recommendation to ask the Legislature to formally enumerate the project so it could be put into the budget.\The governor has included that recommendation in his budget and we're certainly hopeful and have every expectation that the Legislature is going to go along with that recommendation, which would free up the Department of Transportation to move forward with the project, which would probably be constructed around 2016.\Public transit funding is a hot topic right now. A committee voted to dissolve regional transit authorities. What is the future of RTAs?\The RTA bill was passed in the previous session in the Legislature. The governor, in his proposed budget, had basically only recommended one change to the RTA law, and that was that he felt it was important that, before you start a new tax, you should have a referendum. It's important for people to have the opportunity to have some say-so in having to pay a new tax.\The Joint Finance Committee did vote to essentially abolish the RTAs. That's not the governor's proposal, that's the Legislature's action, and where that is going forward is anybody's guess. It has to go to both houses of the legislature and be signed by the governor. We'll see what happens.\Why has the governor put such a high value on transportation funding in his budget proposal?\I know the governor recognizes the important role that a good transportation system plays in growing the economy. The governor's objective when he came into office was to grow the economy and to create 250,000 private-sector jobs. The transportation industry itself, as were designing and building roads, that's a job-creating thing. Those are good nonexportable, nonoutsourceable family-supporting jobs that build our transportation infrastructure.\Over and above those jobs, as we talked about with the interstate conversion, access to a good transportation system is critical to getting people to work and getting freight moved, whether it's within the state or through the state. It helps to get tourists to their destination. Tourism is one of the big industries in Wisconsin. Agriculture, manufacturing, all of those industries depend on good transportation.\Do you see a day in which Wisconsin would have to implement a toll program?\We have in Wisconsin, compared to other states, a fairly narrow source of revenue for transportation. About 90 percent of the revenue that comes from state sources comes from the gas tax and vehicle registration fees. The governor has a proposal in this budget to expand on the base of funding for transportation by depositing 7.5 percent of the sales taxes collected for auto-related purchases into the transportation fund.\Nationally, there is a concern that, as people drive more fuel-efficient vehicles, that creates a problem for states that rely a lot on the motor fuels tax. Having said that, the decisions going forward about where we get the revenues are ones that are going to be made by state policymakers and by the governor.\What service improvements are planned for the Division of Motor Vehicles?\We are really involved with trying to get more into e-commerce to create an environment where people don't have to come visit a DMV service center unless they really want to. We have an initiative in this budget where there is some funding for us to move forward with some electronic initiatives.\Certainly, we can improve the vehicle registration process. There are some other things that involve industry and business and making it easier for, say, trucking firms to obtain the permits they need. It makes for a more frictionless process and saves costs for businesses.\Sarah Riley: 920-993-1000, ext. 225, or sriley@postcrescent;com; on Twitter @PCViews\ID_Code: U0201110110511038"
358,"Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, a longtime fixture inMadisongovernment, is one of eight Democrats seeking to unseat Gov. Scott Walker in the November governor's race.Soglin's political career began in 1968 after hehad won a seat on the Madison City Council. His current term as mayor began in2011. Between his time in public office, Soglinworked as an attorney and consultant for Epic Systems, the Verona-based software giant.Here are his responses to The Daily Reporter's questionnaire:1. If elected, how would you manage the state’s existing deal with Foxconn and development expected to follow the company to southeast Wisconsin?It is very likely that the parties, the state of Wisconsin and Foxconn, violated the terms of the initial agreement and existing statutes. I will notify Foxconn that the agreement is null and that they have a choice: either come back to the table or sue the state of Wisconsin. Three times in my career I inherited agreements not in the public interest, and three times I stood fast on behalf of the hard-working people I represented. I will do it again.2. If you plan to back out of the state’s deal with Foxconn, how would you change plans for supplemental road projects along Interstate 94 and elsewhere to support the manufacturing campus?When you stand up to a party entered into an illegal agreement and do so on behalf of the best interests of hard working people who are in the right on every issue the environment, taxation policy, fighting corporate giveaways and greed that is honorable and noble. To call such a strategy “back(ing) out” is the position of Quislings and cowards.There are bright people, previously ignored in the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. A great and smart governor would seek out their recommendations.3. Does the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. effectively shepherd economic development in Wisconsin? Why or why not?With the exception of the (Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority), which is professionally managed, WEDC is a disastrous mess. The fact that they concurred in the Foxconn deal is proof of their incompetence. Even the Koch Brothers and the National Review recognized this was a horrible example of state-corporate socialism. All of my economic advisors will familiarize themselves with the research and findings of the Kauffman Foundation.Specific attention will be paid to these three well-researched findings: The best way to create job growth is supporting small businesses and startups. States always lose when they get into a bidding war offering large corporate tax giveaways. The best jobs are created by small businesses.6. What role to private sector unions play in Wisconsin's economy? What policies would you enact or support to further this view of them?All public and private sector unions should have their rights restored. I have bargained dozens of contracts in my 22 years as mayor. I took a strike from the teamsters in the 1970’s. It was not the end of the world. I never lost a binding arbitration case which is probably the reason that despite my pro-union record, organized labor endorsed Mahlon Mitchell. You need to be fair and tough a scary notion for many. That’s my policy.5. Would you seek to repeal Act 10? If so, how would the state pay for the higher costs associated with a stronger bargaining position for public sector unions?Prior to Act 10, Wisconsin had no problem paying for public employees. The problem was we were not growing the tax base fast enough because we were driven by the discredited notion that cutting corporate taxes and taxes on the wealthy would create more jobs. Of course, we know that private investment that leads to the creation of great jobs comes from wise public investment in infrastructure and human capacity. Rather than destroying unions, Wisconsin needs to raise the bar so that every worker has access to decent health coverage and a reasonable retirement plan. Bargaining rights for public and private sector unions need to be restored.6. Do you support reinstating prevailing wage on state construction project? Why or why not?Yes. Workers and the responsible contractors know it is best. Obviously, the prevailing wage protects construction workers. What most people do not realize is that its absence leads to shoddy construction and dangerous practices. Without prevailing wage, unscrupulous contractors, in an effort to obtain the lowest bid, will cut corners and hire unqualified workers who can be paid a very low wage. This means that qualified contractors who hire the best construction workers will not be able to compete for the low bid and everyone, including the developer who accepts the low bid, is damaged in the long run.7. Does Wisconsin need new or higher taxes to pay for infrastructure projects? If so, what taxes would you enact or raise to pay for these projects? If you would not add or raise taxes, what parts of the state budget could be cut to pay for new infrastructure?Wisconsin public infrastructure needs are many. This is critical from the standpoint of safety and from the standpoint of economic development since we know proper investment in infrastructure leads to the private investment that create good jobs. Three examples: Roads and public transit. Going back to the rise of the dairy industry, we learned that road investment stimulated the economy. Obviously urban industrial and manufacturing centers need to move their goods and not be tied up in traffic congestion. An increase in the gas tax, and its indexing, is one way of raising the necessary revenues High speed internet. Just as investment and regulations requiring electrification and land line telephones strengthened Wisconsin one hundred years ago, we need to do the same with high speed internet. We need speeds that are competitive with Paris and Seoul. The legacy companies like ATT and Comcast grew fat and lazy, content to churn each other’s customers, and offer speeds twice that of last year’s which means traveling 4 miles an hour instead of 2, when we should be going at 100 mphIt will cost an estimated $1.5 billion to wire every parcel in Wisconsin. The state should put up $500 million, half coming from increased fees on the new service and half coming from Foxconn savings. The private sector can bid on the project, the contract going to the proposal that commits the remaining $1 billion and the highest quality service. This will produce more and better jobs than Foxconn, greater income to the state and less risk. No community can be any stronger than its public schools. We need to significantly increase state participation in funding our public schools and cut, at least in half, the reliance on the property tax. The funding should be based on population and families below the poverty level, not on real estate values as is the existing formula. New revenue sources will come from the significant cut in the Wisconsin Department of Corrections budget and the possibility of an increase of a half cent in the sales tax.I will not support Mahlon Mitchell’s constitutional amendment for the state to fund two-thirds of the cost of schools. That proposal makes no distinction between the needs of a wealthy suburb and a poor school district.8. What is the solution to Wisconsin’s shortage of workers?Workers congregate where there are great jobs and great schools. Intelligent and creative workers come from great schools. Add to that affordable housing (a state tax credit plan); transportation including roads and public transit; access to affordable health care including attention to nutrition, behavioral health, and substance abuse; and quality childcare and we will have no problem developing, keeping, and attracting a great workforce. And let’s pay them enough as well, starting at $15 an hour to be phased in over an estimated five years.\CREDIT: Nate Beck, nbeck@dailyreporter.com"

The economy tops the draw for many Americans' interest in the 2008 presidential campaign.
\
Tiffany Martinez, 42, had never worked for a candidate before, and instead of volunteering 10 hours a week, she says she probably should be finding paid work. But even with her husband's unemployment checks running out soon and house payments gnawing at savings for their 5-year-old son's education, working on the election lets Martinez feel she's doing something for her family's future.
\
""I've voted before and crossed my fingers and wished that my candidate won, and I can't afford to do that this year,"" said Martinez, who lives in Franklin and is campaigning for Barack Obama.
\
Likewise, Bobby Kraft got involved as a John McCain supporter after a campaign official heard him voicing his concerns as a small-business owner.
\
""It now gives me an opportunity to make sure at least that maybe the small-business guy and maybe the Main Street person is being heard a little bit,"" said Kraft, 30, who's president and chief executive officer of First Edge Solutions, a digital printing and document management company with 75 employees in Milwaukee's Walker's Point area.
\
Martinez considers Obama more attuned to workers. Kraft sees McCain letting entrepreneurs grow.
\
Economists say that based on their campaign rhetoric, their voting records and the background of their advisers, McCain and Obama have contrasting economic views generally, with McCain more prone to let free markets prevail and Obama more open to government intervention.
\
Manufacturing at risk
\
Among the issues that separate them, trade policies provide an example in an area important to Wisconsin.
\
McCain portrays himself as a champion of free trade, supportive of current and pending trade agreements, and an advocate for more. In April, he met with business executives in South Milwaukee and heard how trade deals help local companies compete globally.
\
Obama says he's for free trade but takes issue with past agreements, seeking stronger language for and enforcement of labor and environmental standards aimed at putting trading partners on more equal footing. At the General Motors plant in Janesville in February, Obama blamed trade policies for the loss of U.S. factory jobs.
\
Though not drawing as much attention as their tax policies or health care plans, the candidates' foreign trade stances matter more in Wisconsin than in most states because of a heavy reliance on manufacturing.
\
More than one-fifth of Wisconsin's gross domestic product and 17% of its work force depend directly on manufacturing, which collectively pays more than any other sector. The average manufacturing wage exceeded $47,000 last year, 23% more than for all industries.
\
""It's hard to imagine how the state is going to remain prosperous if its best-paying sector keeps on shedding jobs,"" said Alan Tonelson, research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, which represents 1,500 companies, most of which are family-owned manufacturers.
\
Manufacturing accounts for 94% of Wisconsin's exports, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. More than 40% of that trade goes to Canada and Mexico, partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, a point of contention in the campaign.
\
Blaming NAFTA for U.S. job losses, Obama has called for amending the agreement. McCain has criticized Obama for ""protectionist NAFTA-bashing.""
\
Presidential sway
\
Presidents have relatively little control over such titanic forces as demographics, economic cycles and globalization, but trade pacts are something in their bailiwick, said Scott Drewianka, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
\
""The president has a lot to say about it. These agreements are always negotiated by someone appointed by the president,"" Drewianka said.
\
Tonelson said his group is nonpartisan and doesn't endorse candidates, but it would be happier with a candidate who put a higher priority on trade deals and worked to improve trade benefits to U.S. manufacturers.
\
""What we seem to be left with in this election is, on trade policy matters, a contest between a somewhat ambivalent critic of U.S. trade policy who frankly doesn't seem to attach much importance to it at all and a full-throated champion of current trade policy,"" Tonelson said.
\
Van Mobley, an economist at Concordia University Wisconsin, agreed that both candidates need to show more interest in trade policies, especially in manufacturing-heavy battlegrounds such as Wisconsin.
\
So far, free-trade policies have resulted in manufacturing and energy sectors growing in other countries at the expense of those industries in the United States, Mobley said. Consequently, Mobley said, America has relied more on its financial sector, which in light of the federal bailout has proved to be ""a dreadful mistake.""
\
""We need Obama and McCain to say, 'Main Street would be better off with a smaller Wall Street and a larger and more vigorous energy and manufacturing sector,'"" said Mobley, who supports McCain.
\
In their campaign literature, both candidates mention the need to beef up training for workers whose jobs are vulnerable to overseas competition. But they offer separate approaches.
\
Obama would extend the existing supports for manufacturing workers to service industry workers whose jobs go abroad.
\
McCain would overhaul the unemployment insurance system to provide retraining assistance.
\
The Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas analyzed campaign plans and decided that, under Obama, employment in education, telecommunications, manufacturing, alternative energy and construction would benefit. If McCain wins, according to Challenger, oil and gas companies, aerospace and defense contractors, nuclear engineering firms, the automotive industry, and insurance and financial services should expect to grow.
\
Stimulus plans
\
The candidates also take divergent tacks on how to jump-start the economy.
\
McCain favors targeting problem areas, such as helping cash-poor subprime borrowers, strengthening student loans and having a gas tax holiday, while Obama prefers more traditional shot-in-the-arm stimulants including rebates and state budget relief funds, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
\
""They are different approaches, and I don't have an opinion on which would work better. They actually are both crafted from a number of sensible plans,"" MacGuineas said. ""And it's a very confusing economy, so nobody knows how to navigate what we're going through.""
\
Dissimilar economic approaches by the candidates also pop up on other issues.
\
For instance, Obama is co-sponsor of the so-called Employee Free Choice Act, legislation that would make it easier for unions to organize workers.
\
McCain opposes the labor-supported measure, saying it would allow unions to coerce workers into joining unions.
\
Likewise, Obama supports raising the minimum wage and adjusting it annually to inflation. McCain doesn't.
\
Of course, candidates stands aren't always true indicators of how they'll lead, said Dean Baker, economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
\
""You have to see what they do when they get in office,"" said Baker, an Obama supporter. Corporate influences on officeholders can be powerful, Baker said.
\
""If I had to say who's more likely to stick to their position, I'd be very surprised that McCain does not,"" Baker said. ""Less so if Obama does not.""
\
ON THE STUMP
\
Sen. John McCain, Green Bay, Sept. 19:
\
""I will expand markets for our goods and services. One in five of all jobs in this country are linked to world trade. In five states alone -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Colorado -- over 5 million jobs depend on trade. My economic recovery plan will create millions of jobs in America instead of driving them overseas.""
\
Sen. Barack Obama, Janesville, Feb. 13:
\
""It's a Washington where decades of trade deals like NAFTA and China have been signed with plenty of protections for corporations and their profits, but none for our environment or our workers who've seen factories shut their doors and millions of jobs disappear; workers whose right to organize and unionize has been under assault for the last eight years.""

360,"Since being appointed to the job by Gov. Scott Walker in January, Department of Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb has had his hands full.\Walker made jobs a priority for his administration and transportation is a key part of his budget proposal. In addition to the ongoing highway construction projects around the state, Walker announced he'd like U.S. 41 to be upgraded for inclusion in the interstate system.\Gottlieb, a former Republican Assembly member, explained in a Newsmakers interview at postcrescent.com what that means for northeast Wisconsin. Here's an edited transcript of the interview:\The governor announced he wants U.S. 41 upgraded between Green Bay and Milwaukee to become part of the interstate system. Why is that important to Wisconsin?\We think it's really important for economic development in the state. We've found, and there's a lot of evidence that indicates, that if you have a business or an industry and you're considering locating someplace and might want to be coming to Wisconsin, obviously access to transportation a really important part of that.\The interstate system, if you think about it on a national level, is kind of like a brand. When people know that they can locate a facility in close proximity to an interstate highway, they know that means certain things to access, safety, speed, convenience. We think by being able to sign U.S. 41 as an interstate between Milwaukee and Green Bay will create great economic opportunities for the Fox Valley.\What's involved with the conversion?\The conversion process started some years ago, and as I'm sure you're very well aware, there's a lot of work going on up and down U.S. 41 to expand capacity but also to make some improvements to bring it up to interstate standards. As we go forward, the department is going to be involved in some environmental processes and we will be involved in some negotiations with the federal highway administration about what additional types of upgrades we may need to have to bring the highway up to interstate standards with the ultimate goal in several years that we would be marking the highway with interstate signs.\What are some of the standards we have to achieve?\There are some things related to shoulder widths, median protection, vertical clearance at bridges and some things off the roadway that need to be talked about, such as signage and things like that.\The work going on now fits into that plan?\Sure, absolutely. We have a major project going on on U.S. 41 right now in Brown and Winnebago counties. That's ongoing and that will all be bringing the road up to interstate standards. In other areas, there may be some changes that need to be made. We think the estimated cost here, over and above the work that we're doing already, is not more than $15 million to $20 million, which we think will certainly pay off in significant economic development benefits for northeast Wisconsin.\What timeframe are we looking at?\Now, with the governor's direction, we are looking toward starting to do some of the public involvement and environmental processes. We'll be talking later this year about what number we would be using, and that will ultimately will be something that the federal government will be involved in deciding, but our hope is that, sometime around 2015, we would be signing the interstate.\What types of funding changes are involved?\It's really not a funding issue. It's more of an economic development thing. It really doesn't change a lot.\We get our funding for the state highway program from a variety of different sources: a significant amount federal dollars and state dollars that are generated by people's gas taxes and motor fuel fees and also bonding that we do, so that's not going to change.\Can you update us on the status of the $390 million U.S. 41/State 441 interchange project?\Just a little bit of background -- I served in the Legislature before I was appointed by the governor to this position. I recall, back in the middle of the last decade, coming up to Neenah for a public hearing where we talked about transportation needs and I distinctly remember folks from the business community talking about how important it was to do that interchange at 41 and 10.\What has happened there is the Transportation Projects Commission, which is the state entity that's responsible for recommending these large-scale projects, met in October pursuant to a recommendation made by the Department of Transportation at that time. The commission supported that recommendation to ask the Legislature to formally enumerate the project so it could be put into the budget.\The governor has included that recommendation in his budget and we're certainly hopeful and have every expectation that the Legislature is going to go along with that recommendation, which would free up the Department of Transportation to move forward with the project, which would probably be constructed around 2016.\Public transit funding is a hot topic right now. A committee voted to dissolve regional transit authorities. What is the future of RTAs?\The RTA bill was passed in the previous session in the Legislature. The governor, in his proposed budget, had basically only recommended one change to the RTA law, and that was that he felt it was important that, before you start a new tax, you should have a referendum. It's important for people to have the opportunity to have some say-so in having to pay a new tax.\The Joint Finance Committee did vote to essentially abolish the RTAs. That's not the governor's proposal, that's the Legislature's action, and where that is going forward is anybody's guess. It has to go to both houses of the legislature and be signed by the governor. We'll see what happens.\Why has the governor put such a high value on transportation funding in his budget proposal?\I know the governor recognizes the important role that a good transportation system plays in growing the economy. The governor's objective when he came into office was to grow the economy and to create 250,000 private-sector jobs. The transportation industry itself, as were designing and building roads, that's a job-creating thing. Those are good nonexportable, nonoutsourceable family-supporting jobs that build our transportation infrastructure.\Over and above those jobs, as we talked about with the interstate conversion, access to a good transportation system is critical to getting people to work and getting freight moved, whether it's within the state or through the state. It helps to get tourists to their destination. Tourism is one of the big industries in Wisconsin. Agriculture, manufacturing, all of those industries depend on good transportation.\Do you see a day in which Wisconsin would have to implement a toll program?\We have in Wisconsin, compared to other states, a fairly narrow source of revenue for transportation. About 90 percent of the revenue that comes from state sources comes from the gas tax and vehicle registration fees. The governor has a proposal in this budget to expand on the base of funding for transportation by depositing 7.5 percent of the sales taxes collected for auto-related purchases into the transportation fund.\Nationally, there is a concern that, as people drive more fuel-efficient vehicles, that creates a problem for states that rely a lot on the motor fuels tax. Having said that, the decisions going forward about where we get the revenues are ones that are going to be made by state policymakers and by the governor.\What service improvements are planned for the Division of Motor Vehicles?\We are really involved with trying to get more into e-commerce to create an environment where people don't have to come visit a DMV service center unless they really want to. We have an initiative in this budget where there is some funding for us to move forward with some electronic initiatives.\Certainly, we can improve the vehicle registration process. There are some other things that involve industry and business and making it easier for, say, trucking firms to obtain the permits they need. It makes for a more frictionless process and saves costs for businesses.\On the Web\Watch the interview with state Department of Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb at postcrescent.com/livestream.\Sarah Riley: 920-993-1000, ext. 225, or sriley@postcrescent;com; on Twitter @PCViews"
361,"
Madison - Gov. Jim Doyle on Tuesday traded targeted tax increases - on smokers, hospitals and oil companies - for more health care and stable funding for the state's transportation system.
\
Handing the Legislature his two-year budget, the governor also called for a $20 increase in the annual car registration fee. The 36% boost would bring it from $55 to $75.
\
In his re-election campaign last year, he said he supported an increase of about $10.
\
The biggest single increase ever in vehicle registration fees, it would cost Wisconsin drivers about $170 million more over the next two years.
\
Doyle's budget would add - not cut - workers. Of 791 new workers, 120 would monitor sex offenders who must be tracked by global positioning monitors.
\
When he ran for governor in 2002, the Democrat said he would try to cut 10,000 state jobs by 2010. But that push has stalled because of public safety needs and federal mandates, officials said.
\
Aides said the budget makes good on a campaign promise to not raise general sales or income taxes.
\
But it would also double - from $3 to $6 for every $1,000 of sale price - the real estate transfer fee paid when property is sold, costing about $140 million more over the next two years.
\
""This is not a budget for the big oil companies or the big tobacco companies,"" Doyle said. ""It is a budget for the middle- class and for those trying to get there.""
\
But Republican legislators accused Doyle of balancing his budget with more than $1.7 billion in new state and local taxes - an amount they said equals $310 per person.
\
Assembly Speaker Mike Huebsch (R-West Salem) said he was concerned about the number of proposed tax increases. ""The governor outlined a number of priorities to a lot of different groups tonight, but the one priority he seemed to forget was the taxpayers,"" Huebsch said.
\
""He finally has done what he said he would never do, and that is raise taxes,"" said Senate Republican Leader Scott Fitzgerald of Juneau.
\
He called Doyle's proposal to prevent oil companies from passing taxes on to consumers illegal, and said it amounted to raising the 32.9-cent per gallon gas tax.
\
But if Senate Democrats go along with Doyle's tax increases, Republicans who control the Assembly would face a painful choice, if they want to kill the tax increases: Either give up the new health programs and highway concrete or cut elsewhere to preserve them.
\
The governor proposed $57.7 billion in total spending, including state and federal funds, over the next two years - a 9% increase over the current budget.
\
Doyle said his budget would continue to shave a long-term deficit that was $3 billion four years ago to $670 million by mid-2009.
\
Health care: Doyle has made health care one of his top priorities this term - pledging to ensure that 98% of Wisconsin residents are insured. That is the area of the budget that benefits most from the new taxes.
\
""By expanding health coverage to children and adults, and helping reduce the cost for hardworking families, we plan to make Wisconsin America's leader,"" he said.
\
Doyle wants to raise the tax on a pack of cigarettes $1.25, to $2.02.
\
He also wants to tax hospitals 1% of their gross revenues. Over two years, the hospital tax would bring in $418 million and capture $575 million in new federal aid.
\
More than two-thirds of that $993 million generated from the hospital tax would go back to hospitals in reimbursement rate increases. The state's hospitals oppose the tax, saying it would be passed onto patients and isn't sustainable.
\
The rest would go toward the state's Medicaid program for low- income, elderly and disabled residents.
\
Doyle has proposed expanding those programs to give all children health care and make adults who don't have children eligible for insurance through Medicaid.
\
Federal restrictions prevent the state from returning to hospitals exactly what they pay in taxes. Those that serve the highest number of Medicaid patients would receive the biggest portions back, but some would receive less than they put in.
\
The hospital tax plan would need federal approval.
\
Transportation programs: Doyle would boost the state transportation fund with higher fees for drivers and a new tax on oil companies. In addition to higher annual vehicle registration fees, Doyle is recommending a $10 increase in driver's license fees, from $24 to $34 for renewal.
\
Doyle wants oil companies to pay a new tax to fund roads and bar them from passing the tax on to consumers. Doyle said the state can legally do that, but critics question whether it has that authority.
\
""Let's turn the tables on big oil and give Wisconsin families a break,"" Doyle said.
\
Doyle's budget would use some of the new transportation money to pay for school busing, debt and other costs, which will likely face opposition.
\
Included in the budget is $241 million to rebuild I-94 from Milwaukee to the Illinois border and $24 million for preliminary work on the Zoo Interchange.
\
Land stewardship: Doyle wants to increase by 75% the Knowles- Nelson Stewardship program, bringing it from $60 million to $105 million a year in 2011. The 18-year-old program issues bonds to buy and preserve recreational land. Doyle wants increased funding to keep pace with rising land values.

\
BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS
\
Some of the initiatives and new taxes included in the governor's proposed budget:
\
Health care
\
-- Raise the state's cigarette tax by $1.25 a pack, taking it to $2.02, to raise nearly $500 million in the next two years to pay for anti-smoking efforts and smoking-related health-care costs.
\
-- A 1% tax on hospital revenue, which would bring in $418 million and leverage an additional $575 million in federal aid.
\
-- By 2008, allow all children in Wisconsin access to health insurance through BadgerCare Plus.
\
-- Expand the state's Medicaid program for low-income, elderly and disabled residents to offer health care coverage to adults who may meet BadgerCare income requirements but don't have children.
\
Tax cuts
\
-- Allow taxpayers to deduct college tuition at public and private colleges and universities equal to the maximum tuition on any University of Wisconsin System campus, now about $6,000, when they file their 2007 income taxes.
\
-- Allow parents or students to deduct the cost of books and fees paid at colleges and universities, also with this tax year.
\
-- Starting in 2008, change state law so that all health-care premiums paid in Wisconsin are tax deductible, and not just premiums paid by companies with pretax accounts.
\
-- Begin phasing in a $3,000 day-care tax deduction for one child and $6,000 for two or more children.
\
Transportation

362,"When Republican state Sen. Terry Moulton decided this was his last term representing the 23rd Senate District, Kathy Bernier decided she was going to try to keep the seat in her party.\Bernier has served as the 68th Assembly District representative since 2010. Bernier is 62 years old, retired and has three children and six grandchildren.\Opposing Bernier will be Democrat Chris Kapsner. A political newcomer, Kapsner is an emergency room physician from Boyceville. He is a member of a group of doctors who provide emergency services to hospitals in western Wisconsin, Minneapolis and St. Paul. Kapsner, 55, has a wife and four children.\The 23rd District of the Wisconsin Senate is located in western Wisconsin and is composed of parts of Barron, Clark, Chippewa, Dunn, Taylor, Eau Claire, Wood, and Marathon counties.\We asked the two candidates to fill out a questionnaire on some important subjects to voters. Here are Bernier and Kapsner's responses, which have been edited for brevity.\In what way should Wisconsin improve its funding of road construction and repairs?\Bernier: Raising taxes significantly to just throw more money at the problem is not the answer. I believe there are significant efficiencies to be found at the DOT but I also believe more funding is needed in certain areas. I voted to provide the largest increases to local road and bridge aids in 20 years, something our communities are already benefiting from.\Kapsner: I would work to protect our economic opportunities by investing in the quality and safety of our community roads. I believe that the citizens using the roads most should be paying for the use of the roads. The gas tax is the closest to a sustainable user fee and should be utilized as part of a comprehensive approach to keep our transportation fund solvent and reduce our infrastructure debt.\Should Act 10 be partially or fully repealed? Why or why not?\Bernier: It is important to remember the reason for Act 10 was to bring government employees benefits, at all levels, more in line with the private sector. Requiring employees to pay the employee portion of their retirement and to pay at least 12% of their health insurance was fair to taxpayers who could no longer afford more tax increases. By giving local governments and school districts the tools to make their own personnel decision they are able to promote their best employees and devote more resources to what they do best.\Kapsner: Unions in Wisconsin have always advanced workers rights including, 40-hour work weeks, health benefits, and safety standards. Any law that takes away the voice of workers at the bargaining table is unacceptable. The freedom for workers to collectively bargain to determine their working conditions, including pay, benefits, hours, family leave and safety is crucial to Wisconsin families employed in both public and private jobs. I will fully support efforts to restore workers rights and repeal Act 10. Where there are strong unions there are good wages for both union and non-union workers.\What specific steps should the state take to ensure that it has an adequately skilled and prepared workforce?\Bernier: I authored a bill specifically to increase support for our technical colleges and to better match workers with available jobs. We've also taken steps legislatively to encourage workers to get off state assistance programs and enter the workforce and to better support those who are already trying to do so. Worker training, apprenticeships, addiction counseling and mental health support are all parts of the solution.\Kapsner: Our UW schools and technical colleges are a driving force behind the economic success of our communities, businesses and families. Several years of cuts to campuses have resulted in teacher layoffs, millions in lost research funding and longer graduation times for students. If elected, I would expand the pipeline of highly-skilled workers from our universities and technical colleges by restoring much-needed investment in these institutions and addressing the student loan debt crisis.\Is Foxconn a good deal for Wisconsin? Why or why not?\Bernier: The Foxconn investment represents an unprecedented opportunity to bring an entirely new industry to our state. Work is already underway and involves construction companies from every corner of the state, including Menomonie and Marathon in our area. While some like to claim we've thrown away a huge sum of money on this, in reality, Wisconsin's investment is ""pay as they grow"" with tax credits released only as jobs are created. In addition to their factory, Foxconn is investing in research facilities around the state, including in Eau Claire.\Kapsner: Foxconn is not good for Wisconsin. It tips the scales in favor of a foreign corporation, and takes much-needed taxpayer dollars directly from local classrooms, roads and health care systems leaving our communities at a disadvantage. Wisconsin families are working harder than ever but can't seem to get ahead because of Republican policies that continue to benefit special interests and out-of-state corporations.\Would you support legislation ending the so-called ""dark stores"" loophole that allows stores to pay taxes on their properties equivalent to those of a comparably-sized but vacant building?\Bernier: Everyone should be paying their fair share of taxes and I feel it is important that property taxes especially should not be shifted unnecessarily unto the backs of homeowners. In addition, I strongly believe that our state and local governments rely too heavily on property taxes and we should pursue a major rewrite of our tax code to better balance our tax structure.\Kapsner: Yes. I believe that the ""dark store"" loophole puts our communities at a disadvantage and unfairly shifts the burden onto our local businesses and taxpayers. In the State Senate I will work to ensure that our economy works for everyone by restoring economic fairness and protecting Wisconsin communities, seniors and working families.\Would you support changing state law to legalize marijuana and/or cannabis products? If so, under what conditions? If not, why?\Bernier: Before making major changes to our state's drug laws, we should first study the results of other states which have already made this change. Certainly tax revenue from marijuana sales sound promising but we must also determine the true social costs of legalization. I am looking very seriously at the benefits of the CBD oil for medicinal uses as research is showing it has promising potential without the typical side effects of marijuana.\Kapsner: Yes. I am supportive of a well-regulated medicinal marijuana program that provides access to treatment for patients suffering from severe, debilitating illnesses.\Why are you running for office?\Bernier: I'm running for the state senate to continue serving my constituents by listening to their concerns and then going to work for them. I believe that we have already made a real difference in our state, but there is more to be done! I will continue working hard to make Wisconsin and the 23rd Senate District a great place to live, work and raise a family. I want to be your voice in the State Senate. One of my greatest pleasures is helping people, just like you, with issues and concerns that they have.\Kapsner: As an emergency physician, I understand impact that the high cost of health care, coupled with the crisis of opioid abuse and addiction has had on our families. I've spent my career as a physician advocating for my patients and now I am running for the State Senate to do the same for the residents of the 23rd District. By investing in each other, we can create opportunities for everyone.\What makes you the better candidate in this race?\Bernier: I was born and raised in this area and have a proven track record of listening to residents about the issues important to them and then acting on them. I'm not afraid to take on the special interests or even stand up to the leadership of my own party when necessary. I'm committed to doing the right thing, because it is the right thing to do.\Kapsner: I understand the importance of using evidence and best practice to solve a problem. I am a father of four, and longtime resident of Wisconsin. I see the numerous challenges and stresses that our communities face. In the State Senate, I would advocate for working families, build up our middle class, and help create an economy that works for everyone in our state.\What are district residents telling you are their most important issues, and how would you address them?\Bernier: While many issues come up, certainly education and health care are among the most common. We have continued to address both in the legislature. I successfully fought for $600 million in new funding for K-12 education, including an extra $604 per student over the next two years. Lowering health care costs through innovation and best practices will benefit business and families in our area.\Kapsner: Residents of the 23rd District are telling me that increasing access to affordable health care, investing in quality public schools and strong infrastructure and protecting our environment are the most pressing issues facing our state. I know that these are the essential building blocks of a healthy community and I believe they must be prioritized.\What is something positive you could say about your opponent?\Bernier: I respect the hard work and dedication that my opponent has shown entering the medical profession and serving people in their most desperate moments in a big city emergency room.\Kapsner: Public service is an important part of our civic duty, and while I do not agree with my opponent's policies, I respect anyone who is willing to run for elected office and serve their community.\Bernier\Kapsner\CREDIT: Mitchell A.

I will fully support efforts to restore workers rights and repeal Act 10. Where there are strong unions there are good wages for both union and non-union workers.\What specific steps should the state take to ensure that it has an adequately skilled and prepared workforce?\Bernier: I authored a bill specifically to increase support for our technical colleges and to better match workers with available jobs.

Worker training, apprenticeships, addiction counseling and mental health support are all parts of the solution.\Kapsner: Our UW schools and technical colleges are a driving force behind the economic success of our communities, businesses and families.

Why or why not?\Bernier: The Foxconn investment represents an unprecedented opportunity to bring an entirely new industry to our state. Work is already underway and involves construction companies from every corner of the state, including Menomonie and Marathon in our area. While some like to claim we've thrown away a huge sum of money on this, in reality, Wisconsin's investment is ""pay as they grow"" with tax credits released only as jobs are created. In addition to their factory, Foxconn is investing in research facilities around the state, including in Eau Claire.\Kapsner: Foxconn is not good for Wisconsin. It tips the scales in favor of a foreign corporation, and takes much-needed taxpayer dollars directly from local classrooms, roads and health care systems leaving our communities at a disadvantage. Wisconsin families are working harder than ever but can't seem to get ahead because of Republican policies that continue to benefit special interests and out-of-state corporations.\Would you support legislation ending the so-called ""dark stores"" loophole that allows stores to pay taxes on their properties equivalent to those of a comparably-sized but vacant building?\Bernier: Everyone should be paying their fair share of taxes and I feel it is important that property taxes especially should not be shifted unnecessarily unto the backs of homeowners. In addition, I strongly believe that our state and local governments rely too heavily on property taxes and we should pursue a major rewrite of our tax code to better balance our tax structure.\Kapsner: Yes. I believe that the ""dark store"" loophole puts our communities at a disadvantage and unfairly shifts the burden onto our local businesses and taxpayers. In the State Senate I will work to ensure that our economy works for everyone by restoring economic fairness and protecting Wisconsin communities, seniors and working families.\Would you support changing state law to legalize marijuana and/or cannabis products? If so, under what conditions? If not, why?\Bernier: Before making major changes to our state's drug laws, we should first study the results of other states which have already made this change. Certainly tax revenue from marijuana sales sound promising but we must also determine the true social costs of legalization. I am looking very seriously at the benefits of the CBD oil for medicinal uses as research is showing it has promising potential without the typical side effects of marijuana.\Kapsner: Yes. I am supportive of a well-regulated medicinal marijuana program that provides access to treatment for patients suffering from severe, debilitating illnesses.\Why are you running for office?\Bernier: I'm running for the state senate to continue serving my constituents by listening to their concerns and then going to work for them. I believe that we have already made a real difference in our state, but there is more to be done!

By investing in each other, we can create opportunities for everyone.\What makes you the better candidate in this race?\Bernier: I was born and raised in this area and have a proven track record of listening to residents about the issues important to them and then acting on them.

We have continued to address both in the legislature. I successfully fought for $600 million in new funding for K-12 education, including an extra $604 per student over the next two years. Lowering health care costs through innovation and best practices will benefit business and families in our area.\Kapsner: Residents of the 23rd District are telling me that increasing access to affordable health care, investing in quality public schools and strong infrastructure and protecting our environment are the most pressing issues facing our state.

364,"When Republican state Sen. Terry Moulton decided this was his last term representing the 23rd Senate District, Kathy Bernier decided she was going to try to keep the seat in her party.\Bernier has served as the 68th Assembly District representative since 2010. Bernier is 62 years old, retired and has three children and six grandchildren.\Opposing Bernier will be Democrat Chris Kapsner. A political newcomer, Kapsner is an emergency room physician from Boyceville. He is a member of a group of doctors who provide emergency services to hospitals in western Wisconsin, Minneapolis and St. Paul. Kapsner, 55, has a wife and four children.\The 23rd District of the Wisconsin Senate is located in western Wisconsin and is composed of parts of Barron, Clark, Chippewa, Dunn, Taylor, Eau Claire, Wood, and Marathon counties.\We asked the two candidates to fill out a questionnaire on some important subjects to voters. Here are Bernier and Kapsner's responses, which have been edited for brevity.\In what way should Wisconsin improve its funding of road construction and repairs?\Bernier: Raising taxes significantly to just throw more money at the problem is not the answer. I believe there are significant efficiencies to be found at the DOT but I also believe more funding is needed in certain areas. I voted to provide the largest increases to local road and bridge aids in 20 years, something our communities are already benefiting from.\Kapsner: I would work to protect our economic opportunities by investing in the quality and safety of our community roads. I believe that the citizens using the roads most should be paying for the use of the roads. The gas tax is the closest to a sustainable user fee and should be utilized as part of a comprehensive approach to keep our transportation fund solvent and reduce our infrastructure debt.\Should Act 10 be partially or fully repealed? Why or why not?\Bernier: It is important to remember the reason for Act 10 was to bring government employees benefits, at all levels, more in line with the private sector. Requiring employees to pay the employee portion of their retirement and to pay at least 12% of their health insurance was fair to taxpayers who could no longer afford more tax increases. By giving local governments and school districts the tools to make their own personnel decision they are able to promote their best employees and devote more resources to what they do best.\Kapsner: Unions in Wisconsin have always advanced workers rights including, 40-hour work weeks, health benefits, and safety standards. Any law that takes away the voice of workers at the bargaining table is unacceptable. The freedom for workers to collectively bargain to determine their working conditions, including pay, benefits, hours, family leave and safety is crucial to Wisconsin families employed in both public and private jobs.

THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR
\
Milwaukee's needs grow as its political clout shrinks
\
City may find it tough to carry out its agenda
\
By STEVEN WALTERS AND GREG BOROWSKI of the Journal Sentinel staff
\
Monday, September 2, 2002
\
Milwaukee will bring the most critical needs in its history to the governor and legislators who will be elected in November, but the city may no longer have the political muscle to push its agenda through Madison.
\
For the first time in decades, no Milwaukee legislator is guaranteed a top leadership role in the Legislature next year, and the waning tenure of Mayor John O. Norquist and other recent upheavals in local leadership have left the city politically feeble.
\
Making the task more difficult is a yawning state budget deficit that next year will force state leaders to consider cutting programs on the city's priority list.
\
""Milwaukee is a city at a crossroads -- showing signs of rejuvenation, with the downtown renaissance and the revitalization of neighborhoods such as Brewers Hill -- yet still suffering from high poverty, growing unemployment and income stagnation,"" said Marc V. Levine, director of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Center for Economic Development.
\
""This gubernatorial election will be crucial in influencing the role played by the state in shaping Milwaukee's progress.""
\
State voters will choose their next governor in the general election on Nov. 5. Three Democrats -- U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett, state Attorney General Jim Doyle and Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk - - are running in the Sept. 10 primary. The winner will likely face Republican Gov. Scott McCallum and Libertarian Ed Thompson in the fall.
\
Less clout
\
The atrophy of Milwaukee's political muscles is not the only challenge the city faces in making its case before the Legislature. The city's lawmakers have never been particularly good at playing together, with personalities, turf fights and issues often dividing them.
\
But in the past year, a series of events have combined to leave Milwaukee with a weaker hand.
\
First, the city lost population in the 1990s, which under newly drawn districts shifts more power in Madison to suburban Republicans.
\
""Every decade that goes by, we're going to have a little less clout,"" said Milwaukee Rep. Shirley Krug, who last year was replaced as Assembly Democratic leader by a Madison lawmaker.
\
Also, two other longtime legislators -- Sen. Brian Burke, who has been charged with 18 felonies, and Rep. Peter Bock -- are retiring. They have been representing Milwaukee in the Legislature for a combined 30 years.
\
Finally, Milwaukee has never had much luck electing a governor from the city. It's been more than 60 years since a Milwaukee resident won. Barrett, who has represented the city in the Legislature and in Congress for 18 years, wants to end that streak.
\
During the campaign, all three Democrats have been sounding like Milwaukee residents, hoping for the support of the 245,670 city voters who cast ballots in the 2000 election for president. That was 9.4% of the statewide total.
\
But the next governor and legislators will face a tangle of competing interests from all parts of the state when they begin work next year on the 2003-'05 state budget. The debate is likely to be contentious, given predictions that Wisconsin will face a $1.3 billion budget shortfall.
\
In such an environment, the city needs an advocate who can navigate the political thicket, according to Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker.
\
""You have to have someone willing to spend a great deal of time and attention on the issues that in many ways are unique to the area, and to make the case for them so it's not something that pits the rest of the state against us, but rather is seen as beneficial across the board,"" said Walker, a former Republican member of the state Assembly.
\
Walker said Gov. Scott McCallum had done that and would continue to do so if he is elected. Others, including Norquist, would prefer any of the Democratic contenders to McCallum.
\
If the state decreases aid to the city, Milwaukee has only two other sources of cash -- higher property taxes or some new, unpopular local tax, said Dennis Conta, a former Democratic legislator, candidate for mayor, state revenue secretary and political consultant.
\
Any cuts in municipal services -- garbage collection, snowplowing and street repairs, for example -- would be unpopular and fought by residents, Conta said.
\
The complicated, costly agenda Milwaukee will bring Capitol officials next year includes:
\
State revenue sharing. This year, almost $1 out of every $4 state government returned to local governments goes directly to Milwaukee, which uses the money to provide police, fire and other municipal services.
\
Transportation. Not only must the Marquette Interchange be rebuilt, at a cost of more than $1 billion over the next several years, but Milwaukee-area freeways also must be reconstructed and possibly expanded to accommodate the growing rush of suburban commuters. A decision on any Milwaukee light rail system, and how to pay for it, also is pending.
\
Depending on the final cost of rebuilding the Marquette Interchange and how quickly area freeways are rebuilt, current transportation fees -- the state gas tax and $45-per-car license plate renewal fee -- may not generate enough taxes to pay for those improvements.
\
Milwaukee Public Schools. Like its urban peers, MPS has a host of problems, including a graduation rate of about 50% for those who enter ninth grade, poor test scores, growing special-education needs, a revolving door to the superintendent's office and such low property values that the state pays about 84% of its operating costs, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.
\
Democrats running for governor have vowed to rewrite state school- aid formulas, which last year delivered $4.9 billion to public schools. That included $32.7 million in state aid to pay for Milwaukee's controversial school choice program, which allows poor children to attend private schools at state expense.
\
Poverty. The 2000 census found that 21% of Milwaukee residents had incomes below the federal poverty level -- more than 2 1/2 times the statewide average. Put another way, 27.4% of all Wisconsin residents in poverty lived in Milwaukee, which makes health care, welfare reform and housing critical issues unique to the state's largest city.
\
Future at stake
\
Milwaukee-area elected officials concede that decisions made in the Capitol next year will help define the city's future.
\
Norquist said members of his party, the Democrats, have been better advocates for Milwaukee than Republicans. ""If you gave the Republicans total power over everything, they would create Detroit. They did it in Michigan,"" Norquist said.
\
Republican Rep. John Gard (R-Peshtigo) dismissed Norquist's partisan remarks as ""laughable."" Norquist often ""has more trouble"" on city issues with his fellow Democrats than Republicans, added Gard, co-chairman of the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee.
\
Gard said Republican legislators had voted to fund school choice, for new buildings on the UW-Milwaukee and Milwaukee Area Technical College campuses, and to give Oak Creek-based Midwest Express Airlines a tax break.
\
Walker said it was important to take a broader view of urban issues, to take in taxes, welfare reform and school choice, in addition to such things as poverty and transportation.
\
""If your answer is solely to throw money at it, that certainly is going to limit you to some of the candidates,"" Walker said. ""For someone who has a kid in a choice school, it may be more important to them to be able to send the student to the school than to have a light-rail line to Waukesha County.""
\
Norquist, who acknowledges GOP support for school choice, said it's important for voters throughout the state to recognize the importance of having a strong major city and metropolitan area. He cited a thriving Chicago as being good for Illinois, while Detroit suffers from poverty, job loss and high taxes in Michigan.
\
""If you look at the strongest states in the country, they almost invariably have a successful large city in them,"" he said.
\
Supporter from afar
\
Democratic Sen. Bob Jauch of Poplar is the senator who lives the farthest from Milwaukee, but he has repeatedly voted for the city's causes. Jauch was the only Democratic senator from outside southeast Wisconsin to vote to build Miller Park.
\
Jauch conceded that it is easy for rural legislators to resent the demands of Milwaukee, because the city needs hundreds of millions of dollars for projects, and other legislators scramble to get a fraction of that amount. But he has always believed ""what is good for Milwaukee is good for the rest of the state.""
\
Besides, many areas of northwest Wisconsin have the same basic problem as Milwaukee -- ""economic starvation,"" he said.
\
That fact alone could make them teammates in the competition for state cash when legislators craft the budget next year. Or, as has been the case in the past -- it could make them opponents once again.
\
STATE BUDGET
\
STATE SUBSIDIZES MILWAUKEE
\
As Wisconsin's largest city, Milwaukee dominates state spending in several categories -- including aid to public schools and aid to local governments. But its poverty rate is more than twice the statewide average, which drives up costs for health care and social programs such as W-2. Milwaukee's future is an understated -- but critical -- theme of the campaign for governor.

366,"Metcalfe's supports Fort McCoy families\Fort McCoy hosted an appreciation event Feb. 22 for its private-sector sponsors. I was pleased but not surprised to see Metcalfe's Market as one of the 10 businesses recognized. \Metcalfe's and its suppliers have donated huge quantities of food and nonperishable items to the military personnel and their families at Fort McCoy. \As a former Army officer, I know this support is incredibly meaningful for the recipients. The families are challenged during long training sessions and deployments. \They are typically far from their extended family-support network, and can expect to be transferred to a new location every two or three years. \According to the leadership team, over 150,000 soldiers and Marines train at Fort Mc-Coy throughout the year due to the climate and topography attributes. Another major component, they noted, was the ongoing commitment and support from community partners. \Thank you, Metcalfe's, and all the individuals, organizations and businesses who help our military personnel and their families. You are a big part of the reason we enjoy unparalleled freedoms. \Curtis Fuszard, Middleton\We must make our schools safer \I am a great-grandmother. I believe we are having the wrong discussion of guns vs. gun control. We need to discuss how to make our schools, teachers and children safe. \Let's brainstorm: Make it harder to get into schools: Have gated communities, with armed guards. \Put bulletproof doors and glass on every entrance into the school building and on all classroom doors and windows, halls, closets and bathrooms. \Add bulletproof closets in each classroom that will hold all the students in a class. Install stronger bulletproof \locks. Have simple wedges in classrooms to shove under doors. Install bulletproof shields that slide out in front of all the classroom doors and block the doors, like plastic room dividers. \Dispense pepper spray where the shooter is known to be. \Engineers can make schools safe. \A Wisconsin kid, Justin Rivard, has invented a simple device called the ""JustinKase"" that barricades doors. This device is a beginning. We can do something. The time is now. \What we can't do is stand by while our kids and teachers continue to be shot in mass murders. \Louise Doescher, Merrill\Invest surplus in Wisconsin's roads \Though an extra $100 child tax credit sounds great, my drive to work cemented my opinion against it. \Driving on Highway 12 just north of Sauk City early Monday morning after enjoying Wisconsin's beautiful forests the night before, I was deftly dodging potholes. Around a corner, I couldn't avoid all the potholes and hit a particularly nasty one. Minutes later, I was carefully choosing a flat area out of traffic to change my tire. It was then, and in the coming ride home on my donut at 50 mph, holding up folks trying to get to work, that I knew the $200 credit my family might be eligible for would not cover my wheel and tire, not to mention the lost productivity of the long line of cars behind me. \Gov. Scott Walker, please keep your so-called surplus and invest it in Wisconsin. Tax me more if necessary, but invest it in the cement for the roads, the quality of our schools and maintaining the beautiful environment that makes our state great, not again, but now. \Robert Ulfig, Middleton\Farmers need to clean up pollution \Historically, when an industry pollutes our air or water, it is ordered to quit and clean it up at its expense. We did it with the paper industry, chemical industry and wastewater treatment plants. \The Department of Natural Resources has found agriculture is responsible for most of our water pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency has found agricultural runoff is responsible for the second-largest dead zone in the world in the Gulf of Mexico. \How do we respond? Agriculture can keep polluting our lakes and waters, and everybody except farmers must pay to clean it up. I don't get it. What am I missing? \Tell farmers to clean up their act so we can all have clean water to drink and enjoy. \Rodney Heller, Cottage Grove\Rebuild historic East Side building \I will be pulling for a full restoration of the Schenk-Huegel building after last weekend's fire. \The circa 1922 building is home to the Chocolaterian Cafe and several other businesses, offices and studios. The cafe has become an anchor for many around Schenk's Corners. My son Sean works at the cafe and loves that place. Many other people revolve around this unique, historic East Side landmark for their work. \So, please, let's put it back together, better than ever. Keep the ""Schenk"" in Schenk's Corners. \Kevin O'Brien, Madison\Tax guns to pay for school guards\I am sorry that putting armed police in our schools has become a necessity. This will not solve our national problem with gun violence, but it appears an inescapable response to the obscene availability of weapons.\But why should cash-strapped school districts have to pay for such protection? Why not pay for them through taxes and registration fees on guns'\This would be consistent with Gov. Scott Walker's overall preference for switching from taxes to user fees, though increasing the gas tax is a notable exception.\If people who don't use our state parks shouldn't have to pay for their upkeep, why should people who don't own guns have to pay for protecting children against those who do'\Michael Nesemann, Lake Mills\Demonizing the NRA isn't helpful\As we find ourselves in the aftermath of yet another horrific massacre, demonizing the National Rifle Association is wholly unhelpful in the search for meaningful change.\It is true our political system is corrupted by money, and our professional politicians have profited rather than served. But the NRA is not the enemy of public safety.\""Fake news"" is not only the perpetuation of false information, it also presents information so out of context that the recipient is drawn to erroneous conclusions.\Here are some facts from the Center for Responsive Politics:\The top lobbying organization in 2017 was the Chamber of Commerce at $82 million.\No. 13 was the National Association of Broadcasters at $15 million.\The NRA spent $3.2 million on direct lobbying and was ranked 154 in 2016 (the latest year with available data.)\In the 2018 cycle, members of both parties have received lobbying dollars. Of the top 20, 10 are Democrats and 10 are Republicans.\If destroying the NRA is not the answer, what is'\How do I keep my child from becoming a mass murderer? We teach right from wrong. We teach how to live. This is the fundamental work of families and has gone undone in too many households for too long.\Joan Ellis Beglinger, Cross Plains\Second Amendment ruling is faulty\In the historic decision District of Columbia vs. Heller on the Second Amendment, the U.S. Supreme Court, led by Justic Antonin Scalia, got it wrong.\The court stated that this 27word amendment guaranteed all Americans the right to own a gun. Most experts who have researched this amendment have disputed that interpretation. From the writings of James Madison and others, it is clear the Second Amendment meant something to them that has little to do with Scalia's interpretation.\In 1791, Americans had a great mistrust of a standing army. This country had just defeated the British army, and many of our Founding Fathers had equal misgivings about a standing army of our own, fearing too much centralized power. They recognized however, that to protect this new country from turmoil within or from foreign adversaries, state militias had to be made readily available for protection.\Scholars have found no evidence that the Second Amendment was about individuals owning guns. Madison wasn't talking about that.\His concern was for a collective group, armed of course, formed to protect this nation and to guarantee order.\Unfortunately, the ""originalists"" on the Supreme Court have misinterpreted our history.\Mark Quinn, Madison\Young people are changing America\I am from the baby boomer generation. When we were teenagers, we changed America.\The collective advocacy of our generation has not been seen again.\Until now.\The high school students in Florida are speaking out for their generation. They are speaking out to change America again.\They are demanding that America address the growing number of deaths by gunfire. It is time, once again, for our country to listen to the younger generation.\Help them stop the overwhelming flood of guns and shooting deaths in our society.\John Robinson, Madison\Teach boys to avoid firearm violence\I found myself crying for the first time since the birth of my daughter three years ago.\The tears came as I read the bios of the victims of the most recent school shooting in America. The 17 people who were slaughtered in Florida didn't deserve to die, much less in vain. As a 35-year-old father of three beautiful children (two are male and all under the age of seven), I continue to think about the role I have in teaching my sons about the responsibilities associated with being male.\Today, too many of our young men are struggling to identify the right qualities that should embody every man. The masculinity crisis is real. As the FBI reports, over 90 percent of gun violence perpetrators are male.\The problem is multifaceted. But one solution is to spend more time educating and emphasizing to our young men that they are meant to show complete compassion, empathy and generosity toward others, have undisputed integrity and be good people - nothing less.\Cassidy McGowan, Green Bay\They should be assassination rifles\Every AR-15 should be called an assassination rifle instead of an assault rifle.\""Assault rifle"" is essentially an advertising term used by the manufacturers and the NRA. It is an attempt to glorify what is essentially a killing machine. Use of the military term just provides free advertising and implies a valid purpose for owning a semiautomatic weapon and multiple- shot magazines.\Assassination means to kill suddenly or secretively, a treacherous premeditated murder. It is a much more accurate label for those guns.\Al Nettleton, Madison\This is not your grandfather's NRA\The National Rifle Association has become a toxic brand.\Companies and politicians are waking up to how destructive the NRA is to this country and are leaving it as fast as they can. They realize the NRA of today is not what it once was, and the majority of Americans want sensible gun legislation that doesn't interfere with the Second Amendment.\Since I was 10, I have been a gun owner. I have many guns now, which I use for target shooting and hunting. If someone breaks into my home, I have a 12-gauge.\All my friends hunt. I am a member of my local shooting range and conservation club. In short, I would love to join the NRA. Except the NRA of today no longer represents me or my friends.\I want the NRA to be the NRA of my childhood. The NRA of my dad and my grandfather - the one I would be proud to join and the one that teaches hunter and gun safety, marksmanship and responsible citizenship.\The NRA today has almost nothing to do with that.\Steve Zahn, Madison"
367,"The State Journal editorial board met in person with nearly two
dozen candidates for the Legislature from across south-central
Wisconsin. \All of the candidates seeking state office deserve praise for
giving voters a choice. Running for an Assembly or Senate seat is a
huge undertaking and commitment. Yet the candidates pictured below
are best suited to represent their districts. \Senate District 17 \ KRISS MARION \ This levelheaded and disarming farmer and bed-and-breakfast owner
in Blanchardville hasn't lived in southwest Wisconsin for most of
her life, as her opponent, Rep. Howard Marklein, has. But Marion
better understands what it takes for her district to attract and
keep more young families and workers to fill jobs and start
businesses - one of the biggest challenges facing the region.
Marion fled the Chicago area with her husband years ago for the
beauty and small-town life of the Driftless Area, where she has
raised four children. She's now an experienced and well-informed
Lafayette County Board member, who sticks up for agriculture and
the natural environment. Endorsing Marion, a Democrat, over
Marklein, R-Spring Green, isn't an easy decision. Marklein has
earned our support in the past. He's a sharp accountant who
advocates for fiscal responsibility and rural schools.
Significantly, Marklein serves on the Legislature's budget
committee, giving him more power over state spending decisions. But
too often during his first Senate term, he has acquiesced to his
Republican leaders when they undermined good government protections
and strayed from smart financial decisions. Unlike Marklein, Marion
is a strong supporter of nonpartisan redistricting and criticizes
excessive Foxconn subsidies. She's fought at the statehouse and in
court to give her fellow ""soil sister"" entrepreneurs the right to
sell small batches of baked goods. Marion has a broader and bolder
vision of what southwest Wisconsin can achieve. \ Senate District 27 \ JON ERPENBACH \ This experienced state senator has a knack for getting along with
colleagues across the partisan divide, using humor and political
persuasion to seek bipartisan agreement. The Middleton Democrat is
no longer his party's Senate leader, but he continues to be a
prominent voice on health care, transportation and education.
Erpenbach has championed the need for high-speed internet service
in rural areas to help small businesses grow: ""We are a dinosaur
when it comes to broadband."" He's fought for better roads in both
rural and urban parts of his district. Recently, Erpenbach led a
bipartisan effort to reduce the distances non-criminal yet
dangerous mental health patients, including juveniles, have to
travel for care. His opponent, Casey Helbach, a small businessman
and Republican, deserves credit for giving voters a choice. Helbach
is likeable and wants more civility in politics. So do we. Yet
Helbach lacks Erpenbach's knowledge and know-how at the Capitol.
Helbach should consider running for City Council or County Board to
gain political experience. \ Assembly District 38 \ MELISSA WINKER \ A teacher and small business owner, Winker pledges to bring a
""balanced voice"" to the statehouse for her constituents in this
oddly shaped district that stretches from suburban Madison across
three counties to her home in Oconomowoc. Winker wants to invest
more in schools. Many communities across the state have raised
their own taxes for public education in referendums, she notes,
because state leaders have failed to properly invest in students.
Winker says he'll advocate for more responsible environmental
policy and a fair and nonpartisan process of redrawing legislative
districts after the 2020 census to reflect population changes. Her
opponent, Barbara Dittrich, is a fun person with some strong
priorities, too, including an emphasis on mental and chronic health
services. Dittrich also sounds open to linking the gas tax to
inflation so road quality doesn't continue to decline while state
debt rises. But Dittrich's dismissive attitude toward
good-government attempts to draw legislative districts fairly for
all voters - especially given the 38th District's nonsensical
boundaries - is disturbing. Winker is the better choice for this
open seat. \ Assembly District 39 \ MARK BORN \ This three-term assemblyman is moving up the ranks at the Capitol
and now serves on the Legislature's budget committee, giving his
constituents more influence over state spending decisions. Born,
R-Beaver Dam, brings a no-nonsense approach to public service. He
focuses heavily on ways to steer more workers into high-demand
fields such as nursing and manufacturing, and worked to expand
university medical expertise to more of the state. Born has taken a
sensible approach to fixing the state's crumbling roads. He's open
to raising user fees while at the same time scrutinizing projects
for waste. He joined his Assembly Republican colleagues in trying
to pressure the governor and Senate for action. We're also happy to
hear Born's view of nonpartisan redistricting has changed. ""It's
something we can do,"" he told our editorial board. ""I've gotten
more comfortable with it over time. Iowa has shown they can make
this work. I'm open to trying something."" We like Born's opponent,
Elisha Barudin, too. The Beaver Dam community volunteer and former
human resources manager is eager to serve and makes strong points
about Wisconsin's bad roads and climbing debt. But Born is best for
this district. \ Assembly District 42 \ JON PLUMER \ The Lodi community booster and karate school owner won this open
seat in a special election this summer. Now he's seeking a full
two-year term in the Nov. 6 election. Voters should support him for
his civil and straight-forward approach to public service. Plumer,
a moderate Republican, stresses the need for more cooperation
across party lines. His priorities include fixing roads, improving
public education and supporting nonpartisan redistricting. Plumer's
opponent, Democrat Ann Groves Lloyd, is dedicated and smart. But
Plumer shows more promise as a leader who can work in the sensible
center of politics to get things done through consensus. \ Assembly District 43 \ DON VRUWINK \ This retired teacher, coach and community leader in the Milton area
has a proven record of pulling people together around solid
solutions. He's a Democrat who has been honored as a friend of
local businesses, and he's an educator who cares deeply about the
future of young people and his state. Vruwink is just getting
started in state service, having served a single two-year term. He
deserves a chance to use the knowledge and personal connections
he's developed at the statehouse to make positive things happen for
his constituents. Vruwink's opponent, Gabriel Szerlong, a recent
UW-Whitewater graduate, exhibits an admirable interest in public
service, having worked as a legislative aide at the Capitol. But
voters in this district with an independent streak would be better
served by Vruwink's strong record of success. \ Assembly District 49 \ TRAVIS TRANEL \ Farmers have no better advocate at the statehouse than this Cuba
City dairy farmer who is easy to talk to and eager to get things
done for his rural district. Tranel has grown in office over four
terms with the confidence to respectfully challenge his governor
and Republican Party when he thinks they're going astray or not
serving his constituents' best interests. Tranel speaks eloquently
about the need for more immigrants on farms. He helped seek the end
of an ethanol limit from President Donald Trump to help the rural
economy, and he's worked with UW to find more uses for milk. Tranel
says he'll vote for a nonpartisan redistricting process that
respects all voters, having seen how it works well in neighboring
Iowa. He favors raising user fees to help pay for better roads - so
long as a fair amount is steered to rural parts of the state.
Tranel's opponent, Mike Mooney of Platteville, is a good guy and
small businessman who wants to get more involved. But Tranel is
better equipped to make a difference for his district. \ Assembly District 50 \ ART SHRADER \ The community banker and former Marine in Reedsburg is running
again for this seat because he sees many of the same challenges
facing his region and state, including rural schools struggling to
stay open and bad roads that ""jar your teeth out of your head.""
""Nothing has changed. Things have gotten worse,"" the Democratic
candidate told our editorial board. ""But the Republicans are not my
enemy. I believe in this country."" Shrader says he's committed to
finding bipartisan solutions ""because the truth is somewhere in the
middle."" He's a Democrat who loves business and economic
development. For that reason, and to help keep and attract young
people who love technology, Shrader will champion the expansion of
rural broadband. Shrader speaks eloquently of his support for
nonpartisan redistricting, and his deep roots in the district.
Shrader's opponent for this open seat, Tony Kurtz, a Republican
from Wonewoc, seems like a good guy but isn't running the kind of
energetic and positive campaign Shrader offers voters. \ Assembly District 51 \ TODD NOVAK \ The two-term Assemblyman and Dodgeville mayor is one of the
strongest advocates for open government at the statehouse. A former
newspaper editor, he's well informed and understands the need for
citizens to have easy access to public meetings and documents.
Novak also was one of the first Republicans in the Legislature to
back and sponsor legislation for nonpartisan redistricting. Novak
voted against his party's splurge in state subsidies for Foxconn, a
Taiwanese technology manufacturer that's locating in Racine County.
Instead of handouts to encourage job growth, Novak says his
district needs workers for jobs that can't be filled, including
open positions at manufacturing and cheese plants. Novak exhibits a
healthy independent streak that matches this district well. Having
adopted children, he's taken a keen interest in helping foster
kids, as well as improving the lives of Alzheimer's and dementia
patients and families. His opponent, Jeff Wright, a school
administrator from Plain, would make a fine assemblyman, too. We
wish we could endorse both of these candidates, given Wright's
polish and strong priorities. But Novak is already doing a fine
job. \ Assembly District 77 \ SHELIA STUBBS \ The educator and former probation and parole officer promises to
bring a laser-like focus on criminal justice issues. Stubbs, a
Democrat, is all for holding criminals accountable, especially
violent criminals. But she speaks convincingly of the need to
address addictions, mental illness and illiteracy. Stubbs won a
four-way Democratic primary this summer, and she now is running
unopposed for this seat representing Madison's West and South sides
in the Legislature. Stubbs will bring a dozen years of experience
on the Dane County Board to the statehouse, having helped create a
community court that lets young, low-level offenders avoid criminal
records if they complete community service, pay restitution and
stay out of trouble. We like her dedication to helping the less
fortunate help themselves. Her real-world experiences and smarts
will inform policy debates at the statehouse. \ Senate District 13 \ NO ENDORSEMENT \ Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, has undermined
good-government protections and procedures at the state Capitol.
Under his leadership, the Legislature has allowed more money from
special interests and anonymous donors to pour into Wisconsin
political campaigns. He oversaw the dismantling of a nonpartisan
Government Accountability Board, replacing distinguished and
nonpartisan judges with partisan hacks to oversee ethical standards
and election rules. Fitzgerald has repeatedly ignored the spirit of
Wisconsin's open meetings law, and oversaw the gerrymandering of
legislative districts to thwart the will of voters. We cannot
endorse him. Nor are we endorsing his perennial opponent, Michelle
Zahn, though we thank her for giving voters a choice. Zahn is
spirited and concerned about climate change. We respect that. But
we question her pragmatism and readiness for the job."
368,"Entering the 2015-16 legislative session, all signs point to an aggressive Republican caucus that will swiftly seize opportunities to take advantage of its strong majorities in both chambers and a conservative in the governor's office.\But that doesn't mean the session will be without its tension, as already been hinted by debates over right-to-work legislation and a proposed casino project in Kenosha.\What will even more concentrated Republican power mean for policy? What effect will a potential presidential run by Gov. Scott Walker have? And with their political capital at a new low, what role do Democrats play in the next two years?\PART 1\Walker for president?\It seems all but certain that Gov. Scott Walker will seek the Republican presidential nomination for 2016 -- but until he says the word, all discussion of Walker 2016 is purely speculation.\That speculation tells us a few things. As long as Walker is considered a serious contender, the national spotlight will be on what he does with the upcoming biennial budget and the laws he signs -- or vetoes -- in the next year. And make no mistake: he is a serious contender.\""Gov. Walker is on my list of the five strongest contenders for 2016,"" said Steffen Schmidt, a longtime professor of political science at Iowa State University and expert on the Iowa caucuses. Schmidt predicts a top-three finish for Walker in Iowa's caucuses, which he'll need for the nomination.\Democrats and liberal groups like One Wisconsin Now say Walker will use his budget to prove his presidential timber, by pushing policies like drug testing for welfare recipients.\""They're using this fiscal document for him to advance himself politically,"" said OWN deputy director Mike Browne. ""And I think you're going to see myriad instances of that throughout the process.""\Browne called the budget ""in essence a $70 billion Walker campaign ad.""\OWN has also suggested that a right-towork bill could become a source of tension -- or a political bargaining chip -- between Walker and Republican leaders in the Legislature.\In order to explore a presidential bid, the governor needs to pass a budget as quickly and smoothly as possible, said OWN executive director Scot Ross, adding that right-to-work would get in the way of a quiet budget.\""He doesn't want the country to think every time he does something ... Wisconsin erupts,"" Ross said.\Ross said right-to-work is an opportunity for Vos to get what he wants from the governor behind closed doors, with the threat of bringing the bill to the floor looming over negotiations.\Walker told reporters at the end of December that he is still considering a run, but hasn't given a timeline for his decision. He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel his presidential viability would be determined by how well Wisconsin performs under his leadership in the years to come.\The governor has said, several times, that a decision would be driven prominently by his faith and that he would need to feel ""called"" in order to run.\""I don't think people should just run particularly for office as high as that because it's the next logical step or it's part of adding to a career, in this case in politics,"" Walker told the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism. ""I think it's something you should feel like you're actually called, that there's a purpose, there's a reason for doing it.""\PART 2\Policy discussions to expect\EDUCATION: VOUCHER EXPANSION, COMMON CORE REPEAL, PUBLIC SCHOOL REFORMS\A newly formed Senate Education Reform Committee -- in addition to the existing Education Committee -- signals changes to come. Republican lawmakers have said expanding the statewide school voucher program is a priority, as is reexamining school accountability and education standards. That could include a move to repeal the Common Core academic standards as well.\More than 27,000 students use vouchers in Wisconsin. All but about 2,000 of them are in Milwaukee, where the program began in 1990. Walker and the Republican-controlled state Legislature have expanded its reach since 2011. The statewide program is in its second year, with 25 schools participating.\Walker said during his re-election campaign that he supports significantly expanding the statewide program, though he has not said by how much.\Adding fuel to the fiery public vs. private debate, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Jan. 1 that Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, is exploring legislation that would allow low-performing public schools in Milwaukee to be taken over by the state or charter school operators in a so-called recovery district.\MORE RESTRICTIONS ON ABORTION\A ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy is a priority for anti-abortion groups including Wisconsin Right to Life, whose officials told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel they're working with Republican lawmakers on a bill.\Pro-choice advocates like Planned Parenthood expect several other measures that didn't pass last session to end up back on the table. Those measures include repealing Wisconsin's contraceptive equity law -- which requires employers to cover contraceptives if they cover other prescriptions and preventive care practices -- a prohibition of sex-selective abortions and a ban on insurance coverage for abortion services.\Anti-abortion politicians have successfully curbed access to abortion not by banning it outright, but by chipping away with a series of restrictions. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin public policy director Nicole Safar said she expects to see more efforts in that vein.\ANOTHER LOOK AT MINING REGULATIONS\Sen. Tom Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst, introduced legislation last session that would have established a statewide approach for regulating frac sand mines. Opponents said the measure would severely curtail local authority, voicing concerns over the bill's environmental effects. Tiffany told the Wisconsin Radio Network in December he's open to revisiting the proposal, adding it's a ""fine line to walk"" between providing consistent regulations while allowing for local control.\Anne Sayers, program director for the Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters, said the group isn't sure what to expect from the Legislature.\'We're also not exactly sure what else is left to dismantle,' she added.\She noted that the Assembly's Rural Affairs Committee is being replaced by a Mining and Rural Development Committee -- something that makes conservationists question legislators' intentions regarding mining activity.\The group will also keep an eye out for once-defeated bills to resurface.\However, Sayers said, because Wisconsinites value the state's natural resources so deeply, conservation issues are on the minds of the state's voters and she's optimistic lawmakers and conservationists will be able to work together to protect Wisconsin's natural resources.\OVERHAULING THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD\The state's nonpartisan elections board has drawn the ire of Republican lawmakers for its handling of ballot designs, recall elections and a John Doe investigation into alleged coordination between Walker's campaign and independent groups. An audit conducted by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau further fueled GOP outrage over the Government Accountability Board's operations.\The audit found that GAB staff didn't fulfill some statutorily required duties in a timely manner, did not follow its penalty schedule for enforcing campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws and has not effectively communicated all statutorily required administrative rules. GAB director and general counsel Kevin Kennedy said the board is committed to bringing itself into full statutory compliance and to further improving its operations.\Rep. Dean Knudson, R-Hudson, is leading Republican efforts in the Assembly to craft legislation to reform the GAB and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has previously called for Kennedy's removal. Kennedy has defended the board, calling criticism ""overblown.""\Walker told the Associated Press in December he's ""willing to look"" at moving the board to a partisan model, but he's not sure whether it would be best to reform the current structure, return to the previous system in place before 2008, or start from scratch.\PART 3\Wish lists from outside interests\WISCONSIN LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS\HOPES: Proactive groundwater management policies, more enforcement laws and resources to monitor frac sand mining companies, more pollution protections.\CONCERNS: Measures that curb local authority to monitor mining companies.\WORRIED THAT? there's not much ""left to dismantle"" in the way of environmental protections.\OPTIMISTIC THAT? a new crop of conservation- minded legislators, along with citizens who care deeply about the state's natural resources, will lead to collaborative efforts to protect Wisconsin's environment.\ONE WISCONSIN NOW\HOPES: A bill to allow student loan borrowers to refinance their loans at a lower rate.\CONCERNS: Right-to-work legislation, expansion of statewide school voucher program, repeal of Common Core academic standards, overhaul of Government Accountability Board, changes to rules for John Doe investigations, creation of a private fundraising arm for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, legislation changing the way the state's electoral votes are allocated.\WORRIED THAT? Wisconsin will be damaged irreparably by policies passed under GOP control promoting a ""far-right ideologically driven agenda.""\OPTIMISTIC THAT? GOP lawmakers may see value in a state student loan debt reform bill, which received hearings in the Senate and Assembly last year but saw no further action.\UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON\HOPES: Approval of a request for $95.2 million in new state funding for the 2015-17 budget years.\CONCERNS: The request could be outranked by other budget priorities.\WORRIED THAT? no new budget money, along with a tuition freeze, would amount to a $30 million hit to the budget, preventing the university from continuing to fund programs and creating new ones.\OPTIMISTIC THAT? lawmakers will see the economic benefits of having a strong, major research university in the state and will see funding the UW as a worthwhile investment.\PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF WISCONSIN\HOPES: ""For Republican politicians to stay out of women's health -- to keep their personal opinions about Planned Parenthood or on access to comprehensive reproductive health care to themselves.""\CONCERNS: Ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, repeal of the state's contraceptive equity law, ban on insurance coverage for abortion services.\WORRIED THAT? lawmakers will continue to chip away at access to abortion and women's health care, through a series of laws and budget provisions.\OPTIMISTIC THAT? the organization will continue to build stronger local partnerships with communities, and that legislators will hear from supporters throughout the state.\WISCONSIN FAMILY ACTION\HOPES: Reforms to tax code and public benefits to eliminate the so-called marriage tax penalty, legislation to protect individual conscience rights, bill to create a ""Choose Life"" license plate, expansion of statewide school voucher program, repeal of Common Core academic standards.\CONCERNS: Welfare and tax reform could be perceived as an attack on single women and poor people, which the organization insists is not the case.\WORRIED THAT? efforts to incentivize marriage in particular will test the organization's mettle and lead to spirited public debate.\OPTIMISTIC THAT? its priorities are in line with a GOP majority and the group can build on momentum from the previous session.\WISCONSIN MANUFACTURERS & COMMERCE\HOPES: Right-to-work legislation, reforms to the Family Medical Leave Act and Worker's Compensation, eliminating the highest personal income tax bracket, gas tax hike, increase vehicle registration fee, take frac sand mining regulation from local to state level, worker training investment.\CONCERNS: ""Radical environmentalists"" targeting frac sand mining, worker shortage.\Sourced from Cap Times interviews, WMC sourced from WMC column \PART 4\Lawmakers to watch\Assembly Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Shankland, D-Stevens Point\Shankland, 27, was elected assistant minority leader in the Assembly after winning re-election to her second term representing the 71st Assembly District. She sees the growing presence of younger and less experienced legislators as a positive asset for Wisconsin, noting that more than half of lawmakers currently serving in the Assembly weren't in office during the passage of Act 10 and the protests that ensued. Her goals for the session include tackling income inequality and forging coalitions wherever possible with lawmakers across the aisle.\Shankland will serve as ranking Democrat on the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development and as a member of the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources and Sporting Heritage. She will also be a member of the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules, the Joint Legislative Council and the Assembly Rules Committee.\""I think young people really want to get past that partisan brinksmanship that we've seen both in Madison and in the nation's capital, and I think we have a story to tell,"" Shankland told the Capital Times in November. ""The number one issue for us is jobs and the economy -- and most voters would say the same -- but for us it's a very different issue.""\Rep. Romaine Quinn, R-Rice Lake\Quinn, 24, will be the youngest legislator in a very ""green"" Assembly. Quinn ousted incumbent Stephen Smith, D-Shell Lake, with a sizable margin in November to represent the 75th Assembly District. Despite his age, Quinn is no newcomer to politics, having served on the Rice Lake City Council in high school and as mayor of Rice Lake from 2010 to 2012. The incoming legislator pointed out to the Associated Press that his age puts him closer to experiences like attending school, buying a home and starting a family. Quinn will serve as vice-chairman of the Assembly Committee on Aging and Long Term Care and Committee of Natural Resources and Sporting Heritage.\Sen. Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg\LeMahieu, 42, was elected in November to fill the 9th Senate District seat vacated by Joe Leibham, who lost the Republican primary for the 6th Congressional District. LeMahieu owns and publishes the Lakeshore Weekly and has served on the Sheboygan County Board since 2006.\""As Chairman of the Elections and Local Government Committee, I am looking forward to working on reforming the GAB, Campaign Finance and John Doe Laws in light of the recent GAB audit and previous court rulings regarding campaign finance,"" LeMahieu said. ""We have many challenges facing us as we head into the new session, such as the transportation budget and general budget deficits. We need to prioritize the state's needs while continuing to reduce the tax burden on Wisconsinites.""\Rep. Mandela Barnes, D-Milwaukee\Barnes, 28, will enter his second year representing the 11th Assembly District. The community activist made news in 2012 by ousting Democratic then-Rep. Jason Fields in what he called a ""progressive sweep"" in the Milwaukee area. Barnes was previously an executive director for MICAH, part of a statewide coalition of faith-based groups calling for prison reforms in Wisconsin, and has been vocal in urging the state to enact policies to address racial disparities. Watch for more work on those issues from Barnes as he serves as ranking Democrat on the Assembly Corrections Committee and as a member of the Committees on Education, Jobs and the Economy and Small Business Development.\PART 5\Bridging a widening gap \BY THE NUMBERS, political polarization is at an all-time high in Wisconsin. An analysis by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Craig GIlbert made a few observations about Walker's 2014 victory: Compared to his previous two wins, partisanship grew stronger among voters. Counties are becoming more and more lopsidedly ""red"" or ""blue.""\And hyper-partisan, one-sided communities and neighborhoods are becoming more common throughout the entire state, not just in places like polar-opposite Dane and Waukesha counties.\""Heading into the new year, the partisan chasm dividing us continues to grow wider, and deeper,"" Gilbert wrote.\At the same time, some issues transcend party lines. A proposal from the Menominee tribe to build a casino complex in Kenosha has lawmakers looking through a regional, not partisan, lens.\""There's no question -- I believe it's unanimous among elected legislators in the Kenosha-Racine area,"" Barca said. ""Democrats and Republicans alike, all the major elected officials in the area -- are all on board.\But there's also other legislators on both sides of the aisle that are not from the immediate Kenosha-Racine area that are also on board.""\At the same time, many Milwaukee-area legislators oppose the proposal. Milwaukee is home to the Potawatomi Bingo Casino, currently the state's largest gambling complex.\The proposed Kenosha casino is expected to surpass the Potawatomi complex in net win dollars. And while Republicans and Democrats alike are calling on Walker to approve the project, conservative groups including Wisconsin Family Action and Wisconsin Right to Work are pushing him to say no. He'll make a decision by Feb. 19.\Some lawmakers say they hope to move away from the bitter partisan fights of the last few years and find ways to work together on issues beyond the proposed casino. Whether that talk amounts to action remains to be seen. ""There have been a lot of talks about how 'green' the Assembly is,"" Shankland said.\""Over half of us haven't even been through Act 10 anymore. I think, personally, that's positive. That means while we lack institutional knowledge, we also have tremendous motivation to build personal relationships and work across the aisle. I see that potential in the new members as well as the current freshman caucuses -- so my goal is to help facilitate that conversation.""\Right-to-work: debate and distraction\DEMOCRATS HAVE SUGGESTED a rightto- work bill could be the second coming of Act 10, Walker's signature legislation that significantly curbed collective bargaining rights for most public employees and resulted in massive protests and unrest at the state Capitol. Walker has said such a bill would be a ""distraction,"" but has declined to say whether he would veto it if it were to land on his desk. That doesn't signal that he secretly supports it, he has insisted.\Republican lawmakers are scattered -- but more on the timing than on whether the measure should be considered at all. The same week that a group aiming to make Wisconsin a right-to-work state launched, Rep.\Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, promised to introduce a right-to-work bill in the Assembly. Vos has said he looks forward to a ""healthy discussion"" about the issue, but that he has no plans to rush into it in January. But Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said early in December that it should be dealt with ""now and early in the session.""\Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, said the polarization that would result from such a bill, on top of the aftershocks of Act 10, would ""create a schism that could take decades to overcome."" He expects the legislation could trigger protests much like the ones that followed Act 10.\Kapenga disagrees.\'No, absolutely not,' Kapenga said. 'I think Act 10 was a very different situation.\Absolutely, people are going to be passionate about it on the other side. We will have some very healthy debate, and I look forward to that. That's part of the legislative process.'\Opponents of right-to-work have dubbed it ""right to work for less"" and say it's aimed at weakening unions and will hurt workers' wallets. Advocates say it will drive economic activity and income growth, pointing to the 24 states that have such laws on the books. PolitFact Wisconsin weighs those arguments with this summary: ""There is some evidence of economic advantage in right to work states. But evidence is lacking that right to work, rather than other factors, is the cause.""\I'm just a (budget) bill\PROJECTED STATE REVENUES will fall $2.2 billion short of what state agencies have requested for the 2015-17 budget, the governor's administration reported in November.\In the coming months, those agencies will find out how much of their requests will actually be funded by the state. Some of the largest requests came from the Department of Public Instruction, the Department of Health Services and the University of Wisconsin System. A proposed $751 million tax and fee increase from the Department of Transportation has also raised eyebrows as lawmakers start to debate the best way to fund the state's transportation projects.\An analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau released in December showed that just to continue funding services at their current levels, the state would come up $824 million short. New revenue estimates will be released in January, and the governor will submit a budget to the Legislature in January or February. The state constitution requires the Legislature to pass a balanced budget. The next budget year starts on July 1.\DEMOCRATS WON'T 'JUST SAY NO'\""I don't think it's Democrats'jobs to just say no to the Republicans,"" Shankland said. ""I think it's our duty and our responsibility to advance thoughtful initiatives that are resonant with the public, and that's something we've spent a lot of time on -- we've knocked on a lot of doors, talked to a lot of voters -- but that's not enough. We're going to have to talk to even more people throughout this session.""\Barca added that Democrats will provide transparency to citizens regarding the legislative process. Democratic-led initiatives like raising the minimum wage or creating a student loan refinancing authority will face an uphill battle, but that doesn't mean lawmakers on the left won't try to make their points heard. And legislators like Shankland and Barca hold out hope that lawmakers will find more ways to collaborate on bipartisan measures just as they did on legislation including mental health reform and an officer-involved deaths bill last year.\WISCONSIN LEGISLATURE: Red, Blue and Green\Republicans widened their majorities in both houses of the Wisconsin Legislature this year, which means a challenging two-year period for state Democrats.

369,"Sent By Senator Lena C. Taylor\By NBCSL Energy Transportation and Environment Committee Chair Rep. Joseph Gibbons\Joseph Gibbons The potential for positive impact of solar energy is enormous.\Our ability to harness the power of the sun to heat our homes and power our lives in an environmentally sensitive way is revolutionary.\This technology will undoubtedly influence nearly every facet of our lives in the coming years and decades, and we will all be better off for it.\But as solar technology continues to improve, some of the policies around it remain outdated.\The result: benefits accrue only to a small number of people who can afford the technology, while the costs of these benefits are subsidized by the working class, low income and minority families throughout Milwaukee and our state.\To get to where we need to be, we must champion a more inclusive and equitable vision for how we use solar power.\We need a vision that ensures that everyone benefits equally, whether you are a solar participant or not.\Recently, the Milwaukee Common Council adopted a resolution that would have taken steps to level the playing field for consumers.\While the Common Council should be applauded for trying to promote a greener environment, concerns remain regarding the unintended economic consequences of such policies on those who can least afford it.\Those who opposed the resolution did so because of its regressive nature that unduly burdens lowincome consumers and working class families.\The primary cause of inequitable outcomes stem not from the rooftop solar itself but from something called ""net metering,"" and program subsidies initially created to urge more residential roof-top solar installations.\Whether a homeowner buys or leases their rooftop solar system, net metering requires utility companies to buy back any excess power they may generate at the full retail price.\The full retail price credit brings substantial savings to those with rooftop solar, but because it is more expensive it provides a financial disservice to all the remaining consumers - including those without solar panels and low income consumers.\These consumers are burdened with higher bills because they have to pay for the solar homeowners' share of the costs of the electric grid.\Since homes with rooftop solar continue to rely on the transmitting and distributing services provided by the grid, they should share equally in the cost to maintain of the grid.\Many policymakers in other states are just now waking up to the fact that this dynamic is fundamentally flawed.\Many are revisiting their net metering policies and attempting to assure that solar power continues to grow -but in a more equal and fair manner.\Arizona, for example, recently added a surcharge to the monthly bills of solar owners in an effort to ensure that all electric customers pay their fair share for benefiting from the electric grid.\California has also been actively investigating the impact of net metering rules in its state and recently determined that, if its policies aren't augmented, those without rooftop solar would end up paying $1.1 billion more for electricity by the year 2020.\In all, about 20 states are reexamining their net metering polices to address this cost shift.\It is also why the National Black Caucus of State Legislators has a paper entitled, The Need to Develop and Implement Equitable Energy Policies, that focuses on the economics of cost shift.\Other states didn't have the benefit of NCBL's views on this issue but Wisconsin regulators and policy makers do and should consider this as they work get the economics around energy policy done right to benefit all consumers.\There are fears remains that supporters of Council's resolution, including rooftop solar leasing firms who put their interests ahead of consumers will also attempt to roll back these policies.\For these many reasons, Wisconsin has a real opportunity to lead on this issue, bring together important views and work towards a solution that makes sense for all of our residents. We should embrace renewable energy but only if its benefits and costs are shared equally by all.\Ultimately, nobody should be in favor of programs that deliver benefits to one class of residents while exacting deep costs on the most vulnerable families, those on fixed and low incomes.\We can - and must - do better. Let's hope the Wisconsin Public Service Commission keeps energy policies fair and equitable while charting Wisconsin's solar future.\Read More! - Related Articles:\Taylor reintroduces two bills for reentry employment\MICAH holds '11 x 15 Campaign' Summit\Legislatively Speaking - Computer Science is the future"
370,"Clean energy is becoming increasingly common. The costs of wind and solar are falling, and the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is rising.\In some places, renewable energy is becoming the cheapest source of new energy generation. From my perspective as an investor this is nothing short of a revolution in the way the energy business operates. This change is good for energy consumers, the environment and our economy.\The revolution could also be good for utilities, if they seek to take advantage of it rather than trying to stifle it. Right now, however, Wisconsin utilities are trying to use their regulator to fight changes in the electric sector.\Three Wisconsin utilities -- We Energies, Madison Gas & Electric and Wisconsin Public Service Corp. -- are pushing for policies that harm the ability of businesses and homeowners to adopt solar energy.\Specifically, third-party leasing and net metering face a severe setback pending a decision by the state's Public Service Commission. On the surface the efforts of Wisconsin's utilities may seem innocuous. Yes, the terms are technical, but the impact would be significant for the state.\In other states, companies can enter into private contracts with renewable energy companies for power. These arrangements are often referred to as ""third-party leasing."" As the name implies, third-party leasing allows businesses or homeowners to lease their rooftop or land to a third-party company that owns solar panels and develops a project.\The home or business ""host"" then receives energy from the system at a discounted rate from the system owner. Third-party leasing has been vital to the recent success of the solar industry as it provides companies and individuals a choice of how they get their electricity without the costs and hassle of maintenance and repairs.\Likewise, net metering allows companies and homeowners an opportunity to participate in the energy market; it ensures fair compensation for the electricity they generate and send back into the grid.\As always, competition benefits consumers, but isn't appreciated by monopolies, like utilities. Third-party leasing and net metering allows this competition by providing opportunities for new players in the energy market: from homeowners, to business owners, to private power companies. The fear of competition explains why the proposal at the PSC is trying to prevent such arrangements.\Wisconsin utilities, however, can only frustrate the desires of Wisconsin homeowners and businesses for so long. Many in Wisconsin are already seeing the benefits of renewable energy. Customers are saving money on their energy use, jobs are being created and investment is coming into the state.\Like Wisconsin residents, America's biggest businesses have realized the benefits of clean energy. In a study we did -- Power Forward 2.0 -- we found that 60 percent of the Fortune 100 has a clean energy goal. Companies aren't doing this to win brownie points; instead they see a business value in doing so.\By pursuing these goals companies save over $1 billion in energy costs annually. However, in order to get the benefits of clean energy they have to be able to participate in energy markets. Without net metering and third party PPAs they're effectively shut out.\If they succeed, Wisconsin's utilities won't stop corporate investment in clean energy, they'll just drive it to other states without the regulatory roadblocks. At the very least, companies will choose to install solar in other states.\However, we've already documented a couple cases in which access to renewable energy tipped the scales in deciding where companies sited whole facilities. Nebraska recently reeled when Facebook chose Iowa over the Cornhusker State; one of the reasons the company cited was the ability to buy wind energy in Iowa.\Likewise, Michigan lost out on a data center to North Carolina; one of a handful of reasons Michigan missed out was that the state's electric grid was too dirty.\Wisconsin and its utilities have a choice to make: Embrace competition or lose out on investment. The Public Service Commission will decide which way the state goes this fall.\Hopefully the commission and the state will move toward greater competition, greater investment, and more choice.\Stu Dalheim is a vice president at Calvert Investments, a member of the Investor Network on Climate Risk."
371,"It is no secret that cows produce two things in abundance in the Dairy State: milk and manure.\Wisconsin's 1.27 million dairy cows produce 3.2 billion gallons of milk and enough manure to fill almost 3,000 Olympic-size swimming pools a year, according to Steve Carpenter, director of UW-Madison's Center for Limnology, who has studied the water quality of Madison's lakes for 40 years.\""The automation, the technologies that farmers use today have made them very successful,"" said Monte Lamer, a farm boy from Tomahawk and former power plant operator in Alaska who is now plant manager for the Clear Horizons community digester outside of Waunakee.\""At the same time, their success is showing up in our waterways.""\According to experts, agriculture accounts for roughly 70 percent of the phosphorus runoff in watersheds across the state, with urban runoff accounting for the remaining 30 percent.\It is closer to an 80-20 split in the Yahara Watershed in Dane County, said Carpenter, who hopes to find a way for the dairy industry to thrive while protecting water quality.\The agricultural runoff that often turns Madison's lakes unpleasant by creating algal blooms that look and smell bad, clog boat motors and close beaches is expected to only get worse.\Climate change is the main reason, experts say.\There were zero rain events of more than 3 inches in the 1980s, four rain events of more than 3 inches in 1990s and eight events of more than 3 inches in the 2000s, according to Carpenter.\""A 3-inch rain event can move a lot of manure and a lot of soil in the lakes at once,"" Carpenter said. ""And we are seeing more of those big storms.""\U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-driven regulations are calling for the state to get phosphorus out of its lakes. Carpenter and Lamer are among a growing chorus of dairy industry supporters who see manure digesters as key to lowering high phosphorus levels in waterways to meet the tougher regulations.\Since 2001, manure digesters have been popping up across the state. Wisconsin now has 34, the most in the nation, with two more scheduled to begin operating by 2015. In all these digesters, bacteria eat biomass like manure, food scraps or whey and emit energy in the form of methane gas.\Dane County kicked the process up a notch by attaching an industrial centrifuge to its digesters. Like a juicer that separates the liquid from the pulp, centrifugal force separates the phosphorus from the liquid and gas.\Manure digesters cannot remove all the phosphorus from waste, nor do they completely remove other contaminants like hormones and anti-microbials, said Sarah Yang, a water evaluation toxicologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The Dane County community digester is designed to remove 60 percent of the phosphorus from the processed manure, according to the DNR.\""Compared to straight land application, the digesters have the ability to degrade those contaminants somewhat,"" Yang said. ""But they were really designed to reduce pathogens, greenhouse gas emission and minimize odor.""\?A political compromise'\Now, however, a changed political climate that is more hostile to renewable energy is stalling digester growth. And spills are raising doubts about digesters' reliability.\Three recent well-publicized spills of 435,000 gallons of liquid manure from Wisconsin's first ""community"" manure digester, in Dane County, contaminated a creek and led to notices of environmental violations.\""Right now, the management of the (manure) runoff is a political compromise. And I understand the sensitivities that need to be addressed there,"" Carpenter said. ""But if, as a society, we wanted to have clean lakes, we could do it. We just haven't valued clean lakes highly enough to make that a priority.""\Case in point: Annual phosphorus runoff into Lake Mendota has fluctuated between 27,000 pounds and 178,000 pounds over the past 38 years with no apparent improvements in water quality, Carpenter said.\For years, Richard Lathrop, an honorary fellow at UW-Madison's Center for Limnology and a retired DNR research limnologist, has been telling anyone who will listen that farmers need help processing their manure.\Best management practices ? planting cover crops to prevent runoff, limiting manure spreading during winter months, and following nutrient management plans ? are helpful but will not cut phosphorus and nitrogen levels enough to really impact water quality, Lathrop said.\For example, Dane County requires farmers to have a permit to spread liquid manure on frozen ground, according to Kevin Connors, director of Dane County's Department of Land and Water Resources.\Many do ? 111 farmers have permits that cover 67,000 acres ? and they can spread on slopes with up to a 12 percent grade. Bascom Hill on the UW-Madison campus has a 18.7 percent grade. So imagine flattening it a bit and spraying liquid manure there when it is covered in snow.\Lathrop estimates that 40 percent of that manure runs off snow or frozen ground between January and March and ends up in the Yahara watershed.\If more digesters were built, counties could limit winter spreading, Lathrop said.\""I think a total ban would be a hardship for many farmers that might put some out of business,"" he said. ""We need agriculture nearby for lots of reasons (in Dane County). We wouldn't want a lot of agricultural land sold for urban development or the Mendota watershed will end up looking like eastern Waukesha County.""\Farms across the state also put together nutrient management plans. The plans, often partially paid for with government funding, outline when and where farmers spread their manure.\But while 5,088 farms in Wisconsin have nutrient management plans, they only cover about one-quarter of the state's nine million acres of cropland, said Donna Gilson, a spokeswoman with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.\Of those farms, 263 are concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, industrial-sized farms required to have the plans.\For some, digesters impractical\Laurie Fischer, executive director of the Dairy Business Association, an organization that works to build a positive image and political environment for the state's $26 billion dairy industry, said there are 10,800 farms in Wisconsin and manure digesters do not make economic sense for some of them.\""The big solution for the phosphorus problem is the nutrient management plans,"" Fischer said. ""When farmers use these plans and rotate their crops, they can actually save money by not having to buy (or buy as much) fertilizer.""\The DNR limits but does not ban CAFOs from winter manure spreading. Most farms lack the capacity to store their manure through the winter months.\Farmers turn to manure pits for storage, but those have problems, too. The pits are a source of methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, Lathrop said.\And the more manure is moved around, the greater the risk for spills. In the past 10 years, 6.9 million gallons of manure have spilled across the state from tanker trucks or digesters, or leaked from lagoons, according to the DNR.\?A whole new future'\""We have to think about a whole new future ? and collecting raw manure and treating it in anaerobic digesters or other manure processing facilities is the path to that future,"" Lathrop said. ""Soil erosion reduction practices by themselves are not going to solve water pollution.""\Dane County came to that same conclusion in 2005 when former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk pivoted the county's approach on clean water quality in Madison's lakes toward manure runoff.\The idea for the ""community"" digester was born.\The state's first, it began processing manure in late 2010 near Waunakee primarily to control the runoff of nutrients from land-based manure spreading into the Yahara watershed, not to produce biogas energy.\""That had never been so explicitly linked before,"" said Michael Vickerman, program and policy director with ReNew Wisconsin, an organization that advocates for renewable energy policies.\The county's second community digester will begin operating in June. When both are operating, they will process 15 percent of the manure in the Mendota watershed, Lathrop said.\The Waunakee digester was humming along relatively unnoticed until the winter of 2013-14 hit, bringing 39 below-zero days and making it the sixth coldest on record for the Madison area.\Digester operators speculate that could be why the pipes started to break.\In November, 380,000 gallons of manure burst from where a pipe connects to a holding container. The manure flowed to Six Mile Creek, which drains directly into Lake Mendota.\A 20,000-gallon spill followed in January and a 35,000-gallon spill in March. Manure from these two spills did not leave the digester site, according to the DNR and digester operators.\Clear Horizons, which owns and operates the digester, was cited by the DNR in January for the first two spills and for failing to remove enough phosphorus from the manure before it is spread on the fields. Clear Horizons' permit requires 60 percent of the phosphorus be removed from the manure, according to Robert Manwell, a DNR spokesman.\Lamer said flexible expansion joints have been installed where the underground pipes that carry the manure come above ground and attach to the digester.\He agreed an alarm should be installed to alert staff when there is a leak.\Shahla Werner, director of the Sierra Club's John Muir Chapter, said the state needs to mandate additional safeguards, including automatic shutoff valves and alarms, and buffers to contain manure leaks.\?The cost of experimentation'\From the date it opened in 2011 through April, the Waunakee community digester has removed 200,000 pounds of phosphorus from the manure it has processed, according to Clear Horizons.\Lathrop said it is important to recognize the amount of phosphorus that has been kept out of Madison waterways versus the amount of manure that has spilled.\Carpenter called the spills ""the cost of experimentation.""\""In the early days of aviation, a few planes crashed,"" Carpenter said. ""It is regrettable those spills happened, but that's how innovation occurs.""\There are 194 manure digesters in the country.\Industry experts agree the boom in digester construction is coming to an end, but not for lack of cow manure.\There are enough cows in Wisconsin to sustain 251 digesters, seven times the current number, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's AgSTAR Program.\?A missed opportunity'\In 2001 the state started its Focus on Energy program. It required utilities to obtain 10 percent of their energy from renewables ? wind, solar, biogas ? by 2015.\When utilities were trying to reach their 10 percent renewable quota, many were buying back the biogas from digester owners for 6 to 9 cents a kilowatt-hour, making a digester financially worth it for an investor. That is now down to around 3 to 4 cents in most cases.\Consequently, some digester owners are flaring off, or burning, the methane gas emitted from the digester, because it cannot be processed or sold.\""Here you have a relatively clean fuel that is being released back into the atmosphere,"" said Melissa VanOrnum, marketing manager of Chilton-based DVO Inc., the country's largest digester designer. ""It is a missed opportunity.""\DVO has built 87 digesters, including expansion projects, across the country, with 28 located in Wisconsin. It also has three international sites, with digesters in Serbia, Canada and Chile.\But business in Wisconsin has slowed down. It has one expansion project on the Statz Brothers Farm outside Sun Prairie and a new digester being built in New Chester.\""It really comes down to incentives,"" VanOrnum said. ""People will say the state shouldn't be subsidizing renewable energy. But oil and gas companies have been enjoying subsidies for years.""\The Sierra Club, while concerned about water quality, opposes subsidies for digesters, Werner said.\""We would rather see the farmers who are profiting pay for them. If any other waste producer was producing a steady waste stream, they would not be rewarded,"" she said. ""Biogas is getting preferential treatment.""\A bill authored by Democrats in February to increase the renewable portfolio to 30 percent by 2030 went nowhere in the Republican-controlled Legislature.\The Legislature did pass a bill that will allow utility companies to purchase power from a hydroelectric dam in Manitoba, Canada, beginning in 2015, to meet renewable quotas.\""Without a change in the law saying utilities must increase their renewable energy supplies, digesters will find access to the market very difficult here, if not impossible,"" Vickerman said.\Fischer said representatives of the Dairy Business Association met with Public Service Commission Chairman Phil Montgomery in the fall to bring the regulatory agency ""up to speed"" on the state's business climate toward digesters.\The Dairy Business Association's president, Jerry Meissner, has a digester on his farm and Fischer said it is important to Meissner that other producers in the state have access to manure digesters.\""What's happening right now. It is definitely a concern,"" Fischer said.\A tipping point?\While support for digesters is waning at the Capitol, it is beginning to find traction with one Madison-based nonprofit.\The four-year-old Clean Lakes Alliance was formed to administer the Clean Lakes Festival, an annual event organized by the Mad-City Water Ski Team to raise money for cleaning up the Madison lakes. The Alliance's activities have become more focused on improving water quality with an ambitious goal of reducing phosphorus levels by half in Madison's lakes by 2025.\In 2012, the Clean Lakes Alliance published its first annual report. It stated it would cost $128 million to clean up Madison's lakes, including private sector investment in manure digesters.\Of that amount, $49.5 million will be used to build five community digesters in Dane County, two of which are up and running. Each costs $12 million, leaving the remaining $10.5 million to cover the cost of the digesters to government subsidies or grants.\Don Heilman, president of the Clean Lakes Alliance, said the group is working with Dane County on the locations.\""We believe in them so much the community is ready and willing to invest in them,"" he said.\Corporate partners include Madison Gas & Electric, American Transmission Co. and the Alliant Energy Foundation, which could prove helpful when these new digesters need to negotiate a rate for the biogas they produce.\The tipping point for Heilman, and other Mad-City Ski Team members, came about 10 years ago when weeds were clogging boat motors and the skiers were reluctant to get in the water.\Lamer, the manager of the Waunakee community digester, thinks the greater Madison community may have reached a tipping point, too.\""Being human, we tend to grow used to things,"" Lamer said. ""Pretty soon, we accept the litter on the ground, the green water as just part of life. We don't respond until it's choking us. I think that's where we're at today. It's choking us.""\This series, Murky Waters, was produced collaboratively by The Capital Times and Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism.

372,"MILWAUKEE - Conservative groups have formed across the country to encourage Republican lawmakers to step up support for clean energy sources like solar power as a source for economic development and job creation.\Two groups in Michigan and Minnesota have already formed. In addition, a Madison lobbying firm, The Capitol Group, has been studying whether to create a Wisconsin conservative energy coalition.\For too long Republicans have been pegged as anti-environment and anti-renewable energy, but there's widespread support for clean energy sources among GOP voters nationally, speakers at a news conference said Wednesday.\The Conservative Energy Network released survey results based on national polling conducted after the election last month that delivered a Republican sweep of the White House, Congress and most state gubernatorial and legislative races.\The election of Donald Trump, who campaigned on bringing back coal and reversing the Obama administration's global warming policies, has left many wondering what federal policies will be for renewable energy. Stock prices of wind energy companies plummeted in the days following the election before recovering somewhat.\Mark Pischea, leader of the Conservative Energy Network, said there's enough bipartisan voter support for renewable energy to persuade Congress to retain federal tax credits that have spurred a boom in solar and wind development across the country.\Among the findings in the survey was widespread support for solar power and for state utility rules known as net metering that ease the path both for homeowners to add solar and dairy farmers to generate electricity from manure digesters.\Other key findings:\70 percent of voters surveyed believe the United States should put more emphasis on wind energy production, and 76 percent support increased solar production. More than half of those polled think the country should put less emphasis on coal, with just 23 percent favoring more emphasis on coal.\Republican, Democrat and independent voters all show strong support for adoption of an energy optimization standard in their state, under which utilities are required to help customers reduce energy consumption through energy efficiency programs and products.\Support for taking action to accelerate clean energy is bipartisan as well, with support ranging from 60 percent on the low end from voters who described themselves as ""very conservative"" to 95 percent for voters who call themselves ""total liberals.""\More than two-thirds of voters surveyed support state renewable portfolio standards that set a target for utilities to generate a minimum amount of wind and solar power. Wisconsin's target, adopted by a bipartisan vote a decade ago, is 10 percent.\In Michigan, where Republicans control the Legislature and governor's office, lawmakers are considering a bill to expand the renewable energy standard to 15 percent, Pischea said.\Republican voters are split on whether they would pay a little more to help create a cleaner energy future, with a majority of ""soft Republicans"" in favor and a majority of ""base Republicans"" opposed. Among all voters, two-thirds support paying a bit more to support clean energy development.\The national polling was conducted by Public Opinion Strategies, which surveyed 1,000 voters by landlines and cell phones from Nov. 10-13. The margin of error is 3.1 percentage points.\The poll avoided asking voters about their opinions on global warming. Support for action on climate change is a political driver for the left to support clean energy, Pischea said, but that's not true for Republicans, many of whom remain skeptical of climate science findings that show a link between burning fossil fuels and warming global temperatures.\""What we've found as conservatives working in this arena that of the folks we come into contact with -- Republican voters, Trump voters, GOP legislators and conservative thought leaders -- climate can often be a barrier to a productive conversation, given the politics around climate, especially on the right,"" he said.\Michelle Kussow, partner at The Capitol Group in Madison, said her firm has been working with Pischea and the national group for about a year and is considering the formation of a Wisconsin-focused conservative clean energy organization in 2017.\""Before the election we thought there was viability for this project, and now after the election we definitely believe there's an opportunity for a conservative energy group in Wisconsin,"" Kussow said.\Kussow released figures tallying the economic impact of the sector in Wisconsin, with $5.9 billion in investment across wind, solar, biomass energy as well as energy efficiency. The sector accounts for nearly 25,000 jobs across the state, she said.\""The bottom line is that rank-and-file Republican support for clean energy policies at the state level is growing,"" said Mike Franklin, consultant to the Minnesota Conservative Energy Forum. ""Clean energy represents an opportunity for the GOP to build a bridge to key independent voters such as millennials, college educated and minorities that are critical to the party's ability to win elections in the future.""\Source: Public Opinion Strategies, Post-Election National\Clean Energy Survey/Designed by Journal Sentinel"
373,"Joel Rogers is director of COWS, the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, at the UW-Madison.\ Dick Cheney is such a jaw-jutting example to us all. First he leads the charge on a national energy policy that profits only oil companies and producers of nuclear waste (among the most colossal contributors to the Bush campaign), while further destroying the environment and committing us to a less secure and more expensive energy future. Then he gets Congress to give him a boatload of new ""defense"" money to protect that future, including billions for his past employer, thereby paying back a thousand-fold his multimillion- dollar severance package from them. And now he's getting the Navy, a prime recipient of that largesse, to pay his electric bill, which runs 2,600 times that of the average D.C. resident.\ Talk about ""running government like a business"" and ""getting value for your tax dollar""! This guy really keeps his campaign promises!\ Sometimes I wish I were Dick Cheney. Life would be so much easier and rewarding. But then, I'd rather not rot in hell.\ No, I'd rather just have a quiet life (and afterlife) here in Wisconsin - raising my kids as tall as corn, able to distinguish right from wrong and shameless greed from public duty, with - to get back to our current topic in Sustaining Wisconsin - a safe and clean energy future that won't need a nuclear Navy to defend it.\ Last week I promised more examples of how that future was being built right here in the Midwest. Here they some, from various neighbors:\ Minneapolis: The Minneapolis housing authority (MPHA) manages 40 high-rise apartment buildings scattered throughout the city. All were built 30 or more years ago, before energy efficiency principles were widely incorporated in building design. After numerous heating, cooling and electrical failures in the buildings, MPHA recently moved to retrofit them with something closer to state-of-the-art heating and cooling equipment. The cost of retrofit: $5 million. The savings net of these costs: $9 million and counting. MPHA is now expanding the program to a second generation of energy efficient roof-top fans, super-efficient refrigerators, other things to realize more savings. Building residents are delighted with the program, reporting improved comfort; and MPHA administration is finding that the new systems also permit it to respond much faster and effectively to resident problems.\ Cincinnati: Another story of energy efficiency retrofitting, this one about the Fifth Third Center (office) Tower in downtown Cincinnati. A few years ago its owners decided to install an energy management system, entailing an upgrade in the heating and air conditioning system, installation of CO2 sensors on air quality, energy efficient lighting, and the like. Again, the investment has more than paid for itself. Building energy costs have fallen by $400,000. The building also provides numerous examples of collateral savings, which are as common in energy-efficient design as collateral loses are in energy-inefficient ones. Fix one part of a system, and you need to spend less on another. For example, more efficient lights are also cooler, which reduces air conditioning costs: The energy savings on efficiency thus multiply.\ Sacred Heart Monastery, N.D.: A nice example of a really small- scale project, Sacred Heart installed two wind turbines several years ago, and continues to recoup the benefits, year in and year out, at the rate of better than $12,000 in savings a year. The only complaint? When they generate excess electricity, which they do regularly, the area utility won't credit them at anywhere near its retail rate. They are calling for it to do so, a practice known as ""net metering."" Were that mandated, there is little doubt that many area residences and farms would also throw their energy fortunes to the winds.\ Chariton Valley, Iowa: Spurred on by local citizens, Alliant Energy is taking a step toward cleaner and more renewable power by testing the co-firing of its turbines with a mixture of coal and switchgrass - a deep-rooted perennial grass once native to southern Iowa, and still used by farmers in fields left fallow for its soil- conserving strength. If the experiment proves successful, as everyone expects, this will be a step toward opening up a more substantial biomass market in the region, which is well-prepared to meet it locally.\ Chicago: Expanding the use of photovoltaic cells to on-the-grid users is a main goal of several alternative energy projects. In Chicago, a citywide project called ""Brownfields to Bright Fields"" involves the city purchasing PV systems for area industry sites, in exchange for their residents developing PV manufacturing capability - a nearly classic example of public power promoting the development of a market, and private capacity to meet it. Toledo, Ohio, is another municipality looking to retrofit both public (e.g., schools) and private commercial buildings with advanced PV systems.\ And so on and so on. The road to a clean energy future is clear enough to see, and the thousand little steps along the way, as these examples suggest, are easy enough to take, and can more than pay for themselves.\ But this really just raises another question, since it's also clear that not enough of these steps are being taken, and that the cumulative weight of such ""alternative"" energy use is as nothing compared to our continued reliance on fossil fuels. If clean energy makes such good economic as well as social sense, why aren't we seeing more of it? Why aren't more people or governments acting like the monastery in North Dakota, or (Lord help us!) the city of Chicago?\ One good answer is power - of a different sort than energy. But there are also market reasons, which might be more gently cured. Let's look at problems a little more next week."

As Governor Jim Doyle continues his northern tour, he is promoting a policy agenda that will serve as his legacy when he leaves office next year.
\
One of the most ambitious pieces of legislation Doyle is pushing for is a law that would create a new renewable energy benchmark for the state.
\
On Monday, Eric Callisto, chairperson of the Public Service Commission (PSC), spoke about how the new goals would mange the way the state looks at its energy policy.
\
""The governor is not running for re-election and as he announced that he talked about some of the priorities for the state going forward,"" Callisto said. ""Among those are environmental protection and sustainable energy.""
\
Callisto, who heads the agency charged with overseeing the state's energy utilities, said the governor's energy plan involves a three pronged approach consisting of strengthening the state's standards for renewable energy, consumption, expanding the state's market share of clean energy production and ramping up clean energy research programs throughout the UW system.
\
The first piece of legislation that could emerge from the governor's energy platform could reach the Legislature this fall. The bill - which would likely come through Sen. Mark Miller's committee on the environment and Rep. Spencer Black's natural resources committee - would entail a modification of the state's renewable portfolio standard (RPS).
\
The current RPS requires that the state's utility companies produce 10 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2015. Under the revamped bill, the deadline for the 10 percent renewable mark would be moved up to 2013 and two new benchmarks would be added to create a ""25 by 25"" agenda - 25 percent renewable by 2025 with at least 10 percent produced in Wisconsin.
\
""I think it's a realistic goal,"" Callisto said. ""It's a goal in which Wisconsin utilities, businesses and rate payers are all going to have to play a major role.""
\
Callisto pointed out that energy conservation is still the most efficient way to decrease the state's carbon footprint, but he added that the new benchmarks would create a framework for businesses and utility companies to create new alternative energy sources and retire inefficient coal plants.
\
""The cheapest way to save energy is to use less,"" Callisto said, adding that the governor's energy plan would shift the assessment of energy efficiency from one based on utility revenues to one based on consumption goals.
\
Callisto said the creation of smaller biomass plants around the state would play a role, as would expanding the state's wind power production and biogas production.
\
Callisto also said he looked forward to legislation that would revise the state moratorium on nuclear power in a way that would allow the PSC to evaluate the issue. The state moratorium prevents any construction of new nuclear facilities until the federal government provides for a nuclear waste disposal program. Wisconsin currently gets 15 to 20 percent of its power from three nuclear stations on Lake Michigan's shores.
\
""We should have the opportunity at least to consider it,"" Callisto said. ""It's CO2-free and if reducing CO2 emissions is the concern than it needs to be on the table.""

376,"Green Bay Press-Gazette\Having successfully completed the downsizing of its nonregulated Energy Services business, Integrys Energy Group CEO Charles Schrock told shareholders Wednesday the company would seek near-term revenue growth through increased operating efficiencies.\""We have a shortfall on what our utilities are authorized to earn and what they are earning. We're trying to close that gap,"" Schrock said during the annual shareholders meeting at the Weidner Center for the Performing Arts on the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay campus.\Integrys reported net income of $221 million, or $3.13 per share, on revenue of $5.2 billion in 2010. Revenue was nearly $9 billion less and net income $108 million more than in 2008, before the company began selling the riskier, more capital-intensive segments of its nonregulated subsidiary.\""I think (the transition) went exceptionally well. We were able to hit every milestone,"" Schrock said Monday.\Also, over the past two years, the company reduced its work force by nearly 600 positions to about 4,500 employees overall.\Schrock announced Wednesday that Integrys' board of directors voted a 68 cents per share quarterly dividend, to be paid June 20 to shareholders of record on May 31.\The dividend has remained the same since the first quarter of 2009. He said that because of the decrease in revenue, the dividend rate is greater than is prevalent in the industry and the company will try to grow revenue before increasing it again.\""We'll monitor it. It's certainly on our minds,"" he said.\Lyn Hart of Howard, a retired shareholder and former company employee, said Wednesday he was satisfied with the state of the company, including with the dividend.\""There are companies out there that are talking about reducing or eliminating dividends,"" he said. ""They are doing a good job. Seventy years of dividends says something.""\Having pulled back from the riskier parts of the nonregulated business, Integrys is diversifying in other ways. It is the largest shareholder in American Transmission Co., which recently announced a joint venture with Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C., to build, own and operate electric transmission infrastructure across the country.\""American Transmission Co. brings a model demonstrated to be successful. They have good skills with project development, regulatory construction and stakeholder involvement,"" he said.\In October 2010, Integrys said it was teaming with Duke Energy Generation Services and Smart Energy Capital to build and finance distributed solar projects throughout the United States. Distributed energy systems are smaller-scale generators that provide power to individual customers, such as a factory.\""We are developing an expertise in that area. The price continues to come down. It's not competitive now, but we see ourselves positioning ourselves in an environment where it becomes more important,"" he said.\Integrys has enough renewable power to comply with the state's renewable portfolio standard (RPS).\""We do not need to build any projects of scale to meet the RPS before the end of the decade,"" he said.\Some projects, such as the 11 anaerobic digesters on farms within its territory, don't provide much in the way of power, but do provide other benefits to the community, he said.\""It's not a matter of scale. We are positioning ourselves in a way we can help our customers,"" he said.\While Integrys will not be building new power plants in the near future, it will be making significant capital improvements to existing infrastructure, including $2 billion over the next 15 to 20 years to replace natural gas piping in Chicago, and hundreds of millions of dollars to make environmental upgrades to existing power plants.\Also Wednesday, shareholders elected as directors Keith Bailey, William Brodsky, Albert Budney Jr., Pastora San Juan Cafferty, Ellen Carnahan, Michelle Collins, Kathryn Hasselblad-Pascale, John Higgins, James Kemerling, Michael Lavin, William Protz Jr. and Schrock. Two directors, Richard Bemis and Robert Gallagher, retired.

377,"Herald Times Reporter\MANITOWOC -- Former Manitowoc mayor, now an Orion Energy Systems executive, Kevin Crawford believes environmentally friendly companies can help save the earth and create jobs at the same time.\""A key element is to help get the Orion picture out there ... we are a key solution to one of America's most daunting challenges,"" said Crawford, named to his vice president of governmental affairs and business development post on Earth Day, April 22.\Six months into his new job after 20 years as mayor, Crawford was speaking via phone Thursday from Los Angeles where he was attending the Governors' Climate Summit 2, hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Doyle and other governors.\Attending the L.A. summit with Orion's marketing director, Guy Peterson, Crawford said, ""When you say you're from Wisconsin, a vision of cheeseheads dances in people's heads. We have to remind people we are cutting-edge technology as an organization and as a state,"" said Crawford.\He was given ammunition for Orion's business development efforts with Wednesday's announcement that the Manitowoc-based public company (NASDAQ: OESX) has been nominated in the category of Energy Efficiency Program of the Year in the Platts Global Energy Awards competition, often described as the Academy Awards of the energy industry.\Last year Orion won Sustainable Technology Innovation of the Year honors for its integrated system.\It includes its high-intensity compact modular lighting, InteLite wireless control system and its rooftop-placed Apollo solar light pipes, which harvest daylight and focuses it to a facility floor, through a sealed tube, using no electricity for up to 10 hours a day.\Collects Asian business cards\Orion energy management systems are in about 5,000 facilities across North America -- as well as Roncalli High School gym and at Manitowoc's Festival Foods -- including 119 of the Fortune 500 companies.\A company document says customers have saved some $640 million in energy costs and reduced indirect carbon dioxide emissions by 5.5 million tons.\In his governmental affairs capacity, Crawford continues to lobby state politicians and Congress to look favorably on legislation that would grant tax credits to purchasers of Orion products, including the light pipes.\""Orion is a sleeping giant ... the downturn in the economy has impacted the companies that would have been buying our products,"" Crawford said from his office overlooking the manufacturing plant -- with its roof dotted by some 400 light pipes -- that used to serve as the Mirro cookware-bakeware distribution center.\Crawford said the light pipes were not available when original ""Renewable Portfolio Standards"" (RPS) and goals were set calling for, in the case of Wisconsin, 25 percent of energy in 2025 to come from renewable sources like the wind.\Or the sun -- after all, the sun comes up every day even when the wind isn't blowing. Crawford believes Orion's light pipes are the ultimate direct renewable, no-cost, energy source that helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels.\He made that pitch at scientific and trade missions in Japan and China last month.\""As we approach the 'Green Teens,' the decade from 2010-2020, we can envision an era during which the world's business enterprises compete furiously to develop practical and cost-competitive environmentally sound products, machinery and tools including alternative fuels, direct use renewables, energy-saving technologies and other strategies that will help nations live up to their promises to reduce humanity's carbon footprint,"" he said to a Japanese audience.\He added, ""There is a growing realization that 'green' means not only environmentally friendly, but also profitable and full of opportunity for job creation.\""In other words, transforming green to gold,"" Crawford told the Japan-Midwest U.S. Conference.\While in Asia, Crawford took the opportunity to exchange business cards with dozens of government and business leaders.\""Radical Ideas - Extreme Energy Savings"" is the slogan on an Orion binder where Crawford keeps his hundreds of cards that can lead to contracts or partnerships helping to keep the current 230 employees in Manitowoc working or generate future openings.\'The other 75 percent'\Doyle's goal of ""25 by 2025"" creates a key question, Crawford said.\""What will the other 75 percent be?"" Crawford said, mentioning natural gas, so-called ""clean coal"" technology, and recalling one Japanese energy executive stating an expansion of nuclear energy must happen for the U.S. to meet RPS.\Crawford told the Japanese conference, ""As companies work their way through the present world while planning for what lies ahead, the key challenge is to maximize potential gains in energy efficiency while ensuring adequate new electric generation to maintain reliability and meet future demand.""\That's where Orion's guarantee that its technology will increase light levels while reducing energy costs is its principal selling point.\It's a theme Crawford uses both with business and government officials, though not in Washington, D.C. corridors as often as when he first joined Orion in spring.\""There is so much horse trading to get health care dealt with ... it really has stalled everything going on with the energy bill,"" Crawford said of the House of Representatives and U.S. Senate's fixation on medical economics.\So, does he miss being mayor? ""I enjoyed every minute and every day ... what I liked about local government was making decisions based on what your gut told you was right and then moving on,"" with no partisan politics, Crawford said.\He's pleased to be at Orion, founded by Neal Verfuerth and his wife, Pat, in 1997, after serving as mayor, United Way director, and Manitowoc Crane test operator and local union official.\""I've spent a lifetime on behalf of working people,"" Crawford said. ""Coming here has evolved (that passion) into another level of helping people through saving the environment and putting people to work.""\Online: www.oesx.com"

Rubasch Sr., age 73, of rural Viroqua, passed away at the Bethel Home on Dec. 26, 2012. \Rich was born at home in Chicago, Ill., on April 1, 1939. His father, thinking that it was an April Fool's joke, had to be persuaded to come home for the delivery! His father nurtured Rich's love of gardening as a child. Rich had a garden almost every year of his adult life and passed on this interest and his love for the outdoors to many of his children and grandchildren. \His first job was in a machine shop at age 10, sorting nuts, bolts and washers, which foreshadowed his future as a toolmaker. After a brief job as a finishing inspector at Bremen Piano Company, he landed an apprenticeship at ALCOA as a mold maker. He later worked at A1Tool and Die Company, one of the most modern in the country at that time. On a blind date at a Christmas party he met his future wife, Patricia. Having lost his parents at a young age, they married in June of 1960 and cared for his younger siblings, Tony and Bill. They later added to the family with the addition of their six children. \As an avid reader, Rich taught himself many things. He read Hoard's Dairyman, Mother Earth News and many books until he was ready to try his hand at farming. He bought a small hobby farm, remodeled the house, acquired a few cows and moved the family to Wisconsin in 1977. With help from his family, good neighbors, and advice from the old-timers, he managed a small Jersey dairy operation until the late 1980s. As the kids left home, he sold the cows and converted the barn into a woodworking business, Wisconsin Wood Products. Woodworking soon came full circle back to machining, when he partnered with his brother, Tony, in his ultrasonic tooling business, Toman Tool Corporation. Rich worked there for many years, until his retirement in 2001. Rich enjoyed reading, gardening, target shooting, woodworking, hiking, camping, boating, fishing and relaxing in the country. He enjoyed trips with his wife, Pat, and watching his children and grandchildren grow up. \He is survived by his wife, Patricia; children, Cathy (Denny) Lund of Viroqua, Rich Jr. (Gunilla) Rubasch of Madison, Jim (Cathy) Rubasch of Aiea, Hawaii, Sue Berger of La Crosse, Mary (Robert) Pietan of Decorah, Iowa, and Laura (Bill) Griffin of Wilmette, Ill.; grandchildren, Nina (Andrew) Bradley, David Lund, Emily, Ian and Hanna Rubasch; Ben and Logan Rubasch, Kaitlin Berger, Amanda Rubasch, Madeline, Margaret and Will Griffin; great-grandchildren Matthew and Emma Bradley; brothers, Tony (Deb) Rubasch of Stoddard, Bill (MaryJo) Rubasch of Tucson, Ariz.; and many other relatives and friends. \A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, Jan. 5, 2013, at ST. MARY'S CATHOLIC CHURCH in Viroqua. Father Michael Klos will celebrate the Mass with burial in the St. James Cemetery.

Fowlie passed away on Thursday, Dec. 13, 2013, at the St. Mary's Care Center in Madison, Wisconsin. \Al was born on Oct. 3, 1928, to William and Else (Behrendt) Fowlie in Stevens Point. He attended Stevens Point Public School and graduated from high school in 1948 before moving to Madison in 1952, where he would reside for the next sixty years. \Al joined his friend, Nick George in Madison. Upon his relocation to Madison, Al was able to find a job, through the State Employment Office, with Automatic Temperature Supplies (ATS), a plumbing wholesale house on East Main Street. Due to his work ethic, diligence and loyalty, Al remained employed with ATS for 38 years until his retirement in 1990. His employment at ATS gave Al a collection of lifelong friendships and associations that ensured the enrichment of both Al's life and the lives of those fortunate enough to know Al through his occupation. \Al was a true individual, one whom no person could ever be quick to forget. It would be impossible for anyone who set foot in his home not to notice his interest in history, especially the period from 1900 through the 1930s. His love of the era's music was constantly amplified within the walls of his abode, courtesy of the thousands of 78 RPS records he possessed from the early 20th Century. His collection of relics and heirlooms also included the kerosene lamps that he burned in his home so his rooms had a Victorian ambiance, the vast number of bound newspapers that he collected from the 1950s until the 1990s, and his exhaustive library of movies that he recorded and watched on his Beta and VHS recorders. \For years, Allen opened his house to serve Sunday morning breakfast to hungry college students attending the University of Wisconsin. At times, there would be up to 20 students at Allen's doorstep. Those mornings consisted of great food along with insightful conversation. Many of those students became lifelong friends of Allen. \He is survived by his cousins, David Behrendt of Edmonds, Wash. and John Behrendt of Boulder, Colo.; as well as his lifelong friend, Nick George, Nick's wife, Joan and the entire George Family. The Christmas Eves that Al spent in the George home year after year would always serve as some of Al's happiest times. He is also survived by the Sweeney Family of Madison. He touched the lives of three generations of Sweeneys through his association with Automatic Temperature. \Al was a member of the Rosicrucian Order for over 50 years. He formulated many of his beliefs about life, death and reincarnation from studying the teachings of the order. As per his request, Al was cremated and his ashes were spread in order to ""comingle with the earth."" \We would like to thank Dr. Albert Musa, his assistant, Bette Macaulay and the entire staff of the Dean Clinic for their 20 years of excellent care that allowed Al to live a comfortable life despite his many ailments. We also wish to thank the staff at St. Mary's Care Center in Madison for their support and care of Al for the two years that he was a resident. \A memorial gathering will be held from 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 2, 2013, at JOYCE-RYAN FUNERAL HOME, 5701 Odana Road. \In lieu of flowers please make a donation to the charity of your choice. \To view and sign this guestbook, please visit: www.ryanfuneralservice.com \Joyce-Ryan Funeral Home \& Cremation Services \5701 Odana Road \(608) 274-1000 \Stich, Lydia Edna (Birch) \STITZER - Lydia Edna (Birch) Stich, age 90, of Stitzer, passed away on Friday, Dec. 28, 2012, at the Lancaster Care Center. \She was born on Nov. 17, 1922, in Liberty Township.
