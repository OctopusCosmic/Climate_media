0,"Many controversial issues lend themselves to split-the-difference compromises, but the Keystone XL pipeline isn't one of them. That puts President Obama in a tough spot as his administration nears a decision on the proposed $7 billion project, which would carry tar-sand oil from Canada to Gulf Coast refineries.\For the environmentalists who strongly supported Obama's re-election, Keystone has become a crucial test of his promises to take climate change seriously.\Thousands demonstrated in Washington on Sunday against the project, asserting that the pipeline would unlock so much dirty oil that it would be ""game over"" for the globe if the project proceeds.\For Canada, whose government badly wants the pipeline to go forward, the decision is an equally crucial test of the two neighbors' relationship. And for the United States, the project offers a rare opportunity to create jobs and lessen the nation's decades-long dependence on oil from unstable or unfriendly suppliers. Both sides make strong arguments, but after more than four years of exhaustive study, the right answer on Keystone remains: Build it.\At a time of rising global competition for energy resources, the pipeline would bring reliable new oil supplies to a U.S. that still imports 40% of its crude, 7.6 million barrels a day last year. And 40% of those imports come from OPEC nations such as Venezuela, Iraq and Nigeria. Keystone is expected to supply 830,000 million barrels a day, a key step toward the long-sought goal of North American energy independence, which suddenly seems attainable.\Much of the opposition to Keystone has come from critics who say running a big pipeline through the heart of the USA is too risky.\Haven't they noticed that tens of thousands of miles of oil pipelines already crisscross the United States? As long as the nation's quarter-billion vehicles rely almost exclusively on gasoline and diesel, pipelines are the safest and most efficient way to move it.\Obama delayed a final decision on Keystone last year, in part to allow a rerouting around environmentally sensitive areas in Nebraska. That has been accomplished, and Nebraska's governor signed off on the new map last month.\Nor would blocking Keystone keep the tar-sands oil in the ground. In a world starving for oil, it's overwhelmingly likely the oil would find another way to market -- through a pipeline to West Coast ports to carry it to China, to East Coast ports to carry it to other nations, or by barge, rail and existing pipelines into the USA.\The goal of locking down tar-sands oil and stopping other forms of fossil fuel production such as fracking -- as many protesters demanded in Sunday's demonstration -- would be more compelling if the U.S. were ready to shift to renewable fuels such as solar, wind and biomass to power vehicles, heat homes and run factories. Last year, though, renewables supplied just 9.4 percent of all U.S. energy needs, despite robust tax incentives for wind power and electric cars. Shutting down conventional sources of energy at this point is naive and economically destructive.\Demand might be further reduced by making vehicles and buildings more efficient. A carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system could do the same by making the price of conventional fuels better reflect their cost to the environment. Until that day, though, the best choice for the economy and the planet is to ensure ample, secure supplies of energy. The Keystone pipeline is an essential part of that strategy.\USA TODAY\ID_Code: DB-302200003"

2,"WASHINGTON - After eight years with a Texas oil man as president, environmentalists are looking forward to a greener White House.\Whoever wins November's presidential election, environmentalists agree, is bound to be better than President Bush has been on their concerns. He has been dubbed by the League of Conservation Voters as ""arguably the most anti-environmental president in our nation's history"" for supporting efforts to weaken clean air and water laws and drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\Unlike Bush, presumptive Republican nominee John McCain has been a leader in efforts to fight global warming, sponsoring 2003 legislation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a time when many in his party were still doubting the existence of climate change. The Arizona senator was by far the most pro-environment Republican to seek his party's nomination for president this election cycle, environmental groups say.\On the Democratic side, New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has used her position on the Senate environment committee to push for tougher clean air, water and toxic waste laws and stronger protections for children's health. Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, whose oldest daughter, Malia, suffers from asthma attacks made worse by air pollution, also is viewed as a passionate environmental advocate.\""This is the first time in many years that we will have two general election presidential candidates who will be good on the environment,"" said Jim DiPeso, policy director of the moderate Republicans for Environmental Protection.\One of the most dramatic changes in environmental policy is expected to happen on global warming. All three candidates support laws to force deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. Bush, despite setting some voluntary goals this month to slow climate change, opposes mandatory limits on carbon emissions because he says they would raise energy costs and put U.S. businesses at a disadvantage against India and China.\""I think the great news is that we can actually expect something to happen when a new president takes office in January,"" said Cathy Duvall, political director of the Sierra Club. ""Whoever is sitting in the White House after the election will finally take up and address global warming.""\Clinton and Obama both support an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. McCain has sponsored legislation that would reduce those emissions 65 percent by the same date.\Bush, in a speech Wednesday from the White House Rose Garden, set a much more modest goal of freezing the growth of emissions by 2025 before starting to reduce them.\""When compared to the current administration, the differences that McCain, Obama and Clinton have with one another are relatively small,"" said Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University.\Still, most environmental groups are clearly hoping for a Democratic victory in November. Obama and Clinton, they say, are willing to go further and faster than McCain to stop global warming and have been more consistent in voting with the environmental community over the years. McCain, for example, has voted against renewable energy standards that supporters say could reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil as well as pollution.\Clinton has earned the League of Conservation Voters highest ""lifetime score"" with an 87 percent out of a possible 100 percent on her overall legislative record. Obama is close behind her with a lifetime score of 86 percent. McCain's lifetime score is 24 percent, low compared with the Democrats but far above the average for Republican congressional leaders.\""To his credit, Senator McCain has made global warming a priority, but his specific plan falls short of what the science says we need to do,"" said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters.\""The Democrats' plans are far superior in terms of getting the job done.""\But pro-environment Republicans say McCain may have the advantage over the Democrats when it comes to persuading Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to reduce global warming. Although Democrats are expected to retain control of Congress after the November election, the Senate still might be shy of the 60-vote majority it needs to prevent conservatives from using a filibuster to kill global warming bills.\""It took a Republican like Richard Nixon to go to China, and a Republican president will be able to accomplish certain things on climate policy that maybe a Democrat couldn't do,"" DiPeso said.\Whoever does it, it won't be cheap or easy to push America off of its reliance on fossil fuels and onto cleaner, renewable sources of energy, Stavins said.\The solution the Senate is scheduled to take up this June is the creation of a cap-and-trade system in which a power plant or factory that released more greenhouse gases than permitted by law would have to buy allowances for the extra emissions. The allowances would be sold by companies that cut their emissions below the required cap. Over time, the cap would get tighter and tighter so all companies would have to come up with ways to meet the emissions requirements and could not buy their way out of them forever.\Bush has made it clear he will not sign the bill if it passes Congress. But congressional leaders say their efforts will outlast him.\""From all the evidence we have now, if Congress passes that kind of bill next year, all three presidential candidates would sign it,"" Stavins said.\-\Contact Erin Kelly at ekelly(AT)gns.gannett.com."
3,"It's a possibility many Republicans speak of only in whispers, and Democrats are just now beginning to face. After passionate and contentious fights over health care, the environment and taxes, could Democrats lose big - really big - in next year's elections?\Ask them about it, and many Democrats will point to the continued personal popularity of Barack Obama. But that's not the story. ""I think what's going to happen is Obama's going to be fine, and the Democrats in Congress are going to get their asses kicked in 2010,"" says one Democratic strategist who prefers not to be named. ""This is following a curve like the Clinton years: Take on really controversial things early, fail, or succeed partially, ask Democrats to take really tough votes, and then lose. A lot of guys are going to get beat, but the president has time to recover.""\Most Republican hope focuses on the House of Representatives, but even there they have a huge job ahead. Democrats control 256 seats, and Republicans 178. Forty seats would have to change hands for Republicans to take charge. On the other hand, 52 seats turned over when the GOP won the House in 1994. And even if Republicans don't get the 40 they need in 2010, they could dramatically narrow the gap between the parties, giving Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership less room to operate.\The polls are definitely moving in the GOP's direction. Just look at the Real Clear Politics average of the generic ballot question, which asks whether, if the election were held today, you would vote for your local Democratic or Republican candidate for Congress. Democrats have dominated it for the past few years - until now.\In recent weeks, poll after poll has shown Republicans neck and neck, or even ahead, of Democrats. Even a National Public Radio survey found Republicans in the lead. ""There's no question that you're seeing a shift across virtually all the polling,"" says one GOP strategist, ""with Democrats losing ground.""\Rep. Tom Price, the Georgia congressman who heads the House Republican Study Committee, points to what he calls the fatal combination of Democratic overreaching and arrogance. ""I think that means huge gains in the House, with a very distinct possibility of returning Republicans to the majority,"" says Price. ""The American people like checks and balances, and right now they don't see any checks and balances in Washington.""\And what if that happened? Some Obama supporters think it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. ""The truth is, Democratic presidents do better when there's a Republican Congress,"" says the Democratic strategist. ""If there were a Republican Congress, there would be things that are nonstarters.""\Things like a public option in healthcare reform, a massive cap-and-trade energy scheme and all sorts of tax increases. In other words, proposals that are popular with the Democratic base but unpopular with the independent voters who hold the president's fate in their hands. Republican victory might not be so bad for a president with re-election on his mind. With a GOP House, Obama would be tugging the debate toward the left, appealing to independents and keeping his Democratic supporters happy. Not long ago, some Republicans were worried about becoming a permanent minority party. They may not win in 2010, but they feel as if they're back in the game.\Byron York is chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner."
4,"Mississippi's businesses could get a work force boost beginning Oct. 1 from a proposed $43 million program that could create 4,800 jobs.\State leaders announced the Mississippi Steps plan Tuesday during Gov. Haley Barbour's Small Business Forum that drew dozens of people to the Jackson Convention Complex.\The Mississippi Department of Employment Security said it hopes to get approval to to use federal stimulus money to implement the program that would allow employers to be reimbursed for the wages and benefits it provides to new hires.\They would be fully reimbursed for the first two months of a new hire's tenure. After that, it would decrease to 25 percent by the sixth month.\If the new hire leaves, a business wouldn't have to repay the money, said Stan McMorris, MDES' director of customer operations.\It could be exactly what Brian Baker needs as he opens a sushi restaurant in Fondren. He said he could hire more than 20 people for the eatery if the program is implemented.\""It's huge, anytime the state can help out with the first (few) months of labor costs,"" Baker said. ""It's massive.""\Officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are currently reviewing the state's request to begin Mississippi Steps.\Any Mississippi company can participate, and there are no pay limits for each hire as long as the program isn't accounting for a majority of a business' payroll, McMorris said.\Participating businesses must be self-insured and create new jobs, not simply create positions that would replace jobs previously eliminated through layoffs or other measures.\People who could fill the jobs must have a family with at least one child under 18 years of age and have a family income of roughly $55,000 or less.\The only businesses that couldn't take part are those performing illegal or ""controversial"" tasks, McMorris said, citing adult entertainment as an example of the latter.\The money would come from the Department of Health and Human Services.\""These were dollars that were not (being used),"" McMorris said. ""We saw a need.""\But while that program has yet to materialize, Mississippi's small businesses are sure to feel some type of effect from whatever health care or energy legislation emerges from Congress.\William Sahutske is following the heated health care debate and is worried about the effect it could have on his Madison-based pressure washing business.\Any reform that includes new taxes, fines or fees could effectively destroy his business, which has expanded its service area as far as Laurel and Magee despite a work force of just Sahutske and two part-time employees.\""I don't think there's a health care plan (proposed) that would be more affordable to me or my business,"" he said.\Ron Aldridge, director of the National Federation of Independent Business' Mississippi chapter, said the biggest flaw in what's been proposed is that insurance and other health-related costs won't be greatly reduced.\""The status quo in health care is unacceptable for small businesses, but not at any cost,"" he said.\Barbour said the reform also could mean the state would have to pay an extra $80 million to $400 million annually to expand the number of Medicaid recipients in Mississippi from 600,000 to 900,000 people, adding that's money the state simply doesn't have.\Small businesses also could bear the brunt of proposed energy legislation that would reduce the amount of acceptable carbon-dioxide emissions over the next two decades, said Jay Moon, head of the Mississippi Manufacturers Association.\That's especially true in the South, he said, where alternate-fuel resources aren't as readily available as in other parts of the country.\Supporters of the legislation say it will give businesses a legitimate means to reduce emissions and protect the environment.\Passing the ""cap-and-trade"" legislation will mean higher power bills for consumers and more costly products for energy-related businesses because of the expense involved in cutting emissions, Moon said.\""Everyone will pay more for energy,"" he said. ""It taxes everyone in the nation for no (effective change) in greenhouse gas emissions.""\To comment on this story, call Jeff Ayres at (601) 961-7050."
5,"Utility operators and regulators in Mississippi responded with praise and criticism to new carbon emissions reduction proposals announced Monday by the Environmental Protection Agency.\By 2030, the agency wants to cut carbon emissions from power plants nationwide by 30 percent, starting from 2005 emissions levels, and reduce particle pollution, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide by 25 percent.\Doing so would prevent 6,600 premature deaths brought on by harmful emissions released into the air and lower power bills by 8 percent through more efficient use of environmentally friendly electricity, according to EPA.\States will have until 2016, and perhaps a couple of more years after that, to submit individual plans to the EPA outlining how to meet those goals.\""Today's proposal will protect public health, move the United States toward a cleaner environment and fight climate change while supplying Americans with reliable and affordable power,"" the EPA said Monday.\While not having read yet in full the roughly 650-page document outlining the agency's goals, Chuck Barlow, Entergy Corp.'s vice president of environmental strategy and policy, says the proposal has its good points but also areas of concern.\""They're at least giving us a long lead time. It gives states a lot of flexibility,"" he said. ""We're trying to avoid knee-jerk reactions, whether they're positive or negative.""\But a big concern, he said, is whether the EPA will count utilities' nuclear-plant emissions toward the overall emissions goal, a detail he says isn't answered in the proposal. Nuclear facilities like Entergy Mississippi's Grand Gulf plant in Port Gibson don't emit carbon dioxide, Barlow said, adding Entergy Mississippi's overall carbon-emission rate in 2012 was 618 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour, below the federal standard of 662 pounds per megawatt hour.\Mississippi Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley says the proposal as drafted ultimately will be a job-killer, because the plan will prove too expensive for the state's utilities to implement. ""When you have to put environmental controls on a plant, someone will have to pay for it,"" and he fears ratepayers will wind up footing the bill. ""We all want clean air and water, but this is a misguided attempt (to do that). This goes too far.""\He says he will ask fellow PSC members Lynn Posey and Steve Renfroe at today's meeting to begin seeking comments from each other and the state Public Utilities Staff that would constitute an official position from those state agencies on the EPA proposal.\South Mississippi Electric Power Association, a collective of smaller power companies and cooperatives, says it's too early for it to comment on the proposal since it's still reviewing the document, but reiterated the group is dedicated to providing electricity ""that is affordable, reliable and environmentally responsible.""\Officials with Mississippi Power and parent company Southern Co. could not be reached for comment. But a lignite coal plant the utility is building in Kemper County, despite its multiple cost overruns, construction delays and a legal challenge from the Sierra Club, could prove to be the kind of project the EPA has in mind in reducing emissions.\The multibillion-dollar facility would capture 65 percent of the carbon dioxide it emits and store it underground before selling the gas to companies who need it as a raw material.\President Barack Obama has long trumpeted reducing the amount of potentially harmful material released by power plants. Supporters say more eco-friendly energy use will save ratepayers money over time through greater efficiency, while opponents say the EPA is taking too great a role in telling for-profit utilities how to operate. Former Gov. Haley Barbour was among those who testified before Congress against ""cap-and-trade"" legislation that aimed to reduce emissions.\Barlow said he wouldn't be surprised if a utility at some point goes to court to challenge whether the EPA has the authority to impose such broad emissions standards. He gave the agency credit, though, for what he described as a thorough, detailed process in putting the plan together. The agency will accept public comments on its proposal for the next 120 days and will finalize its plans in June 2015.\The White House said Monday that Mississippi already has made inroads, reducing carbon emissions by 10 percent between 2008 and 2011 through various private- and public-sector efforts. Barlow said Entergy since 2000 has capped its emissions at 20 percent of federal emissions-level benchmarks.\Presley says a more logical way forward is tapping into an energy source Mississippi has a lot of -- natural gas. He says the fuel typically generates less carbon dioxide than other energy sources. He'd also like to see more study of wind as a power source in the state.\A study on renewable-energy opportunities in the state from Advance Mississippi, an energy policy group, found wind speed in the state isn't consistent enough to make it a reliable energy source, saying utilities would have to ""obtain wind power from out of state, driving up costs through transmissions expenses, regulatory tariffs and other variables.""\But Presley notes Georgia, with a climate similar to Mississippi's, will soon have a wind farm that could make the source a major energy player in that state.\Contact Jeff Ayres at (601) 961-7050 or jeff.ayres@jackson.gannett.com.

8,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi has joined a Republican boycott of a committee vote on Gina McCarthy's nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency, a move that left the committee's chairwoman ""stunned.""\Republicans said McCarthy, currently the assistant EPA administrator for air and radiation, hasn't adequately answered questions posed by GOP lawmakers on the Environment and Public Works Committee.\""Despite a weak economy and enduring high unemployment, the administration continues to use EPA to push regulations that I fear will put more Americans out of work and at the same time achieve only minimal results, at best,"" Wicker said. ""I'm afraid these harmful regulations will continue under Ms. McCarthy's leadership of the agency.""\""Unfortunately, Ms. McCarthy has done nothing to alleviate those concerns because she has failed to answer a number of transparency concerns which we have with the agency,"" Wicker said.\The committee's chairwoman, Democrat Barbara Boxer of California, said the Republican members' refusal to attend Thursday's vote on McCarthy caught her by surprise.\""I am rather stunned that this has happened,"" she said at the start of the meeting. ""I have never seen a nominee in my life answer more questions than Gina McCarthy has done.""\Only Democratic committee members took their seats for Thursday morning's vote. None of the committee's eight Republicans, including Sens. David Vitter of Louisiana and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, showed up. At least two Republicans needed to show up to constitute a quorum.\Democrats accused Republicans of continuing a pattern of obstructionism.\""Every nominee is entitled to a vote, particularly a nominee like this one,"" Boxer said. ""Denying the president's nominee with this level of experience who's been confirmed by the Senate for the position she now holds is wrong. It's unacceptable.""\Boxer said she already had delayed a committee vote at Vitter's request.\At one point, Boxer noted the empty seat next to her where Vitter usually sits. She raised a water glass and said that in the spirit of friendship she hoped Vitter would join the meeting.\Instead, Vitter, a frequent critic of the EPA who has long complained the agency has a ""dismal"" record of answering questions and providing information, held a news conference in the Capitol.\""These requests are all about openness and transparency and things required by present law,"" said Vitter, the committee's top Republican. ""We're not asking the Obama administration to walk away from their views about carbon or anything else. We are asking for openness and transparency and we are asking that present law be followed in a full and fair and reasonable way.""\Vitter's office said he sent about 400 queries to McCarthy, including questions targeting her position on a carbon tax, greenhouse gas emissions and ethanol.\""Gina McCarthy is not coming in from the outside,"" Vitter said. ""She holds a very significant (EPA) position right now.""\Democrats say Republican lawmakers submitted a total of more than 1,000 questions for McCarthy, an unprecedented number.\They said McCarthy is highly qualified and has worked for Republican and Democratic governors. McCarthy has met with 42 senators in recent weeks, including all the committee members, according to the Environment and Public Works Committee.\Vitter said he met with McCarthy March 20.\Vitter and other Republicans also oppose the nomination of Thomas Perez to head the Labor Department.\""This type of blanket, partisan obstruction used to be unheard of,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""Republicans will use any procedural roadblock or stall tactic available to deny the president qualified nominees.""\Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the GOP boycott ""political theater.""\""Committee Republicans should abandon their obstructionism and allow a vote on this outstanding nominee who has served under Democrats and Republicans to protect our air, water, land and health,"" Beinecke said in a statement.\The conservative Vitter and the liberal Boxer had pledged earlier in the year to work together as much as they could. They even crafted a bipartisan bill to renew the Water Resources Development Act, which authorizes water projects, flood protection and navigation programs.\At one point during Thursday's debate on the WRDA bill, Vitter and Boxer chatted in the back of the chamber as Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana urged colleagues to support an amendment that would delay an increase in flood insurance rates.\Vitter said Thursday's boycott won't affect his work with Democrats on WRDA.

Inside that same room at OLG, local leaders and citizens of Hancock County were discussing how to go about rebuilding our communities in the wake of one of the worst disasters in history. In that Post-Katrina reality, Mississippians came together to make decisions that would pave the way to rebuild our homes, communities and the entire Gulf Coast. In that room is where I decided to run for the Mississippi Legislature.\Our needs in Mississippi are still great over a decade after Katrina and require a similar approach to problem solving, free of politics, at the Mississippi Capitol now.\We have created fewer jobs since 2003 than the amount we have lost.\Our tax base is shrinking as our children graduate from high school and college and move out of state. We lost 3.2 percent of our population to migration between 2014 and 2015.\Mississippi ranks 49th nationally in health outcomes.\We continue to compete for the title of the poorest state in our nation.\Mississippi women are paid $9,289 less annually than what men are paid for the same work.\The poor in Mississippi pay a disproportionate percentage of their income in taxes -- 10.4 percent as compared to 5.3 percent paid by the wealthy.\There are 936 state bridges and 24,591 miles of state roads that aren't able to hold up to the traffic they were designed for. It is estimated the fix will cost $375 million per year.\These problems are indeed grave, but they are not insurmountable. Democrats in the Legislature will work to find common ground with Republicans, but where we cannot find common ground we will stand on our core values.\As most people are aware, a consultant was hired to study our current education funding formula and recommend changes. While we haven't seen those recommendations, everyone assumes there will be an attempt to move away from a district funding model to a per pupil model. Democrats are open to improving the funding formula and agree it should include early education, advanced placement classes and English language dollars. However, in other states where the model was changed to a per pupil scheme, it was merely a precursor to implementing school vouchers. Whatever is ultimately decided to be the best formula, we ought to fully fund public education as if it is really our No. 1 priority. As conservative commentator Bill Crawford has said, ""we need more graduates and we need for more of them to stay in Mississippi.""\During the summer of 2016, our tax structure was studied once again with a view towards reform. Democrats are eager to work with Republicans on tax reform, but any reforms must take into account our already favorable business tax environment. Mississippi already has the ninth lowest state tax burden. We must also ensure the poorest citizens of our state do not see their tax burden increased through slight-of-hand maneuvers described as ""user based,"" ""fairer"" or ""more equitable."" We simply cannot make it more difficult for Mississippi's working families to make ends meet in the name of reform. Yet, we must find a way to address our growing road and bridge crisis.\To put a finer point on this issue of tax burden, in Hancock County 19.8 percent of people live below the poverty line, and the median income is $44,069. These numbers aren't too bad for Mississippi. However, paying for gas for your truck, tractor or boat is an everyday reality for folks in Hancock County. How can the Legislature in good conscience ask the people to bear the entire burden of fixing our infrastructure problems through raising the gas tax after we have just handed out over $500 million in corporate tax breaks? For that reason, Democrats believe the better approach to address our infrastructure issues is to roll back some of the corporate tax cuts, at least until the economy improves.\The proposed Fiscal Year 2018 Mississippi budget reduces spending about $200 million from last year. Agencies such as mental health that were already cut to the bone in the FY 2017 budget stand to suffer more. Mississippi's trauma care fund, once lauded as one of the best in the U.S., has been cut $7 million. K-12 education is underfunded by $173 million. What should be clear to everyone in Mississippi by now is we are on a path that is fiscally unsustainable. We need more revenue, and Democrats are willing to work with Republicans to achieve that goal.\In the 2017 session, Democrats will continue to make the case that Mississippi's problems were not created overnight and, while they can be fixed, they are too big for a single party to fix. We will continue to reach across the aisle to work with Republican leaders where we can. We feel there should be common ground on basic governmental functions such as education, roads and bridges, job creation and support for Mississippi's working men and women. After experiencing the pains of a new super-majority for a year, I trust the Mississippi House will return to operating as ""the Peoples' House"" and take concrete steps to improve the lives of all Mississippians in 2017.\David Baria represents District 122 in the Mississippi House.

10,"Age: 51\Occupation: Attorney and state senator\Political affiliation: Republican\A second-term state senator, Doty, of Brookhaven, also has a civil law practice. A mother of three, Doty touts her commitment to family, legislative experience and an A rating from the National Rifle Association. Doty has, in a short time, become a leader in the Mississippi Legislature, is chairwoman of the Energy Committee and handles key bills and helps set state budgets.\If you would like to see federal spending cut, where would you make such cuts?\Funding for SNAP (food stamps), which increased dramatically under the Obama administration, abolish the Department of Education and block grant the savings to the states. Beyond cuts, we need a shift in priorities. For example, the federal gas tax is supposedly for roads and bridges. However, much of that money is being used for walking trails, light rail projects and other non-critical needs. A recommitment of those dollars for critical infrastructure is essential.\Conversely, are there areas where you would like to see federal spending increased?\We need a border wall to stop illegal immigration, and simultaneously transform our legal immigration system. We also must continue building up our defense. Our military is now training not just to fight terrorists, but for peer-to-peer combat against powerful militaries. Not only must we devote more resources for our military, it's also apparent that closing training bases, like those we have here, is out of the question.\Do you agree with President Trump's tariff policy, and how do you believe it would affect Mississippi?\I support President Trump's effort to renegotiate trade deals. However, I believe tariffs should be used very sparingly. I'm committed to ensuring Mississippians, particularly our farmers, are not adversely impacted by any tariff policy. I further believe Congress should reaffirm its traditional role in trade issues.\What are your thoughts on U.S. immigration policy and border security?\I support a building a wall to curb illegal immigration. I support rethinking our current legal immigration system. Mississippi's agriculture industry, for instance, needs access to workers, and I will not support anything that will adversely affect our state's largest industry. But it's clear border security has reached a critical juncture. Nations can't exist without borders, and we must reaffirm the integrity of ours.\What, if any, plans do you have to reduce health care costs for Mississippians?\We must incorporate more telemedicine and commit to rural broadband development. To address costs, we should enable insurers to cross state lines to provide a more competitive environment. Another helpful strategy would be enabling the VA to reimburse local doctors, saving our veterans long trips and waits for care.\Would you agree to cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, SNAP or other social welfare programs?\Social Security and Medicare ARE NOT entitlements! They were paid for by payroll deductions and the government owes them back. Yet, Medicare and SNAP rightfully exist as a way to help those who truly can't help themselves. President Obama acted to expand those programs beyond their scope. Today 25 percent of Mississippians are on Medicaid. That's unsustainable, and we've got to refocus those programs on their original intent.\What, if anything, should the federal government do to help with states' infrastructure and how should we pay for it?\I would act to reorient federal gas tax dollars toward critical infrastructure, their original purpose. Then I would move to rethink the allocation formulas for Mississippi's rural counties, many of which can't afford to maintain essential infrastructure. This is an economic issue, a safety issue and a basic obligation government has to its citizens."
11,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
12,"Small businesses backbone of state, and nation knows it \MISSISSIPPI'S business community has a reason to hold its head high. \In recent months, corporate scandals, a sagging stock market and increased scrutiny of public companies have led the news, but it's the small business person that is making headlines this time. \Mississippi is in the top 10 in the nation for small business survival. \When you consider that half of all small businesses fail within four years, this bodes well for the Magnolia State. \According to the Small Business Survival Committee, states are ranked based on each individual state's policies toward small business and entrepreneurship. \Mississippi is ranked ninth in the nation on the committee's Small Business Survival Index 2002. \The state, according to SBSC president Darrell McKigney, benefits from no tax on in-state capital gains and no added death tax. \Also the corporate income taxes, property taxes, the unemployment tax and the gas tax in Mississippi are beneficial to small businesses. \""When it gets its policy mix right, a state is well positioned to compete both nationally and globally, with policies geared to help economic growth accelerate, incomes increase, and job creation improve,"" SBSC chief economist Raymond Keating said. \SBA, MDA help \While favorable governmental guidelines exist, Mississippi also benefits from other factors, said Janita Stewart, district director for the Small Business Administration for Mississippi. \""The state presents a business friendly environment,"" Stewart said. \There are 53,509 small businesses in Mississippi, according to the SBA. \There are an additional 106,000 people who are self-employed, Stewart said. \The SBA helps provide resources for businesses, including loans. \""It is a program that is designed to help people stay in business, grow and prosper,"" Stewart said. \According to Bob Rohrlack, executive director of the Mississippi Development Authority, the state is positioned to provide a good return on investment for the entrepreneur. \""The whole state is an incubator for small businesses,"" he said. ""A lot of small businesses here grow into bigger businesses, which creates more businesses and more jobs."" \Rohrlack said the MDA's job is to implement programs that help businesses train and find workers, and provide other benefits that help ensure success. \And he was pleased to hear of the state's ranking. \""It shows the programs we have are on the right track and we are moving in the right direction,"" Rohrlack said. \Strong networks \The only areas that the state failed to score well on the survival index were sales, gross receipts and the number of government bureaucrats. \The low sales and gross receipts are likely a result of the state's small population. \But on the other hand, that small population probably goes a long way in helping business succeed because of the support that comes from friends and neighbors. \""The network systems we have here pay off,"" Stewart said. ""I am one of those people who was educated here and stayed here, and businesses need the support of the people here. \""That support is important for the success rate and survival rate."" \As for the abundance of government bureaucrats ? if we could do something about that, small business wouldn't be the only ones to benefit. \n \Contact Business Editor Scott Waller at (601) 961-7235 or e-mail swaller@ clarionledger.com.\BUSINESS; Scott Waller; Pg. 1C"
13,"As our nation's infrastructure ages, the evidence of the decline is obvious, and more importantly, the effect is felt on a daily basis. That's why it is easy for governors operating in a bipartisan way to stand together on matters of infrastructure investment.\As the elected leaders of Louisiana and Mississippi — two small, rural states — we are pleased and thankful President Donald Trump has started a national conversation on infrastructure with his proposal. We believe infrastructure is a critical factor to the economic success of our states, and if implemented properly, it will not only create jobs but bring value to our citizens and build communities unlike this country has seen in decades. As such, there are at least three points worth mentioning:\The investment in our infrastructure is long overdue and will translate to growing the economy.\Investing in rural communities with local decision-making is good for the nation; however, any match greater than the current 80-20 split will be difficult for most rural communities to provide.\A common-sense approach to implementing governmental processes saves time and allows for more money to be invested in infrastructure.\Our states are connected at nearly 20 locations, five of them being major routes of commerce and connectivity. Southern rural states such as Louisiana and Mississippi are connected to larger regions of the national economy by the Interstate 10 and Interstate 20 corridors crossing the Mississippi River. The interstates and the river are essential for multimodal commerce beyond the limits of our states. In fact, we consider I-10 to be the front porch to the Gulf of Mexico and ultimately the world as it leads to two of the world's largest ports.\Our states' and the nation's economy stand to benefit from the improved preservation of highways and a strategic focus on expanding capacity of our interstate system. The president's commitment to investing $1.5 trillion is refreshing and welcome news to the congested corridors in Mississippi and Louisiana.\The rural network we share is essential for commerce because it connects the farm-to-market economies of the Gulf South with other macro economies through the vast port systems on our respective shores. This connectivity is solidified through roads, rails, runways and rivers, all of which are critical to our individual and collective success.\The president's infrastructure proposal validates the struggles governors, mayors and local business and industrial leaders are facing in rural communities in our states. This plan demonstrates a commitment to improving rural infrastructure through a block grant process that prioritizes community needs while engaging local leaders.\A large percentage of rural state highways in this region serves as the backbone of an agriculture network that fuels and feeds the world. From timber to mining natural resources, including oil and natural gas production and recreational activities, the citizens of this nation depend on this region to maintain their lifestyle.\With such a large rural system, a majority of our state's preservation budget is allocated to rural roads and bridges.\Over the past five years in Louisiana, 54 percent of the capital preservation budget has been used for rural roads, with 46 percent allocated for urban roads. In Mississippi, typically 55 percent of the DOT's capital preservation budget is expended on rural roads and bridges.\Since 2012, more than 25 states have addressed their funding issues by modernizing their gas tax structure or rates, and for various reasons, our states have not followed that path; thus, we are dependent on federal support.\We work hard to maximize the spending potential of the dollars our citizens entrust to their state governments. There are no shortages of examples where an accelerated and streamlined environmental permitting process would result in moving a project from concept to construction in a more efficient and expedited fashion. Therefore, we see value in accelerating the environmental process such that we spend less of our dollars on process and more on actually building and repairing infrastructure our citizens can use in their daily lives.\Mississippi and Louisiana take pride in our natural riches and will always protect our environment, but we agree a common-sense approach to decision-making is better for the public and the bottom line.\The president's infrastructure plan is not perfect, nor will it solve all of the nation's infrastructure needs, but if acted on by Congress, it promises to restore confidence in our nation's infrastructure, shores up our global competitiveness, and create jobs, while strengthening the economy for both rural and urban communities.\Phil Bryant is governor of Mississippi.

16,"Proponents of solar energy kicked off a daylong awareness celebration in Jackson Saturday, beginning with the unveiling of the city's largest solar energy system.\The new 32-kilowatt system at Robert Smith's Central Mississippi Health Services, developed by the Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Association, Joule Energy and Mississippi-based Sundial Solar Power Developers, is designed to produce a significant portion of the facility's energy needs for more than 25 years.\Smith said the cost-efficient innovation will alleviate uncertain, but rising health care costs.\""With rising health care costs in all parameters, CMHS is always looking for ways to increase services to our target population,"" Smith said. ""This is an excellent, environmentally friendly project that is important to our environment and to controlling costs.""\The celebration then moved to Ridgeland, where a Solar Energy Expo was held at Northpark mall.\C. Tucker Crawford, GSREIA president, said Saturday's celebration followed the opening of Stion Solar's 100-megawatt solar panel production facility in Hattiesburg. The production line is the first phase $500 million investment that will create 1,000 jobs over the next six years.\Another solar panel manufacturer, Twin Creeks Solar, opened its production facility in Senatobia in May. The $175 million investment will create 500 jobs over the next five years.\Crawford said the expo served to raise public awareness about renewable energy as well as highlight Mississippi's efforts to engage its natural resources.\""A lot of people don't understand solar energy, but most are very interested. They're thirsting for it,"" Crawford said.\Public interest is spurred by the prospect of lower utility bills, said Jill Mastrototaro, senior field organizing manager at the Sierra Club, a grass-roots environmental organization.\""Given the economic situation for most families, people need to try to save where they can,"" she said. ""Mississippi obviously has the resources, the technology and the know-how for solar industry.""\Mastrototaro is based in New Orleans, and said GSREIA is urging Mississippians to call their legislators and push for similar solar power rebates, tax credits and incentives adopted in Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina. She added every resident should have the right to claim sun, wind and water to power his or her home or business.\""If we can do it in Louisiana, we can certainly do it in Mississippi,"" she said.\Crawford said Mississippi has made great strides in solar energy, among them a net metering rule nearing completion at the state Public Service Commission.\Net metering allows solar, wind, biomass and other renewable energy systems to connect to the utility grid and receive payment or credit for their excess energy production. Net metering is currently law in 46 states.\The day concluded with GSREIA's September general meeting at the Hilton Jackson.

17,"When Brandon Presley was elected to the Mississippi Public Service Commission in 2007, he said, he couldn't have found a solar farm ""with a SWAT team and a search warrant.""\A decade later, Mississippi is one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the United States, according to GTM Research. The state's public service commission approved several solar projects this summer, and the state is expected to gain more than 700 megawatts of solar capacity over the next five years.\One of its newest projects is a 52-megawatt solar farm near Hattiesburg. A partnership between Mississippi Power, the state's largest utility, and Silicon Ranch, a solar energy company based in Nashville, Tennessee, the 450-acre solar farm will eventually power 6,500 homes.\""I think everybody wants to be more energy independent, and that's part of the public buzz around the solar industry in our state,"" Presley said.\Combined, the Southern states would equal the sixth-largest greenhouse gas-emitting country in the world, said Michael Vandenbergh, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. But that argument doesn't resonate in many conservative areas. ""People associate climate mitigation with big government, and that's particularly true in the South,"" he said.\What is resonating with utility companies like Mississippi Power and communities like Hattiesburg is the economic argument for cheaper solar power.\Despite the lack of renewable-energy-friendly policies and the reluctance from Republican-led state legislatures to address climate change, states across the South and Appalachia regions that voted heavily for Donald Trump are rapidly expanding their solar markets.\Most of that growth has come from utilities investing in large-scale solar projects, which have dropped in price by nearly 80 percent since 2010 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, making them more cost-competitive with coal and natural gas. There's also a grassroots rooftop solar movement in coal-friendly communities, encouraged by cheap technology and a push for energy independence.\To get communities, investors and utilities on board, renewable energy companies like Silicon Ranch have focused on the economic benefits of clean energy, rather than climate science or environmental regulations.\""Climate change is never coming up in any development activity [conversations],"" said Matt Beasley, chief marketing officer of Silicon Ranch. ""It's not a talking point it's always about economics.""\When Silicon Ranch was founded in 2011, the idea that a national solar energy company could survive and thrive in Nashville, while the rest of the industry was based in California and the Southwest, ""was unimaginable,"" Beasley said. But the young team focused its efforts in the sunny Southeast, states with plenty of solar power potential.\Since then, utilities around the country have closed an increasing number of aging coal-fired generators, and wind and solar have become the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the U.S. It's partly due to tax credits for clean energy industries that Congress extended in 2015, which are supposed to phase out in the 2020s. Rural states also got help from an Obama-era Department of Agriculture program called the Rural Energy for America Program, which gave more than $280 million in funding for rural solar projects in 2015 and 2016.\With the help of initiatives like these, Silicon Ranch has spent the last six years working with a variety of corporate and utility clients across the South to develop large-scale projects, including a military contractor in Arkansas; Volkswagen's facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee; and one of Georgia's largest solar farms. By the end of 2017, Silicon Ranch will have utility-scale projects in 14 states.\The projects have worked well, Beasley said, in part because of Silicon Ranch's relationships with regional utilities and public service commissions, as well as local schools, small businesses and communities around the solar projects.\Rather than building the projects and then handing them over to utility companies to manage, Silicon Ranch owns and operates each one. ""In our own backyard, that's meaningful,"" Beasley said. ""We're developing relationships with economic development authorities, saying we will be here for 25, 30 years or more.""\Many of the company's 30 employees spend a lot of time on the ground in places like Mississippi and Georgia, discussing the economics of solar with conservative public service commissions and utility companies.\""When we're dealing with utilities in the Southeast in particular, they talk about economic goals and their plans to diversify energy sources,"" Beasley said. ""But at the end of the day, it's about delivering low-cost power that doesn't impact their ratepayers.""\In Alabama, solar energy makes up less than half a percent of the state's electricity generation. But, like Mississippi, it has been scaling up its efforts: more than 100 megawatts were installed last year, and more projects are planned for the coming years.\Most of that growth similar to the rest of the Southeast is from utility-scale projects, which are expanding in every corner of the region. North Carolina now has the second-largest solar market in the U.S. behind California, and Georgia added more than 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) in 2016 and had a cumulative total of about 1.5 gigawatts, largely because Georgia Power is growing its solar footprint.\""In contrast to the belief of some regulators and utilities, solar is cost-effective in the South right now,"" said Daniel Tait, CEO of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for renewable energy policy. ""If it wasn't, utilities wouldn't be doing it just for the fun of it.""\Utilities have become interested in diversifying their energy portfolio with renewables as the costs fall, rather than investing in the coal industry a stark contrast to the rhetoric from the Trump administration.\According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the growth of the solar market was driven by utilities in 2016, and utilities are expected to provide two-thirds of the 13 gigawatts of solar capacity forecast to be added for this year.

18,"When Brandon Presley was elected to the Mississippi Public Service Commission in 2007, he said, he couldn't have found a solar farm ""with a SWAT team and a search warrant.""\A decade later, Mississippi is one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the United States, according to GTM Research. The state's public service commission approved several solar projects this summer, and the state is expected to gain more than 700 megawatts of solar capacity over the next five years.\One of its newest projects is a 52-megawatt solar farm near Hattiesburg. A partnership between Mississippi Power, the state's largest utility, and Silicon Ranch, a solar energy company based in Nashville, Tennessee, the 450-acre solar farm will eventually power 6,500 homes.\""I think everybody wants to be more energy independent, and that's part of the public buzz around the solar industry in our state,"" Presley said.\Combined, the Southern states would equal the sixth-largest greenhouse gas-emitting country in the world, said Michael Vandenbergh, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. But that argument doesn't resonate in many conservative areas. ""People associate climate mitigation with big government, and that's particularly true in the South,"" he said.\What is resonating with utility companies like Mississippi Power and communities like Hattiesburg is the economic argument for cheaper solar power.\Despite the lack of renewable-energy-friendly policies and the reluctance from Republican-led state legislatures to address climate change, states across the South and Appalachia regions that voted heavily for Donald Trump are rapidly expanding their solar markets.\Most of that growth has come from utilities investing in large-scale solar projects, which have dropped in price by nearly 80 percent since 2010 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, making them more cost-competitive with coal and natural gas. There's also a grassroots rooftop solar movement in coal-friendly communities, encouraged by cheap technology and a push for energy independence.\To get communities, investors and utilities on board, renewable energy companies like Silicon Ranch have focused on the economic benefits of clean energy, rather than climate science or environmental regulations.\""Climate change is never coming up in any development activity [conversations],"" said Matt Beasley, chief marketing officer of Silicon Ranch. ""It's not a talking point it's always about economics.""\When Silicon Ranch was founded in 2011, the idea that a national solar energy company could survive and thrive in Nashville, while the rest of the industry was based in California and the Southwest, ""was unimaginable,"" Beasley said. But the young team focused its efforts in the sunny Southeast, states with plenty of solar power potential.\Since then, utilities around the country have closed an increasing number of aging coal-fired generators, and wind and solar have become the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the U.S. It's partly due to tax credits for clean energy industries that Congress extended in 2015, which are supposed to phase out in the 2020s. Rural states also got help from an Obama-era Department of Agriculture program called the Rural Energy for America Program, which gave more than $280 million in funding for rural solar projects in 2015 and 2016.\With the help of initiatives like these, Silicon Ranch has spent the last six years working with a variety of corporate and utility clients across the South to develop large-scale projects, including a military contractor in Arkansas; Volkswagen's facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee; and one of Georgia's largest solar farms. By the end of 2017, Silicon Ranch will have utility-scale projects in 14 states.\The projects have worked well, Beasley said, in part because of Silicon Ranch's relationships with regional utilities and public service commissions, as well as local schools, small businesses and communities around the solar projects.\Rather than building the projects and then handing them over to utility companies to manage, Silicon Ranch owns and operates each one. ""In our own backyard, that's meaningful,"" Beasley said. ""We're developing relationships with economic development authorities, saying we will be here for 25, 30 years or more.""\Many of the company's 30 employees spend a lot of time on the ground in places like Mississippi and Georgia, discussing the economics of solar with conservative public service commissions and utility companies.\""When we're dealing with utilities in the Southeast in particular, they talk about economic goals and their plans to diversify energy sources,"" Beasley said. ""But at the end of the day, it's about delivering low-cost power that doesn't impact their ratepayers.""\In Alabama, solar energy makes up less than half a percent of the state's electricity generation. But, like Mississippi, it has been scaling up its efforts: more than 100 megawatts were installed last year, and more projects are planned for the coming years.\Most of that growth similar to the rest of the Southeast is from utility-scale projects, which are expanding in every corner of the region. North Carolina now has the second-largest solar market in the U.S. behind California, and Georgia added more than 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) in 2016 and had a cumulative total of about 1.5 gigawatts, largely because Georgia Power is growing its solar footprint.\""In contrast to the belief of some regulators and utilities, solar is cost-effective in the South right now,"" said Daniel Tait, CEO of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for renewable energy policy.

19,"The Sierra Club of Mississippi and Mississippi Power Co. are ending their dispute over the company's roughly $5.2 billion Kemper power plant that has lagged behind construction schedule and is beset with costly overruns.\The environmental group and utility giant announced a settlement Monday. It will end a 6-year-old legal battle in which the Sierra Club was seeking to block the coal-fired generating plant in east-central Mississippi.\Part of the settlement calls for Mississippi Power to establish a $15 million grant for an energy efficiency and renewable energy program with the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community Foundation to help low-income residents insulate homes and help provide grants to schools to put in solar panels. Mississippi Power also agrees to stop burning coal at two plants in Mississippi and one in Alabama.\The Sierra Club will withdraw all pending legal and regulatory challenges against the Kemper plant, including its appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court of the state Public Service Commission's decision to ease restrictions on the plant.\Sierra Club attorney Robert Wiygul of Ocean Springs said Monday that after lengthy litigation, it's at a point now that the Kemper plant is largely constructed.\The cost of the plant has ballooned, from $2.8 billion to more than $5 billion, and construction is behind schedule. The plant was slated for completion in May but isn't expected to open now until sometime in 2015. The company forfeited $133 million in federal tax credits by missing the May deadline.\""This settlement will allow the Sierra Club to do some things it does best: Help clean up the air and help the people most affected by the rate increase,"" Wiygul said.\Also, Mississippi Power won't oppose a net metering rule under consideration by the Mississippi Public Service Commission. Net metering allows residential and commercial customers to get billing credit for the electricity they generate from solar power that goes back into the grid system of the power company.\""I think this is a huge victory,"" Sierra Club of Mississippi Director Louie Miller said of the settlement. ""...We think it is a win, win for the state.""\Mississippi Power will no longer use coal at the Watson plant near Gulfport, converting its two remaining coal-fired units to natural gas no later than April 16, 2015. The plant already has three units that operate on natural gas.\At the Sweatt plant near Meridian, the company commits to retire two of the existing natural gas units, repower with more advanced technology or convert to an alternative non fossil-fuel source, no later than Dec. 31, 2018.\And at the Greene County plant in Demopolis, Alabama, Mississippi Power will cease coal operations and convert two units to natural gas no later than April 16, 2016.\""Our first priority has always been ensuring plans are in the best interest of our customers and the environment, which also means that the decisions we make must ensure we are providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers,"" said Mississippi Power President Ed Holland. ""We believe we have developed a solution that supports all of the above.""\During former Gov. Haley Barbour's administration, a law was passed allowing Mississippi Power to increase rates to help pay for the Kemper plant, which has been touted as a modeled clean-coal plant.\Mississippi Power Co. announced the company would pay future cost overruns on the plant after the last rate increase.\Public Service Commissioner Lynn Posey said last week at the Neshoba County Fair that he still believes the Kemper plant will be a good investment for the state. He acknowledged the cost overruns, but said Mississippi Power will bear the additional costs.\Contact Jimmie E. Gates at jgates@jackson.gannett.com or (601) 961-7212. Follow @jgatesnews on Twitter."
20,"The sun drenches the earth with enormous energy potential. It's often reported that enough solar energy hits the earth every hour to meet all the earth's power needs for a year. If we could efficiently tap even a tiny fraction of that energy, it could make us truly energy-independent. Since Mississippi is generally a sunny state, getting at least some power from the sun is beginning to become a real possibility.\Technology has improved steadily since the first efforts to convert sunlight into usable power more than 150 years ago. Early efforts used mirrors to focus sunlight, heating a liquid and driving a turbine, and that technology is now in use in places around the globe. But in recent decades, much of the industry is focused on improving photovoltaic (PV) arrays, which turn sunlight directly into electricity.\Mississippi's electric utilities have been involved in pilot projects to test and demonstrate the feasibility of solar power. Entergy has rolled out three ""solar farm"" projects in DeSoto, Hinds and Lincoln counties, while Mississippi Power has three solar projects in Gulfport, Hattiesburg and Sumrall. These facilities have large solar panels installed over several acres, collecting energy from the sun and turning it into usable electricity.\But for many owners of homes and businesses, the dream is to generate power on your rooftop or backyard. Thanks to a 2015 ""net-metering"" rule from the Mississippi Public Service Commission, you can potentially sell your excess power back to the power company. There's even a way to check your rooftop's potential for generating electricity by installing solar panels. Google's ""Project Sunroof"" allows you to put in your address, and it will show you approximately how much sunlight hits your roof, how much area you have available to install solar panels and rough estimates of how much it would cost.\It all sounds pretty exciting, and it is. However, there's a big caveat in all of this: Although the efficiency of solar technology is getting better and it's environmentally friendly, it's still expensive. In many cases, it won't make economic sense for the near future. (The Google tool said I'd lose thousands over the long term, assuming current prices.) But that hasn't stopped companies from marketing and selling solar equipment and services, and understanding how to navigate the process is complicated. That's why Attorney General Jim Hood's office recently rolled out a publication called the Consumer's Guide to Solar Power in Mississippi.\""Renewable energy -- including solar power -- can be beneficial to the environment while providing a costs savings for the consumer,"" Hood said in a news release. ""It is critical to determine whether the investment for the renewal energy in a solar system is the right choice for your home or business. This guide offers tips and resources to help make that determination.""\The guide is full of all sorts of advice, including questions to ask, how to check out a business, financial considerations, and description of the various financing options. Generally, owners of homes or businesses can purchase a system outright or lease it, and there are a lot of factors involved in that decision. For example, you should consider how long it will take the equipment to pay for itself. Usually, this takes several years; in some cases, it won't. And although there are numerous tax incentives and credits for installing solar-power systems, understanding them can be complex.\It's also important to thoroughly check out the contractor or dealer you're considering; Hood noted that nearby states have experienced problems with licensing of solar contractors. For example, Solar Industry magazine reports that consumers in Austin, Texas, were solicited last year by door-to-door salesmen selling solar-power systems, using the lure of incentives to get customers to sign up. The local electric utility, Austin Energy, accused the Utah-based company that had hired the salesmen of claiming to represent the utility, when in fact, it didn't. (For its part, the company denied the allegations.)\In other unrelated cases, consumers reported they'd been approached by salesmen who tried to sell products with predatory financing terms. In any case, if you're approached by someone trying to sell you a system, get multiple estimates, and carefully consider your options. Don't allow yourself to be pressured into making a decision.\You can download a copy of the guide at http://bit.ly/2rMwrFe.\Contact Bill Moak at moakconsumer@gmail.com.\Bill\Moak\Consumer Watch"
