There is a widely held belief in Wyoming that if the private sector can't do it, it probably shouldn't be done. As a state legislator said recently, commenting on a decision of the Wyoming Business Council, ""We ought to have free enterprise doing these things instead of government involvement."" This belief reflects some of our most treasured values: our self-reliance, our resourcefulness, our individualism. Even our most dedicated government officials share this belief. A former state senator and senior State Department official once in conversation contrasted the lethargy of the process by which governments ""exchange talking points"" with the ""resourcefulness, ingenuity, and creativity"" of the private sector.
\
All this is true, but it is only part of the story. This country was not built by the private sector alone. The transcontinental railroad and the agricultural extension service, two examples, show how public-private partnerships could jump-start the free enterprise system.
\
Today, the information technology revolution presents new challenges to channel our increased productivity to meet public needs. We will stifle those sources of productivity through overtaxation , fiscal insolvency or both, if we place too heavy a burden on the public sector to meet those needs. Public-private sector partnerships can play a critical role in mobilizing private resources to help fill these public needs, while enhancing the productivity of the private sector itself.
\
Businesses seeking to enter the market in today's competitive environment need access to communications and transportation capabilities that may exceed their resources. That is the value of concentrating these resources within a centralized infrastructure that provides these facilities. The Wyoming State Loan and Investment Board has recently recognized this value by approving $15 million in grants for business and industrial parks in Laramie County and Cheyenne and a $2 million loan for the conversion of a former Amoco facility in Casper.
\
These are the kinds of public sector investments that enhance the productivity and job-creating potential of the private sector.
\
A clean energy infrastructure is also key to our state's economy. One opportunity for productivity growth and energy savings is presented by using natural gas as a transportation fuel. Natural gas vehicles, however, are an ""infant industry,"" in the sense that both vehicles and a fueling infrastructure are comparatively few in numbers. Moreover, the one depends upon the other. Without vehicles, the fueling stations will not be built; but without fueling stations, people will not buy the vehicles.
\
This is the kind of stalemate a public-private partnership can resolve. The Business Council has responded by allocating $1 million toward the private sector development of fueling stations in Jackson and Afton. Another way in which the public and private sector can be mutually supportive is through policy frameworks that encourage the private sector to step up to help meet public sector needs. A good example of how this works is California's adoption of a 33 percent standard for renewable energy by the year 2020. This requirement creates a significant opportunity for private sector investors to develop and transmit sources of wind power in Wyoming to help meet California's renewable energy needs.
\
That potential market for Wyoming's wind power would not exist without California's standard. But utilities and other suppliers of electricity in California first have to be convinced of the benefits of wind power transmitted from Wyoming in boosting in-state sources of renewable energy to meet that demand. The health care exchanges established through the Affordable Care Act are another example of a policy framework which helps to elicit a private sector response to a public sector need. Wyoming had an opportunity under the act to set up a statewide exchange but declined to do so. As provided by law, the federal government then countered with its own alternative. Over 3,500 residents who would not otherwise have access to group health insurance plans have now enrolled in plans offered by the two private sector carriers.
\
Wyoming owes the success of its coal industry to another policy framework. In 1991, Congress reauthorized the Clean Air Act to include a market-based approach to the regulation of sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, called ""cap-and-trade."" By putting an industry-wide ""cap"" on sulfur dioxide emissions and then letting the electric utility industry figure out the most efficient means of meeting these targets on a plant-by-plant basis, the law achieved a four-fold reduction in these acid-rain-causing emissions at a fraction of the estimated cost. Wyoming's coal became instantly more attractive as a result of its lower sulfur content.
\
In 2009, Congress tried to extend this market-based approach to the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. Here was another opportunity for the coal and electric utility industries to buy in to a policy framework that was in their own long-term interest. But this time these industries balked. As a result, the legislation failed, and the U.S. was left with no climate or energy policy.
\
This failure to forge a larger national public-private partnership to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants then ricocheted down to the failure of numerous individual partnerships, including that between GE and the state to build a coal-gasification test facility for Powder River Basin coals. Unfortunately, the policy framework now imposed by EPA to control these emissions in the absence of the market-based approach has been one of the factors that have brought the construction of new coal-fired power plants to a standstill, to Wyoming's detriment.
\
The productivity gains of the information technology revolution are now starting to come at the expense of job creation and growth. To sustain job growth into the future, we must find new ways to harness this revolution to meet public sector needs. Public-private sector partnerships provide a source of institutional innovation to respond to this opportunity. If we take the time to learn from our successes and failures, Wyoming may be able to take the lead in showing how to seize this opportunity.

But it's unlikely that the stalled legislation would have meant much for Wyoming's coal industry in today's clean-coal environment.
\
By Bill McCarthy
\
bmccarthy@wyomingnews.com
\
CHEYENNE - Both of Wyoming's U.S. senators voted to stall energy legislation on Friday, a move that successfully halted House legislation passed Thursday.
\
""He thinks it is an anti-energy bill,"" said Elly Pickering, press secretary for U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.
\
Greg Keeley, communications director for U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Barrasso also voted to stall the bill.
\
Pickering said Enzi objected to the bill because it ""would still mean higher prices at the pump"" and threaten jobs.
\
Keeley said Barrasso also was concerned about jobs and that the bill didn't do enough to create a path to a clean-coal industry.
\
Senate Republicans blocked Democrats from voting on the proposed legislation, which the president had threatened to veto, according to reports from The Associated Press.
\
The vote was 53-42, seven short of the number needed to bring up the bill passed Thursday by the House of Representatives.
\
Democrats must renegotiate with Republicans, a process that is likely to result in a pared-back energy bill.
\
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he expects to hold a vote on a new bill as soon as next week following negotiations this weekend, according to the AP.
\
Republican lawmakers, as well as the White House, have been most critical of $13.5 billion in taxes imposed on the five biggest oil companies under the House-passed bill.
\
Republicans also objected to a requirement for utilities to produce 15 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources like wind, solar or biofuels.
\
The proposed energy legislation contained little to help Wyoming's coal industry in a carbon-constrained world.
\
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that scientists say contributes to global warming.
\
Wyoming is the top coal producing state in the nation and heavily dependent on severance taxes for government revenue.
\
Greenhouse gas restrictions could impede the coal industry, which is the top producer of electricity in the United States.
\
The proposed energy legislation contained some incentives for research and development of carbon sequestration technologies. Those types of technologies would isolate the carbon dioxide produced when burning coal and store it in a manner that does not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, such as putting it underground.
\
See ENERGY, page A5
\
State officials say that all Wyoming residents should be concerned about the future of coal as an energy source because the state's economy and state government revenues are so dependent on it.
\
People in counties like Laramie County that are not producing energy should care about carbon sequestration technologies and keeping coal viable in the future for other reasons as well, said Keeley.
\
""If we don't keep coal viable in the future, there will be a dramatic increase of 40 to 50 percent in electricity bills for people in Laramie (County) and all over Wyoming,"" he said in an e- mail. ""Energy companies would be forced to switch to the more expensive option of natural gas and pass the increased costs on to all Wyoming residents.""
\
Gov. Dave Freudenthal has said that if the federal government does not establish such things as the definition of a carbon credit, which would assign a monetary value to a measure of carbon dioxide, little can be done to advance and implement carbon sequestration technologies.
\
This week Barrasso successfully amended climate change legislation, winning votes on two key amendments in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's markup of the Warner- Lieberman climate legislation.
\
That legislation would establish carbon credits and a ""cap-and- trade"" system where those credits are capped at a certain amount and then allowed to be traded - bought and sold - among those who produce emissions.
\
Barrasso's amendments would create Rocky Mountain Centers for Coal Utilization at the University of Wyoming and Montana State University. The bill authorizes ""such sums as may be necessary"" for the Rocky Mountain Centers.
\
""This allows us to secure the necessary funds from federal coffers to build the centers. The next step is to secure the funding via the congressional appropriations process,"" Keeley said.
\
Barrasso's amendments also would allow emission allowances given to Wyoming to be sold on the open market and the funds to be used for whatever the state needs - including emergency services such as ambulances and fire trucks, Keeley said.
\
The bill originally said any new coal-fired power plants had to capture 85 percent of their carbon emissions. Barrasso's amendment lowered that target to 65 percent for plants built before 2018 and to 85 percent for plants built after 2018.
\
The industry said it could not meet the 85 percent capture rate, Keeley said.

Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead's vow to ""double down"" on the state's efforts to prop up the beleaguered coal industry reminds me of a racehorse owner who refuses to take the blinders off his most treasured steed.
\
The former champion is getting passed left and right in every race it runs, but the strategy never changes as its losses mount.
\
In the case of coal, the governor and other state leaders are also wearing blinders and ignoring not only the reality of what's happening to the industry, but the low probability that Wyoming's expensive, long-shot plan to save it could succeed. Meanwhile, other states that have come to grips with the need to invest significant resources in renewable energy are destined to have a much brighter future.
\
Stakes are higher Of course, the economic stakes are much higher for Wyoming and the coal industry than anywhere else: The state produces 40 percent of the coal used to generate electricity in the nation. Tax revenue from coal, oil and gas pay for about 70 percent of operating state government.
\
Wyoming politicians and the coal industry are in a symbiotic relationship - both have so much to gain by maintaining coal production that neither will surrender the power and riches they have accumulated without an intense fight. Despite the real need to cut CO2 emissions to combat climate change, officials in Wyoming are trying to sell the notion that the coal industry could bounce back in better shape than ever - if only the right politics and policies were in place.
\
As they gun for a new international export industry, Wyoming officials also stand ready to support coal conversion technologies, which they believe is the best bet to keep the coal industry viable in Wyoming long-term. That's why Mead and legislators continue to push for an energy industrial complex in southwest Wyoming that would include converting coal into higher-value chemical products.
\
But this strategy ignores the fact that pressures on the industry and economic conditions are much different in both Canada and China - where such complexes are being built - than they are in the United States.
\
Stock prices for Wyoming's top coal producers have tanked. WyoFile reported that shares of Alpha Natural Resources that sold for more than $65 in 2011 traded for 33 cents on the New York Stock Exchange last month. Arch Coal Inc. traded at 22 cents on Monday compared to nearly $36 four years ago. Both companies face massive debt payments in the near future.
\
It's not impossible that restructuring their debt could see both companies reverse their fortunes, or that a better-positioned owner could operate the mines more profitably. Still, corporations in such a debilitating monetary condition have to worry about reducing their bottom lines, and don't have the funds to sink into developing new technology. Private investors view coal as a terrible risk, and the industry can't expect government to bail it out, particularly when the chance of success is so low.
\
The odds are so stacked now against the coal industry in Wyoming, it's hard to know where to start listing the pitfalls.
\
Coal production dropped 7.6 percent in the past year. Markets for coal have continued to shrink as older coal-fired plants have been taken off-line. The coal industry was successful in defeating cap-and-trade, the Obama administration's initial attempt to reduce greenhouse gases, but it will be more harder to fight proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
\
Sue the EPA As it typically responds to laws and policies it doesn't like, Wyoming is suing the EPA to stop the rules from being implemented. One of the most disturbing aspects of Mead's faith in coal conversion as the industry's salvation is that he doesn't have a realistic Plan B. Another is the effect his reliance on unproven technology could have on the coal miners whose labor helped build Wyoming's Permanent Mineral Trust Fund to more than $7 billion.
\
If Wyoming coal companies declare bankruptcy and try to get out of their pension and retirement obligations to miners, will the state use its influence and possibly even dip into the PMTF to help coal miners, their families and communities.
\
Instead of going to court and wasting time, Wyoming could have followed the lead of Montana, which decided to cooperate with the EPA and tried to convince other states in the region to do likewise. Mead wanted no part of that and plans to fight the agency at every turn.
\
Two weeks ago the U.S. Supreme Court handed environmentalists their biggest defeat in years, blasting the EPA for failing to consider costs to industry when it created its plan to reduce mercury and other toxic air pollution from power plants.
\
But the court kept the rule in place and sent the issue back to a circuit court. I hope that, in addition to costs, the judges will also decide that the improved health of Americans by reducing toxic emissions should also be given great weight. Wyoming is also banking on exporting low-sulfur Powder River Basin coal to Asian Pacific nations to improve the industry's fortunes. But Oregon and Washington communities have rebuffed the Cowboy State's plans.
\
Amazingly, Wyoming acted as if it could not believe any state wouldn't jump at the chance to bail it out. Undeterred, Mead has pressed several Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest to support the terminals. But the prospect of that happening is dim.
\
Given all of the obstacles the state is facing, it shouldn't be surprising that Mead is placing so much hope in the possibility of building a coal-to-chemicals conversion plant. But he knows Wyoming has tried for many years to initiate projects like this only to see them fall flat.
\
Wyoming had placed great faith in its partnership with General Electric to build the proposed High Plains Gasification-Advanced Technology research center near Cheyenne, but the company pulled out in 2011.
\
Another blow Another blow came later the same year, when a carbon-sequestration demonstration project the University of Wyoming and the U.S. Department of Energy planned near Rock Springs was put on hold.
\
With its abundant wind and solar resources, Wyoming needs to make the conversion to renewable energy as soon as possible. The benefits could be huge, according to The Solutions Project of Stanford University. The project said all of Wyoming's energy needs could be met by wind, solar and hydroelectric by 2050. The advantages would be large: a 38 percent less demand for energy; $400 million health cost savings; and 62 fewer deaths due to pollution a year. We can head in this direction to improve the health of our residents and the environment as well as create clean energy jobs while saving money. The alternative is spending millions of dollars seeking ""clean coal"" alternatives that may never be commercially viable.
\
If the result of Mead's gamble is that miners and their families find themselves without work and their retirements, how leaders respond will be Wyoming's billboard to the talented young people Gov. Matt Mead wants to recruit to this state.

Wyoming failing to see reality of coal industry

Suggested hed : Keep open mind on climate Twelve years ago, I taught in Tennessee and spent summers in Wyoming. The sky was a dome of blue, in discernible contrast with Southern skies, where clouds obscured the blue 10 months out of the year. Today, having lived in Wyoming for eight years, its sky sometimes reminds me of Tennessee's. Horizons are smeared with haze. Overhead, clouds tumble into one another. Twelve years from now, what changes will we see.
\
Human observation can be faulty. But visit the National Center for Atmospheric Research near Cheyenne, off I-80's Exit 257. While you can't sit at its supercomputer with a researcher who will explain climate models that illustrate atmospheric changes past and present, guides will direct you to websites that tell you more than you'll want to know.
\
Another way to open your mind is to stop at a library. You'll be amazed at the books that describe the effects of climate change. True, on the same shelf you'll find books with titles like ""Eco Scam"" that decry global warming, claiming that thousands of researchers around the world are colluding in a gigantic hoax. Such books want to maintain the illusion that climate science is less settled than it is. Paul Krugman , op-ed writer for the New York Times, recently produced a column on climate and ideology in which he takes on ""the much-hyped war on coal."" While getting serious about global warming means, above all, cutting back on - eventually eliminating - coal-fired power (which would hurt regions like Wyoming), he notes that, ""What's rarely pointed out is how few such jobs still exist."" King Coal was once a major employer. More than 250,000 coal miners existed in America by the 1970s. But coal employment has steadily fallen, ""not because output is down - it's up, substantially - but because most coal now comes from strip mines that require very few workers,"" Mr. Krugman writes. Today, he points out, coal mining accounts for only one-sixteenth of 1 percent of overall U.S. employment. ""The real war on coal, or at least on coal workers, took place a generation ago, waged not by liberal environmentalists but by the coal industry itself,"" he adds. ""And coal workers lost."" The natural reaction is denial, angry denial, he observes: ""Read or watch any extended debate over climate policy and you'll be struck by the venom, the sheer rage, of the denialists ."" Yet environmentalism is not the enemy of economic growth, Mr. Krugman argues, citing recent studies, including one by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that found only modest cost. He reminds us that, in the 1980s, conservatives claimed that any attempt to limit acid rain would have devastating economic effects. In reality, the cap-and-trade system for sulfur dioxide was ""highly successful at minimal cost."" Yes, protecting the environment imposes costs on some regions, but ""not as much as you think."" He mentions that the Northeastern states' cap-and-trade arrangement for carbon has lowered emissions ""sharply"" while their economies grew faster than in the rest of the country.
\
Three things we know about human-made global warming, he says: The consequences will be terrible if we don't act quickly to limit carbon emissions. The required action shouldn't be hard to take: emission controls, done right, would probably slow economic growth, but not by much. The politics of action are nonetheless difficult.
\
Why is action on this issue so tricky? While he acknowledges that funding from fossil-fuel interests has played a crucial role, he says the monetary stakes aren't nearly as big as we might think. What makes rational action on climate so hard is ""a toxic mix of ideology and anti-intellectualism."" An interesting debate on science and anti-intellectualism happened on the most recent NPR ""Science Friday"" show. Ira Flatow's guest was Rep. Rush Bolt of New Jersey's 12th District, a physicist.
\
Very few members of Congress are scientists, noted the guest, and those who are, contend with mind-sets of ""Don't tell us what we don't want to know"" and ""Don't confuse us with the facts."" Still, Mr. Bolt says, thinking like a scientist helps the political process. We must open ourselves to scientific thinking, he said, ""not so we have a checklist of what is true and what is false"" but so that we may learn to think critically. To start with an ideology and end on that same ideology signifies a closed mind. NCAR's mission is to understand the behavior of the atmosphere and related systems. Books on the subject express the research in accessible language. I invite you take a look. Consider the evidence.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to issue its rule in June to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants - and coal-reliant Wyoming is in trouble. As the nation's largest coal supplier, Wyoming is dangerously reliant on revenues from coal mining to stabilize it boom-and-bust economy.
\
Wyoming depends on coal, oil and natural gas for nearly 70 percent of its revenue, and that means the state's economy rides on the volatile fossil fuel commodities market. Coal mining - the most stable of the fossil fuels - supports 7,000 jobs directly and thousands more in support services. In 2012, the industry contributed some $1.22 billion to state and local governments.
\
Last week Gov. Matt Mead sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, asking her to withdraw the proposed rule. ""The EPA continues to stretch its interpretation of its authority ? This proposed regulation will adversely impact Wyoming's economy as the leading coal supplier to the U.S. It lacks sound reasoning, technological justification and will not provide regulatory certainty."" Little mention Mr. Mead's letter barely gives mention to the underlying goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants: to possibly head off the most devastating human health and environmental impacts of accelerated climate change.
\
By the way, that is a concern right here in Wyoming where a warming climate is already taking a toll on forests, water, wildlife and many of the state's other economic drivers. That lack of reference to climate impacts is no surprise given Mr. Mead's past statements that he is skeptical of the scientific community's findings that man-caused emissions are a major driver behind climate change. He even gave his blessing to the Legislature's ban on the national Next Generation Science Standards for K-12 students, in part for its acknowledgement of man's role in climate change.
\
Coal state governors, EPA and stakeholders on all sides are preparing for legal battle after the greenhouse gas standards are announced next month. Mr. Mead and anti-regulation proponents are likely to focus their arguments on EPA's carbon capture technology review that is supposed to fulfill an obligation by EPA to justify the new standards. They argue carbon capture is an expensive and yet to be commercialized technology, and doesn't serve as a reasonable method to meet EPA's new emissions limits for new coal facilities.
\
Forced retirement The affect of that standard will ensure not only that no new coal-fired power plants will be built for the nation's foreseeable future, but it will force the retirement of aging, inefficient coal-fired power plants, further diminishing Wyoming coal's U.S. market. For proponents of curbing emissions from coal, that's the outcome they welcome from EPA's new rule. Last week the White House underscored the findings of the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment. President Barack Obama said the report is proof that climate change isn't a health and economic disaster in the future, but the affects have already begun to take their toll.
\
While those dire warnings fall flat with Mr. Mead, lawmakers and the congressional delegation, there's no denying that the state's fossil fuel backbone - coal - will surely continue to lose favor in its primary market; the U.S.A. For much of the past decade, Wyoming produced well over 400 million tons annually, reaching a high point of 467 million tons in 2008 then falling to just around 400 million in 2012. The continued erosion of the U.S. market explains the desperation among the state's producers to open up coal exports to Asian markets.
\
As Wyoming leaders prepare to battle EPA, they tout investments and progress in the very carbon capture technologies that Mr. Mead said in his letter to EPA are unproven to support the agency's greenhouse gas rule for coal.
\
""Governor Mead understands the need to develop proven technologies to reduce carbon emissions,"" Mead's office said in a news release last week.
\
""Wyoming is committed to ensuring the long-term viability of fossil fuel resources,"" Mead said. ""Technologies to capture CO2 and process it ? are in early stages. Wyoming is putting resources toward further developing these technologies to provide real world solutions. EPA should do likewise and start by scuttling this proposal."" Poor track record Despite putting some $50 million toward ""advanced coal"" technologies in recent years, Wyoming doesn't have a good track record in piloting carbon-reducing technologies toward commercialization. Wyoming's partnership with G.E. on a $100 million carbon capture test facility was scuttled by G.E. due to - get this - lack of U.S. regulatory certainty.
\
While Wyoming leaders oppose greenhouse gas rules from EPA (even environmentalists say the proposal is a poor mechanism to reduce emissions), they have also opposed approaches such as a cap-and-trade or carbon tax strategy. Let the markets drive the technology, they say.
\
For Wyoming's economy - and for the world's climate-prone populations and environment - that approach may be too little too late.

A few weeks ago in the mail I got a copy of the Oct. 20 Forbes Magazine, courtesy of a consulting firm in New York City.
\
The reason for the courtesy was clear. The front page had a photo of Carol Browner, head of the EPA, with the line, ""Watch out for this woman.""
\
Also on the front but in smaller type was the sentence, ""The EPA's Carol Browner is exploiting health and the environment to build a power base.""
\
I had browsed through enough of the piece to get the idea when one of its authors, Bonner Cohen, did a guest shot on a regional radio talk program some days ago.
\
One thing he said was that the much-ballyhooed EPA program to take asbestos out of schools (and other buildings) made no sense because the pragmatic thing to do would have been to seal the asbestos and leave it alone. Anybody who came from the Midwest several decades ago would have seen scores of conduits from furnaces wrapped in sheet asbestos, which apparently never did any damage to anybody.
\
Cohen mentioned he would be interested in whether those who worked with asbestos during the big ""scare"" in the 1980s will begin to experience adverse effects from that work, notwithstanding their protective clothing and masks. Makes sense.
\
The story says that Browner ""presents herself as the great family physician,"" adding that she says, ""'There isn't a decision I make on any given day that's not related to the health of the American people. She is an attorney and has no training in medicine.
\
So what's on the Browner agenda lately?
\
Cleaner air and damn the cost seems to be on the program.
\
Browner formerly worked for a consumer advocate group connected to Ralph Nader. Her husband, Michael Podhorzer, still works for it.
\
Cohen said on radio that the environmental danger philosophy and those acts that have stemmed from it originated with Rachel Carson and her ""Silent Spring."" He contended that while she was a talented writer, she wasn't much of a scientist and that her writing abilities gave what she had to say much more credibility than should have been the case.
\
The Forbes piece says that, ""In pushing for new standards for particulate matter and ozone, EPA originally claimed its proposal would cost approximately $8.5 billion, a figure the agency revised to $47 billion after president Clinton approved the program.""
\
One agency recommendation hatched in 1994 wants a new tax of 50 cents a gallon on gasoline, which is estimated to cost motorists $47 billion by the year 2000 alone. The reach is astounding, since EPA also wants a greenhouse gas tax, a carbon tax and a BTU tax, to mention only a part of the menu.
\
Forbes sees the prospect that Browner could be a vice presidential candidate with Gore in case he makes it to the semi- final.
\
Or, head of the UN environment program, or maybe nominee as the new UN deputy secretary general.
\
Not an appealing prospect.

6,"How does one deal with all the misinformation bombarding us from different directions? Has technology exponentially expanded the avenues of scamming others?\As example is the so-called Green New Deal, with its supposedly new ""carbon tax."" Oil is a hydrocarbon, and is already highly taxed. When I had oil production, the government got more income from my oil than I did. That was before the gas tax that everyone pays filling up their gas tanks.\Concerning the environment, a quote from Yale professor and governmental adviser Gus Smith is notable: ""I used to think that the environmental problems were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change. I thought that 30 years of good science could address these problems. I was wrong. The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy, and to deal with these, we need a cultural and spiritual transformation, and we scientists don't know how to do that ...""\Technology does not diminish the corrupt nature of man, but instead gives it new avenues of proliferation. It is another reason representation and accountability are so needed in government. To concentrate power and greed together is a bad combination.\That is what has happened to the oil and gas industry in Wyoming and the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. Aren't we supposed to have a representative government that includes not only elections, but having a voice in the process? Except for the governor, the people's voice has been squelched at the Oil and Gas Commission.\My personal experience with the commission was an education. Against odds, I found a good lawyer to top a non-producing well from being converted to a disposal well. The oil company and the Oil and Gas Commission were in bed together to deceive me and other neighbors.\To give the people and landowners of Wyoming more of a voice in the process, the Wyoming Land and Mineral Owners Association has been formed. Hopefully this will help make the Oil and Gas Commission be more accountable to the people of Wyoming."

For proponents of curbing emissions from coal, that's the outcome they welcome from EPA's new rule. Last week the White House underscored the findings of the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment. President Barack Obama said the report is proof that climate change isn't a health and economic disaster in the future, but the affects have already begun to take their toll.
\
While those dire warnings fall flat with Mr. Mead, lawmakers and the congressional delegation, there's no denying that the state's fossil fuel backbone - coal - will surely continue to lose favor in its primary market; the U.S.A. For much of the past decade, Wyoming produced well over 400 million tons annually, reaching a high point of 467 million tons in 2008 then falling to just around 400 million in 2012. The continued erosion of the U.S. market explains the desperation among the state's producers to open up coal exports to Asian markets.
\
As Wyoming leaders prepare to battle EPA, they tout investments and progress in the very carbon capture technologies that Mr. Mead said in his letter to EPA are unproven to support the agency's greenhouse gas rule for coal.
\
""Governor Mead understands the need to develop proven technologies to reduce carbon emissions,"" Mead's office said in a news release last week.
\
""Wyoming is committed to ensuring the long-term viability of fossil fuel resources,"" Mead said. ""Technologies to capture CO2 and process it ? are in early stages. Wyoming is putting resources toward further developing these technologies to provide real world solutions. EPA should do likewise and start by scuttling this proposal."" Poor track record Despite putting some $50 million toward ""advanced coal"" technologies in recent years, Wyoming doesn't have a good track record in piloting carbon-reducing technologies toward commercialization. Wyoming's partnership with G.E. on a $100 million carbon capture test facility was scuttled by G.E. due to - get this - lack of U.S. regulatory certainty.
\
While Wyoming leaders oppose greenhouse gas rules from EPA (even environmentalists say the proposal is a poor mechanism to reduce emissions), they have also opposed approaches such as a cap-and-trade or carbon tax strategy. Let the markets drive the technology, they say.
\
For Wyoming's economy - and for the world's climate-prone populations and environment - that approach may be too little too late.

No need for 5th penny tax if we have a gas tax
\
Why do we need to pay a 5th penny tax? The ""Wish List"" for the continuation of the 5th penny tax looks pretty darn close to the ""Wish List"" for the already passed 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax. Looks like the projects proposed under the 5th penny tax are nearly all related to maintenance of roads. Isn't that why the Legislature passed the 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax?

School board members should not resign
\
Fred Schlacter's implication that school board members Allen, Atkins, and Kopsa resign for voting yes to increase teachers' salaries, therefore ignoring the needs of students and parents, is unfair. This issue was raised by member Mosher as he lauded conflict of interest accusations because these three accepted $250 from WEA.
\
Insinuating $250 will sway honorable, civic-minded gentlemen from performing responsibilities ethically is equally unfair. I do not know members Atkins and Kopsa; I do know Tom Allen and guarantee he is also honest, hard-working and a concerned Christian. I also know Tom's primary concerns are his family and creating a quality learning and teaching environment for every student, parent and teacher. Mr. Allen is constantly approached by former students and their parents who fervently acknowledge the lasting impact he had on their lives. And that's the man charged with being ignorant of the needs of students and parents?
\
Since I do not know Atkins and Kopsa, and Mosher for that matter, the Christian philosophy is assuming they are also honest and hard- working. I do not agree with some decisions made by the School Board, but realize these members make personal sacrifices and devote enormous amounts of time and energy attempting LCSD1 improvements for everyone; for that they have my respect.
\
Sadly, tolerance of our differences in opinions is missing in today's society. In the future perhaps Mr. Schlachter will get acquainted with his accused before implying they are not honest, hard-working, concerned Christians.
\
Mr. Schlachter also took issue with the fact the 7.73 percent pay raise denies quality education. I agree there are numerous urgent needs of LCSD1. I see this every day while being involved at my daughter's school. However, if the priority isn't recruiting and retaining quality, motivated teachers, class size or building maintenance becomes irrelevant. In my experience with teachers of Deming/Miller, 7.73 percent may not be enough. Mr. Schlacter, spend time in the classroom of a devoted teacher, like those at Deming/ Miller, and walk away acknowledging an estimated $153 per month increase is too much.

Mail gets slower; gas price gouging
\
Oh, our modern fast service of computers and first-class mail service.
\
They call this progress? I have another name for it. We stand in line at the check-out two to three times longer to pay than we ever did before at a regular cash register.
\
As for the mail, now get this. I had a voucher mailed from my bank in Fort Collins on May 13, and it was May 19 when it reached the office in Denver. This is first-class mail service? Give me a break. Pony Express was three times faster, and ox cart would have beat that by three days. What great progress we have today.
\
On another topic, I just came back from Topeka, Kan., and purchased gas for 96 cents, and they have a 40-cent tax. Now, aren't our stations here jabbing us at anything from over $1 to 94 cents when Wyoming only has 28 cents in gas taxes; even after 5 cents increase in the gas tax, it will be 32 cents.
\
That's still 8 cents below the Kansas tax. Maybe our local gas stations are as greedy as our state government.
\
I believe they are irresponsible when they tax gasoline instead of liquor and cigarettes, the two number one killers.

Get the facts straight when talking about BOPU
\
In regard to recent letters, it is apparent that several authors are shooting from the hip when addressing the Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities.
\
A major concern is the expansion of the city's water production capacity to meet Cheyenne's need well into the next century. The concept adopted was to expand the Sherard Treatment Plant to 32 million gallons per day. This will replace the production of the old Roundtop plant, which is literally on its last leg. Much thought and work went into the process to minimize the cost of the expansion at $28 million.
\
Engineer's determined that a more cost effective way would be to build a separate plant in the proximity of the Sherard Plant and use the existing settling basins and retention ponds. This new concept also reduces the need for rerouting transmission mains required to keep the plant in operation during the construction phase. Conservative estimates point to a $1.7 million savings.
\
To imply there was a hidden agenda regarding this matter is false. For the BOPU staff to ignore this new concept, as presented by the design engineers to reduce the cost of the project, would be negligent in our responsibility.
\
There is also a misconception presented that the BOPU and city operate within their own entities and never share resources. The fact is that equipment, materials and employees are shared on a routine basis.
\
Concerning the issue of parity in salaries of BOPU employees and non-uniformed workers for the city requires a comparison of job standards. BOPU employees are required by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality to be certified to work on the water distribution and the collection (sanitary sewer) system. The incentive for obtaining state certifications is a 5 percent pay increase for each level of certification.
\
I fully assure the citizens of Cheyenne that they are getting big dividends on their investment in BOPU employees.
\
We know our mission, we have a vision, goals have been established, and we know our past accomplishments. If you want facts, contact the source -- we will gladly provide you with the information.

Hed: Local landowners make case for increased oil production setbacks At a glance Applications for oil well permits in Laramie County have increased in recent years. And with the permits have come rising concerns from landowners over issues of health and safety, noise and light pollution and negative impacts on property values. The Cheyenne Area Landowners Coalition is lobbying for the state to require new wells be built no closer than a quarter-acre from homes and businesses. CHEYENNE - Wyomingites, by and large, are supportive of the state's oil and gas industry, and for good reason: The industry employs thousands and fills government coffers with tax revenue. But how supportive would you be if the industry set up shop less than two football fields away from your back door.
\
In Laramie County, the recent explosion in well permits, many in close to rural subdivisions, has local landowners wondering whether the state is doing enough to protect residents from potential negative effects of oil and gas production. Members of the Cheyenne Area Landowners Coalition gathered for an informal meeting last week to discuss issues like health and safety, noise and light pollution and the impact of oil development on nearby property values.
\
The coalition is dedicated to lobbying on behalf of local property owners. ""I have never seen a state government that is so indifferent to the concerns of their residents and their constituents,"" coalition member Paul Cook said.
\
The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission regulates oil and gas development in the state. It is considering a rule change that would require new wells to be drilled at least 500 feet from homes and businesses. The current setback is 350 feet.
\
Members of the coalition say 500 feet is not nearly enough; they recommend a setback of at least 1,320 feet, or a quarter-mile. Cook called the proposed 150-foot setback increase a ""pathetic attempt at appeasement."" ""We have been called extremists by some people in the government and industry. But we're not,"" he said. "" We aren't against oil development in the state and in Laramie County. We just want to see it done in a responsible way."" Health and safety Coalition members say that too often state regulatory agencies prioritize oil and gas tax revenues over the health and safety of residents.
\
""The health of the citizens of Wyoming is nothing but a sacrificial lamb for state's bank account,"" Cook said.
\
Coalition president Alex Bowler said, ""It's no mystery that if you breathe in the things that spew out of oil and gas wells, you are going to have respiratory problems."" Jon Goldstein, a policy manager for the Environmental Defense Fund, said, ""There are a number of things that get polluted into the environment around oil and gas production sites. Some of them are cancer-causing, like benzene and chemicals like that."" The Environmental Defense Fund is a national group that seeks economic solutions to environmental protection problems. Pollutants from oil and gas wells can increase the incidence of ""asthma and all sorts of respiratory ailments, especially for kids and the elderly,"" Goldstein said.
\
""There is always a concern when people live close to (oil and gas production facilities) about 'Is it going to hurt me? Is it going to hurt my kids?' Those are legitimate concerns,"" he added.
\
Members of the Landowners Coalition say by increasing setbacks and keeping oil rigs further from homes, the industry can reduce health risks to nearby landowners.
\
And it isn't just the wells themselves that have local landowners troubled; it's the activity around them.
\
Many rural subdivisions in the county have seen rising traffic from large trucks that service the oil production sites.
\
""What's it going to take - a collision between this heavy equipment and a school bus - before the state government opens their eyes to the fact that maybe these operations are too close (to neighborhoods)?"" Cook wondered.
\
Brad Brooks lives in an area east of Cheyenne with one active rig site and several proposed future sites. He agreed.
\
""More (distance between neighborhoods and oil production sites) is better,"" Brooks said. ""Why not be safe and (increase setback requirements) to 1,320 feet?"" ""Up all night"" And then there are the worries about noise and light pollution.
\
Myrna and Wayne Brautigam live off of County Road 136 east of Cheyenne, less than a quarter-mile from a well drilled last September.
\
""It's nothing pretty to look at, that's for sure,"" Wayne said. ""And when it was built, they didn't put up any sound barrier, no light barriers"" Myrna said, ""We have had all of the trucks going to and from (the well) 24-7. It's a lot of noise, a lot of light all the time. ""Headlights from the trucks would shine right through our windows and into our bedroom. It would sometimes keep us up all night."" Brooks, who lives close to the Brautigams but a bit further from the well, had similar problems.
\
He said he bought a white noise machine to try to cut down on the noise at night.
\
""It's a real nuisance."" Property values Local real estate agent Sherry Hall said there is anecdotal evidence that suggests homes in Wyoming near oil and gas production sites often take longer to sell and sell for less than comparable homes further from wells. She said a recent study in Colorado ""reveals that property values nosedive"" when new oil wells are drilled nearby.
\
""This is a real issue that we are wrestling with right now,"" Hall said.
\
Cook added, ""Who is going to buy your house if you can't drink the water and you're afraid to breathe the air? Who's going to give you market value for your house?"" On a related note, Wayne Lax, who lives on a five-acre lot just outside of Cheyenne, said he has been informed by his homeowner's insurance company that he would not be covered should oil-related activity damage his home. A different opinion There are, of course, many in the state who disagree with the Landowners Coalition and oppose any setback increases. Or they say that hiking minimum setbacks to 500 feet is plenty. The Petroleum Association of Wyoming recently sent a letter to state Oil and Gas Supervisor Mark Watson.
\
It said an ""across-the-board increase in setback distance would unnecessarily risk the waste of oil and gas ? with no discernible benefit to surrounding property owners."" Another letter provided to the commission from the Wyoming Business Alliance says mineral rights owners should be compensated for lost access to oil and gas reserves as a result of setback increases. A setback requirement of 1,000 feet ""would reduce employment, royalty payments and tax revenue,"" the letter reads. The Oil and Gas Commission has gotten dozens of other comments expressing similar sentiments.
\
It will hold a public hearing on March 9 in Casper before issuing a ruling on any changes to current setback requirements. Landowners: 500-foot well setback puts us in danger

Fence Yellowstone movement is growing
\
Our movement to fence Yellowstone National Park has gathered a lot of support.
\
Father Time is on our side with the wolves and grizzlies. We predict that this year a pack of wolves will kill someone on a hiking trail or possibly a child in an open field. We wouldn't let a pack of pit bulls or German shepherds run loose, would we?
\
Well, what's the difference?
\
Grizzlies have already been blamed for killing outside the park, as our friend, Ivan Schafer, of Riverton lost his life while camping west of Dubois. There will be more of the same. So, you see, it's not just livestock losses.
\
Brucellosis should be eradicated just like polio. Why not? The elk and buffalo could be penned and vaccinated. They could be trucked out of the park during the winter to a nice facility and then hauled back during the spring. In the early '60s, our father,
\
Pat Johnson, hauled 1,571 elk from the park and also buffalo from Victor, Idaho, to new locations. It can be done.
\
Our ongoing survey tells us that the National Park Service and the Forest Service are not very well liked by the people. They have sold their souls to the super-ecologists, have pulled too many shenanigans, and grizzlies, wolves and brucellosis have become a simple tool for their big land grab. The BLM on the other hand has earned respect.
\
This movement is going to be around for a long time. Eventually these problems will be solved or the park will be fenced. BILL JOHNSON andPAT JOHNSON JR. Kemmerer

US West needs to improve Internet speed Apparently ""Life's better here"" is U S West's slogan. When I noticed my fastest connect speed to the Internet with a modem was 26.4k, I contacted U S West and asked that my line be checked. I noticed friends in other areas of town connected to the Internet at faster speeds. I was told by a technician that the fastest I would be able to connect was 26.4k in my area because that was the limitation of an interface box. The box interfaces a trunk fiberoptic cable to the copper wire that leads to many residences. I asked when were they going to replace the box and was told never. Further, he advised if I wanted a faster connection, I should either move to another area of town or they would be happy to give me my own very expensive T-1 connection. I then wrote the PUC and was told there was nothing they could do as the 26.4k connection meets FCC standards. Since U S West has no competition for local telephone service, perhaps they could save enough money to replace the interface box by simply not running one of their ""Life's better here"" ads. Then all of us in my neighborhood could have a faster connection. As I am sure many readers have observed, we have already some of the highest telephone rates for this size town in the nation. Insofar as ""Life's better here,"" and U S West ... not! ROBERT A. BOESE Cheyenne

Those who restrict access should be penalizedI am definitely opposed to the landowner-sponsored license proposal to provide access for hunting. I feel that public land should be closed to all hunting and fishing if landowners refuse access to public lands if they can only be accessed through the landowner's deeded land. As a hunter and fisherman, I feel any ranchers who restrict access through private lands to adjoining public land should not have their grazing leases renewed after the end of the lease period expires. I also believe the state should obtain easements to landlocked public lands before any agreements are made with landowners. Any rancher who has a sign that says ""Private Property - No Hunting, No Fishing, or No Trespassing"" should have their grazing leases terminated prior to the renewal date whether they own two acres or 5,000 acres.

Anglers hurt animals and environment Robert Gagliardi need only open his eyes the next time he's at his favorite fishing hole to see the damage angling does to animals and the environment (Outdoor News and Notes, March 12). First, there's no doubt that fish feel pain. According to Dr. Donald Broom, animal welfare adviser to the British government, ""The scientific literature is quite clear. Anatomically, physiologically, and biologically, the pain system in fish is virtually the same as in birds and mammals. In animal welfare terms, you have to put fishing in the same category as hunting. ""Angling doesn't just hurt fish. Every year, anglers leave behind a trail of tackle victims that includes millions of birds, turtles and other animals who suffer debilitating injuries after swallowing fish hooks or become entangled in fishing line. Officials with the Virginia Marine Science Museum Stranding Team say fishing line is one of the top three threats to aquatic animals. Even the smallest amount of lost line can add up to a huge problem: One U.K. study found that in just two weeks anglers discarded or lost 36,000 pieces of line -- totaling 6 kilometers -- around a 2-kilometer stretch of embankment. Angling is not a harmless pastime. That's why PETA is calling on park superintendents across the country to give fishing the boot. PAULA MOORE People For The Ethical Treatment of Animals Norfolk, VA

Cheyenne gas station owners appear greedy I'm really disappointed with my home state of Wyoming. When I moved back to Cheyenne a month ago, gas was 88 cents, and it helped pay for my trip to Cheyenne by saving 15 cents to 20 cents per gallon. Now, seems since our wonderful Republican leadership voted in the 5-cent gas tax the stations have jumped the gun and decided to be greedy before the tax goes into effect. I have to go to Loveland, Colo., twice a week because I volunteer in a kitchen rhythm band that brings happiness to people confined to nursing homes. Now I buy gas for the first time ever in Colorado for 96 cents instead of $1.03 to $1.05 in greedy Cheyenne. So they vote to raise tax on gasoline that everyone has to use to make a living. I wonder how the leadership sleeps at night. NORB CATES Cheyenne

Longtime resident in no hurry to exile newbies From Carol Matteson Pascal Cheyenne Recently a 40-year resident of our city wrote urging those who wish to change anything about our city or state to leave.
\
To her and to others who resort to this tired trope, the answer is a resounding, ""No!"" In two years my large, extended Mexican American family will celebrate a century in this city.
\
Their commitment to faith, family and community has made this a better place than when our ancestors arrived almost 100 years ago. I have no doubt that over the next 100 years many of us will continue to advocate and work for more tolerance, for better public services, for protection of the environment, for green spaces and places, for assistance for those who need it, for a fairer justice system, for immigration reform, Medicaid expansion, anti-discrimination ordinances and the arts, improved education and work opportunities, for equal pay and many other progressive causes.
\
Not every single member of our huge family agrees with everyone else's position, but none of us would even consider telling one of them to leave.
\
I am tempted to suggest to the latecomer of only 40 years that she should be the one to leave if she doesn't like the goals of those of us born and raised here.
\
However, that would only exacerbate the hatefulness and intolerance I find so contemptible, so I won't.

Take moment to celebrate those who are in recovery From Victor J. Lisek Cheyenne September is National Recovery Month, recovery from addictions and other mental health disorders. It should be no surprise to the citizens of Cheyenne and the Wyoming community that addiction touches nearly everyone, whether directly or indirectly. Denial is not unique for the alcoholic or the addict; many others choose dim-sightedness to its prevalence in their own lives. What a surprise to realize that our co-worker, cousin, doctor or child might be struggling with active addiction or has actually been in recovery for many years.
\
So during this Recovery Month, we congratulate and applaud those who have overcome this primary battle and now enjoy sobriety. Whatever was the pathway, it is seldom an easy or soft journey toward sobriety. We salute you. And to those of you still struggling, know that as we made it, so can you. Keep on keeping on. National Recovery Month may be a good time to reflect on what we, as a community, are doing toward eradication of this societal scourge called addiction. The simple facts (nationally) are: 8.8 percent of youth (ages 12-17) are illicit drug users and 11.6 percent are alcohol abusers; one in five youth report binge drinking; 22 percent of college students (18-22) use illicit drugs and 59.4 percent are drinkers. In Wyoming: 65 percent of all arrests involve alcohol and 13 percent involve drugs; 87 percent of all traffic crashes involve alcohol; and our state has the highest suicide rate with addiction more often than not implicated.
\
In Wyoming, public and private facilities, non-profit agencies, AA community and caring individuals and groups provide many opportunities to arrive at an alcohol- and drug-free lifestyle. Even though we have seen major positive growth in education, treatment and support, there still exists too much avoidance and denial among families, corporate executives, myopic religious leaders and some government officials.
\
So in celebration of this Recovery Month, we who are in recovery thank you, our families, friends, supporters; our counselors, AA members and peers; our support community and treatment network. It's great to be in recovery and subsequently, alive in so many ways. Someone is ripping us off with high gasoline prices From Michael Smith Cheyenne Here we go again. On my yearly trip to New York, I again noticed that the gasoline prices were lower in every other state than Wyoming. I read an online reason for this that said, ""Things happen slowly in Wyoming."" I think the people here must think slowly too, especially in Cheyenne. Over Labor Day weekend I took a road trip north through Torrington. It's $2.20 a gallon up there, maybe they think a little quicker. Donald Trump says that politicians are stupid, that they're all puppets of big money, and he might have something there. Warren Buffet would probably say it's just a case of profiteering, and a little bit of ""ostrich management"": Stick your head in a hole, and it will all fix itself. Our gas tax here is about 42.5 cents a gallon, which is about average with many states but lower than most of those to the east, so that can't be the reason. So let's see. We're getting ripped off for about 35 cents a gallon. If we were to use about 20 gallons a week, that's $7. I don't know about you, but that yearly savings of $364 looks better in my pocket than anyone else's.

Cheyenne farmers market should allow leashed dogs From Mark Dickehage Cheyenne I am curious why the Cheyenne farmers market does not allow dogs on leashes. This is the only one we have been to that doesn't allow dogs. Laramie, Sidney and Scottsbluff, Nebraska, Golden and Boulder, Colorado, even Fort Collins when we were there all allow dogs on leashes. It seems to bring people together to talk about their pets and I have yet to see any problem with it. So why is Cheyenne the only one that does not allow this? 9-15 Letters to the editor

A few weeks ago in the mail I got a copy of the Oct. 20 Forbes Magazine, courtesy of a consulting firm in New York City.
\
The reason for the courtesy was clear. The front page had a photo of Carol Browner, head of the EPA, with the line, ""Watch out for this woman.""
\
Also on the front but in smaller type was the sentence, ""The EPA's Carol Browner is exploiting health and the environment to build a power base.""
\
I had browsed through enough of the piece to get the idea when one of its authors, Bonner Cohen, did a guest shot on a regional radio talk program some days ago.
\
One thing he said was that the much-ballyhooed EPA program to take asbestos out of schools (and other buildings) made no sense because the pragmatic thing to do would have been to seal the asbestos and leave it alone. Anybody who came from the Midwest several decades ago would have seen scores of conduits from furnaces wrapped in sheet asbestos, which apparently never did any damage to anybody.
\
Cohen mentioned he would be interested in whether those who worked with asbestos during the big ""scare"" in the 1980s will begin to experience adverse effects from that work, notwithstanding their protective clothing and masks. Makes sense.
\
The story says that Browner ""presents herself as the great family physician,"" adding that she says, ""'There isn't a decision I make on any given day that's not related to the health of the American people. She is an attorney and has no training in medicine.
\
So what's on the Browner agenda lately?
\
Cleaner air and damn the cost seems to be on the program.
\
Browner formerly worked for a consumer advocate group connected to Ralph Nader. Her husband, Michael Podhorzer, still works for it.
\
Cohen said on radio that the environmental danger philosophy and those acts that have stemmed from it originated with Rachel Carson and her ""Silent Spring."" He contended that while she was a talented writer, she wasn't much of a scientist and that her writing abilities gave what she had to say much more credibility than should have been the case.
\
The Forbes piece says that, ""In pushing for new standards for particulate matter and ozone, EPA originally claimed its proposal would cost approximately $8.5 billion, a figure the agency revised to $47 billion after president Clinton approved the program.""
\
One agency recommendation hatched in 1994 wants a new tax of 50 cents a gallon on gasoline, which is estimated to cost motorists $47 billion by the year 2000 alone. The reach is astounding, since EPA also wants a greenhouse gas tax, a carbon tax and a BTU tax, to mention only a part of the menu.
\
Forbes sees the prospect that Browner could be a vice presidential candidate with Gore in case he makes it to the semi- final.
\
Or, head of the UN environment program, or maybe nominee as the new UN deputy secretary general.
\
Not an appealing prospect.

\
CHEYENNE - Wyomingites want better state highways, but they don't want to pay for them with a higher fuel tax, a statewide poll shows.
\
Sponsored by the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle, the poll was conducted in the last week of December by the Aspen Media and Market Research organization.
\
The chairman of the state Senate's Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee agrees with the poll results.
\
""People realize we need safe roads in Wyoming,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Casper.
\
He added that while it costs money to maintain roads, an increase in the fuel tax is not the way to go.
\
""When you look at the amount of money it costs to maintain and improve the highways, raising the gas tax doesn't do very much at all,"" Barrasso said.
\
Officials from the state Department of Transportation say they face a budget shortfall of $500 million per biennium as they struggle to cope with a severe rise in construction costs.
\
Additionally, nearly 43 percent of the state's secondary highways and roads are rated in poor condition.
\
Some legislators have suggested a higher fuel tax as one avenue of relief.
\
A proposed 5-cent fuel tax would translate into an estimated revenue stream of $33.9 million with $22.5 million going directly to the State Highway Fund.
\
Gov. Dave Freudenthal has said he will not support any fuel tax increases while the state is enjoying excess revenue from its energy industry.
\
Added state Rep. Rodney ""Pete"" Anderson, R-Pine Bluffs, ""I would not support it simply because the administration has indicated it would not support it. Politically, it's probably not a wise avenue to go down at this time.""
\
Of those polled, 88.8 percent said they would support surplus funds being used to improve the state's highways as well as to add lanes to busy two-lane roads.
\
Only 7.2 percent said they would not support that.
\
On a related question, only 36.7 percent said they would approve of an increase in the fuel tax to maintain and improve the state's highway system. More than half, 55.2 percent, were against the measure.
\
See POLL, page A10
\
Continued from A1
\
The chairman for the House's Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee said the poll shows inconsistency between what people say they want and what they will pay for.
\
""Well, of course it is (inconsistent),"" said Rep. Dave Edwards, R- Douglas. ""It's automatic in our psyche to be against raising taxes.""
\
He said most people didn't realize the impact a 5-cent tax hike would have on their pockets or on the state highway system.
\
""The average person in this state drives supposedly about 18,000 miles, and if you take the average fuel consumption for our cars, it would cost you about $5 a month to raise the fuel tax a nickel,"" Edwards said.
\
""Now, I think we can all afford that. The sad thing is that that's just a drop in the bucket.""
\
Edwards said it is imperative for the state to act now.
\
""We have to get money any way we can - we're talking about billions of dollars if we're going to get these highways in shape,"" he said. ""We're way behind now.""
\
Rep. Debbie Hammons, D-Worland, said the state has to review all of its options.
\
""We have to take the long view with our roads, and we'll look at multiple means of funding them,"" she said. ""The fuel tax is the least popular of these options.""
\
Most legislators are reluctant to raise the fuel tax, Hammons said, because of an incongruity existing in Wyoming.
\
""There's a disconnect between Wyoming having the lowest fuel tax in the region but not having the lowest fuel prices,"" she said.
\
Barrasso agreed maintaining highways will be expensive.
\
""Last year the Legislature and the people of Wyoming stepped up to do more, and we'll need to do so again this year,"" he said. ""There are better ways to fund this than raising the gas tax.""
\
Life in a high-plains desert
\
Respondents also were asked whether they would approve surplus funds going to the development of more water storage.
\
Nearly 72 percent said yes.
\
In his supplemental budget request, Freudenthal requested $45 million from the Legislature for such efforts.
\
Of the remaining 28 percent of respondents, roughly 15 said water storage should not be a focus of the Legislature.
\
The push for water storage is recognition of the realities faced by Wyoming, one legislator said.
\
""We live at a high altitude, and we've been faced with drought over the years,"" Barrasso said. ""The best thing we can do in terms of taking things into our own hands is to work on long-term water projects.""
\
Hammons agreed.
\
""For Wyoming, one of our most precious assets is water,"" she said.
\
For Anderson, increased funding for existing water infrastructure takes priority.
\
""My guess is you like to drink water and take a shower now and then,"" he said. ""We need not only a handle on the infrastructure, but also the availability.""
\
An inconvenient Wyoming?
\
Environmental concerns also weigh on Wyomingites' minds.
\
Some 80.3 percent said decisions regarding the state's energy sector should be balanced against a fragile environment.
\
Of those polled, 34.8 percent said environmental concerns should play a large role in decision making; 45.5 percent said a moderate role; and 13.7 percent said a small role.
\
""We've got to recognize the fact that there's something about this global warming - we've got to address that,"" Edwards said.
\
Barrasso said the state's energy decisions have to be made in a sensitive fashion that protects the state's resources.
\
""Wyoming's a very special place; we want it to stay that way for our children and grandchildren so they can enjoy it just as we have,"" he added. ""There's a commitment in the Legislature to continue down that road.""
\
The state has a unique balancing act to travail, Hammons said.
\
Energy is the state's lifeblood and its wide-open spaces are its charm. Historically, the one has had an impact on the other, but new technology is beginning to diminish the harm done, she said.
\
""With science, we can handle both,"" Hammons added. ""There have been tremendous breakthroughs and improvements in the development of minerals in Wyoming.""
\
Economic assistance
\
Roughly half of Wyomingites say the Legislature is doing an adequate job of promoting economic growth in communities to produce better-paying jobs.
\
Anderson said the state has addressed many of the communities' needs. But more aid is needed, he said.
\
""Some of our smaller communities have no way of raising enough taxes on their own to keep up with the demands in that community,"" Anderson said.
\
From the poll, 48.5 percent approved of the Legislature's efforts to promote economic growth; 35.7 percent said it has not done enough.
\
Barrasso said the Legislature's efforts to spur economic growth are ongoing.
\
""I want to make sure that we have quality education for our children and quality jobs for our communities,"" he added.
"
16,"How does one deal with all the misinformation bombarding us from different directions? Has technology exponentially expanded the avenues of scamming others?\As example is the so-called Green New Deal, with its supposedly new ""carbon tax."" Oil is a hydrocarbon, and is already highly taxed. When I had oil production, the government got more income from my oil than I did. That was before the gas tax that everyone pays filling up their gas tanks.\Concerning the environment, a quote from Yale professor and governmental adviser Gus Smith is notable: ""I used to think that the environmental problems were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change. I thought that 30 years of good science could address these problems. I was wrong. The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy, and to deal with these, we need a cultural and spiritual transformation, and we scientists don't know how to do that ...""\Technology does not diminish the corrupt nature of man, but instead gives it new avenues of proliferation. It is another reason representation and accountability are so needed in government. To concentrate power and greed together is a bad combination.\That is what has happened to the oil and gas industry in Wyoming and the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. Aren't we supposed to have a representative government that includes not only elections, but having a voice in the process? Except for the governor, the people's voice has been squelched at the Oil and Gas Commission.\My personal experience with the commission was an education. Against odds, I found a good lawyer to top a non-producing well from being converted to a disposal well. The oil company and the Oil and Gas Commission were in bed together to deceive me and other neighbors.\To give the people and landowners of Wyoming more of a voice in the process, the Wyoming Land and Mineral Owners Association has been formed. Hopefully this will help make the Oil and Gas Commission be more accountable to the people of Wyoming."

CHEYENNE -- Two bills in front of Congress could restore about $28.5 million in federal highway funds to Wyoming.
\
If the legislation is successful, the Wyoming Department of Transportation would be able to continue planned highway projects, department Director Sleeter Dover said Friday.
\
All states are facing a cut in federal highway funds in fiscal year 2003 from the Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century. That law, passed in 1998, outlined $27.7 billion in highway funding for fiscal year 2003 for all the states. This proposal would restore $4.4 billion to the proposed highway budget.
\
The additional funds would come from the federal Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the federal gas tax imposed on drivers at the gas pumps.
\
In fiscal year 2002, Wyoming received $188.9 million. Fiscal Year 2003 figures put Wyoming's allocation at $143.8 million.
\
The West's share of the cuts totals about $2 billion, in the estimation of the Western Governors' Association, and could cost 84,000 jobs.
\
Wyoming was supposed to lose $56 million, Dover said, because of the drop-off in sales tax collections after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the national recession.
\
Dover said he and the trade associations he's a member of had asked for a recalculation. That resulted in a smaller probable loss of $45 million.
\
With the $28.5 million outlined in the two bills, Wyoming's share would grow to $172.3 million.
\
Dover said about 230 members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed onto the House version, including the 74 members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
\
Nineteen members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee have signed on as original co-sponsors.
\
In a prepared statement,
\
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said this funding increase will not come at the expense of other programs, as it will come from the federal Highway Trust Fund, which currently has an $18 billion surplus.
\
Federal lawmakers say restoring highway funding will preserve jobs across all 50 states.
\
Republican communications assistant Justin Harclerode said the bills have just recently been introduced.
\
""The bills have not been scheduled yet,"" Harclerode said. ""But in the next few weeks, we should see some action.""
\
In the meantime, Dover said he has briefed Gov. Jim Geringer, who is attending the National Governors Association's winter meeting this weekend.
\
The association has drafted a letter supporting the funding that Geringer has agreed to sign onto.
\
Without this additional funding, Dover said some highway projects would have to be shelved.
\
""This is just trying to hold on to what we expected.""

\
CHEYENNE - Protecting states' rights and the chance to support anti-abortion issues have prompted Mary Boud to run for the state House District 9 seat in the Legislature.
\
""We're definitely a country headed down the wrong track, and there definitely are things the state can do to defend its states' rights against the encroachment of the federal government,"" she said.
\
She plans to resume debates on some anti-abortion issues that failed in the previous full session of the Wyoming Legislature.
\
""I was very disappointed by some of the directions of the last legislative session in 2011, where some of our pro-life issues lost by one or two votes,"" Boud said.
\
Other issues she would seek to bring back for discussion include those like the requirement to offer an ultrasound to women seeking an abortion, she said.
\
""Since I couldn't convince them with all my talking and all my writing (in the last session), I'd like to be able to vote for the issues I consider right,"" she said. ""That mostly has to do with life, family, marriage, liberty issues and then states' rights and national sovereignty.""
\
She also would support the state doing what it can to protect the interests of the country, she said. These include opposing Sharia law and being wary of the International Criminal Court and international regulations on the environment and gun ownership.
\
Boud said she would promote legislation to strengthen states' rights in issues like health-care coverage. She also would work to protect state religious freedom from governmental mandates, like when church adoption programs have to close because they won't adopt children to same-sex couples.
\
""We're having very basic rights eroded, and the state does have a role,"" she said. ""The federal government hasn't any right, based on the First Amendment, to dictate what is a religion and what isn't.""
\
Boud said she considers herself a social and fiscal conservative.
\
""I'm very concerned about the decline of our country, and that has to do with the values of responsibility and personal morality, without which you cannot have freedom,"" Boud said.
\
She supports the proposed 8 percent state budget cuts, though she is still studying the issue, and she supports a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility.
\
Though opposed to toll roads, she said she would consider a possible gas tax hike to help fund the highways.
\
""I don't like taxes, but if a small amount of tax on, say, gasoline would do it, then I could accept that,"" she said. ""Taxes on gasoline cover all of us and visitors and truckers.""
\
Boud is running against Republican incumbent Dave Zwonitzer.
\
House District 9 covers a portion of northeast Cheyenne. Some of the area is in city limits, and it includes some county area.
\
If elected, she would receive the standard state legislator's salary, which is $150 per day of work during the session and interim committee meetings. Lawmakers are also eligible for a $109 per diem for each day of work.
"
19,"CASPER – With a month until his administration releases its first budget, Gov. Mark Gordon said all ideas to trim spending are on the table in 2020, explaining that Wyoming appears to be entering “a new period” in its history as the outlook for fossil fuels as the state’s primary economic driver grows increasingly grim.\In a conference call with reporters Tuesday afternoon, Gordon said that he anticipates a number of cuts to be included in his proposed budget, setting the stage for a major funding debate in a Legislature still smarting from massive reductions in spending two years ago.\“I think it’s going to be a tough budget,” Gordon said. “My view is that people in Wyoming are wanting to make sure we have looked fully at every opportunity we have to reduce our government spending before we start talking about any taxes.”\“From my standpoint, I’m willing to look at everything,” he added.\A fiscal conservative, Gordon has stressed improving government efficiency as an overriding theme of this year’s budget, urging each department in state government to evaluate what it could do to streamline operations and cut costs in a way that has as little impact on taxpayers as possible.\While Gordon does believe that the numbers for the next two years will present some challenges, he was reluctant to speculate on what sort of deficit the state will face, particularly with the October report from the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group still two weeks from release.\“We have reason to believe coal volumes are still pretty high, so we don’t necessarily anticipate seeing as serious a decline as we might have expected with all the bankruptcies and so on,” he said.\In the long-term, however, the state’s revenue picture is bleak. Throughout the summer, the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Committee on Revenue has been working to find ways to broaden the state’s revenue streams, so far balking at all but the smallest solutions. At the same time, Gordon’s Energy Futures Modeling Group has submitted a number of pessimistic early scenarios for the state’s revenue outlook in the future, leaving him to contemplate just how much longer the barrage of negativity from fossil fuel wary states like Oregon and Washington can last.\“It’s my view that we are entering a new period in our state’s history, and as that fully matures, we get a better understanding how long-standing these pushes for renewable energy are and how that affects things like our revenue picture,” Gordon said.\But even the low-earning bills that have survived the summer weren’t regarded warmly by the governor, who has long been opposed to any tax increases. Throughout Tuesday’s presser, Gordon was reluctant to endorse a number of revenue-raising proposals working their way through the Legislature, including a corporate income tax and an increase to the gas tax – a small solution to addressing part of a massive, multi-million dollar shortfall facing the Wyoming Department of Transportation.\Instead, Gordon stuck to a tune similar to the one he ran on as a candidate: the need to “live within our means.”\“We’re not going to go crazy on trying to find revenue to fix all of that,” Gordon said. “Part of the conversation has to be how we prioritize the roads, and how people in Wyoming understand what we won’t be able to do before we start talking about raising taxes.”\“I really favor a comprehensive look at what our future in Wyoming looks like, and that our citizenry has a chance to weigh in on it,” he added.\At the same time, Gordon is still looking to find a medium between raising the revenues the state needs without new taxes while, simultaneously, ensuring the bottom remains intact on an energy industry that is finding itself increasingly in peril.\Throughout the news conference, Gordon teeter-tottered between maintaining his promise to preserve a business-friendly environment while also keeping mineral revenue streaming into Wyoming’s coffers. Citing the tens of millions of unpaid taxes left behind the bankruptcy of coal operator Blackjewel, Gordon underlined the need to overhaul the way the state collects its ad valorem, or mineral production, taxes.\“I think we absolutely have to do something on ad valorem taxes ... I’m certainly in favor,” he said.\At the Legislature’s committee meeting on coal bankruptcies Monday, lawmakers considered reviving a 2016 bill that required coal companies to pay mandatory mineral production taxes to counties on a monthly basis. The proposed bill mirrors the model for collecting state severance taxes. The annual tax payment plan in place enables struggling coal companies to fall behind on the payment, advocates of the proposed bill reasoned.\Blackjewel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 1 with tens of millions of dollars in unpaid production taxes owed to Campbell County. This month, Campbell County approved the terms of the sale of the two mines, but will only hold the new company liable for half of the unpaid production taxes left by Blackjewel. The sale has yet to close.\The insolvent company operates Wyoming’s Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines, but plans to sell the mines to a new company, Eagle Specialty Materials, a sale Gordon said he remains “very optimistic that the two closed coal mines in Campbell County are on the verge of being reopened.”\Gordon also stood firm in his support for a recent rule proposed by the Bureau of Land Management that could reduce royalty rates for the extraction of non-energy minerals, on soda ash, on federal land checkered throughout the state. The rule change could hand operators a 2% break on federal taxes.\About 48% of federal royalties flow back to Wyoming and critics of the new rule have pointed to the loss of revenue from companies who mine public land."

CHEYENNE Police identify motorcyclist who had leg severed in collision The motorcyclist who lost his leg in a collision with a passenger car Wednesday afternoon has been identified as 56-year-old Tim Donley. The Cheyenne Police Department said in a news release Thursday that Donley was driving eastbound on East Lincolnway when his bike collided with a red Ford Focus driven northbound on Campbell Avenue by 86-year-old Patricia Haffeman. Donley's right leg was severed in the crash, and he was taken to Cheyenne Regional Medical Center for treatment. He was listed in fair condition at the hospital as of Thursday afternoon, about 24 hours after the incident. That means he was conscious with stable vital signs within normal limits and a favorable outlook, but he may be uncomfortable or have minor complications. East Lincolnway was closed until 5 p.m. Wednesday for the investigation, which is still ongoing. Police say charges have not yet been filed against either driver. School Facilities Commission OKs extra funds for new LCSD1 school The Wyoming School Facilities Commission on Thursday approved a request from Laramie County School District 1 for additional funding for a new elementary school.
\
The district sought $210,700 from the commission to help cover cost overruns for the new Meadowlark Elementary School, which is slated to begin construction later this summer.
\
The low bid for the school's construction came in more than $700,000 over what the district had anticipated, and while the district was able to make up most of that difference internally, it asked the facilities commission to cover the remainder as ""unanticipated funds."" Cheyenne Police Department holds training at Frontier Park The Cheyenne Police Department was conducting emergency vehicle operation training Thursday afternoon around Frontier Park.
\
As a result, emergency sirens were audible much of the afternoon. Officer Kevin Malatesta said the training is standard for all officers. Because police have to drive under stressful conditions, they need to practice maneuvers such as accident avoidance, pursuits and steering techniques in a safe and controlled environment, he said.
\
The training was in the Frontier Park parking lot near where the carnival is set up each year, west of the grandstand. Malatesta said it will happen several other times this year and that people should avoid driving through the area if they see that it's going on. Tax service volunteers help area people file income tax returns Seventeen local volunteers with Wyoming Free Tax Service donated nearly 1,000 hours during this year's income tax season to provide free tax preparation to residents of Laramie County.
\
The organization is made up of volunteers certified by the Internal Revenue Service each year on tax law. Residents who received help met income guidelines.
\
In 2015, the organization helped file 807 income tax returns in Laramie County. The help provided low-income filers with $337,737 in earned income tax credits, $185,987 in child tax credits, and more than $1.1 million in total refunds, according to a news release from the United Way of Laramie County.
\
The service would not be available without support from the IRS, Laramie County Community College and the United Way of Laramie County.
\
LCCC provided the location and onsite services, and the United Way of Laramie County hosted the site and provided volunteer coordination and marketing support.
\
The local Wyoming Free Tax Service site will re-open in January 2016. Boating facility improvement grants available through the state The Wyoming Division of State Parks, Historic Sites and Trails is offering funding through its Motorboat Grant Program to the state's governmental entities for public boating facility improvements.
\
Awards are based on a dollar-for-dollar cost share basis and can be used for construction, restoration, repair and other improvements of publicly owned boating facilities, including campgrounds, parking lots, shelters, picnic tables and more. Applicants may apply for up to $50,000 worth of funding. The size of the grant award will be based on the number of applicants and the merits of the proposed projects. The application deadline is Aug. 21.

Recycling program needs to get under way
\
From Edith Cook
\
Cheyenne
\
A front-page article in the Jan. 26 WTE asked whether it was ""profitable"" to recycle cardboard and paper, given that the price for these commodities fluctuates wildly and is at the negative.
\
It's the wrong question, and the wrong argument. Instead, we should ask: What are the costs, overt and hidden, of dumping recyclables into a landfill?
\
Two days later, a follow-up article on ""Cheyenne's great garbage debate"" answered that question, albeit obliquely, when it acknowledged that our city has been trucking its garbage to a Colorado landfill for almost a year, 10 trucks per day at a fee of $395 per load.
\
Meanwhile, the city's pilot project on curbside recycling has been immensely successful.
\
Dennis Pino was quoted as saying that participants recycled 30 to 90 percent of their garbage.
\
Let's suppose that 50 percent is the average. This means once all Cheyenne households are linked to curbside recycling, each and every pick-up day the city saves itself around $2,000 in fees alone, half of what it expends to dump our waste in the Colorado landfill.
\
And these are only the overt costs. The hidden costs are equally alarming.
\
Traditional garbage collection encourages wastefulness and rampant consumerism. Trash is dumped with no thought to the consequences, and residents remain unaware of the harm done to the environment.
\
Irreversible climate damage, the subject of another recent front-page article, is only the most readily discernible, in our state and elsewhere.
\
Mr. Pino was quoted that funding is in place to effect city-wide curbside recycling but that the logistics of conversion will take more time than thought.
\
Surely we can speed up the process?
\
Not only should curbside recycling be implemented with urgency and diligence, but also consumers must be educated on its necessity because if we don't change our ways, an unrelenting consume-and-trash mode will bring irreparable harm to the Earth's finite resources of water and clean air.
\
We'll render our planet all but uninhabitable - for our children, for grandchildren to come.

Among the many victims of drug use are children
\
From Karl Schneider
\
Cheyenne
\
The WTE has recently published a couple of columns promoting the legalization of drugs.
\
Before printing any more of these irresponsible pieces, I'd ask the editors and authors to do one thing: Go get some real world experience in our public schools. Do what I did, and drive a public school bus. If you do, the following might just happen.
\
If you have any powers of observation, within a few weeks you will easily be able to pick out the kids where there is drug usage in the home. They're the ones with behavioral problems and tend to be neglected.
\
If you have any compassion, within a month you'll be fighting to keep from getting sucked too far into the lives of these kids.
\
The hard ones are where mom lives with her drugged-out boyfriend. She works during the day while he crashes out on the couch. He seldom gets up and when he does, it too often ends up with the kids getting abused and sometimes hospitalized.
\
If you have any integrity, within two months you will never again state the lie that drug usage is a ""victimless crime."" You will know this because you have hauled the victims of drug usage to and from school every day.
\
If you still think drug usage doesn't destroy lives and society, just answer one question from history.
\
Over 100 years ago, the Brits wanted to control China. To gain control, one of the first things they did was to start importing opium to the Chinese. If the use of these drugs doesn't destroy the fabric of society, why did the Brits do that?
\
Drug usage is a crime with victims. It destroys lives and society.
\
This is a war that must be fought and won. Rather than promoting legalization, perhaps the WTE should look at how Malaysia deals with drugs. Check out their crime rate and quality of life. You might be surprised.

Frustrated city resident has many questions
\
From Bill Branch
\
Cheyenne
\
I have a question I'd like to have the city fathers to answer: How many Wyoming workers are working on the large flood control project?
\
Another is: Do you really use the gas tax on roads, or do you use it for other pet projects?
\
Also: Can you tell us what the extra taxes on smokes are really going to be used for?
\
This may not sound important to you, but many of us are wondering if the city fathers could answer these without going into the old two-step dance.
\
A lot of us would like answers flat out, eye to eye. It has been so long since any of us have been answered that way, we wonder if it still happens.
\
We also know that governments don't do that any more, so here's your chance to really be someone that serves us to answer all.
\
Also, forget the skyway and let's fix roads downtown and give some of that money to young people to go to work to try to live the American dream.

Vets refuse to treat cat unless they get payment
\
From Andrea Maphies
\
Cheyenne
\
The evening of Feb. 25 my cat came inside late. He was missing a large area of fur and had a quarter-size hole in his side, showing muscle.
\
I immediately called an on-call vet and was told without $135 they wouldn't even see him. I told them I don't get paid until the third and could write a postdated check. This was not good enough.
\
I was astonished. I called two other places and was told basically the same: No money upfront means no treatment.
\
My cat needed immediate cleaning, stitches and antibiotics. No one would help my poor cat.
\
This was unacceptable. No hospital turns down people because they don't have money upfront. In the case of an emergency, no vet should either.
\
This is unethical and immoral. How can people turn away a defenseless, helpless animal because they don't want to wait a couple days for the money?
\
I am truly saddened by the lack of sympathy in this situation.
\
Shame on you, vets!

Government funding
\
has too many strings
\
Dan Corbin
\
Cheyenne
\
This is in response to your request for opinions on the restoration of the cemetery vault.
\
Perhaps there are other options to historic preservation besides government funding. How about independent historical preservation? If you get government funds, you basically sell your soul to the government. You do what they want even if it is ridiculous; i.e. like having every item reproduced exactly like it was or it isn't eligible to be on the National Historic Site Registrar.
\
The depot project took ten years and millions of dollars into a black money hole. Yes, when finished it is a good job, but too long, too much and for too little.
\
Let a newly formed Independent Historical Preservation Board (IHPB) secure the land and building by purchase, donation, lease or whatever.
\
Then we could do what we want when we want to. How about a chapel motif? This could be a refuge for body, mind and spirit at any time in a very appropriate place.
\
The roof on the cemetery building does not need to be replaced, but a number of tiles need to be replaced or repaired. Anyway, let's get with the restoration any way that we can.
\
Government funds, independent or combination. To me it appears the structure was a combined sexton/caretaker's quarters and vault. Three bodies could fit in the south room which is separate from the other part by a solid wall.
\
This is a very interesting structure in its style and appearance.
\
Perhaps the light grey/brown limestone that it is primarily made of was quarried at Granite Canyon west of Cheyenne where many of our early sidewalks came from. Additional research needs to be done to complete the history of the building. I would be willing to work for and contribute to the restoration.
\
Congress should
\
reinstate the estate tax
\
W. C. ""Bill"" Besselievre
\
Cheyenne
\
Ed Feulner of the Heritage Foundation wants to kill the estate tax (WTE, Sept. 2).
\
Under current law, the death tax, as Mr. Feulner prefers to call it, is declining each year through 2010 when it will disappear. In 2011, it returns.
\
The Senate is considering a measure that will permanently repeal the tax. If it becomes law, the country will suffer gravely. Any reform (such as a misleading proposal by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.) or law that significantly reduces the estate tax will cause grave, protracted, and perhaps irreparable harm.
\
I am concerned about the annual multibillion-dollar revenue loss if the tax is repealed. Charitable losses concern me also. Despite Mr. Feulner's specious claims, large estate-tax deductions substantially increase estate beneficence.
\
While important, these are not my major concerns. Repeal of the estate tax will accelerate the concentration of wealth in the hands of a privileged few. With disproportionate wealth comes disproportionate influence and power. As corporate, government, and media-influencing plutocrats mute the voices of the less fortunate, the foundations of our democracy will crumble.
\
Democratic principles are already in decline. Political choices at election time are influenced more by the wealth of candidates than ability or merit. As wealth strong-arms merit and ability, our ""democratic"" leadership acquires a narrow, often-selfish conception of society's welfare. The interests of a privileged few usurp those of many.
\
Estate law isn't perfect. However, it is not as dire as Mr. Feulner's hyperbolic portrayal. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, estate taxes have forced ""very few"" families to sell their family businesses or farms. Minor tweaking of estate law can correct this unfortunate particular without gutting the tax itself.
\
Congress should reinstate the estate tax. The first $3 million is completely tax-free for married couples ($1.5 million for singles). It will not pauperize the rich. By taxing the people who can best afford to pay, it provides sorely needed revenues to meliorate our ballooning budget deficit. More importantly, it will buttress our American democracy.
\
More bike racks around
\
Cheyenne would be nice
\
Marguerite Herman
\
Cheyenne
\
Cheyenne residents have good reasons to use bicycles as an alternative to petroleum-fueled vehicles, among them the rising cost of gasoline and diesel, our great Greenway, sunny weather on most days, and benefits to the health of the rider and the environment.
\
Add to that the convenience of being able to ride your bike right up to the door of your destination, with no worry bout a parking ticket.
\
Yet, able-bodied people automatically reach for the car keys to go just a few blocks on a nice day. Walking is a good alternative, too, but a bicycle has the advantage of speed.
\
I have one simple suggestion to encourage the two-wheeled alternative: bike racks. Before you laugh, consider how awkward it is to find a place to lock up a bike, with only an occasional street light available. There was no bike rack on the Depot Square this past summer. Visible racks also are a low-key reminder of the bike option. (I envision the reaction similar to that in a TV commercial a few years back: A touch to the forehead and, ""I could have used my bike!"") Businesses or groups could ""sponsor"" racks, providing a service and promoting themselves, too. It also would help if Cheyenne motorists were more aware of bicyclists and more adept at dealing with bikes in traffic. That's a lot more complicated.
\
Racks would be a start.

Wyoming doesn't need
\
another nickel gas tax
\
Bill Hern
\
Cheyenne
\
I was glad to see the article on page A8 of the WTE last Wednesday regarding the ""Fuel tax out for the highway funding.""
\
I wrote a Letter to the Editor several weeks ago concerning his position regarding that nickel that was being proposed, with the skepticism of ""what good did it do to write,"" that is still a debatable issue but I am glad to see that the position I took was in accordance with the action taken. However, I could not believe a comment that was made in the article referenced above.
\
The statement made was Co-chairman Sen. Bob Peck, R-Riverton, ""......My personal opinion is that a nickel in the pricing structure would never have shown up."" I could not believe that a person living in the last several weeks and watching the gas prices sky rocket with even a threat of change of policy could make such a remark.
\
We have witnessed the gouging of J.Q. Public by the oil companies and their suppliers for the better part of two weeks now and you cannot make the residents of Wyoming believe that those same parties would not take an opportunity to collect that much more. They operate with an unrestricted hand now.
\
The oil companies and their associates have outstanding bottom lines, greatest profits of all times, why would they not capture another opportunity to enrich that position.
\
I am thankful someone in that arena has enough insight to recognize another rip off.

Bush need to come clean
\
about high fuel prices
\
Charles Esch

Cheyenne
\
An open letter to President Bush:
\
It is time for you to come clean with the American people.
\
Please explain to us why our oil from Alaska cannot be kept here in the United States. This includes all the pumping oil wells across the country. I know that there has been a terrible situation in the Gulf States. God Bless all of them!
\
However, you can't tell me that these sates control all of the oil in this county. In watching TV what is happening in the recovery of this hurricane, you went down there and rolled up your sleeves as if you were going to work. Just who were trying to impress? I know that if I was one of the victims, you would mean nothing to me unless you handed me a McDonalds sack with a cheeseburger, french fries, and a big coke in it, because I have been without water and food for four days.
\
Then you and your Daddy and Bill Clinton talked to the public asking for money. You also stated that you understand that the price of gasoline makes a hardship on the American people. Mr. Bush, you have no idea what hardship is! Try living on a very small income that is never going to go up, but the cost of living goes up regardless.
\
I have a great idea that sounds dumb, but in reality, it would be a great idea. Starting immediately, out of your pocket, buy all the fuel to run that big airplane of yours, all the helicopters, cars, and what ever else you have that the tax payer pays for. This program would also include the home town boy Dick Cheney and any politician that travels on taxpayer's money.
\
Mr. Bush, if you want to get back your popularity see that the price of gasoline at the pump takes a tremendous cut in price. You can't tell me that is not possible.
\
God Bless our troops, pray for them and the military, police, firemen, and victims of Katrina.
"
23,"A legislative committee last week advanced a bill that would reduce benefits to small electricity generators – such as homeowners with rooftop solar panels – who also use the electrical grid, a move one critic said would kill the solar-power industry in Wyoming.\Committee members advanced amendments to the state’s net-metering laws saying they would reduce “cost shifting” that unfairly burdens electricity consumers who don’t have solar or other private power systems. The Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee agreed in a meeting in Jackson on Sept. 16 it would work on the bill at its next meeting set for November.\Utility consumers who generate some of their own power forego paying a fee to the utility for that energy, those involved in the debate explained.\Some portion of that avoided fee would have covered costs for building power lines, plants, substations and so on.\As a result, those facility costs avoided by solar generators are shifted to other ratepayers, lawmakers said.\There is “some serious cost shifting” now taking place, said Rep. Danny Eyre (R-Lyman), who proposed amending the existing law. His bill would rectify the perceived problem “without killing the [solar] industry,” he said.\But the measures under consideration would have disastrous effects on Wyoming’s solar industry, said Scott Kane, co-founder and owner of Creative Energies. That three-state company has offices in Lander, Victor, Idaho and Salt Lake City.\“It will shut it down,” Kane said of the proposed amendments’ effects on his industry in Wyoming. “There’s no doubt about it.”\Lawmakers supporting the bill contend that solar power consumers don’t carry their fair share of fixed costs – the overhead costs an electric utility provider accrues erecting power lines, building substations, maintaining buildings, paying salaries and so forth.\Utilities recoup their energy costs – the price they pay for an electron – by billing a consumer for the number of kilowatt hours he or she uses each month. They recoup some of their fixed costs through a base charge imposed uniformly to all consumers in a class.\Most consumers see these two charges broken out in their utility bills.\But utilities also recoup some of their fixed costs through their energy charges, said Jim Webb, CEO of Lower Valley Energy, who testified at the hearing.\By generating their own electricity, net-metering customers typically consume fewer utility-generated electrons and have lower energy charges. In this way they avoid paying some of the fixed costs built into the energy charge.\Eyre and his bill supporters contend net-metering customers shift that portion of avoided fixed costs to regular consumers. Yet net-metering customers still take advantage of the fixed assets – power lines and so-on – when they call on the utility for power. That happens at night, using a solar-generating example, when the sun isn’t shining.\To correct that shift, the amendment would first require solar-generating and other net-metering customers to pay the retail rate for all electricity they used – even the electricity generated by private solar systems at their residences.\The utility would then pay the customers back for self-generated electricity, but only at a lower wholesale or avoided-cost rate, not the higher, retail rate.\Retail rates are about three times wholesale rates, Kane and Sen. Cale Case, (R-Lander) explained. “In simple terms,” Kane told WyoFile, “this could reduce by two thirds the financial return on solar.”\The amendment likely means installing another meter between a solar system and a residence, Kane said. That system would show how much electricity a net-metering customer generated, a figure that is not collected by utilities today.\“They would be inserting themselves into your home,” he said in an interview. “They would measure what your total energy consumption is in the house.”\The monthly bill would be for that total consumption, including the owner-generated electricity – at the utility’s retail rate that includes the portion dedicated to fixed costs.\“They would also meter how much energy your solar produced,” Kane said, “and they would pay you a diminished [wholesale or avoided-cost] amount for that.”\The amendments “unfairly identify solar” as the cause of cost shifting, Kane told the committee. “Solar is not necessarily the cause of that cost shift.”\People who are frugal, low-income families who don’t use a lot of energy, conservation-oriented households who turn out the lights or add insulation, all also shift costs to other consumers. Yet federal, state and local agencies give grants to help reduce energy consumption in those ways.\Kane pointed to the Wyoming Business Council as one such entity.\“Energy efficiency improvements are often overlooked as cost-effective opportunities for Wyoming’s local governments public schools and small businesses,” the council writes on its website. “The State Energy Office uses federal grant money to offer a range of programs to help reduce energy consumption.\Kane envisioned four homes, with Home One using a normal amount of energy from a utility. Home Two cuts its utility bill by using net-metering and a solar array. Home Three invests in new insulation, has a wood-burning stove and also cuts its utility bill. Old Widow Murphy lives in Home Four and only heats one room of her home, cutting her utility costs.\Homes Two, Three and Four all shift costs to Home One. But under the proposed changes to the net-metering law, the solar home – Home Two – will be dinged while the others aren’t.\“An identical cost shift happens in each case,” Kane said. “Somehow it’s uniquely solar that is being called the cause of cost-shifting.”\Cost shifting is not a net-metering issue as much as a rate structure problem, Kane said. “A cost shift is intrinsic to this [energy] rate,” that includes fixed costs, he said. “Low users pay less of the fixed cost than high users.”\A Teton County Commissioner who has a solar array on his roof told the committee why he put money into the project.\“Our investment in solar is an investment in somebody’s job in Wyoming,” Mark Barron said, speaking for himself. His utility bill is as little as $18 a month, he said and the Legislature needs to honor the contract it made with those like him who have existing systems.\Without addressing consumers with net-metering systems, proposed changes to the law would be “a regulatory taking of existing users,” said Hesid Brandow, an organizer with the Powder River Basin Resource Council.\The Rock Springs-Sweetwater County Airport wouldn’t have installed a solar array without the existing net-metering laws, manager Devon Brubaker told the committee. More is planned, he said. But “without true net metering we would not move forward.”\If there was any cost shifting, it was minimal, Brubaker told the committee. The issue should be addressed in rate structures overseen by regulators. Regulators could approve rates that call for taking fixed costs out of the energy charge and imposing them in the base rate.\“Let’s let the [Public Service Commission] do what they do,” he said.\Lower Valley Energy did exactly that when it oversaw a Montana utility in Red Lodge that sought help when it was in financial straits, Webb said in an interview. At a small resort area, the utility served homes that were occupied mostly in the summer. The solution was to increase the monthly base rate from $16 to $32.50\“I should be indifferent to where the electricity comes from,” Webb told the committee, “as long as we’re covering our cost … for lines.”\Webb agreed that the bill would be a death-knell for the fledgling solar industry.\“It would really kill in our area any solar going in,” he said in an interview. “It’s already tough for solar to pencil out.”\Wyoming’s Office of Consumer Advocate agreed with the principle that everybody should share the cost they impose on the system – be it transmission, generation or distribution – Bryce Freeman, administrator at the OCA told the committee.\Net metering “hardly poses a threat” or creates much cost shifting, Wyoming Outdoor Council Program Director Steff Kessler told the committee. “It is not harming others,” she said.\She touted the opportunity the industry brings for a diversified job environment, calling solar work “the fastest growing job in the U.S.” In that field, Wyoming is lagging compared to other states.\A handout she distributed showed there are 886 net-metering customers in the state and 67% generate electricity from solar devices. Almost 90% are residential users, the handout said, quoting from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\In Wyoming there are 144 jobs in the solar industry, Kessler’s handout said, quoting from the Solar Foundation. Wyoming has the eighth-best solar resources among 50 states but is ranked 43rd in solar jobs per capita, according to her group.\The averaged electricity rate in Wyoming is bout 10 cents a kWh, according to ElectricityLocal.com, which bills itself as a comprehensive local electricity guide for the nation. The average Wyoming home consumes 894 kWh a month, so the average homeowner who doesn’t use solar pays an electric bill of approximately $1,073 a year.\The Legislature enacted the existing net metering statute in 2001. Case, an economist, told the group cost shifting is consequential.\While the cost shifted today may be small, that can change quickly, he said.\“It suddenly becomes significant,” he said.\There has been a 100-fold increase in solar customers in five years in Utah, Case told the committee. “I definitely think this is a big deal,” he said."

\
CHEYENNE - Michael Crook describes himself as an ""alternative energy hobbyist.""
\
But his pastime could eliminate your monthly utility bills.
\
Beginning June 24, he will lead a second round of Laramie County Community College classes focused on residential alternative energy. The non-credit life enrichment course allows participants to learn about energy options and how to get started.
\
""Making your own power - there's a neat feeling to it,"" Crook said.
\
His home off of South Greeley Highway features a 42-foot windmill, solar panels and solar heat collectors. The combination generates about 1,000 kilowatt hours a month, and Crook uses half of that. He also earns utility credits for the extra energy he produces, since he remains connected to the electricity transmission grid.
\
Every Wyoming utility company offers net metering, allowing customers to sell back their energy excess, said Rob Morris, manager of energy services at Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power. Participants are paid a wholesale energy rate for power that is put back into the system.
\
""Some months they will use more of our electricity, and other months they will use more of theirs,"" he said. Morris added that Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power had about five customers who fell into this category in March. Today, about 12 customers generate some kind of renewable energy. He said the company also collects about one serious inquiry each week from other customers.
\
Crook said while he leads LCCC's alternative energy
\
See Energy, page A6
\
course, he is not a teacher or an engineer. But he is someone who learned how to install these systems on his own.
\
He put up solar panels on his home in California, and when he moved to Cheyenne five years ago, he decided to continue pursuing alternative energy.
\
""This is the perfect environment,"" he said. ""There is lots of wind and sun.""
\
The windmill and solar panels cover his household energy needs, while the solar heat collectors provide a steady supply of hot water. But this is not a project for everyone. It does take time and money.
\
Crook's solar panels cost $12,600, while the windmill totaled $9,000. The price tag also increases if homeowners hire extra help, and alternative energy assistance isn't always easy to find. But the systems could pay for themselves after 10 to 15 years of virtually nonexistent utility bills.
\
He said people who are still interested should start by designing a system to meet their energy needs. He encourages class members to bring in proposed projects and share what they've learned. Once homeowners determine what they want, the next steps are to buy the equipment and possibly hire professional contractors.
\
Crook said most of what he learned was through his own research. While he was familiar with solar panels, he didn't add the windmill until a year ago. It was difficult finding a home-sized unit that could handle Wyoming's stronger wind speeds.
\
He added that while wind power provides more bang for the buck, these systems have more moving parts. This means there is more potential for something to go wrong.
\
""If you want to put something up and not think about it, maybe go with solar instead,"" Crook said.
\
His last class attracted 35 participants and a waiting list equally long, said Veronica Pedersen, community liaison for Workforce and Community Development at LCCC. People can sign up for the summer session up to June 24, but it's likely a third round will be added if interest remains high.
"
25,"The article on the front page recently about proposed legislation to change how utilities charge small farms, ranches and individual homeowners for renewable electrical use has many false claims.\It seem the real reason to increase costs on solar and wind electrical use is based on the Wyoming Legislature trying to raise the cost of renewable electrical use to increase the demand for coal- and gas-generated electricity. Our legislators can’t find ways to to make up the state revenue lost by the long-term decline in use of Wyoming coal.\Utilities currently have the billing means to charge and recoup their power infrastructure costs, but they have have to go before the state utility commission. Power infrastructure maintenance cost must be fairly low. I have been been living at the same location for more than 40 years have seen no major local infrastructure changes, except for normal maintenance.\I have yet to see the any system costs come from the volume of home electrical use. Utility companies have the means to identify and charge for the infrastructure. For the Legislature to say my use of net-metering increases everyone's electrical cost is false; utilities are changing a connection fee to all users, plus make a profit on any electricity I produce over what we use.\The connection fee charges seem to vary by utility company, approximately $12 to $30 per month. I assume this cost covers maintenance expenses. Maybe they want to cover higher profits and the millions made by investors and their managers.\I can't believe my neighbors are paying more because of my environment-improving solar system. It's the utilities' profits. Also, I don't see much utility pass-through for their reduced costs by using lower-cost natural gas and renewables to produce electricity.\Because of electrical connection improvements and upgrades, including a emergency generator, we spent about $40,000 in the local community, hiring several workers and paying local taxes. Solar alone would be about $20,000, less 30% federal tax incentives. Legislators, please don’t reduce the local solar and wind generation construction business, which could help make up the loss in employment in coal mining."

\
CHEYENNE - As the days get shorter and the nights turn cooler, concerns about utility bills may be creeping back to kitchen tables.
\
The University of Wyoming Extension Services and Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power teamed up to talk energy on Wednesday evening.
\
About a dozen community members turned out for a presentation on energy efficiency and the future of energy at the Laramie County Library.
\
Alan Stoinski and Rob Morris, both with Cheyenne Light's Energy Services, gave tips to increase energy efficiency.
\
Their tips included doing an energy audit in your own home by checking for places where air is leaking.
\
Places like attics, crawl spaces and garages can be a drain on a home's energy if the warm air is escaping through leaks.
\
Also, installing programmable thermostats can save on energy bills by automatically adjusting your home's temperature.
\
Cheyenne Light offers rebate incentives from $20 to $200 for installing energy-efficient appliances such as programmable thermostats.
\
Visit www.cheyennelight.com/tips for a lot more energy-saving advice.
\
Stoinski also presented information about the Net Metering Program, which is the system that Cheyenne Light uses for customers who produce energy through windmills or solar power.
\
Those technologies at residences are good for the environment and usually lower utility costs, but customers shouldn't expect to make money by selling energy back, Stoinski explained.
\
""It's not a big money-maker, and I know they're expensive,"" he said. ""But you're doing it for the right reasons.""
\
Juliet Daniels, a University Extension educator, also explained some of the state and federal tax credits that are available for improving your home's energy efficiency.
\
Visit www.dsireusa.org for federal and state-specific information on those incentives.
\
Daniels recommended talking to a tax adviser to ensure that purchases will qualify before making them.
\
John and Kathy Stephens said they came to the presentation to learn more about saving on energy and the possibility of installing a wind turbine.
\
""Something's got to be figured out now,"" John Stephens, a miner and electrician, said.
\
Non-renewable resources are just that - non-renewable, he added.
\
Saving money on utility bills was their main objective. But keeping the planet healthy was important to them as well, regardless of the cause of the Earth's poor health.
