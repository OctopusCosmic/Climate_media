0,"If cap and trade is the answer, just what exactly is the question? Understanding a question is vital to coming up with a correct answer or to solve a problem.\If we accept the premise that global climate change is a serious threat to human existence on the planet and that global warming is due to human factors, then a global strategy must be devised and executed. This strategy must be effective, economically and environmentally viable, and must reach worldwide in its scope.\The strategy proposed in the Waxman-Markey legislation (Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009) is the cap and trade approach. Basically, here is how cap and trade works. Facilities emitting greenhouse gasses will be assigned a maximum permitted level. This will be their ""cap."" A portion of or the entire cap for a particular greenhouse gas like CO2 will be designated an ""allowance."" The allowance will be reduced over time by the government. In order to meet the reduced emissions, emitting companies will have to install control technologies, purchase credits (there's the ""trade""), or cease operations. These credits will come from an emissions banking system that brokers excess allowances t.\It has been argued that this approach has been effectively used to reduce acid rain and release of ozone depleting substances. It was also used to reduce smog in California.\Here's the problem. It is a regional or national answer to a hypothetical global problem. I certainly support environmental stewardship, clean air and a sustainable planet. However, if the question is how we address human induced factors for global climate change, cap and trade is at best an incomplete yet costly answer.\If Cap and Trade is the answer, the question must be one or more of the following questions.\* How can we export jobs, stifle the American economy, reduce tax revenues forcing increased taxes just to curb the effect on the national debt? Estimates are up to 1.9 million job losses by 2012.\* How can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions in North America while increasing greenhouse gas emissions around the planet? Emission transference to other countries is not a global answer.\* How can we set up an emissions trading scheme allowing the politically connected to become rich while actually accomplishing or producing absolutely nothing for the environment? Does anyone think the government setting up another financial institution is a good idea?\* How can we increase energy costs for Americans while limiting availability of domestic energy sources? A family of four could see energy costs raise as much as $829 per year. I wonder where the power will come from when plug-in hybrids hit the market in the next couple of years.\All this yields a best-case effect of 0.2 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 according to climatologists and that does not consider transfer of greenhouse gas emissions to less regulated areas of the planet.\The path forward to address the question of global climate change should include at least the following.\* Employ ""sound science,"" and start with re-defining the phrase. Every time I hear environmental policymakers say they are using sound science to address an environmental issue I am excited until I discover how they define the phrase. It is defined in Washington as a conclusion derived by any scientist that agrees with a certain political philosophy.\* Provide tax breaks for developing and installing control technologies to recover, reuse, destroy or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. This is partially being done but again tends to support certain regions, energy sources, or industry sectors.\* Support research into global climate change. There is much we know now and much more we can learn. This is vital to understanding the question so we can indeed come up with the right answer for the planet.\*\David Burroughs, of Haughton, is a former member of The Times Community Board."
1,"Remember the commercial from the '70s depicting the driver of an automobile littering, while an American Indian witnessing the atrocity, turns towards the camera with a tear streaming down his cheek? The first buds of a greening America sprouted.\I consider myself to be green. You know, turning off lights when not in use, replacing incandescents with CFLs, insulating well, using energy efficient appliances, low E glass, etc. Now, if you want to be good to the environment by reducing your carbon footprint ""[broken bar] fine. And I'm glad to do that.\Some of the political, global warming kool-aid is hard to swallow. Too much conjecture. Besides, it props up cap and trade, just another tax on Americans. Don't misunderstand. I like trees. I planted 13 last autumn. My concern isn't saving a tree ""[broken bar] just saving. But I've always thought it'd be great to go solar.\The cost of a solar setup has always been prohibitive though. Photovoltaics aren't cheap to manufacture. As technology progresses, costs may not necessarily decrease. But better technology will produce photovoltaics that convert energy with higher efficiency.\Though pricey, systems have just become less expensive through government incentives.\The federal government now offers 30 percent of the cost of a solar energy system as a residential/business tax credit! Just months ago, the credit was 25 percent. Any unused, excess credit is carried forward for as many years as the residential customer wants. For a business or organization, it must be used within two accounting years. Rural Ag producers and rural businesses can qualify for a 25 percent grant on top of the tax credit. Louisiana offers an additional residential 50 percent tax credit on the first $25,000 in system costs!\This credit can be used over a 10-year period or received as a refund no later than the year end. The Legislature passed two bills. One allows this state tax credit to pass to third parties. The other, Senate Bill 224 (Act 348), allows parishes to set up ""energy efficient districts"" which enable them to sell bonds for making loans to home and business owners for renewable energy improvements.\So think about it, now in Louisiana a solar energy system that costs $25,000 can be reduced to approximately $5,000 after credits and refunds! Not bad. The system could pay for itself in less than 10 years easy, plus it adds to the resale value. And guess what, the additional value it adds to your home can't be assessed to raise your property tax by the tax assessor because it's a renewable energy source. The government put the kibosh on that. And if you're selling your home, energy generation is an appealing feature.\If you are concerned about your carbon footprint, solar is clean and doesn't pollute the air or water. It replaces electricity from facilities powered by coal, natural gas and other non-renewable fuels, eliminating threats to public health from industrial emissions.\Since solar generates onsite from the sun, it's dependable and doesn't need to go through the grid first before supplying your home, making you less dependent on the utility company. Plus, any unused electrical power turns back your meter, crediting your electric bill. How cool is that?\The more we can conserve and produce our own energy, the better off we'll be. With the summer rolling blackouts and talk on Capitol Hill about a national energy tax, it's worth considering. Here's to catching rays and saving dollars.\Wayne DesLattes, of Shreveport, is a member of the Times Community Board."

What are the rules in Congress these days? It seems the playing field gets changed daily, depending on the leadership's ability to accomplish whatever it is it wants. ""Who needs a bill' to read?"" ""Let's just adopt a concept.' "" ""We'll work out the details later."" ""I'm committee chairman, and I'll get back to you with the specifics.""
\
The same thoughts are running through the Obama administration. The debate on ""cap-and-trade"" legislation has slowed in recent weeks and taken a back seat to health-care ""reform."" But, since cap and trade may also be in jeopardy of failing, the administration isn't idle in its efforts to limit greenhouse gases.
\
Now that the Waxman-Markey bill is in peril, the Environmental Protection Agency has decided that it will become the regulator not just of the environment, but of all sectors of the economy-electricity generation, transportation, industry and agriculture. In late September, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said she will use the 33-year-old Clean Air Act to now limit greenhouse gases. In her speech to the Governors' Global Climate Summit, she announced her newest effort, a way to force investment in new technology by regulating old technology out of business.
\
Administrator Jackson had already stated publicly that EPA had been prompted to determine if greenhouse gases posed a threat to the health of Americans, and if so to regulate them under the Clean Air Act. ""We soon expect a final document that will lay the foundation for reducing greenhouse emissions and confronting climate change,"" Jackson said. Only weeks later, Jackson announced a new rule that, for the first time, requires ""large sources"" of greenhouse gases to report their emissions.
\
During the 2008 presidential campaign, there was much discussion about whether the EPA should use the Clean Air Act to deal with climate change. Then-Sen. Obama said he believed legislative action was the preferred course to take. Now-President Obama reverses course when Congress is unlikely to pass what he wants.
\
Does the end justify the means? Administration and congressional leaders seem to think so, much to the chagrin of folks in Louisiana. While our state's political and business leadership attempts to retain and attract investment and jobs, many dollars simply won't come to an energy-intensive state because of the looming legislation and now negative EPA regulation.
\
Whatever is finally done in Washington will lower Louisiana's industrial output due to higher prices for energy, higher costs of complying with required emissions cuts and greater competition from overseas manufacturers with lower energy costs. When that happens, most energy prices will start climbing higher, particularly electricity and natural gas.
\
With less economic growth because of limited investment, higher costs and fewer jobs, the state likely will see the gross state product decline by hundreds of millions of dollars during the next decade, and billions over the next 20 years. And higher energy prices will ripple through every household, particularly those homes of low- and fixed-income families.
\
The rest of the year and next will be tough for Louisiana congressmen and senators. First, most are finding themselves excluded from the debate because of political partisanship. Then, they suffer the negative impact from what is being passed and the harm it will have on their state. And, finally, they have a lot of new ""rules"" to learn, because none of the old rules apply any more.

3,"Care for, value all animals\While I agree that whoever shot and hung a family pet in a tree should be held accountable, I have a question for P.A.W.S. Would your $250 part of the reward be better spent educating the public on responsible animal ownership?\You could remind them that animals, especially those thought of as part of the family, must be properly confined, fed and treated humanely.\By proper confinement, I mean adequate fencing to keep cows, horses and dogs safe and off the road. Busy roads, animals and motor vehicles are a formula for disaster. Remind them rounding up roaming animals is their responsibility not the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office or Animal Control.\By proper feeding, I mean animals should never be kept in enclosures or on chains without food or water. How many times have you witnessed a neighbor's trash strewn all over the yard thanks to a loose, hungry pet?\You would never place a beloved family member in a dirt corral with no shade, food or water. Shouldn't the same be true for a herd of 20 to 30 starving cows or horses?\By humane treatment, I mean valuing all animals and treating them with respect. Collars and harnesses should fit properly and be checked regularly to ensure they are not too tight or, worse yet, growing into the animals flesh.\If an animal dies, they should not be left to rot where they lie, becoming food for hungry dogs and coyotes. Is this any way to treat a member of the family?\If P.A.W.S. answers ""yes"" to my question, maybe such tragedies can be avoided in the future. Rest in peace, Junior.\Sarah Normand\Deville\Help at home first\After reading the June 6 Town Talk article ""Bill helps Iraqi refugees, ignores Katrina victims,"" it is irrational that our ever-wastful government is currently funneling more than $350 million to directly support the welfare and social services for Iraqi refugees.\Whatever happened to the understanding that charity begins at home?\I guess it's like pet rocks, polyester suits and platform shoes -- it died with Disco. Why aren't the Iraqi people taken care of by proceeds from Iraqi oil and gas? This country is the third largest producer in the world.\We are a compassionate people and will help take care of anyone, but we should take care of our own first.\With the homeless population more than doubled in New Orleans since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, we are in need of some healing stateside don't you think?\Their are enough issues, problems, programs and projects that need and deserve financial help right here in the United States before we should consider shipping tons of federal green across the globe.\Evan Davidson\Alexandria\Senators saved us money\Senate Bill 2191 almost passed in the U.S. Senate without us knowing had Sen. Mary Landrieu and Sen. David Vitter not stopped it.\The bill was introduced by Lieberman-Werner and was with good intentions to improve the environment by putting a federal cap and trade program to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\The main problem with the bill would have been that we would pay for this great project out of our empty pockets.\The bill still remains at the Senate until some changes have been done.\But I have faith in our congressmen that we will have a healthier environment, here in the United States and in other countries.\Lissa Malone\Lafayette\Clean-up appreciated\I wrote a letter a while back about the appearance of South Alexandria.\I have noticed some positive changes since then.

THIBODAUX -- Local officials from Lafourche and Terrebonne flew to Washignton, DC last weekend to fight against environmental policy changes on a national platform at the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference.
\
Lafourche Parish President Charlotte Randolph, her assistant Donna Toups, Terrebonne Councilwoman Arlanda Williams and Council Clerk Paul Labot, all attended the conference March 6 though March 8.
\
Randolph, a member of the Environment, Energy and Land Use Steering Committee, said her committee was focused on discussing the number of legislative proposals that would implement a federally mandated cap-and-trade system, or a tax to regulate greenhouse gases.
\
Cap and trade is a proposed emissions trading program that would allow the government to set a limit, or a cap, on the amount of pollutant that can be exposed to the environment.
\
If companies were to go over the amount set by the government, they would have to buy credits from companies who produce less.
\
""It was a good trip,"" Randolph said. ""We could gauge some success. We didn't get them to oppose cap and trade but we got a seat at the table when they talk about climate legislation.""
\
The committee Randolph served on passed a resolution that asks Congress to work with counties when discussing climate legislation in order to make sure local governments can address problems in legislation before it takes effect.

THIBODAUX -- Parish officials from Lafourche and Terrebonne flew to the nation's capital last weekend for the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference and helped the organization craft resolutions on disaster relief and environmental policy.
\
Lafourche Parish President Charlotte Randolph, her assistant, Donna Toups, Terrebonne Council Chairwoman Arlanda Williams and Council Clerk Paul Labat attended the conference March 6 though March 8 in Washington, D.C. Randolph, a member of the Environment, Energy and Land Use Steering Committee, said the committee focused on legislative proposals that would implement a federally mandated cap-and-trade system, or a tax to regulate so-called greenhouse gases.
\
Cap and trade is a proposed emissions trading program that would allow the government to set a limit, or a cap, on the amount of pollutants that can be released into the environment.
\
If companies were to go over the amount set by the government, they would have to buy credits from companies who produce less.
\
""It was a good trip,"" Randolph said. ""We could gauge some success. We didn't get them to oppose cap and trade, but we got a seat at the table when they talk about climate legislation.""
\
The committee Randolph served on passed a resolution that asks Congress to work with counties when discussing climate legislation in order to make sure local governments can address problems in legislation before it takes effect.
\
Randolph said a cap-and-trade system would cripple industry in south Louisiana, starting first with large oil-and-gas companies and spreading to marine-services companies. The result, she said, could be massive layoffs.
\
""And this is not a regional problem,"" Randolph said. ""It's a national issue.""
\
Williams, who serves on NACo's Board of Directors and as a member of the Justice and Public Safety Steering Committee, said her committee also addressed issues that could have a major local impact.
\
Williams' committee passed a resolution that proposes changes to the Robert T. Stafford Act, the law that lays out the rules for federal disaster aid, that would allow FEMA to reimburse local governments 100 percent of assessed value for structures substantially damaged due to flooding.
\
""We want an automatic 100 percent in any federal disaster,"" Williams said. ""That way we won't have to worry or request any additional assistance. And so it doesn't cause any delay.""
\
The resolutions passed by the committee became NACo's official policy, meaning the group's lobbyists will begin contacting members of Congress.
\
""It goes to the heart of NACo,"" said Jim Philipps, spokesman for NACo. ""We want to be there from the beginning of the process, and this is a way to communicate and speak with credibility.""
\
NACo was founded in 1935 and is the only national organization that represents county and parish governments in the U.S. It currently represent more than 2,400 counties.

HOUMA The federal government aims to control pollution, and the environmental damage that could result, by providing economic incentives to companies that limit carbon-dioxide emissions.
\
Environmentalists say the move is necessary to the Gulf Coast's survival.
\
Energy officials question whether it's needed and warn that the associated costs will be harmful to residents statewide.
\
The climate-change legislation, called cap and trade, sets a limit on overall emissions linked to global warming. That's the cap.
\
Companies would be fined for exceeding the cap, unless they buy carbon credits from companies with emissions to spare. That's the trade.
\
A cap-and-trade program already exists in the U.S. for sulfur dioxide, the pollutant linked to acid rain.
\
Now the focus is on carbon dioxide.
\
The House version, which seeks a 17 percent carbon-dioxide reduction by 2020, passed in June. It was introduced to the Senate last month.
\
The Senate version seeks a 20 percent reduction.
\
Cap and trade is necessary to control emissions that could lead to global warming, triggering sea-level rise that will help drown Louisiana's coastal communities and result in stronger and more damaging hurricanes, said Aaron Viles, spokesman for the nonprofit Gulf Restoration Network.
\
""Anyone who says they care about the future of the coast should support cap-and-trade legislation,"" Viles said. ""We're ground zero for global warming because we are already sinking and facing wetland loss problems.""
\
And, he added, it's unwise to ask the federal government for help to restore Louisiana's coast while simultaneously ignoring global warming.
\
""If we're advocating for resources to fix coastal Louisiana, we have to recognize that some of these problems are going to be fueled by climate change,"" Viles said.
\
But critics say cap-and-trade legislation won't solve global warming and could inflict serious damage on Louisiana's economy, which relies heavily on the oil-and-gas industry.
\
Don Briggs, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, said cap-and-trade legislation ""will harm every citizen"" in Louisiana because the associated costs will be passed onto consumers.
\
""It will definitely have an impact, and it will have an impact on everyone,"" he said.
\
Estimates are that the average consumer will pay $1,761 more a year on utility bills, an increase equal to all other current environmental regulation combined, said Joel DiGrado, spokesman for U.S. Sen. David Vitter, R-La.
\
That's particularly burdensome, Briggs said, given the current economic climate.
\
He also questions whether carbon-dioxide emissions are truly harmful to the environment.
\
""I don't buy into the global-warming myth, and I don't think (cap and trade) will really do anything to cut back on carbon dioxide,"" Briggs said.
\
Scientists agree that global warming is occurring, but there's been some debate as to whether human influence is to blame. Research shows the Earth has a long history of climate changes periods of warmth followed by ice and some speculate that the current warming trend could be part of that cycle.
\
Briggs, like some conservatives, says global warming is a ""hoax"" being perpetrated by environmentalists. Even if the U.S. were to cap carbon emissions, he said, other countries wouldn't follow suit, hurting America's competitiveness in the world industrial market.
\
Viles said he doesn't buy the argument that carbon-dioxide caps will hurt businesses or the American economy. Though he acknowledges that greening the energy industry is a ""challenge,"" he said American manufacturers will adapt.
\
""We can respond to this energy challenge in a realistic and harmless way,"" he said. ""We're not saying that people should huddle in the dark. There are ways to help curb emissions and ensure our standard of living.""
\
Louisiana lawmakers say they oppose cap-and-trade legislation.
\
U.S. Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-Napoleonville, voted against the House version.
\
""We must work together as a nation to reduce the pollution causing this climate change, but not on the back of our energy industry in Louisiana,"" he said.
\
The House-passed cap and trade bill disproportionately penalizes the oil-and-gas industry, said Aaron Saunders, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La, and would reduce domestic energy production at a time when our nation should be increasing production.
\
Cap-and-trade legislation will hurt the fragile U.S. economy, create instability in the marketplace and result in a significant loss of Louisiana jobs, Saunders said.
\
Vitter remains strongly opposed to any sort of cap-and-trade provision as well, agreeing that it would hurt the economy and raise energy costs and taxes for American families.

What is happening to America? We are now wondering what will become of the tragic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico? Will our environment and our Gulf waters ever be the same again? While all of us give our heartfelt sympathy to those who suffered greatly in this sad rig explosion, we must support the people in the fishing and oil industries who are working so hard to come up with a solution to correct this mishap. We have some of the greatest minds working on this oil crisis. It is not like someone intentionally did this to cause havoc in this country.
\
Things happen.
\
We need to have faith by praying that we will not lose both industries due to something that has unfortunately occurred. The state of Louisiana depends on the two most important industries we have. Otherwise, our state will become crippled with high unemployment for many years to come. President Obama and his administration are thinking about filing criminal charges against the oil company. They feel this mishap only confirms belief in taking our domestic oil and gas industry elsewhere along with other alternative sources of energy. We all will have no choice but to contact our elected officials once again to ask them not to pass the cap-and-trade bill, otherwise we will all be paying even higher prices for our resources. It will affect everyone. So, everyone must support our valuable Louisiana industries.
\
The state of Arizona also has its perils. It had no choice but to pass a bill to protect it from crime due to people coming across their border. President Obama and his administration feel sympathy for the wrong people and want Arizona to retract its new law or the government could pass a bill to override the state bill. What ever happened to defending the people of our own nation?
\
This is America. This administration needs to understand that we are the only country that welcomes immigrants, legal or illegal, into our country and ends up blessing them with all the entitlements that American people have paid into for many years. No wonder they are all trying to come here expecting and demanding to wave their flags in the streets and on our American soil. We have terrorists attempting to destroy our country. Yet this administration defends the very people committing these crimes rather than defending their own.
\
Support your capitalist society. Support your seafood industry. Support the domestic oil, gas and coal industries in our country by contacting your elected officials to stand on our side on these issues. Our country, our industries and our freedoms are worth saving. This covers it all. You should know that big government never worked in the early 1900s and it will not work now. Vote in only the people who will understand that we want our country back. Vote out the people who are in office for their own selfish motives or to give our money away to everyone. God bless America.

HOUMA U.S. Sen. David Vitter made stops in Houma and Thibodaux Friday to voice his opposition to the newest health-care reform bill up for discussion in Congress, and discuss other topics.
\
""There are important aspects of our health care delivery system that are broken,"" Vitter, R-La., said to a room full of doctors at Terrebonne General Medical Center in Houma. ""We need to fix Medicare reimbursements. We need to train more health-care providers and physicians. And we need to take on tort reform. We don't want to disrupt the folks that are happy with the health coverage they have right now. The bills that I see being put forward in Congress right now are not taking that approach.""
\
""It is using a sledgehammer, and not a scalpel,"" Vitter added.
\
Prior to lunch in Thibodaux with members of the Bayou Industrial Group he held his health-care forum at Terrebonne General.
\
Vitter said he has several concerns about health-care reforms being proposed in the house right now.
\
One is making the cost of health care sustainable in the long run. He expressed worry that the current plan being bounced around in Congress would push the cost of federal health care higher.
\
A fee established by government for not providing care would lead companies to pay the fee rather than the far higher cost of coverage, he said. People who have good insurance with their employers today might then be ""dumped"" into a cheaper public option plan, he said.
\
""The government option could become the dominant option overnight, and the only option within a few years,"" Vitter said.
\
Vitter added there aren't enough doctors in many places now to properly serve patients.
\
Putting more patients into the system without solving the physician shortage first will make things go ""from bad to worse,"" he said, adding that tort reform must be addressed in any health-care reform bill.
\
""This is an enormous cost to the system that could be removed if we do it right,"" Vitter said.
\
Doctors are forced to perform ""defensive medicine"" and unnecessary tests due to the ""litigious environment"" in medicine right now, he said.
\
But some doctors who spoke at the meeting said more aggressive reforms are necessary to fix the American health-care system.
\
Dr. Owen Grossman, an emergency physician at Terrebonne General, said Americans haven't ""had the courage to take a sledgehammer"" to the a defective existing system.
\
The U.S. is facing many crises in health care, including more doctors choosing highly-paid specialized medicine rather than needed family practice roles to pay off eduction debts, increased obesity and a general health crisis in the population.
\
""Forty percent of our patients don't have insurance and can't see a doctor until they're in crisis,"" Grossman said. He said he is in favor of a single-payer universal health care system to solve the problem.
\
Dr. Moira Ogden, an internal medicine physician, said private health insurance companies often dictate what kind of treatment a patient receives.
\
But other doctors said their experience with Medicare gives them a lack of faith that any government-run health coverage could be better.
\
""Medicare limits our practices in an extreme way,"" said Dr. Christopher Saal, an oral surgeon with Terrebonne General Medical Center.
\
Vitter said reforms to private insurance practices might help, such as requiring insurers to cover people with preexisting conditions or creating a public pool to subsidize their coverage, and allowing insurance purchases across state lines.
\
But Vitter added that he would fight any universal single-payer system ""with his every waking hour.""
\
""It would destroy American health care,"" Vitter said.
\
In Thibodaux, Vitter also spoke to the Bayou Industrial Group about the health proposals, but focused more on what he called ""out-of-hand"" government spending.
\
Vitter also railed against other examples of what he called high government involvement in spending, including proposals to make it easier for employees to unionize and the ""cap and trade"" bill to combat global warming, which he called ""cap and tax.""
\
""It would be bad for the country, but it would be devastating for south Louisiana,"" he said. ""It's going to move us in exactly the wrong direction.""
\
He cast Louisiana as a state with ""reasonable"" labor costs, created by ""right to work"" laws, an added incentive for companies to move to the state. That could be undone by the bill, he said.
\
""If that advantage is wiped clean, we lose an enormous advantage in bringing business to Louisiana,"" he said. Asked if any compromise proposals looked to be emerging with Democrats in Congress or the White House, Vitter expressed pessimism.
\
""So far the president's method of governing has been anything but bipartisan,"" he said.
\
Harold Templet, 63, a retired banker from Labadieville, echoed Vitter's concerns about high government spending.
\
""If Washington keeps spending, sooner or later the people who buy the debt will stop,"" he said.

9,"Lisa R. Faust\lfaust@theadvertiser.com\and The Associated Press\Cars, power plants and factories could all soon face much tougher pollution limits that Louisiana's energy-intensive industries say would devastate the state's economy.\The federal government Friday took a major step toward regulating greenhouse gas emissions, concluding that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases ""endanger public health and welfare"" under federal clean air laws, that they help cause climate change, or global warming and pose an enormous threat\""in both magnitude and probability.""\It is the first time that the federal government has said it is ready to use the Clean Air Act to require power plants, cars and trucks to curtail their release of climate-changing pollution, especially carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.\Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson cautioned that regulations are not imminent and made clear that the Obama administration would prefer that Congress address the climate issue through a broader ""cap-and-trade"" program that would limit heat-trapping pollution.\Even if actual regulations are not imminent, the EPA action was seen as likely to encourage action on Capitol Hill.\Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., whose House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hopes to craft legislation in the coming weeks, called the EPA action ""a game changer.""\""It's now no longer doing a bill or doing nothing,"" Markey said. ""It is now a choice between regulation and legislation.""\Republicans and some centrist Democrats have been critical of proposed cap-and-trade legislation, arguing it would lead to much higher energy prices. Such a measure could impose an economy-wide limit on greenhouse gas emissions but let individual companies or plants trade emission allowances among each other to mitigate costs.\Louisiana's U.S. Sen. David Vitter called EPA's move ""particularly disturbing to American business owners, workers and consumers.""\""Assuming the endangerment finding is the first step towards a regulatory scheme or otherwise to push Congress into implementing cap-and-trade, this move could have a profoundly negative impact on Louisiana's economy in particular, bringing about significant job loss and increased energy prices -- neither of which we need in these trying economic times,"" Vitter, R-Metairie, said in a prepared statement.\U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat who has consistently differed with the Obama administration over energy policy, took a less staunch approach, but remained skeptical of the move toward regulation.\""I share the administration's concern regarding the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment,"" Landrieu said in a prepared statement. ""However, I am equally concerned that misguided federal regulation of greenhouse gases could have a detrimental effect on our economy and potentially on the environment, as regulations can have unintended consequences.\""I look forward to working with the administration and Congress to ensure that we take a commonsense approach as the government weighs the costs and the benefits of regulating greenhouse gases.""\Environmentalists called the EPA action a watershed in addressing climate change.\""It's momentous. This has enormous legal significance. It is the first time the federal government has said officially the science is real, the danger is real and in this case that pollution from cars contributes to it,"" said David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.\Reaction from Louisiana's energy intensive industries ranged from cautious to critical.\Don Briggs, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, called EPA's announcement ""pure politics.""\""You have a very green administration in Washington,"" Briggs said. ""These are all people who have a history of not supporting the oil and gas industry. Taken to its ultimate end, this would shut the country down. There are 250 million cars on the road. Put 250 million horses on the road and tell me what kind of CO2 you're dealing with.""\Henry Graham, environmental and legal affairs director for the Louisiana Chemical Association, said Friday's announcement was the first step in a very long process that everyone in Louisiana should be watching closely.\""A lot will depend on the details, on what Congress does, on how far any legislation or regulation would go,"" Graham said. ""The state should be concerned about the final outcome of any federal legislation, whether it's cap and trade or a carbon tax. Fundamentally, we're shifting the burden of our economy from energy intensive industries to other industries.""\Because the bulk of Louisiana's economy is dependent on energy intensive industries, Graham is a concerned that the state would suffer disproportionately by moves to regulate greenhouse gas emission.\""We hope any federal legislation will recognize the importance Louisiana has in the big picture of the national economy. We're one of the top 3 states in chemical production and in oil and gas production,"" Graham said.\But Graham said there is a larger impact he hopes lawmakers and regulators will take into effect.\""You have to remember, we're not talking about toxins or carcinogens,"" Graham said. ""CO2 is naturally occurring, as well as manmade. The bigger questions is at what level do we regulate ourselves in Louisiana and in the U.S. while allowing other countries to be unregulated. As we reduce emissions, countries like China and India double what they're producing. Do we bankrupt this state, this country simply to shift it overseas, and the planet is not better off for it. If this is a global problem, it requires a global solution.""\The Bush administration strongly opposed using the Clean Air Act to address climate change and stalled on producing the so-called ""endangerment finding"" that had been ordered by the Supreme Court two years ago when it declared greenhouse gases pollutants under the Clean Air Act.\The court case, brought by Massachusetts, focused only on emissions from automobiles. But it is widely assumed that if the EPA must regulate emissions from cars and trucks, it will have no choice but to control similar pollution from power plants and industrial sources."

Our free-market society is under attack. The liberal, progressive, socialist Democrats are lying, bribing and cheating any way they can in an effort not to lose their power.
\
The Democratic Party is backed by the socialists. The proof was at a meeting of liberals at the Lincoln Memorial. ACORN, the NEA and the UAW, among others, bused in thousands. Communist and socialist material was given and read by attendees. They said they backed Obama. He in turn backed their rally -- not the right to have a rally but the rally itself.
\
Now these same people say they care about the environment, the Earth. Did you see how they trashed a national monument?
\
The Glenn Beck rally was just a week or so before. There was no trash left anywhere on the grounds.
\
The socialists know how to get control of America: Get control of the schools (NEA) and colleges. Get control of the media. Get control of the movie industry (pick most any actor or actress). Get control of Wall Street. Get control of major industry. Get control of the oil-and-gas industry (cap and trade).
\
Oh yes, cap and trade is still on the table. Let's see if the lame duck Democrats try to pass cap and tax in retaliation for not being re-elected.
\
Obama says he's worried about saving the environment. Hence, the drilling ban in the Gulf. Well, if it's bad for us to drill, why did he give money to Brazil and Mexico to help them drill?
\
In truth, he doesn't care about our energy producers or the environment. His agenda is to destroy our economy and our manufacturing. The Democrats have created several crises for government to solve.
\
Once the government is overloaded by entitlements, it will fail. Our economy will crash. This is what Obama and the socialists want. It will lead to anarchy and we will be ripe for takeover by our own government or someone else.
\
Many of the present people in office do not care about us but about their own power. Go vote in November. Pick candidates with moral and ethical backgrounds. We need honest, freedom-loving people to represent us. If you fail to vote, America may be doomed.
\
Please remember, if Republicans do take control of the House and Senate, Obama can veto any attempt to kill his bills for the next two years. Please be patient.
\
God bless America.

11,"The last Friday in April is National Arbor Day. You knew that, didn't you? Born in the Victorian era, Arbor Day began mainly as a gentle reminder to admire trees as things of beauty. As an environmental observance, it has been upstaged by the more comprehensive Earth Day (itself now almost 50 years old). But Arbor Day has been very much updated.\The status of trees as uniquely important environmental players has risen in recent years. Trees are now on the front lines in the battle against climate change. That's because forests absorb nearly 40 percent of human-made fossil fuel emissions every year. Burning wood and rotting trees release carbon dioxide into the air.\This makes massive deforestation a harbinger of doom for the environment as we know it. Fortunately, there are ways to head this off. Proposals to create a carbon-offset market for trees, if put in motion, could reverse the destruction. Right now, these cap-and-trade setups are open only to utilities and industrial companies. Adding trees to a cap-and-trade system would let owners of forested acres make real money by not cutting down trees.\The fate of tropical forests, particularly in Southeast Asia, is of greatest concern. The ranching, mining and timber industries have played a major role in leveling more than a billion acres of tropical forest over the last 40 years. The loss of these trees contributes an estimated 12 to 15 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions a year.\Here's a simplified version of how a market for trading carbon offsets now works: Company A reduces its emissions below a government-set cap. Company B's emissions, by contrast, exceed the limit. To avoid paying a penalty, Company B buys offset credits from Company A.\The price of credits is set by supply and demand. That these systems are market-oriented pleases conservatives committed to fighting climate change. Trade in these markets already totals billions of dollars a year.\Some 40 countries now put a price on carbon. Some do it via cap-and-trade. Others, such as Canada, place a tax on fossil fuels, with most of the proceeds going back to Canadians through reductions in their tax bills. The United States does none of the above, but California and nine Northeast states have established their own cap-and-trade systems.\Where do trees come in? Removing trees increases emissions. Letting them grow reduces them. Putting a price on leaving them alone would act as a powerful incentive to not cut them down.\There remains the dilemma that many locals in and around tropical forests currently make a living in ways that require their destruction. Under a proposal known as the Rainforest Standard, however, mechanisms would be set up to spend some of the money building new livelihoods not dependent on axing trees. Examples include ecotourism, fishing and harvesting tree products, such as nuts and palm fruit.\Ordinary homeowners don't have big forests to preserve but can nonetheless use trees to reduce their carbon footprint. Trees shading the house have a cooling effect in hot weather, reducing the need for air conditioning. And there is some money in this, of course, in the form of lower electricity bills.\Bear in mind that your state's Arbor Day may fall on a different date than the national one. Many states move their observance to coincide with the best times in their area to plant trees. The big news this year is that in addition to providing beauty and serenity, trees can play a major role in saving our world from catastrophe. Is there a poem for that?\Follow Froma Harrop on Twitter @FromaHarrop. She can be reached at fharrop@gmail.com.\Arbor Day began mainly as a gentle reminder to admire trees as things of beauty.

12,"In the 1970s and early '80s, having seized control of the U.N. apparatus (by power of numbers), Third World countries decided to cash in. OPEC was pulling off the greatest wealth transfer from rich to poor in history. Why not them? So in grand U.N. declarations and conferences, they began calling for a ""New International Economic Order."" The NIEO's essential demand was simple: to transfer fantastic chunks of wealth from the industrialized West to the Third World.\On what grounds? In the name of equality -- wealth redistribution via global socialism -- with a dose of post-colonial reparations thrown in.\The idea of essentially taxing hard-working citizens of the democracies in order to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies went nowhere, thanks mainly to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (and the debt crisis of the early '80s). They put a stake through the enterprise.\But such dreams never die. The raid on the Western treasuries is on again, but today with a new rationale to fit current ideological fashion. With socialism dead, the gigantic heist is now proposed as a sacred service of the newest religion: environmentalism.\One of the major goals of the Copenhagen climate summit is another NIEO shakedown: the transfer of hundreds of billions from the industrial West to the Third World to save the planet by, for example, planting green industries in the tristes tropiques.\Politically it's an idea of genius, engaging at once every left-wing erogenous zone: rich man's guilt, post-colonial guilt, environmental guilt. But the idea of shaking down the industrial democracies in the name of the environment thrives not just in the refined internationalist precincts of Copenhagen. It thrives on the national scale too.\On the day Copenhagen opened, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over the regulation of carbon emissions by declaring them an ""endangerment"" to human health.\Since we operate an overwhelmingly carbon-based economy, the EPA will be regulating practically everything. No institution that emits more than 250 tons of CO2 a year will fall outside EPA control. This means over a million building complexes, hospitals, plants, schools, businesses and similar enterprises. (The EPA proposes regulating emissions only above 25,000 tons, but it has no such authority.) Not since the creation of the Internal Revenue Service has a federal agency been given more intrusive power over every aspect of economic life.\This naked assertion of vast executive power in the name of the environment is the perfect fulfillment of the prediction of Czech President (and economist) Vaclav Klaus that environmentalism is becoming the new socialism, i.e., the totemic ideal in the name of which government seizes the commanding heights of the economy and society.\Socialism having failed so spectacularly, the left was adrift until it struck upon a brilliant gambit: metamorphosis from red to green. The cultural elites went straight from the memorial service for socialism to the altar of the environment. The objective is the same: highly centralized power given to the best and the brightest, the new class of experts, managers and technocrats. This time, however, the alleged justification is not abolishing oppression and inequality but saving the planet.\Not everyone is pleased with the coming New Carbon-Free International Order. When the Obama administration signaled (in a gesture to Copenhagen) a U.S. commitment to major cuts in carbon emissions, Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote the president protesting that he lacks the authority to do so unilaterally. That requires congressional concurrence by legislation or treaty.\With the Senate blocking President Obama's cap-and-trade carbon legislation, the EPA coup d'etat served as the administration's loud response to Webb: The hell we can't. With this EPA ""endangerment"" finding, we can do as we wish with carbon. Either the Senate passes cap-and-trade, or the EPA will impose even more draconian measures: all cap, no trade.\Forget for a moment the economic effects of severe carbon chastity. There's the matter of constitutional decency. If you want to revolutionize society -- as will drastic carbon regulation and taxation in an energy economy that is 85 percent carbon-based -- you do it through Congress reflecting popular will. Not by administrative fiat of EPA bureaucrats.\Congress should not just resist this executive overreaching, but trump it: Amend existing clean air laws and restore their original intent by excluding CO2 from EPA control and reserving that power for Congress and future legislation.\Do it now. Do it soon. Because Big Brother isn't lurking in CIA cloak. He's knocking on your door, smiling under an EPA cap.\Write Charles Krauthammer at letters@charleskrauthammer.com."

U.S. Sen. David Vitter said a new carbon-tax bill being proposed on Capitol Hill reminds him of the failed cap-and-trade legislation from 2009.
\
A carbon tax, in theory, puts a price on certain pollutants to curb them and is often held up as a solution to global warming.
\
The cap-and-trade concept would have forced plants, manufacturers and other businesses to buy transferable permits for their emissions, which would be capped.
\
""It's not just energy prices that would skyrocket from a carbon tax, the cost of nearly everything built in America would go up,"" Vitter said.
\
Vitter, the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Committee, has introduced legislation along with 19 cosponsors that says a carbon tax is not in the economic interest of the United States.
\
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Chairwoman Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, are sponsoring the carbon-tax bill.
\
Under the legislation, a fee on carbon-pollution emissions would pay for investments in energy efficiency and sustainable technologies such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass.
\
The proposal would also provide rebates to consumers to offset any efforts by oil, coal or gas companies to raise prices.
\
""The leading scientists in the world who study climate change now tell us that their projections in the past were wrong;"" Sanders said, ""that, in fact, the crisis facing our planet is much more serious than they had previously believed.""
"
15,"dhaag@gannett.com\In the first few months of office, U.S. Rep. John Fleming, of Louisiana's 4th District, has plunged into the dozens of complicated issues facing the country.\He went to Washington as a physician and small-business owner but has had to become an expert on the military, oil and gas industry, and the economy.\Earlier this week, he sat down with members of The Times Editorial and Community Boards to discuss issues ranging from defense to health care to earmarks. Here are some of his thoughts.\Question: Can you make us feel good about the investment in cyber innovation tied to Barksdale Air Force Base? We put $107 million of Bossier taxpayer dollars and state taxpayer dollars in that effort (to lure Cyber Command, which is now going to San Antonio).\Answer: ""One, remember Cyber by definition is not a locationally directed apparatus. It's everyplace and I think it gives us the opportunity to have research in any location and this is a perfect research location in terms of infrastructure. ... The Air Force may be positively disposed to use that building for global strike (the nuclear weapons command to be based at BAFB) in some way.""\Q: In light of the North Korean tests over the weekend, any thoughts about our nation's nuclear stance?\A: ""I'm very concerned because our president has already begun to cut funding for missile defense. And the dynamics are different today than during the Cold War when you basically had two major powers with nuclear capability, and deterrence is the way we ensured we would not have nuclear war. ... Today, we have a situation where multiple countries, including third world countries, are developing rapidly nuclear capability and the ability to deliver that. ... It's just a very few short years ahead of us now before both Iran and North Korea can deliver an ICBM with a nuclear warhead anywhere they want. It's exactly the wrong thing to do to pull back on missile defense.""\Q: What approach will you be advocating as we march toward health care reform?\A: Republicans and Democrats agree on 80 to 90 percent of health care issues. They both want better access to care, affordable care, portability of insurance, doing away with prior-condition clauses, emphasizing wellness and a primary-care centered system. They disagree on the administration.\The administration has pushed a single-payer system where government would pay for everything. ""Single-payer systems ultimately bump up against the realities of budgets.""\Instead, Fleming supports a private insurance system. Government would help pay premiums on a sliding scale, and people would also have health savings accounts. Under this system, he said government and insurance companies wouldn't dictate what doctors can charge and patients would have to be more engaged in their health care.\""A system is the healthiest when you have people competing in an open and free market for dollars and for delivering goods and services that are going to meet the expectation of consumers. ... We want to make our patients not only patients but consumers. ""[broken bar] What we have today is not transparent. Consumers don't have choices ""[broken bar] and if we go to single payer system, we're going to lose a lot of choices.""\Q: Where do you see stimulus having the greatest impact in the district?\Though he voted against it, Fleming said infrastructure would be his highest priority for the stimulus money.\""Through the stimulus, we only got $30 million for I-49. When you think about it """" as ambitious as the stimulus package was and supposedly infrastructure was going to be the big pull on that """" we got a pittance.""\He also is planning to hire a grant writer to help local groups find government money for their projects. ""That's really a solution to the earmark issue. I don't want to be telling I'm against earmarks, so I'm not going to support your project. I'd much rather support the project in a way that meets appropriate criteria ... Now we have a pathway.""\Q: New Social Security numbers came out saying the rate of insolvency is approaching. Are people talking about that in the House and what should be done?\A: ""The truth is the American people have proven they don't want to hear about Social Security insolvency. ... We've got to address solutions whether raising the age or means testing. But no one wants to discuss it because it's political suicide.""\Q: What do you think about the cap-and-trade legislation currently being debated?\A: ""Cap and trade is a bait and switch. ... It's another way to raise taxes."" He cited the example of Spain which has used cap and trade as a way to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, and said it has resulted in higher energy prices and unemployment. And some manufacturing companies left Spain for the United States after the policy was in place.\""It will have little or no impact on the environment, raise the average utility bill by $3,100 a year and impact the poor more than others.""\Instead, Fleming supports expansion of nuclear energy.\PULLOUT: 4th District man's in D.C.\Dr. John Fleming\Party: Republican\Hometown: Minden\Elected: 2008\Key votes: Stimulus Bill """" no\2010 budget """" no\Credit cardholders bill of rights """" yes\Helping families save their homes act """" yes\Veterans Employment Rights Realignment Act """" yes\Voting trend: voted with party 97 percent of the time\Source: washingtonpost.com and Times research"
16,"At a time when people are asking ""where are the jobs,"" thousands of high-paying jobs are waiting to be created in America's energy industry. Jobs can be created today by further developing America's natural resources such as oil and natural gas and expanding on new technologies such as hydraulic fracturing or ""fracing,"" a critical tool in tapping the huge potential of our country's natural gas supply.\Instead of a comprehensive national energy policy that would create jobs, this administration and the liberals running Congress are trying to ram through a ""cap and trade"" national energy tax that would ship millions of jobs overseas and raise energy prices on American families. And these same people continue to threaten our energy security through attempts to put an end to critical technologies like fracturing.\In Louisiana, the energy industry is among our top employers; and we are proud to be one of the largest producers of domestic energy in the United States. Louisiana has the second-largest refining capacity in the U.S., with 2,300 active oil and natural gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and 19 crude oil refineries. More than 80 percent of the nation's offshore oil and natural gas is produced off our coast.\And, more recently, our state has seen huge successes in the Haynesville Shale in northwest Louisiana. By using environmentally sound energy production technologies such as fracturing and horizontal drilling, we are safely unlocking huge amounts of clean-burning, job-creating natural gas. In fact, thanks to fracturing, which has been safely used for 60 years, Louisiana's energy industry created almost 33,000 jobs and generated $3.2 billion into our state's economy.\Unfortunately, this economic activity and job creation is threatened by misguided Washington policies such as ""cap and trade"" and billions in new, burdensome taxes on homegrown energy exploration.\Some in Washington are even working to strip energy-producing states of their ability to regulate fracturing. Turning this authority over to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would threaten energy production altogether and could severely hurt job creation and economic activity at a time when we absolutely need it.\Louisiana's Legislature formally urged Congress to ensure that fracturing remains tightly regulated by the states, as it has for 60 years. A number of other energy-producing states that share Louisiana's common-sense approach to allow states to effectively regulate fracturing have passed similar resolutions.\Turning the regulation of fracturing over to the EPA is not only unnecessary but would represent nothing more than a one-size-fits-all power grab by those who oppose responsible, 21st-century American energy production. Louisiana, along with virtually every other energy-producing state, already has comprehensive laws in place to protect drinking water sources and ensure that shale gas production does not compromise the environment.\Because of these effective state protections -- and the commitment from industry -- fracturing has been used in more than 1 million wells throughout the U.S. without a single case of groundwater contamination. Not one in 60 years. The EPA confirmed this fact at a recent Senate hearing. And just weeks ago, a top EPA drinking-water official said, ""State regulators are doing a good job overseeing hydrofracking, and there's no evidence the process causes water contamination.""\Fracturing is not only a safe way of increasing our nation's domestic energy supply, but it is a proven way to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil, create good American jobs and keep energy prices stable for struggling families, senior citizens and small businesses.\The American people deserve common-sense solutions that will help redirect our weakened economy. We should promote ideas that create jobs and harness -- not stifle -- the American ingenuity that has helped us become the greatest nation in the world.\U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise represents Louisiana's 1st Congressional District and serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Energy and Environment subcommittee. His Web site is scalise.house.gov."
17,"
With rising energy costs making it more expensive to drive our cars, heat our homes, and fuel our sputtering economy, many Republicans are criticizing the Obama administration for a failure to adopt a comprehensive energy policy. I believe that critique lets the president off too easily. His administration does have a national energy policy--it's just a subservient by-product of his radical environmental policy.
\
This administration willfully ignores rational choices that would lower energy prices and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign energy sources.
\
In 2011, the average annual prices of a barrel of oil and a gallon of gas were higher than at any time in the last 150 years. If we are going to be serious about rebuilding our economy and helping American families who are struggling to make ends meet, this president must take action.
\
To pursue national and economic security, the president's first obligations on energy should be to increase the quantity of domestic energy sources and to decrease the cost of that energy to consumers. That starts with implementing a clear strategy of increasing energy production in all sectors--including the hydrocarbon sources abhorred by the left--and by providing the kind of long-term regulatory certainty that private capital demands before investment.
\
While the president is quick to tell anyone who will listen that domestic oil production is higher today than at any time since 2003, that's not the whole story. The truth is that today's production levels are not based on anything this president has done, but on the decisions made by private companies before he took office. And much of this production is taking place on private land.
\
Because energy prices are driven by a sense of future risk, the president should create a more predictable environment for exploration and production. In an election year, the federal government is now suddenly attempting to reach pre-moratorium--that is, pre-2010 BP oil spill -- levels for approving deep-water drilling permits. That's not enough. The average number of deepwater drilling permits approved monthly by the administration is down by nearly 30 percent from the historical norm prior to the spill.
\
The reality is that the Obama administration slowed the permitting process long before the spill happened. Rather than playing catch up, we're falling further behind. The American people and the oil and gas industry need certainty that energy independence, not politics, will drive our nation's security.
\
The president should also start opening new fields where there is clear bipartisan local support -- along the mid-Atlantic coast, the Eastern Gulf, and in Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge -- and he should stop slow-walking lease sales for onshore drilling on federal lands, which in 2011 reached an all-time low (since 1984), when discounting for leases sold in previous years.
\
He could also send a clear signal that his administration will not shut down the revolutionary hydrofracking technique that is making our nation the world leader in natural gas. It's an industry that supported more than 600,000 jobs in 2010 and is expected to add more than a quarter million more jobs by 2015. The affordable prices that come with abundant natural gas have a tremendous impact on our steel manufacturers, fertilizer companies, plastics companies and individuals who need to heat their homes and fuel their vehicles. If you want more manufacturing, you need cheap and reliable natural gas -- period.
\
By signaling its understanding that fracking is a safe way to produce energy, the administration would allay immense concern and encourage private industry to invest in a more extensive natural gas distribution and utilization infrastructure.
\
Third, the president could reverse a series of cabinet-level decisions that are at odds with a strategy of affordable domestic energy production. That starts with rebuking Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who once said that our goal should be to increase gasoline prices to the levels seen in Europe. It also means suspending regulations like Tier 3 gasoline standards that are expected to increase gas prices by 25 cents a gallon. And it means ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to go in the opposite direction from its currently hostile stance on domestically abundant clean coal energy.
\
These regulations -- plus the mere threat of flawed proposals like cap and trade, which in 2008 the president said would ""bankrupt"" anyone who wanted to open a coal plant -- are sending a message that the United States is not a viable place for major, multiyear capital investments.
\
Some estimates suggest that the U.S. could overtake Russia as the world's top producer of oil and gas by 2020, and we should not be singling out one industry for tax increases that would inevitably lead to higher prices for American consumers. Rather than punish one type of producer in favor of crony capitalism, we should adopt a flatter tax code with lower rates and no loopholes that allows different energy types to compete in the marketplace.
\
Finally, the president should announce today that he's going to reverse his decision on the Keystone XL pipeline. This pipeline would produce 20,000 construction jobs and 100,000 indirect jobs, and it would provide a much-needed transportation line between oil refineries along our Gulf Coast and production facilities in Canada, not to mention the booming Bakken oil fields of Montana and North Dakota. Our friends to the north have been reliable and steadfast trading partners, and the president should be making this pipeline decision on policy grounds instead of cheap political appeals to his liberal base.
\
President Obama claims to be focusing this election year on the American economy. To make that pledge true, he must make wholesale changes to his energy policy and put energy prices and energy independence ahead of zealous adherence to left-wing environmental theory.

All over the world, cities want to nurture entrepreneurs and attract innovation.
\
One approach has been to establish ""accelerators"" or ""incubators"" -- programs where entrepreneurs receive business assistance, get mutual support and often share workspace.
\
For a good example of accelerators, head to New Orleans.
\
After Hurricane Katrina, civic leaders launched a variety of programs. I recently toured the BioInnovation Center and met graduates of the IdeaXcelerator run by the nonprofit Idea Village.
\
The BioInnovation Center is located in a new, $48 million Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design gold-certified building in the heart of New Orleans' medical and business district. The center provides 66,000 square feet of subsidized ""wet"" labs and offices, and offers business assistance, events, financing and legal help.
\
""We've built a community where entrepreneurs and scientists can learn from one another,"" President Aaron Miscenich said. Tenants in the BioInnovation Center also have created hundreds of well-paying jobs for the city.
\
These entrepreneurs -- and the companies they run -- represent the vibrancy and diversity of New Orleans' new business climate.
\
Dr. Tarun Jolly, Renaissance RX
\
""I'm so proud of what's going on here in New Orleans. It's why we chose the name Renaissance,"" said Dr. Tarun Jolly, founder of Renaissance RX. By identifying through DNA testing how patients metabolize specific drugs, Renaissance RX enables physicians to tailor prescriptions to each individual's needs.
\
Renaissance RX launched in the BioInnovation Center, and its rapid growth means that it has just about outgrown the facility. Started with four employees in October 2012, the company now employs 58 employees with a contracted sales force of 250 to 350 and another 300 DNA collectors working in 44 states.
\
""I'm now recruiting people from California,"" said Jolly, 38. He's also collaborating with the University of New Orleans to create a training program to meet growing local biotech demand for talent.
\
Sarah Mack, Tierra Resources
\
Originally from Colorado, Sarah Mack, 37, came to Tulane University in New Orleans for her doctorate in water resources.
\
""I fell in love with the city,"" she said.
\
After Hurricane Katrina, Mack was one of the city's emergency managers, looking at how to make the city safer and restore wetlands.
\
But ""there was a $5 billion gap of what needed to be done,"" Mack said.
\
She looked at other ways to attract financing for wetlands restoration.
\
""In 2007, the concept of carbon credits was booming,"" she said.
\
Because of cap-and-trade policies, a market-based idea to control pollution, companies that emit too much in greenhouse gases can offset their carbon use, but none had applied credits for wetlands restoration. Mack created a for-profit company to do just that.
\
The IdeaXclerator helped Mack transition her idea into a business.
\
""I had a Ph.D. but didn't know business. When I won the Water Challenge, a lot of that funding ($50,000) was used to get a Conoco Phillips contract."" Her company now is working on projects in California and Florida and soon will be working internationally.

Although Solomon's family has been well entrenched in New Orleans, he left for brighter lights and a bigger city for college.
\
""After Katrina, I could have stayed in New York and struggled,"" he said. ""There were a ton of lighting designers much better than me, and they weren't making any money. It was the right time to go home.""
\
Solomon realized that New Orleans was host to world-class events, such as the Super Bowl, NCAA Final Four and NBA All-Star Game.
\
But ""we had third world resources,"" he said.
\
So he and his partners set up a production design and implementation firm. They light the Superdome, built eight broadcast environments during Super Bowl XLVII and are designing a Miss USA Pageant. They've been nominated for a set design Emmy.
\
Most important, they are creating jobs.
\
""We exhausted the workforce of people doing what we do. So now we looking in related fields,"" Solomon said. They're also attracting new workers from as far away as Los Angeles.
\
""The pay is lower,"" he said. ""But the cost of living is less, and the pace much saner.""
\
Together, these entrepreneurs and other graduates of New Orleans' accelerators are generating hundreds of jobs, creating optimism and building 'buzz' for this rapidly revitalizing American city.

20,"wjohnson@dailyworld.com\The state budget, which is expected to shrink by another billion dollars next year, is a topic of worry for state business leaders.\""The budget will be our issue one, two, three this year,"" Dan Juneau, president of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, told the Opelousas Noon Rotary Club on Tuesday. ""It is not a fun time to be a state legislator.""\For Juneau, the answer is to cut government spending, pointing out that while state revenue has been growing for much of the past decade, state spending has increased even faster.\""The reason for our budget problem is we spent that money on recurring expenses,"" Juneau said. ""We need to spend down to our 2007 level.""\He said, despite the state's budget problems, there are still bills being introduced to increase the state's homestead exemption, which is already the highest in the nation.\While the state exempts the first $75,000 in value of a home, he said that tax doesn't go away, but is instead transferred onto the back of business and industry.\He said homeowners in Louisiana now pay the lowest rates ""in the nation, probably in the galaxy.""\""Our residential property tax is 51st out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia,"" Juneau said. ""The next closest is Alabama, and homeowners there pay twice as much as Louisiana.""\While not supporting a reduction in homeowner taxes, Juneau did brag of the many tax breaks for business and industry that his organization has championed.\He argued that business is the source of wealth and jobs and that Louisiana, with its host of unique business and industry taxes, has traditionally been a hostile environment for business.\Juneau said his agency doesn't oppose all taxes on business but does try to reverse the state's unique or excessive taxes.\""Our approach is to see where we stick out like a sore thumb and correct that,"" Juneau said.\While not happy with the state budget, Juneau told the Rotarians that what is happening in the nation's capital terrifies him.\He called the ""cap-and-trade"" carbon credit system designed to fight global warming ""a fraud;"" the Employee Free Trade Act, which would make it easier to form a labor union, a move that will ""turn labor relations on their head;"" and the health-care bill that is currently before Congress ""is like reading a horror novel in a raging thunderstorm.""\While calling the goal of universal health care a ""noble goal,"" he said it comes with a price tag that ""will bankrupt our children and grandchildren,"" Juneau said."

Reject climate-change regulations or solutions that will cost jobs and increase burdens on American taxpayers.
\
I am disappointed that President Obama is pledging billions of American taxpayer dollars for solutions that do nothing to improve our environment.
\
Further, giving away billions of dollars and promising to curb emissions, without knowing whether this will help our climate, will ruin America's economy while allowing other industrial countries to grow and prosper.
\
Unfortunately, there are some in Congress who want to pass laws that limit the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
\
They claim that CO2 is a pollutant. That is a myth and absolutely false. There is no scientific proof that CO2 is a pollutant. The science is inconclusive whether this would slow, stop or reverse climate change.
\
Here's what I am telling my representatives in Congress:
\
1. Slow down: The rush to label CO2 as a pollutant or pass cap-and-trade legislation will hurt our nation's economic recovery.
\
2. Know the science: There no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant.
\
3. CO2 has benefits: Higher CO2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life.
\
4. Other factors are involved: As for the greenhouse effect, which warms the earth, CO2 is not even close to being the most important of the greenhouse gases. Most of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapor, which is about 30 times as abundant in the atmosphere as CO2 and has a much larger greenhouse effect.
\
5. CO2 is green: More importantly, it has been proven that higher levels of CO2 result in more plant growth as well as less water being required for plants to grow faster and larger.
\
6. CO2 supports life: While CO2 accounts for less than 1 percent of the atmosphere, CO2 is essential to life on earth. In fact, we all exhale CO2 and enjoy it in our carbonated beverages.

BILOXI, Miss. -- Republican presidential contender Rick Santorum tapped a chunk of oil shale against the podium at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum and Convention Center.
\
""Thanks to the Marcellus shale and the Utica shale, we're seeing our economy growing again, and we've seen a tremendous reduction in natural-gas prices,"" the former Pennsylvania senator told the audience of hundreds. ""It's pretty remarkable to think that you can get oil out of this, but through that hydraulic fracturing you can.""
\
The show-and-tell moment occurred during the first-ever Gulf Coast Energy Summit, organized by the Thibodaux-based Gulf Economic Survival Team and the Consumer Energy Alliance.
\
The conference also drew Republican contender and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, as well as oil, natural-gas, manufacturing and political leaders. It was held on the eve of today's GOP presidential primaries in Mississippi and Alabama.
\
""We're a bipartisan organization, but the timing does allow us to make this a cornerstone issue of the election,"" said Lori LeBlanc, executive director of the Survival Team.
\
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, considered the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination with 454 delegates, was also invited to speak, according to LeBlanc, but he was campaigning Monday in Alabama.
\
LeBlanc said U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar was also invited but declined to attend.
\
The Survival Team is a group of local energy businesses that formed in response to the six-month moratorium on offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. The moratorium, which was followed by a more-thorough but slower federal permitting process, was part of the Obama administration's reaction to 2010's Gulf oil spill.
\
During his speech Monday, Gingrich called the permitting process ""an absurdity"" and added that safety inspections for rigs need to be streamlined and modernized.
\
""Deepwater Horizon in part is a function of a bureaucracy that didn't even know how to deal with rigs or doing things under those kind of pressures,"" he said.
\
He added he would replace the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with ""a brand new Environmental Solutions Agency.""
\
""It is very clear the EPA has evolved into an anti-jobs, anti-business, anti-local government institution,"" he said.
\
Santorum equated climate science with political science and scoffed at the notion that carbon dioxide could have a detrimental effect on the environment.
\
""Tell that to a plant,"" he said, adding that he had always supported the energy industry while his opponents have wavered by supporting cap-and-trade measures.
\
""When it was tough to stand up and say you were for energy production, when it was tough to say, 'that stuff in the ground is an asset, not a liability,' I stood up and said the science was bogus,"" he said.
\
In this fall's presidential election, energy has already become a key political issue, with ties to the economy, states' rights to self-regulate, foreign policy and national security.
\
The candidates criticized the Obama administration for not supporting the Keystone XL pipeline that would send Canadian oil to Texas refineries, the lengthy permitting process for offshore drilling and the president's interest in green energy.
\
Gingrich said the general election will be a choice between $2.50 for a gallon of gasoline or $10 per gallon and a ""fantasy"" of creating renewable energy from algae.
\
White House officials have joined the fray, and on Monday in Washington, D.C., Salazar said the administration's actions have cut oil imports by 10 percent compared to a year ago and that domestic production is at an eight-year high. Salazar said the numbers represent ""a dramatic achievement and one that we are very proud of.""
\
But locals say offshore drilling in the Gulf has still not recovered from the moratorium that ended 17 months ago. LeBlanc said she hopes Monday's event will highlight local industry's struggle.
\
Among speakers was Lafourche Parish President Charlotte Randolph, who said the drilling ban and subsequent permit slowdown had a ""devastating"" effect on her community.
\
""With all the speeches you've heard today, I can bring it on home for you. The energy industry is part and parcel of our community,"" she said. ""Our country is thirsting for energy, and the folks down here along the Gulf Coast know how to produce it.""

"
23,"WASHINGTON -- Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent. Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.\So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.\The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. Remember diplomat George Kennan's axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table? The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.\The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised."" The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of Copenhagen conference.\There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, two stubborn facts -- the two most populous nations. On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth -- together they account for 26 percent of emissions -- jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades. Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them.\But do not really embrace them. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel. When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""\In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago. Then intelligent people agreed (see above) that global cooling threatened human survival. It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average."" Some scientists proposed radical measures to cause global warming -- for example, covering the arctic ice cap with black soot that would absorb heat and cause melting.\Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change. For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement -- people eating locally grown foods from small farms -- actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.\Although the political and media drumbeat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:\They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!""\In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or\anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes. As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed -- half the average of the last 50 years -- and none have hit the United States.\Write George Will at Washington Post Writers Group, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071."
24,"The miracle of McCain\WASHINGTON -- In the genuine historical miracle of Barack Obama -- it was only 43 years ago, half a historical eye-blink, when African-American voting rights remained unsecured -- the political and personal miracle of John McCain has been largely overshadowed.\A year ago this summer, the McCain campaign was a bankrupt political joke; the political class only mentioned it to speculate when it would be mercifully euthanized.\What followed was one of the most improbable comebacks of American political history. The electoral stars aligned into a powerful, unpredicted syzygy: The surge in Iraq worked, the immigration issue faded, the conservative movement did not coalesce around a single opponent. McCain won by shedding his early, bloated campaign structure and emphasizing his own large personality.\The style and approach of general election campaigns are often conditioned by the method of victory in the primaries. The Obama team ends the season like a battle-worn Army division -- organized, relentless and skilled at fundraising, registering voters and getting them to the polls. Members of the McCain team feel more like survivors of a near-death experience -- convinced that the virtues of their candidate and the blessings of the political gods matter more than the money, phone banks and door-knocking of traditional politics.\This worries some Republican strategists. One recently described the McCain campaign to me as the political equivalent of a Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland movie: Every morning a few guys get together and say, ""Let's put on a show!"" McCain's state campaign organizations, coalition outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts are weak or nonexistent. But McCain campaign officials are convinced that they will win -- if they win -- in a different manner than the methodical Bush campaigns of 2000 and 2004. McCain will either catch fire, or he won't -- and traditional efforts to boost turnout, in this view, are not likely to make the difference. Given its history, the McCain campaign is understandably proud of its stripped down,\seat-of-the-pants, insurgent campaign style. But it may eventually be useful to have a serious campaign organization in, say, Colorado.\The personal miracle of McCain's presidential run is even more extraordinary. It is obvious -- and therefore often unstated -- that the journey from a 4-by-6-foot Viet Cong cell to the 36-by-29-foot Oval Office would be unprecedented. It would be as though George Washington were captured by the British, who snapped his legs in a torture cell; or Ulysses\Grant were nearly starved to death at Andersonville Prison; or Dwight Eisenhower had been interrogated and beaten by the Gestapo in a German Stalag. All three, I imagine, would have been honorable, defiant and arrogant enough to survive. But McCain has proved it.\McCain's experience, unlike some war stories, grows more shockingly impressive upon examination. Physical courage and mental toughness may not be requirements for the presidency, but they are at least as relevant as service in the Illinois Legislature. And McCain's election as president would, in its own way, be historic -- finally and fully honoring the lessons of heroism that came out of America's conflicted experience of Vietnam.\All these experiences, political and personal, have created a unique candidate -- a man more driven by instincts of honor than ideology, predisposed to believe in his own virtue, equally predisposed to confuse opposition with dishonor. At its worst, this approach has alienated many of his Senate colleagues and reportedly led McCain to the brink of leaving the Republican Party in 2001, more out of pique than principle. At its best, this approach has seemed like a populist, reform-minded conservatism, aimed at breaking up concentrated, selfish interests that threaten the public\good -- from his campaign against big tobacco, to his anger at inflated corporate salaries, to his disgust with congressional earmarks and pork-barrel spending, to his support for increased automobile fuel efficiency standards and a cap-and-trade system to limit carbon emissions.\Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution calls McCain's policy agenda ""a promiscuous heap of interesting ideas that will not cohere in one administration"" -- a judgment some Republicans share. Up to this point in the campaign, the charge has not been much of a problem -- in this environment, a reliable, robotic Republican of the Romney-sort would be nowhere near Obama in the polls.\But the personality- and destiny-driven McCain campaign of the primaries is reaching its natural limits. Eventually a presidential campaign needs a national organization. And eventually McCain must define McCainism.\*\Michael Gerson is a columnist for the Washington Post."

HOUMA The refrain ""Drill, baby, drill"" used at Republican rallies and the GOP convention this year, has become a drumbeat for consumers anxious about high energy prices.
\
And it's put offshore-energy exploration, the lifeblood of the Houma-Thibodaux economy, in the national spotlight.
\
Pro-exploration Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and drilling skeptic Sen.
\
Barack Obama, D-Ill., offer voters two very different views on the subject. The two men are the major presidential contenders on the Nov. 4 ballot.
\
McCain has cast himself in the pro-drilling camp, repeatedly calling for repeal of the federal ban on exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf. That ban was lifted in this year.
\
He also chose Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a fierce advocate for increased exploration, as his running mate.
\
Both mark a shift from the 2000 campaign when McCain vied for the GOP nomination against George W. Bush in which he opposed new drilling and sought to differentiate himself from other Republicans by reaching out to environmental groups.
\
In August, he visited the Chevron Genesis, a massive production platform in the Gulf of Mexico, and called for aggressive exploration.
\
""Americans across our country are hurting, as we all know, because of the cost of energy,"" McCain said aduring that appearance. ""Gas prices are through the roof. Energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills, making it more expensive to feed our families. Now as we prepare for the winter, it's time for us to be more serious about our home-heating oil needs. ... We need to drill offshore and we need to do it now.""
\
Obama has been less enthusiastic about offshore exploration, though he has said he could support limited drilling as part of a comprehensive strategy like the ""Gang of 10,"" a plan from U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., that couples new exploration with support for alternative energy and other initiatives.
\
""I remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short-term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term, though I do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact,"" he said in August in reaction to the bi-partisan plan backed by Landrieu and others.
\
Some analysts agree with Louisiana economist Loren Scott, who said McCain's plan to expand drilling would be more conducive to oilfield-related businesses like local shipbuilders and fabricators like Bollinger Shipyards, Edison Chouest Offshore and Gulf Island Fabrication.
\
""All of these major people who supply the oil-and-gas industry would be much better off under the McCain administration,"" Scott said.
\
But others questioned how much impact the occupant of the White House could have on drilling expansion, given the decision lies with individual states and the nation's demand for for gasoline.
\
""I don't think the president makes the call on those things,"" said Ted Falgout, executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission. The commission oversees Port Fourchon, which serves the majority of oil platforms and rigs in the Gulf.
\
Brian Uhlmer, a research analyst with Pritchard Capital Partners in Houston, echoed that sentiment.
\
""We're not just going to elect a Democrat and say We're not going to need oil and gas anymore,' "" he said. ""I think that they're going to come to that realization very fast. Oil services are still going to be in high demand.""
\
Obama has proposed taxing oil companies' profits above $80 per barrel and using that money to help families pay for energy. Under the plan, families would get $1,000 and individuals would receive $500, enough to offset the rising costs of gas, heating oil and other energy sources.
\
The U.S. signed a similar tax into law under President Carter in 1980 during another time of high fuel costs, but it was repealed that same decade, according to the Tax Foundation.
\
Economists say with fewer profits, companies are likely to cut back on new projects and exploration, the kind of offshore work on which the Terrebonne-Lafourche service industry thrives.
\
Obama also would close a so-called ""tax loophole"" for U.S. companies operating internationally, where there's generally a lighter tax burden.
\
With international energy companies driving the offshore-energy business, Uhlmer said, that would mean companies would likely move overseas and run U.S. subsidiaries, citing driller Transocean's move to Geneva and Halliburton's move to Dubai as examples.
\
""That would actually hurt the U.S. economy more than it would help,"" he said.
\
McCain has said he opposes that kind of tax.
\
Both candidates say global warming is caused by humans and dangerous to the environment. Both support a system called cap-and-trade, which would restrict the overall amount of carbon that
\
could be given off while allowing polluters flexibility about
\
how to make that happen. Obama have more aggressive
\
restrictions.
\
Both would put taxpayer money toward incentives to develop alternative-energy technology, though Obama's investment would be far more aggressive, at $1.5 billion over 10 years to McCain's $2.3 billion towards biofuels, wind, solar and plug-in hybrid
\
technology. Obama also would step up federal mandates with respect to efficiency and alternative energy, increasing the federal vehicle mileage and requiring utilities to generate 25 percent of their power from alternative sources.
\
But one part of Obama's plan could mean a big boon for the area: He would more than double the federal requirements for ethanol using noncorn sources, one of which is sugar cane.
\
That could add fresh demand for Louisiana's sugar-cane industry, which has lately struggled with rising costs. In addition, Obama opposes lifting tariffs on sugar, which McCain supports.
\
""If McCain got his way, foreign sugar would be cheaper than Louisiana sugar,"" said Joshua Stockley, a professor at the University of Louisiana at Monroe.

26,"The Coachella Valley is getting five hydrogen-powered buses to serve low-income communities — and the largest hydrogen fueling station of its kind in the country.\SunLine Transit Agency's new zero-emission buses will run from Indio to Mecca and Oasis, passing through parts of the eastern Coachella Valley where childhood asthma is common and ozone pollution from cars, trucks and industry exceeds state averages. The hydrogen that fuels those buses with be generated by a process that uses electricity, some of which will come from solar panels, to split water molecules.\The upgrades are being funded by $12.5 million from California's cap-and-trade program, which requires oil refiners, power plants and other climate polluters to pay for the greenhouse gases they emit. The Federal Transit Administration is pitching in with $2.75 million, and SunLine will chip in $5.2 million of its own.\SunLine is already a leader in hydrogen fuel cell technology — the Coachella Valley transit authority started using hydrogen a decade ago, and runs five hydrogen-powered buses out of just 21 in the state. Fuel cell cars use oxygen to strip hydrogen atoms of their electrons, generating electricity and creating only water as a byproduct.\""A hydrogen bus is just an electric bus, it just doesn't have to be plugged in,"" Lauren Skiver, SunLine's chief executive, said. ""It's kind of like a hybrid car, but you're using an even cleaner fuel than gasoline to generate the electricity.""\Hydrogen cars, trucks and buses have been slow to take off, at least compared to plug-in vehicles. As of October, there were just 925 fuel cell vehicles registered in California, according to the state's Air Resources Board. By comparison, more than 250,000 plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles had been sold in California by November, according to the Plug-In Electric Vehicle Collaborative, a public-private partnership.\High costs are one of the reasons fuel cell cars aren't more popular. The Toyota Mirai, for instance, leases for $349 per month, with the Honda Clarity going for $369. But the lack of charging infrastructure is a bigger hurdle. According to the California Fuel Cell Partnership, which is funded by government agencies and car companies, there are just 27 retail fueling stations for passenger vehicles, mostly clustered in the Los Angeles Basin and the Bay Area. None of the hydrogen stations are in the Coachella Valley.\""You need stations to sell vehicles,"" said Nico Bouwkamp, technical program manager at the California Fuel Cell Partnership.\Another two dozen stations are funded and under development, according to a report from the Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission. In 2013, state legislators passed a law calling for the development of 100 publicly accessible fueling stations, and directing the energy commission to spend up to $20 million annually to fund their construction. The report projects that goal will be met in 2024.\It costs between $2.4 and $2.8 million to build the average fueling station, the report estimates. Fuel cell advocates are hopeful that once 100 facilities are operational, private investors will be more willing to fund additional infrastructure, Bouwkamp said.\Gov. Jerry Brown has set a goal of putting 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles on California's roads by 2025 in an effort to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that are primarily responsible for climate change. While hydrogen cars face obstacles, they also have some advantages over plug-in electric vehicles. For instance, they currently have longer ranges: Toyota's Mirai can run 312 miles on a full tank, compared to 238 miles on a full change for the plug-in electric Chevrolet Bolt. Hydrogen vehicle drivers can also fill their tanks at traditional fueling stations, just like they're accustomed to doing with gasoline-powered cars — and they don't have to wait hours for the vehicles to charge.\Still, the technology has its critics — including Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric automaker Tesla Motors. At a conference in 2015, Musk called hydrogen fuel cells ""extremely silly,"" since they use energy far less efficiently than traditional electric cars.\""If you're going to pick an energy storage mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,"" Musk said at the time.\State officials say the $12.5 million grant to SunLine should help bring down the costs of fuel cell buses.\""The first generation of these buses were very expensive. Now they're less expensive, but they're still on the more expensive side if you compare them to a diesel or natural gas bus,"" said Peter Christensen, an official at the California Air Resources Board, which awarded the grant to SunLine after a competitive process.\Bouwkamp said it's important that Sunline's five new hydrogen-powered buses will be supplied by New Flyer, the largest manufacturer of transit buses in North America.\""They've never taken the lead on building those. Now they have a group internally working on fuel cell buses,"" Bouwkamp said. ""Now everyone can start working on cost reduction in a significant way.""\Another company, Hydrogenics, will build SunLine an ""electrolyzer,"" which produces hydrogen by using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms. State officials say it will be the country's largest electrolyzer.\That device will replace the ""steam reformer"" SunLine uses to produce hydrogen, which strips hydrogen molecules from natural gas.\Right now, 95 percent of the hydrogen produced in the United States comes from steam reformation, according to the federal Department of Energy — and from a climate standpoint, that's a problem. While fuel cell cars produce no tailpipe emissions regardless of where their hydrogen comes from, steam reformation produces planet-warming carbon dioxide as a byproduct. When those emissions are taken into account, hydrogen-powered cars still pollute the climate, although less than traditional cars do.\Producing hydrogen via electrolysis, if widely adopted, would help solve that problem. Cost is the main obstacle: Electrolysis is more expensive than steam reformation.\And electrolysis isn't a perfect solution. Most electricity is still generated by burning fossil fuels, which spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But that problem is easier to solve. California already gets more than a quarter of its electricity from climate-friendly sources like solar and wind, and state law calls for 50 percent clean energy by 2030. Lawmakers are considering a bill that would raise the mandate to 100 percent by 2050.\Sammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun."

While hydrogen cars face obstacles, they also have some advantages over plug-in electric vehicles. For instance, they currently have longer ranges: Toyota's Mirai can run 312 miles on a full tank, compared to 238 miles on a full change for the plug-in electric Chevrolet Bolt. Hydrogen vehicle drivers can also fill their tanks at traditional fueling stations, just like they're accustomed to doing with gasoline-powered cars -- and they don't have to wait hours for the vehicles to charge.\Still, the technology has its critics -- including Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric automaker Tesla Motors. At a conference in 2015, Musk called hydrogen fuel cells ""extremely silly,"" since they use energy far less efficiently than traditional electric cars.\""If you're going to pick an energy storage mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,"" Musk said at the time.\State officials say the $12.5 million grant to SunLine should help bring down the costs of fuel cell buses.\""The first generation of these buses were very expensive. Now they're less expensive, but they're still on the more expensive side if you compare them to a diesel or natural gas bus,"" said Peter Christensen, an official at the California Air Resources Board, which awarded the grant to SunLine after a competitive process.\Bouwkamp said it's important that Sunline's five new hydrogen-powered buses will be supplied by New Flyer, the largest manufacturer of transit buses in North America.\""They've never taken the lead on building those. Now they have a group internally working on fuel cell buses,"" Bouwkamp said. ""Now everyone can start working on cost reduction in a significant way.""\Another company, Hydrogenics, will build SunLine an ""electrolyzer,"" which produces hydrogen by using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms. State officials say it will be the country's largest electrolyzer.\That device will replace the ""steam reformer"" SunLine uses to produce hydrogen, which strips hydrogen molecules from natural gas.\Right now, 95 percent of the hydrogen produced in the United States comes from steam reformation, according to the federal Department of Energy -- and from a climate standpoint, that's a problem. While fuel cell cars produce no tailpipe emissions regardless of where their hydrogen comes from, steam reformation produces planet-warming carbon dioxide as a byproduct. When those emissions are taken into account, hydrogen-powered cars still pollute the climate, although less than traditional cars do.\Producing hydrogen via electrolysis, if widely adopted, would help solve that problem. Cost is the main obstacle: Electrolysis is more expensive than steam reformation.\And electrolysis isn't a perfect solution. Most electricity is still generated by burning fossil fuels, which spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But that problem is easier to solve. California already gets more than a quarter of its electricity from climate-friendly sources like solar and wind, and state law calls for 50 percent clean energy by 2030. Lawmakers are considering a bill that would raise the mandate to 100 percent by 2050.\Sammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun."
28,"
U.S. Sen. David Vitter said a new carbon-tax bill being proposed on Capitol Hill reminds him of the failed cap-and-trade legislation from 2009.
\
A carbon tax, in theory, puts a price on certain pollutants to curb them and is often held up as a solution to global warming.
\
The cap-and-trade concept would have forced plants, manufacturers and other businesses to buy transferable permits for their emissions, which would be capped.
\
""It's not just energy prices that would skyrocket from a carbon tax, the cost of nearly everything built in America would go up,"" Vitter said.
\
Vitter, the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Committee, has introduced legislation along with 19 cosponsors that says a carbon tax is not in the economic interest of the United States.
\
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Chairwoman Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, are sponsoring the carbon-tax bill.
\
Under the legislation, a fee on carbon-pollution emissions would pay for investments in energy efficiency and sustainable technologies such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass.
\
The proposal would also provide rebates to consumers to offset any efforts by oil, coal or gas companies to raise prices.
\
""The leading scientists in the world who study climate change now tell us that their projections in the past were wrong;"" Sanders said, ""that, in fact, the crisis facing our planet is much more serious than they had previously believed.""
"
29,"
U.S. Sen. David Vitter introduced eight bills this week to modify the country's energy production.
\
Among the bills are plans to expand access to the outer continental shelf, fight a carbon tax and direct action on the Keystone XL Pipeline.
\
""Louisiana is at the forefront of an energy renaissance, but there is no disputing the fact that our nation's domestic energy production on federal lands has been stymied by this administration. The rapid energy growth we're seeing is on private and state lands,"" Vitter, R-La., said in a statement.
\
Vitter, ranking member of U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, co-sponsored a bill to open the Outer Continental Shelf for more oil and gas leasing.
\
A five-year lease plan would open most of the Outer Continental Shelf for lease sales, 85 percent of which are currently closed. This is a plan that was scheduled to be implemented before President Obama took office.
\
Vitter's Strategic Petroleum Supplies Act would require the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline before the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the largest emergency supply of oil in the world that could hold up to 727 million barrels, could be opened.
\
The Carbon Tax Resolution he proposes would prohibit the regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. until China, India and Russia do the same.
\
""This would prevent the unilateral increase in the cost of energy to U.S. consumers and businesses while China, India and Russia avoid taking any action,"" according to a statement from Vitter's office.
\
Vitter's Artificial Reef Promotion Act would accelerate the rate at which applications are reviewed to remove an offshore oil and gas platform in the Gulf of Mexico and use it as an artificial reef.
\
His Offshore Fairness Act would extend the seaward boundaries of Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia to allow more state-control. It would increase the three-mile boundaries by three marine leagues further from the coastline. A marine league is three nautical miles.
\
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission Reorganization Plan Codification and Complements Act would reorganize the commission ""through approval, policy formulation, rulemaking, and orders and adjudications,"" according to Vitter's office.
\
Vitter's Legacy Lawsuit Jurisdiction Assistance Act would prevent trial lawyers from shopping for venues for legacy lawsuit litigation. Vitter said this shopping discourages investment and hinders economic growth, including growth in the oil and gas industry.
\
Vitter spokesman Luke Bolar said the bills will be referred to various committees for hearings.
\
Some of these measures will be introduced as amendments to other bills or included in other more comprehensive legislation, Vitter's office said.
\
The senator's legislation does have detractors.
\
Franz Matzner, associate director of government affairs with the National Resources Defense Council, said Vitter is ""putting polluters before people"" by proposing these measures.
\
""They're all designed to give pollution a free pass. And that for the people, for those who are on the front lines for dirty air and dirty water, means that they all suffer more instead of a solution to some of our most pressing environmental issues like climate change. There's nothing to see here but more denial ignoring the real plight of real people,"" Matzner said.
\
Vitter said he wants to make sure south Louisiana, which is responsible for much of the nation's energy production, remains a world leader in the industry.
\
""The administration has limited access to federal land and offshore areas, and they've suffocated our domestic energy producers with red tape. Making sure our energy producers can continue the great job they do is one of my top priorities,"" Vitter said.

30,"Lisa R. Faust\lfaust@theadvertiser.com\and The Associated Press\Cars, power plants and factories could all soon face much tougher pollution limits that Louisiana's energy-intensive industries say would devastate the state's economy.\The federal government Friday took a major step toward regulating greenhouse gas emissions, concluding that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases ""endanger public health and welfare"" under federal clean air laws, that they help cause climate change, or global warming and pose an enormous threat\""in both magnitude and probability.""\It is the first time that the federal government has said it is ready to use the Clean Air Act to require power plants, cars and trucks to curtail their release of climate-changing pollution, especially carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.\Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson cautioned that regulations are not imminent and made clear that the Obama administration would prefer that Congress address the climate issue through a broader ""cap-and-trade"" program that would limit heat-trapping pollution.\Even if actual regulations are not imminent, the EPA action was seen as likely to encourage action on Capitol Hill.\Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., whose House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hopes to craft legislation in the coming weeks, called the EPA action ""a game changer.""\""It's now no longer doing a bill or doing nothing,"" Markey said. ""It is now a choice between regulation and legislation.""\Republicans and some centrist Democrats have been critical of proposed cap-and-trade legislation, arguing it would lead to much higher energy prices. Such a measure could impose an economy-wide limit on greenhouse gas emissions but let individual companies or plants trade emission allowances among each other to mitigate costs.\Louisiana's U.S. Sen. David Vitter called EPA's move ""particularly disturbing to American business owners, workers and consumers.""\""Assuming the endangerment finding is the first step towards a regulatory scheme or otherwise to push Congress into implementing cap-and-trade, this move could have a profoundly negative impact on Louisiana's economy in particular, bringing about significant job loss and increased energy prices -- neither of which we need in these trying economic times,"" Vitter, R-Metairie, said in a prepared statement.\U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat who has consistently differed with the Obama administration over energy policy, took a less staunch approach, but remained skeptical of the move toward regulation.\""I share the administration's concern regarding the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment,"" Landrieu said in a prepared statement. ""However, I am equally concerned that misguided federal regulation of greenhouse gases could have a detrimental effect on our economy and potentially on the environment, as regulations can have unintended consequences.\""I look forward to working with the administration and Congress to ensure that we take a commonsense approach as the government weighs the costs and the benefits of regulating greenhouse gases.""\Environmentalists called the EPA action a watershed in addressing climate change.\""It's momentous. This has enormous legal significance. It is the first time the federal government has said officially the science is real, the danger is real and in this case that pollution from cars contributes to it,"" said David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.\Reaction from Louisiana's energy intensive industries ranged from cautious to critical.\Don Briggs, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, called EPA's announcement ""pure politics.""\""You have a very green administration in Washington,"" Briggs said. ""These are all people who have a history of not supporting the oil and gas industry. Taken to its ultimate end, this would shut the country down. There are 250 million cars on the road. Put 250 million horses on the road and tell me what kind of CO2 you're dealing with.""\Henry Graham, environmental and legal affairs director for the Louisiana Chemical Association, said Friday's announcement was the first step in a very long process that everyone in Louisiana should be watching closely.\""A lot will depend on the details, on what Congress does, on how far any legislation or regulation would go,"" Graham said. ""The state should be concerned about the final outcome of any federal legislation, whether it's cap and trade or a carbon tax. Fundamentally, we're shifting the burden of our economy from energy intensive industries to other industries.""\Because the bulk of Louisiana's economy is dependent on energy intensive industries, Graham is a concerned that the state would suffer disproportionately by moves to regulate greenhouse gas emission.\""We hope any federal legislation will recognize the importance Louisiana has in the big picture of the national economy. We're one of the top 3 states in chemical production and in oil and gas production,"" Graham said.\But Graham said there is a larger impact he hopes lawmakers and regulators will take into effect.\""You have to remember, we're not talking about toxins or carcinogens,"" Graham said. ""CO2 is naturally occurring, as well as manmade. The bigger questions is at what level do we regulate ourselves in Louisiana and in the U.S. while allowing other countries to be unregulated. As we reduce emissions, countries like China and India double what they're producing. Do we bankrupt this state, this country simply to shift it overseas, and the planet is not better off for it. If this is a global problem, it requires a global solution.""\The Bush administration strongly opposed using the Clean Air Act to address climate change and stalled on producing the so-called ""endangerment finding"" that had been ordered by the Supreme Court two years ago when it declared greenhouse gases pollutants under the Clean Air Act.\The court case, brought by Massachusetts, focused only on emissions from automobiles. But it is widely assumed that if the EPA must regulate emissions from cars and trucks, it will have no choice but to control similar pollution from power plants and industrial sources."

He moved over to the Senate, winning the seat in 1986, handily winning re-election in 1992 and 1998 and building a middle-of-the-road voting record and a penchant for bipartisan coalitions all the while.\In an hourlong session with The Times Editorial Board, Breaux touched on topics ranging from Interstate 49 funding to the prospects for universal health coverage.\THE TIMES: Can you address Louisiana coastal erosion and the role you think the federal government will actually play in coming up with the funds to restore the coast.\BREAUX: One of the things we've done that is in effect now ... is a gasoline tax on small engines. A percentage of that tax that people pay goes into the fund, which is given to the states, and Louisiana is guaranteed 75 percent. We've been using that for about the last eight years on coastal erosion projects. There have been numerous projects started and completed, but they've basically been small. We've been getting $30-some-odd million a year, which is really not nearly enough, but that's in place.\This is a problem that cannot be solved by Louisiana alone. The energy bill has an authorization for funding for coastal erosion in any state that has the problem, but it's not an automatic earmark. You still have to fight for dollars.\The governor's task force and the work they have been doing has really been helpful in creating the concept of America's wetlands. We've got to sell it as America's wetlands. This is a national problem, and people in Minnesota, California and New York have an interest in this, and they have a responsibility in this. We drain two-thirds of North American right here through our state. If it wasn't for that, we wouldn't have the coastal erosion problem to the extent we have it now. We had to levee off the Mississippi river to take all of that water through the state, and if we didn't do it, they'd be flooding more severely up in the North. By building the levees we prevented it from overflowing and rebuilding the wetlands.\That argument says it's a national responsibility... We tell people that Louisiana is losing an area the size of a football field every 30 minutes, they can't believe it. But they're starting to understand it better.\The Times: What is your position as far as the effort to place an Indian casino in DeSoto Parish?\Breaux: It should be a federal decision, and it's in the Interior Department. I've written a letter that says make the decision based on whether there is a tribal connection to that part of the area. If the state allows it and there's a tribal connection to that part of the area, they should sign it and approve it. If there's not a connection, or if the state does not want it, they should not approve it. It's their decision - it's the Interior's decision, and it should not be a political decision.\The Times: We have a real focus on I-49. Can you tell us any good news about that?\Breaux: Well, the good news is that, in September, we have the highway bill coming up in the Senate for reauthorization. Hopefully, we'll be able to find a way to increase the funding in the bill, which will allow Louisiana to get a larger share. The real problem is the need greatly exceeds the amount of money (available).\The question facing Congress is whether we increase the gas tax, the principle way of funding the highway bill, or do we look at some other mechanism to raise revenues. For instance, using general revenue bonds, which is a concept that's being talked about.\The chairman of that House committee from Alaska, Don Young, is opposed to increasing the gas tax. I don't think it's feasible now, and I don't think that will happen, so the other alternative is to look at giving greater use of revenue bonds to put more money in the trust fund, which would allow Louisiana and all of the rest of the states a greater amount of money.\The Times: You've spent a lot of time studying the Medicare situation. What do you think, realistically, is it's future, and what do you think will have to be done to make it solvent, and whether it'll be around in 20 or 30 years, or will it be in a different form?\Breaux: If I could give you a good answer to that, I'd be on Mount Rushmore.\We've spent the last six or seven years intimately involved in the problem. It's a huge problem.\A lot of people don't want anything changed, but they want it fixed. It's a real crisis, and it's going to get worse. We've got about 40 million people in Medicare now; We've got about 77 million people who are Baby Boomers, born between '46 and '64, who are getting ready to move into this new system....\It's the ultimate micro-managed top-down government program. We fix prices on everything. There's very little competition. But what we're trying to do is say, `Let's change it and move it to a type of system that is more competitive.' Some Republicans say the government should have nothing to do with it and just turn it over to the private sector and let it work. Some Democrats are saying the private sector shouldn't have anything to do with it; it should be a government-run program because only the government can provide the protection we need.\I think the answer lies in between those two. I think we ought to take the best of what government can do with the best of what the private sector can do and combine it into a new program.\The private sector needs to be involved because they can bring about a degree of competition that is sorely lacking and make companies compete for the right to serve individual seniors. That can bring about better prices and greater innovations and ways of delivering healthcare.\The Times: Do you see the federal government moving any more toward universal health coverage?\Breaux: Yeah. I've been working about two years trying to come up with universal health coverage, because we still have about 40 million Americans who have no health coverage whatsoever. They still get health care, but they get it in the emergency room, and it's the most expensive and inefficient type of health care you can have.\I think you ought to have a universal mandate that everybody have health insurance. This is not what Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton were working on, which was an employer mandate. This would be an individual mandate that said every American over the age of 18 would have to have a health insurance policy. The federal government would set up the standards for it. The individuals who are low income would be helped with the premiums up to a certain level...\The Times: Any regrets in not getting into the governor's race this year?\Breaux: I really don't look back and second-guess a decision like that. It was a tough decision, and I would have liked to have been really involved in it.\But, I made the decision that a lot of the problems that I see the state is facing... a lot of the answers involve the federal government in terms of finances, in terms of how we provide health insurance for children. A lot of the answers have to involve Washington, and I'm already there.\The Times: Will you be involved in any of the campaigns or endorsing any candidates?\Breaux: I might be, but not until after the primary.\The Times: Any ideas on why the governor's race really hasn't caught fire with the public?\Breaux: That's a tough question. I don't have an answer for that at all. It's not that you don't have enough diversity among candidates, because you do. It's not that it should be viewed as another ho-hum election, because the state is at a real crossroads with some of the major issues that we have.\The Times: Do you have a personal favorite in the race?\Breaux: No. I think the next governor needs to do three things. No. 1, help the state understand the serious nature of the problems. A lot of people are not yet fully convinced we have a problem. The second thing they have to do is to come up with a solution for the problems, and the third thing they have to do is to help sell those solutions.\Whoever can do that the best would be my favorite, but I'm not sure that has evolved yet. I think it may take a runoff to have that type of selection, to see what they stand for.\I would also want to say that the lieutenant governor could be utilized to head up a constitutional convention, to bring it up to date and to incorporate some of these ideas that may need constitutional amendments. That would be a good function for the lieutenant governor to take on.\Quick takes\BREAUX ON...\WASHINGTON POLITICS: Too many people are worried about doing anything for fear they might make a mistake. They spend so much time trying to figure out ways to blame the other side for failure. ... How much better would it be for us to actually get something done? We can always argue about who did it. At least we'd be fighting about success and accomplishment rather than failure.\THE UNITED STATES AS A PEACEKEEPER: Doesn't any other country in the world have an army? Are we the only country in the world with an army that has to go in when there's a problem some place around the world and literally do it ourselves?\The United States today is arguably the strongest nation in the world and arguably the strongest nation in the history of the world, but we're not the only ones who need to be involved in solving the problems ... .\Iraq is a great example. I'm bitterly disappointed in France and Canada and Germany and some of our traditional allies for not participating in a way that we felt was appropriate, but it's not too late for them to step in and be involved and help us now restructure that country.\LOUISIANA'S OUTMIGRATION WOES: (The latest Census reports) tell us the people who are leaving are the young people, people between the ages of 20 to 35, and that represents the future of Louisiana...\We're the only state in the entire Southeast that has seen an incline in the outmigration exceeding the inmigration, particularly among young people who are saying, ""I want to go somewhere else to make a living, I want to go somewhere else to educate my children, I want to go somewhere else where there's a better climate and a better environment for me to live.""\That is one of the great challenges that we in this state have. First we have to recognize we have a problem, which this type of information tells us. ... I don't want to dwell on the negative, but I think we as a state need to understand what the problem is.\THE ENERGY BILL: It's in conference now, and staff is working on it trying to blend the bills together. I think there's a huge need for some sort of national energy policy to help us move away from the 60 percent import of energy that we have today. The energy bill has incentives for traditional oil and gas exploration. It has incentives for alternative type of activities and other alternative yields, solar energy, wind power, etc. One of the largest manufacturers of wind power equipment is right here in Shreveport, Beaird Industries. A single wind tower can provide electricity for 200 homes.\It's a battle of whether to open up ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) in Alaska. The House says yes, the Senate says no. I don't think it'll be opened up anytime in the near future.\I think we'll get an (energy) bill done before the year is over, and I think we'll get something the president can sign. I think it'll be a very important accomplishment.\MEDICARE REFORM: We've been able to pass a Medicare reform bill, both in the House and in the Senate. I think that is very positive. It's the first major reform of Medicare since 1965.\Medicare is a wonderful program that has served seniors for over 35 years, but it's really out-dated. It's frozen in the 1960s. It's micromanaged by Washington. It's 133,000 pages of regulations - that's three times the Internal Revenue Code has.\It's notable for the fact that it has not covered prescription drugs. The legislation will include prescription drug coverage for the first time.\The House has passed their version; the Senate has passed its version. I'm on the conference (committee). Interestingly, (U.S. Rep.) Billy Tauzin (R-Chackbay), who is chairman of the Energy Committee in the House is on the conference ... so we have Louisianans actively involved. (U.S. Rep.) Jim McCrery (R-Shreveport) has been a big player in the Medicare bill that came out of the Ways and Means Committee.\To learn more\The full text of the question- and-answer session with U.S. Sen.

37,"Oil, gas tax defended \I feel compelled to respond to several assertions about my proposed oil and gas processing tax made by John Rennier in his May 24 letter. \He stated that the tax would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Big Oil has already raised gas prices by more than 60 cents over the last 18 months and is reaping record profits at our expense. I estimate that the processing tax will raise gasoline prices by only three cents per gallon, not just in Louisiana but in all states where Louisiana processed petroleum products are sold. \To lessen the burden on Louisiana motorists I propose to lower the state gasoline tax by five cents. Thus the processing tax will result in a net decrease of two cents on the cost of a gallon of gasoline, in addition to paying our teachers a fair salary, paving our roads and cleaning up our environment. \Rennier is mistaken when he says that the ""current prices ... are a direct reflection of the drilling slowdown ... from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s."" The problem is not supply; it's lack of refining capacity. Because of the popularity of low-mileage automobiles, U.S. demand for gasoline is at an all-time high. No new refineries have been built in the U.S. in the last 20 years. Louisiana is one of the very few states that welcomes the petrochemical industry with open arms. As our problem is not with supply but with refining capacity, claims that the industry will leave Louisiana are completely false. \I don't know what information Rennier bases his claim on, that 70 percent of the domestic oil produced is from mom-and-pop companies. So-called independents might not be affiliated with Exxon, Mobil or Texaco, but they are not mom-and-pop outfits by any means. For instance, Apache Oil is a Fortune 1000 company. \We will forever be dependent on foreign oil and the processing tax is the only way Louisiana can recoup revenue to make up for the decline in domestic production. As Exxon/Mobil Chairman Lee Reymond recently said, ""The days of oil independence went out with Richard Nixon."" \State Sen. Joe McPherson \D-Woodworth \Enforce noise laws \Alexandrians must have been surprised when the Alexandria Police Department public relations officer announced on television that there is little police can do about boom boxes. What an invitation to boom boxers to fire at will. \As I understood Sgt. Clifford Gatlin, police can't do much about the problem because the nuisance has moved on when police officers get there. Well I have complained to the APD, and on occasion waited 15 or 20 minutes before any response; it's right, if you wait long enough, the problem will move on. \Further, I have been told that the perpetrators see them coming and turn down the noise. Don't give me that. One time during a complaint, I suggested they use unmarked cars. I was told they didn't have any. I don't believe that, but if it's true the city could invest in a fleet of clunkers for about $$@$!25,000 and stop this problem once and for all. It wouldn't take many noise fines to pay for the clunkers. \According to the television discussion, these lawbreakers want an area where they can go and blare their racket at will. But where would this be? On the moon? All of us deafened by boom boxes have civil rights and property rights, and in this part of the world the land is mostly privately owned. Perhaps these highly successful boomers want to pool their immense resources and buy three of four thousand acres somewhere we won't hear them. \The APD should perhaps do whatever the Pineville Police Department is doing; it is quiet over there. Or perhaps the Sheriff's Department could give advice. \Clunkers are the simple answer. The APD could eliminate this problem, and we the citizens that pay their salaries have a right to expect it. Don't give us excuses; give us peace. \Clyde Hanson \Alexandria \Creation \I must correct Lloyd Hammett's assertion that scholars have been misinterpreting Scripture all the years by not knowing how to read the Book of Genesis. If Hammett thinks he has stumbled onto real knowledge with his assertion that the creation days of Genesis could not have been literal days because the sun and moon were not created until the fourth day, he should be corrected. \Hammett makes a classic error and thus reveals that he has never actually studied the Scriptures as a serious student. Beyond the obvious that Hebrew scholarship consistently reveals that God created our world in six literal days, resting on the seventh, he misses the simple fact that the Bible reveals that God is Light. This message is repeated over and over through the Old and New Testaments. This is not simply a nice, little spiritual thought. God reveals that among his other characteristics, He is Light. This truth culminates in the next to last chapter of the Bible. \Going beyond that, if Hammett had really studied the Creation story, he would have noted that God revealed His purpose for setting the lights in the heavens, aside from separating the day and night, which He created, that they would be for signs -- for set times, for days and years. In other words, they would measure time. Isn't it curious that every single measurement of time, save one, that we humans use here on earth are determined by the movement of the heavenly bodies -- seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years, the seasons? The one exception, and it is worth noting, is the seven-day week, which God created in the Book of Genesis. \People are free to believe in any philosophical system they wish. I assert that Charles Darwin's theories set up such a philosophical belief system rather than outline good science. I would ask that in doing so they not erringly use God's revealed Word as sources for their heretical and antithetical ideas. \Science has yet to demonstrate, quite simply, that out of chaos matter can create new information and overcome the laws of entropy by organizing itself. Until they do, all their evolutionary theory will be so much nonsense. \Stephen Huffman \Pineville \Your Mail Policy \We welcome your comments on editorials, columns or other topics in The Town Talk or any subjects important to you.

38,"
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, lawmakers and interest groups are locked in an election-year political battle over oil-and-gas policy in the wake of rising gasoline prices and calls for more U.S. production.
\
Arguing that Obama's policies are hurting oil-and-natural-gas production, Republicans have used a one-two punch of rhetoric and legislation aimed at boosting domestic development, and industry groups have upped their lobbying. With gasoline prices now approaching $4, Republicans see a chance to hammer their point further -- even though analysts say presidents have virtually no control over rising costs at the pump.
\
""This debate is a debate we want to have,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told a closed-door GOP meeting. ""Certainly this summer will see the highest gas prices in years.""
\
Obama argued Thursday that no short-term fixes exist but that his ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy, which he outlined in his State of the Union address, stands the best chance in the long haul of insulating the U.S. from gasoline-price spikes.
\
""That's the only real solution to this challenge,"" Obama said. He touted:
\
-- Plans to make available 75 percent of the nation's potentially recoverable offshore oil-and-gas resources in the Gulf of Mexico and Arctic Ocean, with new rules to boost safety.
\
-- Proposed doubling of passenger-car mileage standards by model-year 2025.
\
-- The administration's goal of approving construction of 10 gigawatts of renewable energy projects (such as wind farms) on federal lands in 2012.
\
-- Proposed doubling of low-carbon power by 2035 and calls for extending business tax incentives for renewable energy.
\
The drilling wars started anew in January when Obama called for an ""all-of-the-above"" strategy with more conventional and renewable energy for jobs and security. Obama has noted that U.S. oil-and-gas output has risen under his watch, that net imports have fallen and that his administration already has leased millions of acres for drilling.
\
GOP lawmakers and industry have responded that the rising production stems from state and private lands that Obama largely doesn't control. They argue his policies have hurt development of federal lands and waters.
\
""It's like Al Gore taking credit for inventing the Internet,"" said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, top Republican on the Senate energy committee.
\
American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard argued that Obama's actions ""don't match his words."" Among the president's decisions he cited were:
\
-- Not opening waters outside the Gulf and Arctic to drilling, and imposing offshore regulations that raise costs and slow permit approvals.
\
-- Rejecting the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which supporters argue would carry crude from a friendly neighbor, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas.
\
-- Advancing rules for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands that Gerard argued would diminish domestic oil-and-gas production.
\
-- Proposing to nix oil-and-gas tax breaks that Gerard said aren't subsidies and whose elimination would be ""discriminatory.""
\
Seeking to set a contrast with Obama, House Republicans approved a bill this month that would allow drilling in new areas, including parts of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and a sliver of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It also would approve Keystone XL.
\
Environmentalists and Democrats say Keystone XL wouldn't impact U.S. imports of Canadian crude. They call the drilling plans environmentally destructive. The House measure is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate.
\
""If we are serious about weaning our dependence on foreign oil, we need to continue the clean-energy policies of the Obama administration and efforts in recent years by Congress,"" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., Democratic Party chairwoman.
\
But some Obama supporters and environmentalists want the White House to resist GOP and industry pressure. They argue that more regulation of hydraulic fracturing and offshore drilling is needed to protect the environment. Industry insists fracturing, the method of breaking rock to free up oil and gas, is safe.
\
They also say Obama shouldn't back down on his proposal to nix oil-and-gas tax breaks because major oil companies are making record profits.
\
Rising gasoline prices, which threaten the pace of economic recovery in an election year, are complicating the debate.
\
Sarah Emerson, president of consulting firm Energy Security Analysis Inc., said no short-term policy solutions exist.
\
""There is no magic bullet,"" she said.
\
She mainly blamed global crude-market forces -- among them, tensions with Iran -- and suggested some role for increased speculative trading on oil futures.
\
Amy Myers Jaffe, fellow with Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, said polling shows gasoline prices, a longtime political football, heavily sway public sentiment.
\
That may explain why politicians on both sides are again using them as further fodder.
\
""This administration has consistently pushed policies that have driven gas prices to nearly double what they were when President Obama was inaugurated,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
\
But political experts are not certain how ever-rising prices will play out.
\
""Unless the economy really turns south...I don't think it's going to make too big an impact, but it can't help President Obama,"" said Thomas Whalen, a professor at Boston University.
\
Obama could seize on populist anger about oil-and-gas tax breaks, and counter GOP drilling plans by noting domestic oil could be sold on the global market overseas, he said.
\
Three House Democrats wrote Obama, asking him to open the 696-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stem oil-price increases. They also urged policies to ""develop clean-energy alternatives that can reduce our dependence on oil.""
\
The White House says the reserve isn't off the table, but analysts said it is intended for global-supply disruptions, not price shocks.

39,"Infrastructure must be repaired\With the release of the TRIP report on Louisiana's transportation system, it is apparent that Louisiana's infrastructure is in serious need of overhaul. Crumbling roads and traffic congestion are hurting Louisiana in its efforts to recover and grow economically. We can no longer stand idly by with our infrastructure in such disrepair.\The grades issued in the report speak for themselves -- Roads an F, Bridges a D-minus, Congestion a C, Safety an F and Funding a D. Nearly half of Louisiana's major roads and highways are in poor or mediocre conditions. Louisiana's traffic fatality rate is 40 percent higher than the national average.\In addition, we face $12 billion in highway funding backlog with an expected increase to $15 billion by 2010.\The bottom line is, Louisiana's method of funding its roads does not work.\The state's primary source of road money, the Transportation Trust Fund, is a 16-cent gas tax approved in 1984, with a current buying power of 8 cents, since it was never adjusted to current inflation.\For every dollar Louisiana puts up, it gets $4 in federal matching funds for road and bridge needs.\If Louisiana does not generate additional transportation funds, the state will lose federal matching dollars as early as 2009.\The longer we put off addressing the additional financing of our highway system, the more it will cost the state's citizens in the long run.\Hopefully, the Louisiana Legislature will take the opportunity in the spring legislative session to do something about these serious problems.\We must find additional revenue sources to improve our highway infrastructure. It is critical to economic development and the safety of all Louisiana citizens.\Jennifer Marusak\Driving Louisiana Forward\Baton Rouge\Facts are proof\Much has been written about the American Civil Liberties Union in the last few weeks, and I thought a few facts would be enlightening. Facts become proof in a court of law, and facts are most helpful in a study of the beginnings of an organization, helpful in understanding its purpose and goals.\In 1848, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels authored the ""Manifesto of the Communist Party."" Key points: abolish private property, family, marriage, religion and replace home education with social education.\In 1933, ""The Humanist Manifesto I"" was implemented in America. A revision was made in 1973 and named ""The Humanist Manifesto II."" Key points: reject traditional religious morality, begin with man and not God, push the right to birth control, abortion, a lifestyle of choice, euthanasia, the right to suicide and the right to die and separation of church and state.\Today we find that the ACLU has sued to try to: halt the singing of Christmas Carols in public facilities, deny tax-exempt status for churches, remove all military chaplains, remove all Christian symbols from public property, prohibit Bible reading in classrooms even during free time, remove ""In God We Trust"" from our coins, remove ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance and deny federal funding for Boy Scouts until they admit gays and atheists.\This organization is implementing the following goals in its quest to destroy America's culture and traditions: eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them ""censorship"" and a violation of free speech and free press, break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio and television, present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as ""normal, natural and healthy"", eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the grounds that it violates the principle of ""separation of church and state,"" belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the grounds that it was only a minor part of ""the big picture,"" support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics and such, and discredit the family as an institution, encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.\Here are some of the stated goals of the ACLU, from its own published policy issues: the legalization of prostitution (Policy 211); the defense of all pornography, including child pornography, as ""free speech"" (Policy 4); the decriminalization and legalization of all drugs (Policy 210); the promotion of homosexuality (Policy 264); the opposition of rating of music and movies (Policy 18 ); opposition against parental consent of minors seeking abortion (Policy 262); opposition of informed consent preceding abortion procedures (Policy 263); opposition of spousal consent preceding abortion (Policy 262); opposition of parental choice in children's education (Policy 80) -- not to mention the defense and promotion of euthanasia, polygamy, government control of church institutions, gun control, tax-funded abortion and birth limitation. (Policies 263, 133, 402, 47, 261, 323, 271, 91, 85)\Roger Baldwin, the co-founder of the ACLU has said: ""I am for socialism, disarmament, and ultimately, for abolishing the state itself ... I seek social ownership of property, the abolition of the properties class, and sole control of those who produce wealth. Communism is the goal. I don't regret being part of the communist tactic. I knew what I was doing. I was not an innocent liberal. I wanted what the communists wanted, and I traveled the United Front road to get it."" (Source: Trial and Error, by George Grant) I\Baldwin didn't create the ACLU in a vacuum, he had plenty of help. A group of Communist Party officials, fellow travelers, anarchists and radicals joined Baldwin to found the ACLU in 1920.\Former chairman of the Communist Party USA, William Z. Foster, was also an ACLU co-founder.\If Americans want to put the ACLU out of business, demand that our public servants in Congress repeal the unconstitutional funding of this subversive organization.\There is no justification under Art. 1, Sec. 8, to steal from the people's treasury to give money to the ACLU or any other organization for ""civil rights"" lawsuits.\While it is true that not all ACLU members or supporters are Communists, all must be sympathetic to the ACLU goals, or they wouldn't be associated with the ACLU.\Billy Miller\Alexandria\Wage hike can hurt us all\Leonard Ford's literary vehicle for a raise in the minimum wage published Jan. 22, fell into the usual statistical and historical potholes. The results of a host of studies of minimum-wage laws back to the Roman Empire show that these laws are devastating to small businesses, undercut the expansion that provides more jobs and often cause business failures by raising costs of the business that most often hire workers with marginal skills.\To oppose these studies, Ford cites a study by the Fiscal Policy Institute, an avowedly left-wing, pro-minimum-wage propaganda mill.\Ford states that 70 percent of minimum-wage workers are adults; he neglects to mention that most are between the ages of 16 and 24, that 60 percent are part-time employees, most are students and suburban teenagers and that the average annual family income of a minimum-wage worker is almost $50,000.\He writes that the typical adult provides 54 percent of the family income. He doesn't tell us that his ""typical adults"" consist almost entirely of persons qualified for and holding jobs paying well above minimum wage.\It is true that small businesses are thriving better in states with legal minimum wage rates above the federal minimum; however, Ford fails to note that, in those states, the actual minimum wages are much higher than the state minimum because of the booming economies.\The minimum-wage laws in those states are passed by politicians who want to curry favor with voters by cosmetic bills with no practical effect. The good economies in those states were not created by minimum-wage laws.\Employers do not keep good workers by raising everybody's pay regardless of work quality as the minimum-wage law does.\Employers keep good, long-time employees by raising their wages above those of their less industrious or less skilled colleagues and above those wages paid by the competitors who will hire them away if their wages are not increased.\If Ford wants to help the lowest-paid workers, he should drop his support for increased minimum-wage rates and support an increase in the child tax credit.\He should drop his support for business subsidies and support a reduction of the payroll tax, thus making the money available to the employer for pay raises and reducing government distortion of the job market.\Finally, he should demand a reduction in immigration (legal and illegal).\The increase in the labor supply brought about by immigration lowered the income of the poorest 10 percent of the work force by 7.4 percent between 1980 and 2000.\Let's really help the poorer workers by getting government off their backs and stop the importation of foreigners to build up the voting base of the Democrats.\Harry D.A. Pratt\Alexandria\Man must work with nature\From the beginning, our relationship with the natural world has been one of essential importance.\Not only does our physical survival depend on the health of our earth, but also, our spiritual survival -- our goodness and virtuousness as human beings -- will be measured by the way we treat our environment.\Closeness to nature has been linked historically to Godliness. In Eden, Adam and Eve lived for a time in harmony with their environment and with their God.\After the fall, however, God punished us by changing our relationship to nature, transforming it into one requiring toil and strife.\It is our relationship with nature that we, as Americans, must always struggle to understand. Late President Gerald Ford encouraged his countrymen to reconcile themselves with nature. ""Ours,"" he explained, ""is a bountiful land. Let us resolve to live in it, at one with man, with nature, and with God.""\Certainly that concept seems ideal, but how have we currently resolved to live in our environment?\Ashamedly, we do not live as one with it.\These days, most people seem to be separated from one another, isolated from nature, and removed from God. Instead of attempting to reconcile these relationships, we address them artificially.\We maintain ""business"" relationships. We spend money on items marketed toward bringing nature more into our lives. There are indoor waterfalls, bird clocks, dangling pine-scented and tree-shaped ornaments, and the list goes on.\We seek God in city-size churches and on evangelical-programming. While all these things in actuality do little to help us reconnect with nature, and by extension with ourselves and with God, they do prove that we have maintained a healthy desire to reunify ourselves with the larger world.\But how can we reunify ourselves with the world in which we live?\Admittedly, doing so may at times seem like an impossible endeavor.\After all, in our society, growing our own food, catching our own fish, and living off the land requires that we first own land, that we have an ample amount of time away from our jobs to tend to that land, and that we have money to spare.\Reconnecting to our natural environment is further complicated by the grand-scale on which our earth is destroyed.\Not only are we endangering our future sustainability by ignoring the consequences of global warming, but we have already made vast areas of our earth no longer suitable for human habitation.\Pollution, failed engineering projects, blindness toward impending natural disasters, and the depletion of once abundant resources have made wastelands of areas previously populated by humans and thousands of other species.\In places where abundance remains, such as in the oil-rich Middle East, fighting over those resources has created an inhospitable environment.\Our personal insecurities also keep us from reconnecting wholeheartedly with nature. We are not only a nation of excess, but we are a nation that measures success by the degree of excess indulged in.\The bigger our home, our car, our wardrobe, our buffet plate, the better. Reconnecting with nature requires a sacrifice that not many of us are yet willing to make.\It requires a certain simplicity, an inner peace that transcends the need for material consumption, that allows us to open our eyes to the truths around us.\Really reconnecting with our world requires that we make a personal and individual commitment to ourselves, to each other, to our earth, and to our God.\We must seek fulfillment by focusing our attention not on the social expectations of our society but on the truths and beauties hidden within our world and within ourselves.\Only in this way will we be able to secure the health of our earth and our individual integrity as human beings.\Benjamin Cagle\Natchitoches\Gotta get a witness\I would like to share a recent experience we had with a video rental store.\We had been doing weekly business with this store since it opened over a year ago. Recently, we rented three movies (our usual rental) and returned them via the ""drop box.""\Three days after these movies were returned, I rented five more movies and was notified that the previous three movies had not been returned. I assured the employee that they had been returned on time.\Instead of refusing to rent the five new movies to me until the missing movies were returned, the clerk proceeded to ask me my phone number, which pulled up our account, and even announced that I had a ""free"" rental. (Probably because of our good record of renting and returning). No membership card was required to rent the movies.\The five movies were returned on time (as usual), via the drop box. Just to be on the safe side, I phoned the store to double-check that these five movies had been received and checked-in.\They had.\But, the previously missing three movies were still unaccounted for. Hmmmm.\In the next few days, I made daily phone calls to the store to check on the missing (yet returned) movies, and they were nowhere to be found.\What could have happened to them once they were dropped in this box, which leads to the interior of the locked store?\Were they thrown into the trash as opposed to checking them in? Handed to another customer by mistake? Stolen? Rented by someone else before they were checked-in?\Who knows?\The final straw was when we received a bill ($84.11) for the missing movies, and we had no recourse. ""He said -- she said.""\I often wondered why we were constantly asked if we wanted ""rental insurance"" whenever we rented movies.\We never bought this insurance -- no need. We do take care of other peoples' property.\My suggestion to the public: return your rented movies during store hours where you can personally hand the movies to a clerk. Don't forget to read their name tag.\Otherwise, the mysterious MDBM (""Movie Drop Box Monster"") will take your movies hostage until you pay the ransom, in this case, the full price of the movies.\Needless to say, that store lost some very good customers because of its poor handling of this situation.\Karen Schrock\Deville\Abortion a cancer on society\Jan. 22 marked the 34th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion on demand.\This decision ruled that states have no authority to legislate in matters of unborn human life. Since 1973, 50 million human beings have been destroyed, executed without due process and without representation.\We are missing two generations of Americans. To paraphrase the famous Peter, Paul and Mary peace mantra, ""Where have all the children gone?""\The implications of this cheapening of human life have been far-reaching. Like a cancer, it has invaded all aspects of society.\Today, it is legal to destroy a child as he emerges from his mother's body by puncturing his skull in a brutal procedure known as partial-birth abortion.\This act of premeditated murder is permitted under abortion laws because the child is not technically born when the killing occurs.\It has been suggested by forward-thinking ""ethicist"" Peter Singer that the parents of an infant should be free to kill their offspring if the parents determine it is in the best interests of the child, whether due to the child's deformity, mental condition, or simply his status of being unwanted.\Singer teaches at an Ivy League university and has been singing his murderous lullabies to a generation of impressionable youth.\There have been numerous instances of young girls giving birth at home, or at the prom, or in a hotel room, who then left the child to die in a garbage dump.\Human embryos, grown in a lab and then destroyed, are viewed as mere tools for scientific research. ""Grow 'em and use 'em"" has become the enlightened position.\Much success has been achieved through the use of adult stem cells, like umbilical cord blood or fat tissue.\The elderly and disabled are seen as social nuisances, unnecessary drains on our resources. They are seen as taking up perfectly good space that the young and the healthy could occupy. Often they are denied food and hydration, suffering an agonizing death that can last as long as two weeks.\Make room for the beautiful people.\The cultural imprint of legalized abortion is everywhere. While the logical consequences of it should surprise no one, where we are headed should frighten us all.\For as Martin Niemoller wrote in reference to victims of the Holocaust, the time will inevitably come when there is ""no one left to speak up.""\Like the landmark Dred Scott case, in which blacks were judged non-citizens, and like the corrosive Nazi belief in ""life unworthy of life,"" the Roe versus Wade decision marginalized and made invisible the most vulnerable among us.\Those committed to reversing this injustice look to the day when unborn children will no longer be banished to the ""back of the bus"" but will assume their rightful place as fully protected members of the human family.\Leslie Alexander\Lafayette"
40,"Twenty-six candidates are vying to fill Lafayette Parish's four Senate seats and eight House seats in the state Legislature, resulting in a number of contested races.\The legislative races don't receive the same level of attention as the gubernatorial race, or even some fiercely contested local races, like Lafayette's mayor-president. But, in recent years, state legislators have been responsible for passing the state's criminal justice reform and working to solve a number of budget crises, among other major policies affecting residents.\Early voting for the Oct. 12 election runs Sept. 28 through Oct. 5.\The incumbent, Lafayette Democrat Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, is squaring off against Cory Levier I, a firearms instructor and U.S. Army veteran.\The district is primarily made up of St. Landry Parish, including Opelousas and the eastern part of Eunice. It also includes the northeast part of Lafayette Parish (including Carencro, north Lafayette and running just east of Scott) and part of St. Martin Parish.\Boudreaux is seeking his second term. An ally of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards — even sharing a joint campaign headquarters in Lafayette — Boudreaux has racked up endorsements from the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association and the Louisiana Hospital Association.\""From education to access to healthcare, we are definitely in a better place than we were four years ago,"" he posted on Facebook. ""But there is still so much work to be done.""\Levier, a National Rifle Association-certified firearms instructor and the owner of Safehouse Firearms and Safety Solutions in Lafayette, has touted an endorsement from GOP U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins. He also endorsed Republican Josh Guillory in the Lafayette mayor-president race. He's emphasized veteran's issues throughout his campaign.\""Progress in Louisiana for me would be my children being able to be safe anywhere they go, have a reassurance of security,"" he said during a candidate forum.\Conservative Republican Bob Hensgens, the incumbent who took office in a special election in 2018, is from Gueydan, where he served in the house and as the city's mayor. He's challenged by Abbeville Democrat Jerry Gaspard, an author and former Louisiana Farm Bureau worker.\The district includes the bulk of Vermilion Parish and extends northeast into Acadia and Lafayette parishes, including Rayne and the western half of Lafayette Parish, as well as the southern portion of St. Landry Parish near Sunset.\Hensgens is on the Health and Welfare Committee, the Local and Municipal Affairs Committee, and is the vice chair for the Senate Judiciary C Committee.\On his website, Gaspard outlines priorities such as dedicating gas tax revenue for roads and reforming welfare.\Republicans Jim Doré, Jonathan Goudeau, and Gus Rantz are running to keep the district in Republican hands, while Democrat Quinta Thompson is looking to paint the area blue. They are running to succeed former Republican Rep. Nancy Landry, who left for a job in the state Secretary of State's Office.\The district sits in Vermilion and Lafayette parishes, including parts of River Ranch, Maurice and Milton. In 2015, Landry defeated a Democratic challenger with 85% of the vote.\Doré has pushed for road improvements during his campaign and has emphasized his pro-life stance and support for small businesses.\""It's great that we have growing communities in Acadiana, but we need viable routes and roads to relieve the gridlock,"" Doré posted on Facebook.\Goudeau's campaign Facebook page has heavily featured his pro-business and pro-oil and gas stance, while also highlighting conservative values.\""It doesn't take a genius to figure out how screwed up our state is,"" Goudeau posted. ""We are seeing businesses leaving the state at an alarming rate and they are taking high paying jobs with them.""\Like the other Republicans in the race, Rantz has floated traditional conservative values and has not been afraid to go after Gov. John Bel Edwards during his campaign.\""Louisiana ranks at the bottom in education, healthcare, and economy for the past three years under Governor Edwards' leadership,"" he posted.\Thompson is a mathematics teacher in Iberia Parish, according to her LinkedIn. She highlights education on her campaign website.\""I know the importance of a quality education and getting a good job to secure your future,"" her website says. ""I believe we have a good foundation and the tools to build a better community for ourselves and future generations.""\Julie Emerson, a Carencro Republican, was elected to the house in 2015, when she flipped the district from blue to red. She narrowly defeated Democratic incumbent Stephen Ortego and now faces Democratic challenger Paul ""Polo"" Carter.\District 39 begins north of Lafayette and includes Carencro and most of Scott, as well as a strip of area running toward Opelousas.\Emerson is on the House committees for Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture, and Rural Development, Appropriations, and Education.\On her campaign website, Emerson has a video touting her status as the youngest member of the Louisiana House and explaining why other millennials should be Republicans.\""Socialism isn't edgy; it's the principal's office,"" Emerson says in the video. ""It's not outside of the box; it is the box...The people having the power, that's the far sexier idea.""\Her challenger, Carter, has been heavily involved in the community over the last 30 years, according to his Facebook page. He's served as a minister and is the part owner of Medical Advantage Care.\""I have dedicated the last 30 years of my career to protecting our senior citizens, the health and well being of our children, and fighting for the communities around our district,"" he posted.\Rep. Stuart Bishop, a Lafayette Republican, has represented District 43 since 2011, when he ran unopposed. He was unopposed again in 2015, but he has a challenger now: Leslie Bourque.\The district is made up of the southern part of Lafayette and runs south toward Broussard and Youngsville.\Bishop is the chairman of the House's Natural Resources and Environment Committee. He's collected a number of endorsements from oil and gas, business groups, and Lafayette Mayor-President Joel Robideaux.\""As your District 43 State Representative, I will continue building a strong business environment for Louisiana's future, work to bring greater transparency and accountability to state government, and champion and defend our values,"" Bishop posted on Facebook.\Bishop's challenger, Bourque, has emphasized improving the quality of life in District 43 through early childhood education, preventative health care and criminal justice reform.\""Elected officials continued to commit themselves to their parties and not to their constituents. For years, I worked closely with the people in my district, and I knew I could bring their concerns to Baton Rouge,"" Bourque says on her website.\Rep. Jean-Paul Coussan, a Lafayette Republican, will face off against Lafayette Democrat Rhonda Kim Gleason.\The district incorporates the west portion of Lafayette and moves west to S Fieldman Drive.\Coussan is an attorney who serves on the Commerce, Judiciary, and Natural Resources and Environment committees for the house.\""As a small business owner, I know the real-world impact of decisions made at the Capitol. We feel it every day...It's all about jobs, and I'll keep fighting,"" Coussan posted on Facebook.\Gleason, who was part of Emerge Louisiana's 2018 class of Democratic recruits, has been critical of legislators skipping hearings during her time advocating for causes at the capitol.\""Testifying to empty seats year after year, I realize some of our legislators do not take their roles very seriously; they do not understand their elected position is one of honor and service,"" she posted on Facebook.\The three New Iberia Republicans — ""Beau"" Beaullieu, Dana Dugas and Ricky Gonsoulin — and New Iberia Democrat David Levy are vying to take the seat previously held by one of Louisiana's most important political figures.\District 48 is shaped like a V, running south from Youngsville along Highway 90, then back north Loreauville.\Beaullieu lists improving education and work training, pro-life stances, infrastructure, lowing insurance premiums, and reducing ""job-killing regulations and wasteful spending"" as his priorities on his campaign website.\Dugas has also emphasized fiscal responsibility, building a pro-business environment, and being available and transparent with constituents on his website.\Gonsoulin has highlighted the need for better and more jobs on his Facebook page, pushing for deregulation and a resurgence for the area's oil and gas industry.\Levy has posted about a few of his stances on Facebook, including equal pay, increasing health care access, and reducing the cost of living for those living in poverty.\Three Democrats and one Independent are jockeying to succeed retiring Rep. Terry Landry in District 96.\Two St. Martinville Democrats — Marcus Bryant and Patrick Isaac Wiltz — New Iberia Democrat Cammie ""Yogi"" Maturin, and New Iberia Independent Bob Titus II are running to replace Landry, who announced in May that he would not be seeking reelection.\The district starts around Breaux Bridge and snakes south to include St. Martinville and New Iberia.\Business and the oil and gas associations have not handed out any endorsements in the race.\CREDIT: William Taylor Potter"
41,"Read more about the candidates' stands on issues at theadvertiser.com\Amanda McElfresh\amcelfresh@theadvertiser.com\Candidates for three Lafayette City-Parish Council districts expressed their positions on public safety, economic development and a host of other issues during a Tuesday night forum.\The forum was for candidates in Districts 5, 6 and 7. One candidate, Linda Duhon of District 5, was not in attendance. The other District 5 candidates are independent business owner John Barras and petroleum landman Jared Bellard.\In District 6, the candidates are customer service business representative Travis Farrar, salesman Sam Dore and communications consultant Bruce Conque, who is only of only two incumbents running this year.\The District 7 candidates are Tom Sekhani, who works in the real estate industry, and petroleum landman Don Bertrand.\On the most pressing priorities of the Lafayette In A Century plan:\Travis Farrar:\""It mentions a loop around Lafayette, which could do wonders for alleviating traffic. I would also like to see some other things discussed at length, especially the Johnston Street improvement plan, which I don't really agree with at this time, and the toll roads, which I don't think Lafayette can support.""\Sam Dore:\""There are many issues in it that will need to be addressed in the future. Whatever we discuss, it must include the planning and zoning commission and citizens. The real future of Lafayette will come from economic development, and as part of that, new jobs will always be my priority.""\Bruce Conque:\""The council is not the driving force on this issue. It is the planning commission. We need to look at increasing the size of that planning commission. We must, as a council, do due diligence to make certain that we have strong people appointed to that commission.""\John Barras:\""We have been talking about smart growth quite a bit. We need to decide which direction we want to head in. Now, we can adopt a smart growth code that we can define for this parish according to the guidelines we've set.""\Jared Bellard:\""The most pressing priorities would be under the LINC recommendations for economic development. Also, teachers need tools for discipline in classrooms, and we need more police presence and parental involvement. It is very comprehensive, we just need to make sure we have the money available to see it through.""\Tom Sekhani:\""My main concern with all of these recommendations is where are we going to get funding. If we can implement it within our budget a little at a time, then I think I'm all for it.""\Don Bertrand:\""None of this means anything to our community if our council does not embrace this. We can fully fund LINC, we can all talk kindly about LINC, but if our council does not realize the potential of planning short term, medium term and long term for our community, the LINC recommendations will do nothing to help us.""\On the greatest opportunity for development in another district:\John Barras:\""Basically, we need a business-friendly environment. Education is number one. Also, business-friendly means that you have to be able to get places, and with our infrastructure, it's hard to get to work safely. There's a lot of things we need to change, and I feel a business-friendly environment would help us a lot.""\Jared Bellard:\""I feel that District 1 has similar problems as my District 5. It's a very rural district, and your growth is tremendous in the outlying areas. I feel that in order to make development happen in those areas, some of the money has to get back to these rural areas.""\Don Bertrand;\""If you take a look at some of the developments, particularly around I-10, other initiatives like that will go a long way to bring development to that sector of town. We are going to see a boom in that area north of I-10. The time is coming, and we all have to embrace it when it does happen.""\Tom Sekhani:\""I think it's a great idea that we should look at TIF districts in every district. If it's spread out throughout the area, it helps everybody. TIF districts are created to create jobs, not just business.""\Sam Dore:\""North side Lafayette has the most potential for growth in the entire parish. Frontage roads must remain an important issue. More revenue without the need for new taxes is something everybody should be excited about.""\Bruce Conque:\""We must encourage the continued development of the infrastructure on the north side of Lafayette to encourage both commercial and residential development. We also need to address the quality of life issue. If you create good quality of life, you will enhance residential areas.""\Travis Farrar:\""I have to agree that the north side of Lafayette is definitely the area which could use the most development. I'd like to try and remove the stigma that is associated with it. Also, we need to push our state Legislature for federal fundings to get the I-49 corridor completed and get the frontage roads completed.""\On enhancing relationships with council members and other officials:\Tom Sekhani:\""I would like to see all of the communities be a part of consolidation, but they don't want to be a part of it. We should have one consolidation. The only consolidation I know is parks and recreation, and to me, that's not true consolidation.""\Don Bertrand:\""Unity in Lafayette Parish begins with this council. We can work together, we can achieve goals, we can do it in a fashion that develops unity with all of the other members of the community, whether they're part of consolidation or not. But it starts with the council working together.""\Bruce Conque:\""We talk about the lack of true consolidation of services. That is absolutely on target. Also, whoever is elected, they need to be involved. To be good council members, you have to do more than represent your district.""\Travis Farrar:\""Just listening, not only to the other members of the council, but to your constituents, their constituents and encouraging them to listen as well. I'm trying to come to the table with ideas that are good for the whole city. I think that any idea that comes to the table has to be considered as how it's going to affect the entire community.""\Sam Dore:\""If we want to do consolidation, we must start with things like the water system. All of the drainage projects should be brought under one master plan. I will bring north side issues together with south side issues and work with my fellow councilmen on all of them.""\Jared Bellard:\""The key is teamwork. We need shared goals for the entire parish. However, let me be clear, my priority is Scott, Ridge, Judice and that portion of Lafayette Parish within District 5. We just need to work together as a team.""\John Barras:\""I think division doesn't begin with the citizenry, it begins with the leadership. You need a person who is strong enough to pull the people of his district together.""\On initiatives to address crime and public safety:\John Barras:\""We're losing people to other areas that pay much more money for the same job. Taxes are a dirty word, but if it means we have to levy taxes to do this, then let's get it done. How are we going to attract businesses to Lafayette if we don't have people to keep it safe? There's a lot of possibilities we can look at, but definitely pay them what they deserve.""\Jared Bellard:\""We need to make sure we are using all available resources to secure state and federal grant money. We need more programs like Crime Stoppers and neighborhood watches. When the neighborhoods and people come together and protect what is theirs, they can work together with police.""\Don Bertrand:\""When you think about what red light cameras are doing, it's making our roadways safer and at the same time keeping our policemen on the street responding to other emergencies or crimes that are taking place. We need to take a look at all of the little things that make our quality of life better. Do we have safe parks? Do we have safe sidewalks? We need to address things like that.""\Tom Sekhani:\""We definitely need more policemen. We have a safety issue, but by the same token, we have thousands more people in Lafayette Parish. With that kind of money coming in, we can definitely hire more policemen to protect everybody.""\Travis Farrar:\""We're already understaffed and if we don't do something to address this issue, it's only going to get worse. There are state, federal and private grants to fund equipment, to fund training, to fund innovative new programs. Our fire department is in the same boat. We need that funding, and whatever we have to do, we have to do it now.""\Sam Dore:\""Looking at what policemen make as starting pay, it's hard to see how we get any qualified officers to work here at all. I believe if government would reduce spending in other areas, we could afford to pay policemen and firefighters more without having more taxes.""\Bruce Conque:\""Pay is certainly an issue and it is being addressed. We also should improve and expand our community policing effort. Most importantly, we have to have community participation. Also, we can no longer treat the mix of alcohol and driving as an acceptable part of our culture. We need to look at some legal options about how old you must be to enter a bar. We need to look at drive-through liquor sales. Of course, we need to look at continued enforcement and prosecution.""\On whether local government should pay for projects such as a loop, state highways and I-49 improvements:\Don Bertrand:\""We will participate in some way in the cost, but we will not pay for those roads. We are going to have to be proactive, but it's going to be up to the council to work with our local delegation to change the way the legislature thinks. We are going to have to do a better job of lobbying Baton Rouge.""\Tom Sekhani:\""Lafayette is a donor parish. The real responsibility is on the shoulders of the legislators. I think we have a good hope in the new government coming in. It should also be the federal government's responsibility to help us with some of these things.""\Sam Dore:\""Our parish is unique in the fact that it has a large number of state highways. I will work to make sure that the tax dollars we pay here stay in our parish. I think the use of roundabouts should be increased. The idea of a toll road has been around for a long time, but unfortunately, we do not have the population base to support a toll road.""\Bruce Conque:\""We need to get people in that position of responsibility who are willing to recognize the responsibility of the state. But we have to have some local options to address local issues. We must be proactive, because by 2009, the state says it will no longer fund new road projects.""\Travis Farrar:\""We definitely have to make our voices heard to the state. One of the best ways we can deal with it is to continue the good work the council has done and improve the roads that aren't state roads. If we can find a way to fund a loop, I think it would go a long way toward showing the state that we are serious. We can't just ignore the needs of our citizens.""\John Barras:\""I would say look at the federal or state funding, then the $1 million surplus that is projected. Maybe send more of the gas tax back to us, or sales taxes on automobiles. Where will that money go? Then, we also need to look at TIF districts.""\Jared Bellard:\""I do not think the parish has the sources to support these major projects. We have had road taxes voted down, and that tells me that people do not want to be taxed for these roads.""\On impact fees for new developments:\Bruce Conque:\""An impact fee is just one of many revenue streams that needs to be considered. One of the things about the impact fee is that it is not a recurring revenue and cannot be used for bonding purposes. But we need to address our aging infrastructure. When we talk about addressing infrastructure needs, we have to look at both new and existing.""\Travis Farrar:\""I don't like the idea of impact fees, but I'm also not ruling anything out at this point. If I were going to support impact fees in Lafayette, there are several things that would have to happen. If it comes down to the point where we need it for funding, I wouldn't rule anything out.""\Sam Dore:\""I feel that impact fees may slow our economy. We all know that they would pass it on to the consumer. Impact fees are not a sustainable source of revenue. Now is not the time for an impact fee.""\Jared Bellard:\""I am against impact fees for the simple reason that it would make it harder to create the kind of development we need. Ultimately, the impact fee will be passed on to the consumer. Whatever we do, we need to look at the whole picture and make sure it does not cripple development in less affluent areas.""\John Barras:\""I'm against impact fees totally. It discourages affordable homes. The monies cannot be bonded and they cannot move from one district to another. Our largest subdivision at this point would not bring in more than $5 (million) or $6 million. $6 million is a drop in the bucket.""\Tom Sekhani:\""I'm totally against impact fees. It drives up the cost of development and is passed on to the consumers. I think we should do it in the fashion that we did other subdivisions.""\Don Bertrand:\""I can't support impact fees. I'm not afraid to have the discussion, but they're not going to raise the types of money that we need, they can't be bonded and I haven't seen a formula to determine how the fees are going to be assessed."""
42,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
43,"BATON ROUGE -- Encouraging natural gas use for automobiles would be good for the state economy and the environment, Rep. Jane Smith said Thursday.\The House approved her House Bill 110 that offers tax credits she says could spur the development of natural gas-powered vehicles and filling stations.\""Natural gas is a clean-burning fuel,"" Smith told the House, and with the monstrous Haynesville Shale development in the northwestern part of the state, it's going to be in bountiful supply for years to come. And with oil supplies in the United States on the decline, ""it's almost a matter of national security"" to find alternative fuels.\HB110 increases the individual and corporate income tax credit for the purchase of a qualified clean-burning motor vehicle, the purchase and installation of equipment to convert a gasoline or diesel engine to burn natural gas and to develop a dispensing location.\The cost estimate of HB110 is $164,000 the first year, growing to $200,000 by 2013-14, the Legislative Fiscal Office report shows, but it contains qualifying language.\""The bill would pay for 50 percent of the costs of fueling-dispensing equipment,"" the report says. ""If gas stations add this equipment or firms operating vehicle fleets add this equipment, the costs of this credit could increase substantially.""\The 11 opponents in the House questioned why the natural gas tax credit should receive preference over others that are being bottled up in the House Ways and Means Committee and whether the state should be granting credits when it's cutting higher education and health care.\Smith answered that some credits ""rise to the top"" but ""I know mine's competing with all the others."" She said she has received numerous inquiries from investors interested in coming to the state and the Department of Natural Resources estimates natural gas production could be a $3 billion industry.\Rep. Barbara Norton, D-Shreveport, said the tax break would ""bring more funds in than what we're putting out."" She encouraged the House to ""vote for the future.""\Rep. Sam Jones, D-Franklin, said he supports the measure because ""it's an investment, and it's one quarter of 1 percent what we spent on the Saints.""\""We have the opportunity in the state of Louisiana to be a national leader in this,"" Smith said when she introduced the idea. ""We have something that's abundant, it's clean and it's American.""\Sen. Nick Gautreaux, D-Meaux, has an identical bill awaiting a hearing in the House Ways and Means Committee."
44,"By Bobbie J. Clark\bobbieclark@gannett.com\The stimulus package, alternative energy, the film industry and the Independence Bowl are some of the topics Louisiana Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu covered Tuesday at the Greater Shreveport Chamber of Commerce.\After a brief introduction, Landrieu opened the floor to questions. Following are his responses to some of them.\If Louisiana is able to attract money from the stimulus package, is there support from your office to get that funding out to train people and create jobs?\""Yes.

LAFAYETTE Mary Scheps' monthly electric bill? $4.12.
\
Doing her part to protect the environment? Priceless.
\
Scheps is Lafayette's first resident to generate all of her electricity from solar power.
\
More than a dozen solar panels on her roof produce enough energy to power her entire home, with enough left over to share with her neighbors.
\
The system has reduced her electric bill to a $4.12 customer service fee. The excess power it generates is credited to her utility bill.
\
But money isn't her motivation for solar power. She's worried about conserving natural resources.
\
""I believe ... we should make choices that benefit our descendants, our country and our planet,"" she said.
\
""And if these choices require sacrifices, then we should be willing to make them.""
\
Solar power has grown exponentially in the past few years, but still makes up less than 1 percent of the power supply. The large initial investment deters most homeowners.
\
But financial aid such as rebates, tax credits and the ability to sell excess energy back to a grid are making solar panels more attractive to homeowners.
\
Scheps' entire system cost about $26,000, but incentives and credits should knock that down to about $6,000.
\
Energy savings should pay for the system in about 10 years, according to the Baton Rouge company that installed it.
\
Scheps' system generates an average 360 kilowatt hours of power each month.
\
For an average household, that would be about one-third of the total. But it's more than enough for Scheps, who uses less than half the power her solar system produces.
\
The Lafayette City-Parish Council recently passed a net metering ordinance that would let LUS customers connect their solar panels or other alternative energy sources to the city's power grid.
\
Any customer generating more ""green energy"" than they consume would be eligible for a credit on their utility bill, which can be redeemed when they disconnect their service.
\
Scheps became the first residential customer to connect to the city's grid. Since her net metering system was installed, she has generated more than 800 kilowatt hours of electricity while consuming less than 400.
\
Conserving resources is nothing new to Scheps. She became interested in conservation around the time of the nation's first Earth Day in 1970.
\
""I just became aware of ... the way we were using up the resources of the planet too fast,"" she said. ""It just worried me because it looked like we needed to turn it around.""
\
To this day, Scheps dries her laundry on a clothesline instead of using an electric dryer or iron, and rides her bike instead of driving a car. She uses fans instead of air conditioning to cool her home, and lets in sunlight rather than turning on light bulbs.
\
""I do everything I know to do, and I am eager for more suggestions,"" she said.
\
Lafayette Utilities System has no current plans to invest in renewable resources because of additional costs, said director Terry Huval.
\
But the company encourages customers to do so on their own through the net metering program.
\
""If customers invest in renewables, the city becomes greener at the initiative of the customers themselves,"" Huval said. ""So, it's a positive thing for the community as a whole.""
