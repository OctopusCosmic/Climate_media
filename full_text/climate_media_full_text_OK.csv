0,"While efforts to boost the use of natural gas as an alternative fuel in Oklahoma continue to gain momentum, those efforts need to continue, energy experts said last week.\In a media statement issued by outgoing House Speaker Chris Benge, the lawmaker said business leaders are showing increased interest in developing the state's natural gas market.\""From a public policy standpoint, energy security is one of the top issues facing this country right now,"" said Benge, R-Tulsa. ""It's clear that both Oklahoma's citizens and business leaders are embracing this idea and joining the effort to promote locally produced fuels like natural gas.""\Officials with the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association agreed.\""Several private companies, including Apache Corp. and Chesapeake Energy, are replacing their regular fuel vehicles with natural gas-powered vehicles,"" said Cody Bannister, OIPA spokesman.\Bannister said the biggest change could be spawned in fleet vehicles.\""The biggest gain is in fleet vehicles,"" he said. ""Companies are replacing cars and trucks that typically run the same routes with natural gas vehicles. Those are the most viable options.""\Benge agreed. Speaking at a Tulsa Metro Chamber event last week, he said the state is at the forefront in expanding the nation's natural gas market.\""When looking at alternative fuels, the no-brainer for Oklahoma is natural gas,"" Benge said. ""It creates jobs in Oklahoma and provides greater energy security for the country.""\Industry studies show the United States spends about $100 million per day on imported oil, including oil generated in regions hostile to Americans. But at the same time, those studies show an estimated 100-year supply of natural gas is still available for production on the American continent.\""And that supply is increasing, thanks to successful technological advancements in horizontal drilling,"" Benge said.\Benge said energy security - on the state and national level - has been a focal point of his tenure as speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives.\He said state lawmakers have enacted policies that encourage the use of natural gas for vehicles and the installation of corresponding fueling infrastructure and continue to develop proposals for the development of the fueling infrastructure.\""We want to be aggressive in building the network of fueling stations,"" he said. ""As a result of Oklahoma's policies, there are currently around a dozen more natural gas fueling stations in the development pipeline.""\Bannister said those ideas would allow natural gas to be used as a ""bridge fuel"" as the country makes a switch from petroleum to other energy sources.\""We've seen a lot of promotion for natural gas as a bridge fuel,"" he said. ""It's here, it's affordable and it's accessible.""\And new technologies, Bannister said, have expanded the supply.\""The use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have opened vast amounts of natural gas across the country that were, 20 years ago, unproducable,"" he said.\To help develop the state's market for natural gas, Benge said lawmakers passed the Oklahoma Energy Security Act this year, which set an alternative-energy goal, including having one public natural gas fueling station every 100 miles along the state's interstate system by the year 2015 and every 50 miles by 2025.\""Oklahoma is reportedly the only state with an alternative-energy standard set specifically for natural gas,"" he said.\Benge said the price advantage of natural gas, along with the increased energy security, will make the fuel a major part of the national energy policy discussion.\""Everyone was really focused on this issue when gasoline was $4 per gallon,"" he said. ""I don't want the public to forget we still have a real challenge ahead of us. Prices may have come down from a high of a couple of years ago, but we are still facing the need to address the nation's energy security.""\That's the right direction, Bannister said.\""We taken some great first steps to develop the market,"" he said. ""But there are still more steps to take.""\Credit: M. Scott Carter"
1,"Oklahoma U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe predicted that Tuesday's election results will impact legislation for the next two years as senators up for re-election in 2012 will change their voting behavior.\""They will not be in lock step with the Obama administration,"" Inhofe said.\Inhofe, a Republican, addressed 275 people at the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association's Wildcatter luncheon Wednesday at the Tulsa Country Club.\Inhofe, the state's senior senator and the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, offered his views on the results of the Nov. 2 election and the impact the election results will have on the country, Oklahoma and the oil and natural gas industry.\""The senators who were elected in 2006 up for re-election sat up and took notice of what happened,"" Inhofe said.\The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works impacts the energy sector more than others in the U.S. Congress because it creates regulation.\""But that will change with this election,"" Inhofe said.\As the ranking member of the committee, Inhofe sits next to the committee chair, which has been U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who won re-election on Tuesday. While Inhofe is rated the most conservative senator in the U.S. Senate, Boxer is considered by many to be on the opposite end of the political spectrum.\""I want you all to know what I have to put up with for you,"" Inhofe told the audience, to much laughter. ""I have had to spend three-and-a-half hours a week sitting next to her for the last four years.""\Currently, there are 16 Democrats on the committee to seven Republicans. As the GOP has won six seats, the ratio on the Public Works panel will likely shift to 10 Democrats to nine Republicans, Inhofe said. With such a narrow margin, it will be tougher for the Democrats to push their agenda.\""I do not see Democrats passing any new regulations as a result of the elections last night,"" Inhofe said. ""And we'll be on top of it.""\Answering a question from the crowd, Inhofe pooh-poohed earmarks.\""The whole argument is a phony issue. They demagogue it,"" Inhofe said, referring to Democrats. He blamed Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain for stirring up the debate over earmarks, or provisions written into federal legislation that directs funds to be spent on specific projects.\McCain, knowing that he'd have to run for re-election this year, used the issue as a tool in his campaign effort, Inhofe said.\Inhofe said the U.S. House of Representatives wrote a rule against using the controversial tactic of earmarks, but defined it as an appropriation, or something Congress is instructed to do by the Constitution.\""Writing appropriations is what the House does, that is their job,"" Inhofe said. ""That entire move by the Democrats gave authority to the president to write the budget.""\The estate tax will be another issue likely to be tackled during the lame-duck session, which starts Nov. 16, Inhofe said.\""I tell all my friends they need to die before Dec. 31, because after that the death tax doubles,"" Inhofe said.\Inhofe warned about potential legislation that would target crude oil production.\T. Boone Pickens, previously a proponent of wind energy, has changed his renewable-energy message. Now the energy tycoon speaks solely of natural gas as the energy source that can eliminate America's dependence on foreign oil.\Inhofe called Pickens naive, saying he trusts U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid too much.\""The natural gas legislation will benefit natural gas and make crude oil (producers) pay for it,"" Inhofe said. Reid won re-election on Tuesday.\Inhofe also repeated his warning about global warming. He said claims that so-called greenhouse gases and man-made warming harm the planet are part of a hoax.\The administration has failed to push a cap-and-trade bill through Congress. The measure would limit greenhouse gases.\""Cap and trade is a regressive energy tax,"" Inhofe said. ""And, cap and trade will have no effect on reducing greenhouse gases.""\Inhofe said companies and consumers outside of Washington are realizing that cap and trade is designed to deliver money and power to the government.\Credit: D.

2,"If nothing else, the opposition is organized.\While members of the U.S. Senate struggle to find the right language for the American Clean Energy and Security Act and the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, the opposition to both measures has grown larger and more vocal.\According to the Web site opencongress.org, the Waxman-Markey energy bill (also known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act) includes a cap-and-trade global warming reduction plan designed to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020. Other provisions include new renewable requirements for utilities, incentives for new carbon capture and sequestration technologies, energy-efficiency incentives for homes and buildings, and grants for green jobs.\The measure is currently awaiting action by the full Senate.\The second bill, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Bill, is sponsored by Sen. John Kerry. That bill includes short- and long-term emissions limits, consumer protection measures and support for the development of clean energy technologies, including natural gas. The bill, which was introduced just a few days ago, has been assigned to the Senate's Committee on Environment and Public Works.\Neither measure is popular with most energy leaders.\In fact many industry leaders say the bills would kill jobs and wreck the economy. Across the country trade associations have lined up to stop the Waxman-Markey bill.\Charles Drevna, president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, said the Clean Energy and Security Act offers false promises. In a recent media statement, Drevna said the measure would have a negative effect national security.\""While this may appear, in the short term, to be a monumental political success, ultimately it represents nothing more than an abject policy failure,"" he said. ""Ultimately at stake are American energy security and the ability of our home-grown energy providers to compete in global markets, as we must.""\The State Chamber has been vocal in its opposition to the bill.\""Oklahoma could lose 20,000 jobs and see household income fall almost $900 annually under cap-and-trade legislation that recently passed the U. S. House of Representatives, a new study shows,"" chamber officials warned in a recent media release. ""The study evaluated the impact of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, also known as the Waxman-Markey Bill, on the manufacturing sector, energy prices and overall state economies.""\State Chamber Senior Vice President Ron Cupp said the measure would cause Oklahomans to lose jobs and disposable household income.\""Household income will decrease by $490 to $883. Under the bill, energy prices are expected to rise, particularly coal, oil and natural gas. By 2015, gasoline would increase between 6 and 9 percent, electricity between 5 and 8 percent and natural gas between 16 and 25 percent,"" he said.\Natural gas companies have come out against the proposal, too. \Chip Minty, a spokesman for Devon Energy, said his company was opposed to the Clean Energy Act. \""We're very concerned for a few reasons,"" he said. ""The cap-and-trade provision would create additional costs for energy for everyone in the United States. It would increase energy prices.""\Minty said Devon officials also were concerned because natural gas was left out of the Waxman-Markey bill. \""Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available to us. It's a fuel plentiful in supply and is an obvious source of energy. It's alarming for us that a bill designed to fight greenhouse gas emissions left out natural gas.""\Officials at Oneok, the parent company of Oklahoma Gas & Electric, said they were taking a ""wait-and-see"" attitude.\""We are watching this legislation closely and evaluating its impact on our customers and our businesses,"" said company spokesman Megan Washbourne. ""As is usually the case, you can expect the legislation to change several times before the final vote is taken.""\Oneok, she said, recognizes the need to balance protecting the environment and its obligation to provide natural gas to its customers safely, efficiently and economically. \""We have supported federal and state legislation that helps our customers become more energy efficient and use conservation as a means to reduce carbon emissions. We regularly work with our industry trade associations and our Congressional delegations to help them understand our business and how this legislation could affect their constituents and our customers,"" Washbourne said.\Yet even with the controversy, not every energy group is opposed to the bills.\The trade group America's Natural Gas Alliance said it was pleased to be included in the introduction of the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act.\""America's Natural Gas Alliance appreciates the opportunity to be included in today's event announcing the introduction of the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act,"" said Rod Lowman, association president. ""For months, ANGA has worked constructively with Chairmen (Sen. Barbara) Boxer and Kerry, and many other members of the Senate and House, to help them understand the benefits of including strong incentives to promote domestic natural gas in any climate legislation.""\The group, Lowman said, looks forward to working with Boxer and Kerry over the coming weeks to ensure that any final energy and climate bill fully recognizes the environmental, economic and energy security benefits of abundant natural gas.\And, according to at least one national poll, Americans, themselves, are supportive of the Waxman-Markey bill.\According to a Zogby International telephone survey of 1,005 likely voters, 71 percent said they favored the American Clean Energy and Security Act.\The poll found that 68 percent of likely voters believe a new American energy policy will not result in job losses, with a majority believing such efforts could instead bring about job growth. Commissioned by the National Wildlife Federation, the Zogby poll was conducted from July 31 to Aug. 4 and carries a margin of error of +/-3.2 percent.\Credit: M. Scott Carter"
3,"Chesapeake Energy spent more than $1 million lobbying the federal government on issues ranging from climate change to the derivatives market during the first quarter of 2010 alone, according to public records. Devon Energy spent a little more than half a million dollars on lobbying efforts during the same period of time, according to federal disclosure statements.\The lobbying reports, required by federal law, include payments to Washington, D.C., lobbying firms, as well as money spent analyzing and monitoring legislation and things like dues to trade organizations and travel expenses. \Chesapeake spent $1.08 million during the first quarter of 2010 on lobbying efforts, according to disclosure statements. Devon spent $525,000 during the same period of time.\Both Chesapeake and Devon paid close attention to legislation related to climate change and environmental policy, including two bills that would make hydraulic fracturing, an integral part of the natural gas extraction process the companies use, subject to federal regulation. \The process involves using liquids to create fractures in rock to aid in the extraction of natural gas from rock formations. Environmentalists have raised concerns about groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing, although natural gas companies claim the process is safe and has been in use for more than 60 years. \Senate Bill 1215 and House Resolution 2766 would force oil and gas companies like Devon and Chesapeake to disclose the chemicals they use in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as put restrictions on underground injection of the fluids near drinking water sources. Both bills are in committee. \Chesapeake Energy has been working closely with U.S. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., who authored the House version of the hydraulic fracturing bill, and members of the energy and commerce committee to make its voice heard, said Tom Price Jr., a senior vice president of corporate development and government relations for Chesapeake. \""We want to ensure we have a bill that addresses the concerns of those in some of the new areas of the country, while not taking the legislation into the areas that are not going to enhance the protection of the environment, but are just going to reduce the amount of capital investment into the industry and reduce the overall production of natural gas as well,"" Price said. \Chesapeake and Devon both spent money during the first quarter monitoring bills such as House Resolution 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. Also known as the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, HR 2454 would create a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions and promote the development of clean energy resources in the United States. The bill passed the House last spring and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. \The Waxman bill mentions developing alternatives to coal and oil, but pays little attention to natural gas, said Chip Minty, a spokesman for Devon Energy. \""The Waxman bill really ignored natural gas,"" Minty said. ""When it passed, we realized that few of the policymakers in Washington realized the potential natural gas has for solving some of the energy problems we have in this country.""\Credit: Brianna Bailey"
4,"Recent legal changes affecting the environment have centered in statutory and regulatory actions as well as the courts, say attorneys who practice in the area of ""green law."" Among changes they see in the wind: internalization of fossil fuel costs, to account more for their environmental effects and the potential for fly-ash litigation in Oklahoma.\""The biggest thing is a major change in energy,"" said Edmond attorney Harlan Hentges. ""There's been a clear decision to prevent the fossil-fuel industry from externalizing its costs. So, there's going to be regulation of mercury and regulation of carbon and regulation of fly ash. Perhaps there'll be regulation of mountaintop removal, strip mining.""\Hentges said having to internalize costs associated with those issues would make fossil fuels, particularly coal, less competitive with solar and wind energy.\""It's going to be very disruptive and it's going to cause a great transformation of energy,"" he said.\Hentges sees withdrawal of the permit application for the AES Shadypoint coal-powered plant as a major event in the environmental regulatory arena.\He said the state's lawmakers are working on a couple of issues that seem strange when considered together: ""green jobs"" and nuclear energy.\""Of course, there are different environmental effects,"" Hentges said. ""But the more interesting effect in my mind is that with green jobs, you're decentralizing your energy industry.""\He said that putting into the hands of individuals the ability to be more energy-efficient or actually generate electricity through wind or solar would create a very different industry than a nuclear plant, where electricity generation is controlled by a single entity.\Even if the ultimate resolution comes down on the side of individual choice and independence, Hentges said, the industry would still need to be involved, constructing a ""very smart grid"" to manage all those people who are generating power with rooftop solar, small wind and other means.\Attorney Jeff Tate, who is with the Edmond chapter of the Oklahoma Sustainability Network, noted that the legal battle between Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson and the poultry industry concerning allegations of watershed pollution from poultry litter should go to trial sometime in the fall.\""That will be kind of a large thing to watch coming up, as to how all that poultry waste is treated and whose cost it is to clean up the mess from it,"" Tate said.\Rate said another group of lawsuits, brought by poultry growers about their treatment by Tyson, addresses the social-equity component of sustainability. Tate said the lawsuits center on who should bear responsibility for the costs associated with growing and caring for the poultry.\On the court front, Tate said, the issue of fly ash that is being litigated in Tennessee, Virginia and elsewhere hasn't made its way to Oklahoma yet, but may do so soon. He said the Tennessee litigation stems from the recent collapse of a dike on a 40-acre retention pond, while the Virginia cases center on reported health issues encountered by people whose homes a developer built on top of a former fly-ash dump.\Recently, residents of the small Oklahoma town of Bokoshe have made similar allegations regarding the effects of living near a fly-ash facility in their area.\On the horizon, Tate sees questions about what the federal ""stimulus package"" may mean for obtaining funds to strengthen electrical lines in western Oklahoma for promotion of wind energy, as well as the possible continuance of geothermal tax credits and potential tax breaks for small wind and solar energy facilities. Tate is also following the progress of the Obama administration's ""cap and trade"" proposal, which would place certain caps on the amount of pollution companies are allowed to make. Under the plan, a company that finds it needs fewer pollution units than it is allowed could sell them to other companies.\Credit: Marie Price"
5,"OKLAHOMA CITY - Scientists agree climate change is likely to make weather more severe and unpredictable.\The effects are local: Extreme weather caused more than $112 million in damages in 2015, according to preliminary figures from the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. But Oklahoma policymakers are unlikely to address climate change on a state level because the solutions have global implications, said Oklahoma City University Meinders School of Business Dean Steve Agee.\Local climate researcher Renee McPherson said she's hesitant to tie any particular weather event in Oklahoma to climate change. However, the atmospheric phenomenon affects rainfall patterns and temperature across the globe. McPherson, the University of Oklahoma's South Central Climate Science Center Research director, said that, in general, climate change will lead to warmer winters, hotter summers and more intense rainfall events.\The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency approved disaster assistance funds for damages resulting from storms in the summer and winter of 2015. Summer storms caused at least $41.49 million in damages from flooding, tornadoes and straight-line winds, according to state OEM estimates.\Post-Thanksgiving weather caused at least $20.5 million in damages from snow, ice and flooding. Winter storms from Dec. 26 through Jan. 5 caused about $48.2 million in FEMA-approved damages.\McPherson said shifting rainfall patterns will affect when winter wheat can be sown and harvested. Precipitation soaked fields in early June 2015, when farmers usually take in the crop.\""If that continues, it would be a management issue for winter wheat,"" she said.\The winter wheat crop was valued at $307 million in 2014, the most recent data available, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service.\The southwestern U.S. will become more arid. Oklahoma is already semi-arid, but still receives plentiful rainfall at times. If nurseries continue to stock the plants that thrive in humid environments and don't carry more drought-tolerant varieties, homeowners will have to use more water to keep vegetation alive.\Oklahomans are faced with a classic economic conundrum, said University of Central Oklahoma environmental economics professor Travis Roach. Industries produce greenhouse gas pollution, but don't pay for the damage climate change causes. Consumers and government agencies must then bear the burden.\One solution is for policymakers to determine a market price for clean air. That price can be accounted for by taxing industries that create pollution. Another method is a cap-and-trade system, which caps the amount of pollution and encourages industries to reduce pollution and sell credits to those polluting above the cap, Roach said.\Coastal states have addressed climate policy in different ways. Nine states along the Eastern Seaboard joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and cut climate-change pollution by 30 percent since 2009. That cap-and-trade system gradually reduces overall limits for polluting industries. Money generated from pollution permits goes to help businesses improve energy efficiency.\California addressed climate change in its Assembly Bill 32, passed in 2006. The law puts a cap on pollution from refineries and other heavy industries. It also taxes fossil-based petroleum fuels, including an 11-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax and a 13-cent-per-gallon diesel tax.\Agee said coastal states have more incentive to act because air pollution is worse and population density is greater. Oklahoma was founded on oil and gas, so policymakers won't likely pass legislation that harms the industry and subsequently hurts the state's economy, he said.\And as India and China develop, those countries will continue to burn coal for power generation, creating more greenhouse gas pollution. It's hard to create an incentive to make less pollution in Oklahoma if other states and countries don't act too, he said.\""The intent of adding environmental costs is good, because we all want a healthy environment,"" Agee said. ""But you have to be pragmatic and rational.""\Please read all of our Earth Day 2016 coverage.\(c) 2016 Dolan Media Newswires. All Rights Reserved.\Credit: Sarah Terry-Cobo"
6,"The American Petroleum Institute urged the U.S. Congress and the Obama administration to promote energy policies that will aid the nation's economic recovery and reduce its debt.\An API-sponsored study said increased access to domestic oil and natural gas - rather than increased taxes on the U.S. oil and natural gas industry - is the best strategy for increasing government revenue, jobs and energy production. The study was conducted by Wood Mackenzie, a leading provider of research and consulting services to the energy industry.\U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., agreed with the study's findings.\""Unfortunately, for the past two years the Obama administration has pushed an aggressive liberal agenda designed to hamper such production,"" Inhofe said. ""Exploring and developing our domestic energy resources is essential to creating jobs and building a strong economy.""\It is not a new message, said Bill Bush, API spokesman.\""We always talk about the nexus to more jobs is through lower taxes,"" Bush said.\In today's economic climate, people are hearing the message, he said.\""People understand if the industry can increase its investment in developing energy, it will increase the number of jobs,"" Bush said.\U.S. oil and natural gas companies are a major force in the economy and, with the right policies in place, could drive even greater economic benefits, said API President and CEO Jack Gerard.\""These companies produce most of the nation's energy, put millions of people to work and deliver billions in taxes and royalties to our government,"" he said. ""The study shows increased access to areas currently off-limits would create jobs, grow the economy and dramatically increase revenues to the Treasury, at a time when the U.S. deficit is of national concern.\""Increased taxes would take us backwards,"" he said.\Inhofe, who is the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, has said he beat back costly new taxes on Oklahoma's energy community - including global warming cap-and-trade legislation.\""In the next Congress, I will continue to stand up for our Oklahoma energy sector so we can turn this economy around and put Americans back to work,"" Inhofe said.\By 2025, increased access could create 530,000 jobs; deliver $150 billion more in tax, royalty and other revenue to the government; and boost domestic production by 4 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to the study, which is called ""Energy Policy at a Crossroads: An Assessment of the Impacts of Increased Access versus Higher Taxes on U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Production, Government Revenue and Employment.""\Raising taxes on the industry with no increase in access could reduce domestic production by 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2020, sacrifice as many as 170,000 jobs by 2014 and reduce revenue to the government by billions of dollars annually.\An additional 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in potential production that is currently of marginal economic feasibility would be at greater risk of not being developed under the modeled tax increase, the study said.\On access, the study assumes the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, portions of the Rocky Mountains, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the Atlantic and Pacific Outer Continental Shelf would be opened to development. On taxes, it assumes a $5 billion increase in annual taxes on the industry, which is less than the amount considered last year by the U.S. Congress and the Obama administration.\Credit: D.

7," On Tuesday, the state House Energy and Technology Committee will consider the arguments for and against building a nuclear power plant in Oklahoma.\ State Rep. Doug Cox, R-Grove, proposed an interim study on the cost, economic impact and risks of building a nuclear plant. But the real reasons why Oklahoma is one of only nine states without at least one nuclear power plant may prove difficult to define in purely economic terms.\ Oklahoma's demand for electricity has been growing at a pace of about 2 percent per year.\ The Oklahoma Corporation Commission found the state's two largest electricity utilities will need to add a combined total of 750 megawatts of generation capacity by 2012 to meet increasing demand.\ Oklahoma City-based Oklahoma Gas and Electric, which currently has about 6,100 megawatts of capacity, will need to add 450 megawatts, while Tulsa-based Public Service Company of Oklahoma, with 4,156 megawatts of generation capacity, demonstrated a need for an additional 450 megawatts.\ In October, the two utilities scrapped a plan to meet future demand with a shared 950-megawatt coal plant known as Red Rock, after the Corporation Commission rejected their attempt to collect from their ratepayers the cost of building the plant. State law directs the utilities and the commission to explore all reasonable alternatives before deciding on the best option for meeting future demand, but the utilities had improperly limited their consideration to comparing coal-fired generation with a natural gas-fired facility, the commission found.\ Early in the process, the utilities' spokesmen made it clear that building a nuclear plant in Oklahoma seems a rather remote possibility. It takes several years to design and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to build a nuclear facility, said OG&E spokesman Brian Alford. If OG&E started the process now, the utility might be able to begin use of a nuclear facility by 2020, he said.\ On the other hand, PSO has already tried to build a nuclear power plant in Oklahoma. The company lost millions of dollars involved in planning and fighting for its proposed Black Fox nuclear plant, which would have been built near Inola. PSO proposed the plant in May 1973, which would have cost $450 million to build and was expected to significantly boost the tax base for local schools.\ Carrie Barefoot Dickerson, a registered nurse and owner of Aunt Carrie's Nursing Home in Claremore, made it her mission to fight construction of the plant. She founded a group called the Citizens' Action for Safe Energy, sold her business and mortgaged her home to fund the effort to derail construction of the plant. But perhaps the anti-nuclear group in Oklahoma was most aided by the news coverage of a fire in Tennessee's Browns Ferry nuclear plant in 1975 and a partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. Plans for Oklahoma's nuclear plant were scrapped in 1982.\ Nationwide, nuclear power is gaining renewed interest as a means of making the nation less reliant on foreign oil, and in light of technological advances that have improved the safety and efficiency of nuclear plants.\ Nuclear power provides about 19 percent of the nation's electricity. The state of Texas, with 4,860 megawatts of nuclear generation capacity, ranks seventh among the 31 states with nuclear generation facilities. Other Oklahoma neighbors with nuclear power include Kansas with 1,166 megawatts, Arkansas with 1,824 megawatts, Missouri with 1,190 megawatts and Louisiana with 2,119 megawatts of nuclear generation capacity.\ Until Arizona's Palo Verde plant was updated in 2005, the two South Texas Project reactors were the nation's largest. In 2004, nuclear power accounted for 11 percent of Texas' electricity market, while natural gas dominated the market at 48 percent, followed by coal at 39 percent. The damage inflicted on refineries in the Gulf of Mexico by Hurricane Rita in 2005 led officials in Texas to halt plans to shut down a reactor, reports the federal Energy Information Administration.\ ""The fact that on-site power was available in the event of an emergency was an essential factor in the decision,"" according to the EIA.\ Several legislative committees are currently focused on the issues surrounding Oklahoma's energy future, with an eye to creating a comprehensive energy policy and legislation.\ ""If you want to talk about clean and green, you're talking nuclear,"" Virginia state Sen. Frank Wagoner told members of the Oklahoma Senate Energy and Environment Committee two weeks ago. Wagoner had been invited to speak with the committee about how he led an effort in his state to create a comprehensive plan for meeting Virginia's future demand for electricity using varied fuel sources.\ In developing a 10-year energy plan for Virginia, officials in that state identified nuclear power as the second cleanest and cheapest fuel source for generating electricity, bested only by hydroelectric power. Virginia gets 27 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and most of the balance from coal, said Wagoner. Facing ever-increasing demand from the state's burgeoning technology industry on the one hand and the increasing likelihood that Congress will impose a carbon tax on coal-fired power plants, Virginia committed to increasing its capacity for nuclear generation, he said.\ Uncertainty regarding long-term costs of using coal and natural gas is one of the factors making nuclear more attractive in recent years. Currently, the long-term costs of nuclear, coal and natural gas fired generation are comparable, but increasing shortages in natural gas supplies and impending carbon taxes may give nuclear the edge. In 2006, the lifetime cost of wind generating capacity was $55.80 per MWh, while coal cost $53.10, natural gas cost $52.50 and nuclear cost $59.30.\ Still, Wagoner acknowledged it takes a lot of money to build a nuclear facility. The upfront costs for redundant safety features and stringent regulatory approvals involved in the process can make a nuclear unattractive for privately-held utility companies that are being pushed by the market toward shorter contracts and shorter return-on-investment periods. In the short-term, a nuclear facility is estimated to cost $2,000 per kilowatt or more to build.\ Credit: Janice Francis-Smith"
8,"By Robert D. Hershey Jr. WASHINGTON - In the spring of 1986, George Bush traveled to Saudi Arabia to plead with the world's biggest oil exporter to stop flooding the market. Bush told the Saudis that their overproduction, by driving down the price, was jeopardizing the American oil industry, in turn undermining the nation's economic strength and security.\ Now, President Bush finds himself imploring the Saudis to raise production by about 35 percent, or 2 million barrels a day.\ Both pleas were probably well advised in the circumstances, many energy specialists believe. What the about-face in the United States' position underscores is the extent to which American policy sought to take advantage of an oversupply of oil to keep prices down - at the cost of a higher level of dependence on imported oil.\ Before the latest round of increases that followed Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, a gallon of gasoline cost less, adjusted for inflation, than at any time in the last 30 years. At the same time, the United States' dependence on imported oil has grown to slightly more than 50 percent of consumption.\ In deciding to pursue a laissez-faire policy that had the benefit of stimulating economic growth, the United States relied heavily on an economic analysis that ignores the political instability of the Middle East, where world reserves are concentrated. But Adam Smith's economics break down when confronted by the barrel of a gun.\ While the Reagan administration did build a stratetgic stockpile of oil, many critics contend that its overall policy allowed the country to forget various hard-won lessons from the 1970s.\ ``We fell into a dangerous complacency as oil moved into ample supply and prices tumbled,'' said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International and a high-ranking State Department economic official during the Reagan administration. ``We assumed the problems of the 1970s were permanently behind us.''\ Heavy-handed government intervention has been largely discredited, with widespread agreement that the government's price and allocation controls were responsible for gasoline lines in the 1970s.\ The Reagan administration veered to the other pole. Eight days after his inauguration, Reagan lifted all remaining price controls on oil and began a policy under which the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, relied almost exclusively on unfettered market forces to direct supply and demand.\ Subsidies for synthetic fuels disappeared; consumption taxes were shunned; conservation was played down; ration coupons were destroyed.\ Critics predicted that decontrol would unleash huge price increases - and the government enacted what became known as a windfall profits tax to capture the anticipated revenue. But instead, prices promptly sank, a sustained 65 percent decline that brought oil briefly below $10 a barrel in 1986 before prices rebounded to the teens.\ Consumers and politicians found it appealing for the world to be awash in inexpensive oil, and they also enjoyed the lingering benefits of the era of expensive oil. These included new oil from producers outside OPEC and various increases in oil-use efficiency.\ Indeed, the low-priced oil helped propel an expansion of the American economy that is now in its eighth year, a peacetime record. But an almost exclusive reliance on the free market came up against a major obstacle, one quite apart from guns.\ It is the geologically grounded fact that the United States, even with sophisticated technology, cannot compete successfully in the oil business with countries whose fields are vastly bigger and whose production costs are only a few dollars a barrel.\ ``For the last decade we have allowed market forces to determine energy outcomes,'' said James R. Schlesinger, a former energy secretary. ``But since the U.S. is the highest- cost producer in the world - the comparative advantage lying elsewhere - this has caused a steady decline in U.S. production.''\ The drop in domestic production has been 19 percent in the last five years and 24 percent from the record 9.6 million barrels a day in 1970. The United States, with Alaska's North Slope now past its peak, produced at a daily rate of 7.3 million barrels in the first half of this year, only half its consumption.\ With foreign oil cheap and plentiful, there was progressively little incentive for Americans to produce more - or consume less. While some measures raising energy efficiency, like higher standards for home insulation, remain in place, relatively little attention is paid to curbing oil demand. Big cars, in fact, have made a comeback.\ Reflecting a 75 percent drop in exploration since the early 1980's, as measured by the number of rigs in operation, much of the domestic oil industry's equipment is stacked up and much of its expertise scattered.\ Synthetic fuels programs withered because falling prices required ever- higher subsidies. And when marine oil spills resulted in stepped-up demands by environmentalists for moratoriums on drilling or production in certain areas, there was little political counterweight.\ At the moment, for example, the 90,000-barrel-a-day Point Arguello field off the California coast cannot be tapped because state and local permits have not been issued. Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, calls the situation ``a little awkward'' at a time when the United States is pressing other countries to increase their production.\ The main visible oil initiative of the Reagan administration was to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which now holds 590 million barrels of oil and which could within a month pump out some 3.5 million barrels a day.\ ``The administration's oil policy has been to enhance energy security while maintaining economic competitiveness and environmental quality,'' the Energy Department declared in a 1988 review.\ But critics contend the policy amounts to little more than an ineffective blend of ideology and expediency within a political system in which there are 43 states that consume more oil than they produce.\ ``There is no policy, of course,'' declared James E. Akins, a political and economic consultant and former ambassador to Saudi Arabia. For all its failings, the Carter administration's energy program, he said, at least had the right goal - ``to decrease our dependence on imported oil.''\ The Bush administration, which in July 1989 began a study of the nation's energy situation that is due on the president's desk in December, has found no need to draw on the strategic reserve in response to the Iraqi invasion. No shortages have yet emerged, the price of oil is still moderate by the standards of the last 15 years and the administration, in any event, is disinclined to tamper with the market.\ Yet Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore acknowledged in an interview this week, ``It's been rather easy for the country to sit back and let our growing energy problem continue to get worse.'' He said Bush's energy agenda would not be the same as Ronald Reagan's.\ While what Moore described as the Reagan policy of ``let the market do it'' was not being repudiated, there have been renewed government efforts to supplement market forces, he said.\ ``Already you've seen an activism,'' Moore said, ``to use the Department of Energy as a bully pulpit'' to explain the energy facts of life and to build support for the inevitably hard decisions that will flow from the emerging study of national energy strategy.\ The department, in offering some preliminary ideas this week, mentioned such demand-side palliatives as pumping up underinflated tires, strictly observing speed limits, car pooling, driving the more fuel-efficient car when there is a choice and making it easier for industry to switch fuels, such as from oil to natural gas.\ Some analysts insist on stronger measures. Peter G. Peterson, a private banker and former commerce secretary, characterized the 1980s as a ``period of lethargy'' and ``costless choices'' and said one answer was taxes.\ ``I don't think there's any doubt that we should have had a substantial energy-consumption tax,'' Peterson said. Not only would it have cut imports and aided the environment, such a tax would also have substantially reduced the budget deficit, he said.\ Others favor an import fee, which would also have the effect of raising the world price of oil, aiding domestic producers. There is also growing talk of a ``carbon tax'' on all forms of polluting fuels.\ But whatever the remedy, declared Charles Ebinger, a consultant with the International Resources Group here, ``We've got to get some kind of consensus that energy is indeed a strategic issue.''\ He said consumers must also be weaned from a misplaced sense of entitlement that fostered a belief that energy should be abundant and cheap."

10," By Ronda Fears Journal Record Staff Reporter There is perhaps no better energy segment than electricity to marry conservation and environmental protection issues, Oklahoma Gas and Electric Co. Chairman Jim Harlow observed Wednesday.\ Harlow spoke at the Energy 2001 conference, a week-long event at the Myriad Convention Center focusing on energy conservation and environmental issues.\ ""Certainly, there are tremendous economic benefits to the efficient use of all forms of energy - electric and otherwise,"" said Harlow, who was 1991 chairman of the Edison Electric Institute, the national trade group of\ electric utilities.\ ""As part of the infrastructure of our communities, states and nation, we (electric utilities) have a vested and inseparable interest in the economic health of our country. So, the more efficient we run, the more prosperous we become.\ ""The issues of economic health and environmental responsibility seem, at times, to be largely incompatible,"" Harlow said.\ ""But, with a vested interest in both, there is perhaps no industry - and no entity - better able to marry the issues of commerce and the environment than the electric utility industry."" There are experts who project that electricity will be the major energy source for America by 2000.\ Edison Electric Institute has been a forerunner in promoting conservation and environmental stewardship, he said. The organization has sponsored research into new technology and pilot programs to test new inventions. One current project is research into how cold fusion might assist in more advanced electric generation, for example.\ OG&E is now testing electronically controlled electric fryers at two fast-food restaurants in Oklahoma under a pilot program sponsored by the institute, Harlow said. The fryers capture heat produced in a kitchen to produce electricity, which cuts overall energy consumption by 20 percent, he said. OG&E is also field testing new heat pump technology to capture waste heat in the kitchen and helping in the development of improved electro-technology to handle medical waste.\ Such measures have to take on a worldwide scope, however, Harlow said.\ Edison Electric Institute is instrumental in establishing international exchanges on conservation of electricity and ideas of minimizing the effects of electric generation on the environment, he noted.\ ""These things have to be coordinated globally if we're going to make much impact,"" Harlow said.\ Aside from searching out safer ways to generate electricity, he said electric utilities are constantly promoting improved efficiency and resource management techniques. These measures include such things as energy audits for homes and businesses, which can identify simple things like a need to caulk windows or more major building revisions to reduce energy losses.\ ""Nationally, electric utilities are spending about $2 billion a year to help consumers and customers use energy more efficiently,"" Harlow said, referring to it by the trade term Demand Side Management.\ ""For an electric utility, the basic idea is, if you can minimize the need for electricity during the peak summer demand periods, you can delay the need for additional generating plants, thereby delaying the environmental and capital costs associated with those plants."" By 2000, electric utilities across the nation will have diverted the need for generation plants equaling 45,000 megawatts of new power, he said.\ That translates into a savings of billions of dollars, he added.\ For OG&E, Harlow said, Demand Side Management has helped reduce peak energy needs by 428 megawatts, which is equal to the capacity of OG&E's biggest generating units.\ ""The developing National Energy Strategy, pending revisions to the Public Utility Holding Company Act and the EPA's (Environmental Protection Agency) final acid rain rules as directed by the 1990 Clean Air Act, will all have an impact on the electric utility industry,"" Harlow said.\ ""In order for OG&E or any of these other utilities to pursue these invaluable endeavors, there must be a regulatory enivronment that allows - or better yet, encourages - utilities.""

11,"They're called low-speed vehicles, or LSVs for short, and thanks to two clients of attorney Jeff Tate who insisted on being ticketed, they're now legal in Edmond.\That's just one of the latest developments in what has come to be known as ""green law.""\Tate, president of Sustainable Edmond, said that unlike standard golf carts, LSVs can go more than 20 mph.\Under federal standards, LSVs that can do up to 25 mph are classified as motor vehicles, but are not required to have all of the safety bells and whistles of standard cars. They must have seatbelts, a VIN number, reflectors, lights and the like.\Tate said that under federal law LSVs can run on streets posted at 35 mph or less.\Oklahoma adopted the federal standards in 2001.\Two of Tate's clients have LSVs they use on some streets in their Edmond neighborhood, but some objected and called police.\Both insisted on being given citations.\Tate said the two lost their cases at the city level and appealed to district court.\Before their cases went to trial, Edmond adopted an ordinance approving low-speed electric vehicles, with some restrictions. Under an agreement, the two pleaded no contest and were given deferred sentences.\""The new ordinance kind of mooted what we were trying to do in court,"" Tate said.\Under the Edmond ordinance, LSVs can travel only on Edmond streets with speed limits of 30 mph or less, and must be licensed, tagged and properly equipped. Operators must have an Oklahoma driver's license and liability insurance.\""I guess Edmond is embracing the LSV,"" Tate said.\Attorney Harlan Hentges said two key ""green law"" issues in Oklahoma involve energy and agriculture.\He said there are proceedings before the Oklahoma Corporation Commission that center on demand side management or DSM, which he said includes energy efficiency, on-site generation, timing of demand, wind, solar and geothermal power and other measures to reduce the need for more power plants.\""Demand side management is the idea that how you manage, how you use electricity, is a resource, just like a generation facility,"" Hentges said. ""If you can spend a certain amount of money and decrease the amount of electricity you use, that has the same value as whatever it would cost to build an additional plant to provide that energy.""\Hentges said the focus on DSM intensified after the commission turned down a new coal-fired power plant at Red Rock last summer.\""We need more electricity,"" he said. ""That hasn't changed. Post-Red Rock, we've got to figure out how to meet that need for additional resources.""\However, he said it is difficult getting the relatively new DSM idea through the process.\Public Service Company of Oklahoma and Oklahoma Gas and Electric Co. have filed DSM proposals with the regulatory commission, and the commission is undertaking a rulemaking on demand side management.\Hentges said the commission is using a new approach involving a collaborative process facilitated by the Regulatory Assistance Project, a group of former regulators and others that do consulting work on DSM.\He said the Oklahoma Sustainability Network, known as OSN, is participating in the DSM proceedings before the commission with the Sierra Club, Oklahoma State Home Builders Association and others.\Hentges is general counsel of OSN.\He said DSM is viewed as a way to make the system more resilient.\""Even if a power line goes down, or even if a power plant goes down, that doesn't mean that we've lost all of our generation capacity, because a significant portion of generation capacity will be on people's roofs and in people's yards,"" Hentges said.\He is also concerned about what he refers to as the ""chickenization"" of the beef industry, the trend away from traditional cattle ranching toward feedlots that may contain thousands of cattle.\Hentges said large animal operations such as a 30,000-head cattle feedlot in Watonga remain key issues. He has represented landowners in litigation over the feedlot.\""For the people who live around there and for the town of Watonga, which is just three miles away, it's like living next to a 100,000-person city with no sewer system,"" he said. ""It's a terrible situation.""\In such situations, Hentges said, a few big players dictate how animals are used and treated.\He said a large Brazilian company, JBS, bought National Beef, the fourth-largest U.S. packer, and has reached an agreement to purchase Swift, the third largest. Swift also owns feedlots, so the purchase gives JBS more of those as well, he added.\Hentges said JBS is now the largest beef packer in the world, controlling more than 30 percent of the U.S. packing capability.\""This company has already bought three and four,"" he said. ""There are only two left.""\More recently, JBS has purchased Smithfield Beef Group Inc., based in Green Bay, Wisc.\There's a problem with going down that road, Hentges said.\""Nobody's big enough until there's only one,"" he said.\When that happens, Hentges said, ""a few big players control the market and dictate how animals are going to be raised. You take all the decision-making away from the people who live and work on the land and the people who actually live and work with the animals, people who actually are stewards, responsible for taking care of the environment, because they live there.""\Hentges said a recent $21 million verdict in favor of southeastern Oklahoma poultry growers against Arkansas-based company O.K. Industries is another example of what can happen when industry power is highly concentrated.\Vertically integrated poultry companies own and operate much of the processing chain, except the growing of birds.\The growers claimed that in their area, O.K. Industries is the only buyer, using that power to reduce production at certain times, and engage in other activities that exploit growers.\However, there is a growing trend toward recognizing the value of going green in many areas of society, Hentges said.\""It's obvious that people have caught on to sustainability and green issues, and they're concerned about those things,"" he said.\Credit: Marie Price"
12,"Are natural gas and wind going to be partners or competitors as sources to generate electricity?\This question will be among the topics discussed at Revolution 2009: the Oklahoma Wind Energy Conference scheduled Dec. 2 and 3 at the Cox Business Services Convention Center in Oklahoma City.\""Oklahoma is ideal for wind development,"" said Robert Wegener, Oklahoma secretary of energy. ""Oklahoma's traditional energy industry is the perfect complement to wind.""\Denise Bode, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association and a former member of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, will be the opening speaker.\""We have an abundance of natural gas, which is a great partner for wind generation and development - together they offer a clean, renewable energy solution for the United States,"" said Wegener. ""For the last century Oklahoma has been a leader in the development and delivery of energy - wind is the 21st-century complement to our existing energy industry.""\The opening session for the conference presented by the state secretaries of energy and environment in collaboration with the Oklahoma Department of Commerce will be ""Oklahoma's Balance of Power: Wind, Natural Gas and Demand Side Management."" Panel members for the first session will include Stuart Solomon, president and CEO, Public Service Company of Oklahoma; C. Michael Ming, president, Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America; and Richard Sedano, director, Regulatory Assistance Project.\""We need a balanced energy portfolio,"" Wegener said. ""We can't go all wind. The best backup for wind is natural gas.""\State electricity providers are already using natural gas and wind as part of their generation portfolio. In August, Western Farmers Electric Cooperative added 145 megawatts of natural gas-fueled electricity production in Anadarko. Electricity generated from the units will be used primarily for peak demand. Anadarko-based WFEC provides electric power for 19-member rural electric cooperatives. The 19 members provide electric power to more than two-thirds of rural Oklahoma and parts of Kansas, Arkansas and Texas.\The WFEC has added more than 300 megawatts of new electricity generation capacity in the last year, including 142 megawatts of wind-generated power - 19 megawatts of wind production from the Buffalo Bear Wind Farm near Fort Supply, which went online at the end of 2008, and 123 MW of wind production from the Red Hills Wind Farm in Roger Mills and Custer counties, which went online in June. The WFEC has been receiving wind power from the Blue Canyon Wind Farm, a 74-megawatt facility near Lawton, since 2003.\The WFEC uses a variety of fuel sources with a mix of 38.7-percent natural gas, 42.6-percent coal, 12.8-percent hydro and 5.9-percent wind.\Natural gas and wind are expected to dominate future new electricity generation, WFEC CEO Gary Roulet said in August at the 2009 Oklahoma Emerging Technology Conference in Midwest City.\The WFEC plans to add an additional 125 megawatts of wind power by 2012, he said.\""If we use natural gas and wind only for peak generation they will be competitors,"" Wegener said. ""We need natural gas to be the dominate source.""\Working in partnership wind would offer a hedge for natural gas price volatility, he said.\Revolution 2009 includes sessions designed to inform and educate landowners, developers, manufacturers, utility companies, community planners, economic development groups, sustainable energy advocates and those who work to protect the environment.\""With the new administration's push for renewable-energy development, Oklahoma is poised to become a leader in this new green energy economy,"" said J.D.

13,"OKLAHOMA CITY – In two weeks, all new wind projects will lose access to zero-emissions tax credits, and how that's affecting the industry depends on the company.\No companies have sent representatives to 23rd and Lincoln with pitchforks and torches in tow the way oil and gas companies did during the debate over raising gross production taxes on that industry. The bill that summoned an early sunset for wind's tax breaks passed easily with very little political pushback, and that relative quiet continued after the legislative session.\Gov. Mary Fallin signed House Bill 2298, which accelerated the sunset for new zero-emission tax credits for wind-powered energy. The measure won’t end any company’s breaks, but it ensures no projects that go online after July 1 will qualify.\In the weeks leading up to the cutoff, industry representatives said that the move isn't helping Oklahoma's financial future and won't help maintain Oklahoma's high ranking as a wind-producing state. However they aren't launching television campaigns, suing the state to fight the new rules or taking any other loud measures to lodge their complaints.\Developers expected to qualify for these credits for almost four more years. For some, the early end means leaving Oklahoma, said Jeff Clark, president of the Wind Coalition.\""We have some seen some projects canceled because of the unexpected change … in the tax code,"" he said.\He said he couldn't discuss specifics on the companies that had pulled out, and he noted that the damage is probably to come later. He said HB 2298 was just the most recent policy change that negatively affected the industry, and that the changes are communicating something for the state.\""The message that’s being sent to investors around the world is 'Be very careful,'” he said.\On the other hand, some companies stayed. Representatives said in releases that executives had already given their word to communities, landowners and the state, and they didn't plan to go back on them.\That includes Enel Green Power North America, an Italian company that has invested billions in the state. It already built eight other sites in the area, including one in Rush Springs.\In a prepared statement, representatives said the company understands Oklahoma's tough financial situation and officials' desire to address it. The statement noted the company has already invested $2 billion in the state and has two projects under construction here. They won't be online by July 1, so Enel Green Power will miss out on the tax breaks.\Like Clark, the statement said the damage is to the state's reputation to investors.\""This midyear change to existing policy ultimately downgrades the stable policy and regulatory environment Oklahoma policymakers worked so hard to establish,"" it read.\Oklahoma has about 6,000 megawatts of capacity in operation, and during the first quarter of 2017, sites that will contribute about 900 megawatts more were under construction, according to an American Wind Energy Association report. Most of those projects are in northern Oklahoma.\It's been only a few months since the measure passed, but Clark said it's already having an effect.\""The bottom-line message, the effect has been, in a few cases, you have companies finishing projects,"" he said. ""In other cases, the investment has decided to shift to places that are more welcoming.""\ \CREDIT: Catherine Sweeney"
14,"OKLAHOMA CITY Wind energy usually gets the spotlight when Oklahoma lawmakers consider caps and other limitations on tax credits, but other sources of renewable energy were in the hot seat on Monday.\A committee within the House of Representatives considered Senate Bill 893, which wouldeffectively place a $500,000 annual cap on zero-emissions tax credits for all sources of energy except wind. That would include solar, geothermal and moving water. It is intended to allow lawmakers the kind of oversight they haven't had with wind.\Conservative members often lament that Oklahoma hands out more in tax credits to the wind industry than it ever intended to. A similar claim is in the report the OklahomaIncentive Evaluation Commission released on wind tax credits. State Rep. Earl Sears, R-Bartlesville, said this measure will ensure that same situation doesn't unfold with tax credits for other sources of renewable energy.\""We're trying to make sure this credit doesn't get out of control,"" he said.\The bill requires the secretary of energy and environment to compile reports detailing the amount of credits Oklahoma sees in a year, and if that total surpasses $500,000, that report must go to the Legislature. Then, Sears said, members could re-examine whether that is the kind of investment the state can take on.\State Rep. Shane Stone, D-Oklahoma City, asked whether this essential cap is close to annual usage. Sears said usage is significantly lower than that right now, about $0,000 per year.\Although wind and solar power have comparable potential in Oklahoma, the state consistently ranks in the bottom five nationally for solar development.In 2015, Oklahoma produced about 6,000 megawatts of wind-generated electricity, officialswith the secretary of energy and environment said in an earlier interview. In the same time, the state produced about 5 megawatts generated from solar panels.\Solar energy has been in Oklahoma for decades, but generally on a small scale. Some oil and gas producers use solar panels to power pumps. Residents can use solar power to heat water. The zero-emissions tax credits are a production tax credit, and they apply only to large-scale projects. Residents can‘t use them to put solar panels on their houses, for example.\State Rep. Earl Sears, R-Bartlesville, is the former Houseappropriations and budget chairman. He authored the House version of the bill,and state Sen. Marty Quinn, R-Claremore, was the Senate author.\The measure has already passed out of the Senate, and it passed out of House committee on Monday, 24-2. The two votes against the measure came from Stone and state Rep. Ben Loring, another Democrat.\During the same committee meeting, members heard another renewable energy bill. Senate Bill 888 is another measure that would limit credits available to the wind industry. It has already lost all of its industry-specific credits moving forward, and lawmakers have been pushing for several law changes that would adjust how companies that have already been granted the credit receive them.\SB888would eliminate the refundability on the wind tax credit, which means that the state would no longer be able to refund companies for more than their tax liability. State Sen. Josh Brecheen, R-Coalgate, has pushed to end the refundability of several tax credits, arguing that the state government shouldn't cut a check to corporations while the state is in a budget crisis. He's the Senate author on the bill.\State Rep. Jeff Coody, R-Grandfield, presented the bill for the House committee. He said the state is losing about $70 million annually on the policy in place. He said Tax Commission figures indicate the state paid out $66 million in 2015, $70 million in 2016 and an estimated $75 million in 2017. He said it would take until 2020 to begin seeing any revenue and until 2021 to see significant revenue.\He said the tax credit would still exist, but that bill would prevent Oklahoma from paying corporations that aren't paying any taxes.\""In 2021, it would actually get us about $69 million that we would be able to (use to) adequately fund many things,"" he said.\State Rep. Jason Dunnington, D-Oklahoma City, expressed concern about changing this policy when the state entered contracts with private organizations.\""Wouldn't we be settingourselves up for a potential lawsuit by companies?""\Coody argued that when the law came into effect under Gov. Frank Keating's administration, Oklahoma expected to pay about $2 million annually. The government has adjusted that up several times.\""We could be just as liable for the increases as the decreases,"" he said.\The measure passedout of the committee on Monday by a vote of 14-12.\CREDIT: Catherine Sweeney"
15,"OKLAHOMA CITY After years of legislative changes to their tax incentives and rates, the state's energy industry groups said they're hoping for a quiet year at the Capitol.Over the past few years, the Oklahoma Legislature has ended all tax credits offered specifically to wind generation companies. The industry no longer qualifies for the zero-emissions tax credit, and there has been a push to find ways to end credits that have already been rewarded. As legislators sought new revenue for teacher pay increases and other service investments, Democrats successfully urged a tax increase on oil and gas production.State lawmakers have a little more than a week to wrap up their bill filing. The deadline is Jan. 17. So far, no one has pitched legislation that would affect those industries. Their trade groups said they hope that keeps up.In addition to losing their industry-specific credits moving forward, wind producers have seen their already-rewarded credits on the chopping block. One of the most controversial bills introduced in 2018 would end refundability of those credits, which would prohibit companies from using credits that surpassed the amount they owed the state. That bill stalled and died. A top House Republican, state Rep. Mike Sanders, R-Kingfisher, never filed formal legislation, but he said publicly he supported creating agross production tax on wind companies. Step Up Oklahoma, the group of high-profile private-sector executives that stepped in to assist with the budget impasse, also recommended a wind production tax in their budget proposal.Mark Yates is the Oklahomadirector for the Wind Coalition. He said he hoped the Legislature-induced uncertainty in the market would come to an end.""We’re hoping for a session with some stability, where there aren’t major changes, especially from an investment standpoint,"" he said.He said his organization is hopeful that will be the reality under the new gubernatorial administration and with some leadership changes in the Legislature.There haven't been any mentions of mandates on the industry, but Senate Appropriations Chairman Roger Thompson introduced a bill that would let companies sell their credits back to the state. The idea is that Oklahoma can afford to take a loss right now while the economy is strong and revenues are high, and that it would hedge against existing debt to those companies that might be more difficult to carry in the future.Oil and gas companies also saw some changes to their tax structure. Gross production taxes charge drillers a portion of each barrel's value. The default rate is 7 percent per barrel, but companies pay an incentive rate for the first 36 months. Until 2017, that rate was 1 or 2 percent on all of those wells. In 2017, lawmakers adjusted that rate on some of the oldest wells, and in 2018, lawmakers raised the rate on all wells to 4 percent for the first 36 months.The industry also saw some regulatory updates in that time. Lawmakers passed what was known as the long laterals bill in 2017. It amendedthe 2011 Shale Reservoir Development Act. One provision allowed operators to drill 2-mile horizontal wellbores in any rock layer; the original law limited those longer laterals to shale layers. It made drilling operations more cost-effective for the state's producers. That change sparked some controversy.Companies that employ vertical drilling, an older technology, were concerned that long laterals could tap into the resources they were already developing if the areas overlapped. Mineral rights attorneys also expressed some concern about how the law could make clarifying titles difficult.Chad Warmington is president of OIPA-OKOGA, the newly formed oil and natural gas industry trade association created by the merger of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association and the Oklahoma Oil & Gas Association. He said his members won't be asking for anything controversial this year, and it's unlikely they'll ask for major regulatory changes.He said that if oil prices continue dropping, the industry would likely be asked what should be done to compensate for revenue losses. State finance officials have projected more than $600 million in surplus revenue, but that is based on a model that places oil prices in the $50-to$60 range.""If we get to session and oil drops back down to 40 bucks, we’d have a wide-scale panic in the industry,"" Warmington said. ""It may be all hands on deck.""Barring that situation, the organization is hoping there won't be much talk about the gross production tax at 23rd and Lincoln come February and through the following months.""Peace and quiet was on our Christmas wish list,"" he said.Unlike wind, oil and gas, solar energy has enjoyed that quiet over the past few years. When lawmakers worked to reduce the amount of zero-emissions tax credits the state was dispensing, they exempted the solar industry from any reductions.Although wind and solar power have comparable potential in Oklahoma, the state consistently ranks in the bottom five nationally for solar development.In 2015, Oklahoma produced about 6,000 megawatts of wind-generated electricity, officialswith the secretary of energy and environment said in an earlier interview. In the same time, the state produced about 5 megawatts generated from solar panels.\CREDIT: Catherine Sweeney"
16,"OKLAHOMA CITY One of the most controversial bills of the legislative session finally made it to the House of Representatives on Wednesday, and it just barely passed.\Senate Bill 888 would end the refundability on wind energy producers' zero-emissions tax credits. The measure, which will have to return to the Senate, has been slated for a House floor vote several times. Top-ranking Republicans said they didn't have the support to pass it and would seek other optionsbut ultimately returned to this policy. It passed 51-46, garnering exactly the amount of yes votes required to pass the House.\The measure has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle since it got introduced. Democrats from urban areas pushed against a policy that would harm green energy production. Republicans represent many of the western and central rural areas where wind energy production has become common, and they said that harming that industry would harm schools within their districts. Opponents from both parties said the sudden change would harm the state's investment environment and open the state up to lawsuits with companies whose financing contracts depended on the Legislature keeping its word.\The bill's supporters insisted that this measureshows another example of corporate welfare and that liberal members should be in favor of it for that reason. They said the other measure that SB 888's critics have pushed for, a new production tax on wind energy, would take decades to bring in the kind of money this bill would save over the next few years. The bill's author, state Rep. Jeff Coody, R-Grandfield, said this measure is superior to a new tax for several reasons, but that one of those is that it would give lawmakers money more quickly and that it would do so without raising new taxes.\Several Democratic members argued that oil and gas is a resource with an expiration date, and wind isn't. State Rep. Melodye Blancett, D-Tulsa, pointed to the Google facility in Pryor and said one of the incentives that brought it to the area was access to green energy. Threatening that industry will harm Oklahoma's economic development prospects, she said, not only because of the potential to limit the access that Google sought but also because it could create concern about the state's ability to uphold a stable investment environment.\State Rep. John Pfeiffer, R-Orlando, said the Legislature created these wind tax credits to assist an industry that would help diversify the economy. They have done that, and the reward has been whittling them down until they no longer exist, he said. Those companies pay ad valorem and other local taxes, many of which support schools to the extent they no longer qualify for state aid. Damage to those companies would directlyaffect the communities near which farms have been built.\""We're punishing ourselves and to be honest the people in my district and the schools in my district because these were successful,""Pfeiffer said.\State Rep. Leslie Osborn, R-Mustang, said that when she was the budget and appropriations chairwoman last year, she sought legal advice on this subject, and she learned that the state had entered into legally binding contracts with these companies. She said that advisers told her lawsuits were more than possible; they are inevitable.\""They said(companies) will litigate,"" she said. They've done it in other states. And they will win.""\Several Republicans said they had no idea what kind of legally binding contracts keep coming up, but regardless, the threat of a lawsuit was not serious enough to endanger the measure.\""Anything can be litigated,"" Coody said. ""Anyone can file a lawsuit on anything.""\State Rep. Kevin Calvey, R-Edmond, said the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that theLegislature can end tax credit refundability after the state prevailed in a legal challenge to the bill ending the Earned Income Tax Credit's refundability. He said it was strange that the same people defending the state's investment environment were the ones who supported a $600 million tax increase on existing oil and gas wells.\""Talk about yanking the rug under from an industry,"" he said.\There were also several concerns about the measure's revenue projections. In committee hearings, the bill's supporters said it would likely bring in $70 million for a few years beginning in 2021. Coody said during the floor hearing the measure is expected to bring in $500 million to $750 million over the next years. Democrats pointed out many times that $250 million is a wide range.\State Rep. Cory Williams, D-Stillwater,saidofficials know the exact cutoff date of the credits, have data on the companies using the credits and should be able to calculate with little margin how much money this provision would save the state.\""It's a finite number,"" he said. ""We know exactly how many windmills were operating in the program.""\CREDIT: Catherine Sweeney"
17,"OKLAHOMA CITY Four top legislative officials tackled some of Oklahoma's most pressing issues during a panel discussion on Tuesday, which revealed their ongoing struggle to agree.\The State Chamber of Oklahoma held its annual public affairs forum and hosted two high-ranking officials from each chamber. The moderator asked a handful of questions about topics that have cropped up several times during the regular and special legislative sessions this year, including pitches to kill business incentives and raise taxes on cigarettes. Although some disagreements broke predictably along party lines, others broke by chamber.\They discussed whether the state's tendency to choose ending business incentives overraising taxes was harming the economy, whether state officials should try to lower the vote threshold for new taxes and whether Oklahoma needs to raise taxes on cigarettes. The first highlighted that at times, finding a bicameral agreement can be just as hard as getting one across the aisle.\The lawmakers' views on business incentives differed by chamber. The two people representing the Senate, Republican Majority Floor Leader Greg Treat and Democratic Minority Leader John Sparks, said that Oklahoma's economy depends on consistency and predictability, and changing the rules in the middle of the game is counterproductive. The two people representing the House of Representatives, House Speaker Charles McCall and the chamber's top Democrat, Minority Leader-elect Steve Kouplen, said that although that consistency is beneficial, the Legislature needs to hold the programs accountable and cull the ones that don't work.\The Legislature voted to end a few tax incentives during the regular session this spring, including a sales tax break on cars and a gross production tax incentive on a subset of oil and gas. About 6,000 wells were still within their incentive period, and the incentive rate increased years after production began. Members passed legislation that exempted the wind industry from the zero-emissions tax credit, which was slated to be available to companies for several more years. During the first special session, the strategy continued. The same subset of wells got another tax increase. Lawmakers considered provisions that would prevent coal and wind companies from getting more tax breaks than their burden. The bills' author said during tough times, the state shouldn't be cutting corporations checks.\Treat, the Republican senator, said that although he believes this practice harms the business environment in the state, he believes it will continue because of the heightened vote requirement on tax measures. In 1992, voters approved State Question 640, which made Oklahoma one of two states in the nation requiring a 75-percent majority on tax measures.\""I can tell you 640 makes business incentives more of a target,"" he said. It's because it takes 51 percent to get it done. Tax increases take 75 percent.""\Sparks, the Democratic senator, said that it's easy to demonize business incentives, butlawmakers need to take a big-picture approach when adjusting them, especially when the corporations and business owners are operating on the belief that their taxes will be a certain rate for a specific period of time.\""To go back on our deals ... in the long run, it's detrimental,"" he said.\House members said that the state can't protect incentives that aren't working. Officials created the Incentive Evaluation Commission to review each break's efficacy. For example, it supported preserving the aerospace engineering tax credit, stating that for each dollar it cost, it raised two. It also recommended reducing or ending tax credits for the wind energy industry.\Speaker McCall said that the Legislature should pay attention to these evaluations and act accordingly.\""We always have to have that accountability piece,"" he said. ""If they just flat don't work anymore, let's reallocate those.""\Democrat Kouplen said it's a lot easier to tell crowds and constituents what the Legislature is doing for business than taking credits away, but sometimes the latter is the right thing to do.\They also debated whether the state needs to either get rid of the provisions SQ 640 authorized or at least limit them. Members agreed that something should be done, but there was a disconnect along party lines what collateral damage the policy has caused.\Kouplen argued that because raising taxes has become more difficult, lawmakers have shifted the burden toward fees, which has harmed businesses, he said. On the other side of the aisle, Treat argued that the damage changed when the parties traded places. Now that Republicans are in the majority, they have to work to get Democrats on board, he said. To do so, they often have to introduce taxes that otherwise wouldn't be on the table. For example, during the regular legislative session, House Democrats said they wouldn't support a cigarette tax increase unless Republicans also introduced and approved a tax rate increase on oil and gas wells.\The lawmakers agreed that raising the tax rate on cigarettes to fund health care would be a good idea, but Democrats said the regressive tax would bring in less revenue over time as smoking rates drop and would need to be supplemented.\CREDIT: Catherine Sweeney"
18,"OKLAHOMA CITY A bill that would end a tax break on wind energy producerswill continue its tumultuous journey.Senate Bill 888 has highlighted several fractures within the Oklahoma Legislature for weeks. The measure would end the refundability on the zero-emissions tax credit for wind power companies, meaning the state would no longer be allowed to offer payments to companies whose credits surpass their tax liability. The House of Representatives made changes to the bill, and the Senate voted down those changes, sending the measure to conference committee instead of the governor's desk.Republicans saw a split on the issue. Lawmakers from the rural areas in western and central Oklahoma opposed the measure. School districts near wind energy producers have seen ample growth in local funding because of the projects, and members from those areas said any threat to wind producers would hurt their students and local economies. Republicans in urban areas and in eastern Oklahoma tend to support the measure, which could save the state about $70 million annually beginning in 2021 and ending in 2027.State Sen. A.J. Griffin, R-Guthrie, said Oklahoma is an energy state. The land holds oil and gas reserves, rivers are dammed for electricity production and now the state is afforded wind production. Oklahoma can use wind energy to lure in other industries because of low utility rates. Some corporations want to use only green energy.""As a state competing with the 10th-largest economy in the world, because we're sitting right on top of Texas ... we have to be able to compete,"" she said. ""If we demonize this industry and drive them out of our state, we all lose.""Several of the measure's critics have talked about how this change could affect the state's investment environment because the government is going back on its word. State Sen. Mark Allen, R-Spiro, who is the chamber's energy chairman, said the wind industryhad already gone back on its word. When this credit was adopted, he said, industry representatives had said they would bring massive manufacturing operations with them.""They haven't arrived,"" he said.State Sen. Marty Quinn, R-Claremore, presented the bill in the Senate on Monday. He said Oklahoma has raised more than $250 million in taxes on the oil and gas industry, but it hasn't raised any taxes on wind producers.""As you and I well know, the special interests have continued to fight back those efforts, and they've been successful,"" he said. ""Changes are going to have to be made.""\CREDIT: Catherine Sweeney"
19,"OKLAHOMA CITY Wind energy industry representatives said any adjustment to their tax structure would be a struggle, but newcomers said the dichotomy between some of the policy pitches highlights a break between themselves and those who have been around a while.\Oklahoma lawmakers have been making changes to the wind industry's financial environment for years. Wind-specific tax credits have slowly but totally disappeared. Legislators are looking to the industry for more revenue this year, either amending tax credits again or raising new taxes. The proposals' popularity among producers seems to be based upon when their projects came online.\Senate Bill 888 was expected to be heard on the House floor Thursday morning, but top-ranking Republicans said tension among the party's members prevented that. The measure would have ended the refundability of the zero-emissions tax credit, preventing the state from observing those credits beyond a company's actual liability. The Oklahoma Legislature ended that program for all future users in 2016, so SB 888 would affect only companies whose projects were producing before that.\Top-ranking Republicans said on Thursday that they would instead consider another measure, which would create a gross production tax on windenergy, but would apply only to projects completed after that law went into effect. Industry representatives said the measure being discussed now, $1 per megawatt-hour produced, would be equal to a 5 to 7 percent GPT. That would be levied in addition to the local property and sales taxes the industry already pays.\The Wind Coalition has opposed Senate Bill 888 since its inception, said Oklahoma Director Mark Yates. Clawing back benefits that had already been agreed upon would harm companies with existing farms as well as overall investment in the state. However, a tax increase seems inevitable, and GPT is more palatable.\""Over the past three years, we‘ve worked with the Legislature to early-sunset all of our incentives,"" he said. ""In many ways, we think we shouldn‘t be a part of the (new revenue) conversation.If this is the only alternative we‘re faced with, and we must have a vote on the industry this session, this seems to be by far the best of two options we‘ve been presented with.""\Although there is no bill filed yet, conversations about the policy have included provisions that would make the new tax apply only to new projects. PNE Wind USA Chairman and CEO Ron Flax-Davidson said adopting that measure instead would harm companies like his. That organization is through the planning stage of its project in Kay County, in central Oklahoma near the Kansas border. His staff is now working to secure financing within the next 60 days, and once that is in place, building can begin. However, the shift has created some difficulty with potential investors.\""We‘re hoping to close on it, but they‘re very nervous about what‘s happening with the tax,"" he said.\Revenue on wind generation is at about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, he said, so about $20 per megawatt-hour. For his company, the proposed policy would likely mean a 5-percentage-point increase on tax liability, which is already at about 7 percent in local ad valorem taxes and other state and federal expenses. He reiterated that existing projects would likely not face the same tax burden.\""I‘m not sure we could build if this tax were put on us,"" he said. ""The wind farms that are already in service today would not be harmed.""\CREDIT: Catherine Sweeney"

22,"WASHINGTON -- Carefree American drivers and their sport-utility vehicles are guzzling cheap gas at the pumps, and that's having an extra payoff for the federal government: up to $1.5 billion in unanticipated fuel tax collections.\No matter how low the price of gas goes, drivers still pay their local, state and federal governments an average of 43 cents per gallon in taxes. The federal share is 18.4 cents, and the Clinton administration and the Republican-controlled Congress are already fighting over what to do with this revenue bonanza.\Under the nation's new $203 billion highway bill, gas tax revenues were split 80/20 between highway and mass transit programs. Any unanticipated money was supposed to be restricted to highway construction, traffic reduction and air quality improvements.\But with some $25 billion already in the pipeline for highway construction projects, the new Transportation Department budget outlines a different way to divvy up the $1.456 billion in extra gas tax revenues the administration now expects:\* $730 million for road construction, congestion reduction and air quality improvements.\* $291 million for mass transit.\* $250 million for surface transportation research.\* $125 million for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety programs.\* $35 million for rail programs, including grade-crossing eliminations.\* $25 million for a transportation preservation program.\That would mean roughly 50 percent being spent in ways other than those outlined in the highway bill.\""We are proposing to direct those resources to programs that we think are strategic and are in keeping with the overall needs identified by the administration, where we focus on investments in the environment, safety, technology and the like,"" Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said Monday during a briefing on the department's $45.5 billion budget.\Republicans were quick to complain.\""Instead of each transportation program receiving a proportional increase as was agreed to in the law, the president seeks to steer gas taxes away from flexible state programs to programs run by federal bureaucrats,"" said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation Committee.\It appeared that Congress and the administration had put their highway budget battles behind them -- at least for the next six years -- when President Clinton signed the ""Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century"" in June.\The largest transportation bill in the country's history, it allocated $167 billion to improve, widen and extend the nation's highway system through 2003. It also budgeted $36 billion for improving mass transit systems.\A hallmark of the bill was a provision requiring the government to spend all future gas tax collections on transportation projects. That was a major shift from past policy, where a portion of the receipts was held and used to reduce the size of the overall government budget deficit.\For planning purposes, the drafters of TEA-21 relied on gas tax revenue estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. They are now turning out to be conservative.\In 1998, for example, the CBO estimated collections would total $22.16 billion. In reality, $23.1 billion came in. This year the CBO projected collections of $32.6 billion. The administration expects they will exceed $33 billion.\Transportation officials attribute the added consumption to extra driving and larger gas purchases, especially to fill the tanks in SUVs.\The administration's proposed spending plan would give a double- shot of money to some programs.\For example, the administration would allocate $341 million outright to traffic mitigation and air quality programs. But it also would allocate an additional $388 million for more general programs funded by TEA-21, including some for traffic mitigation and air quality."
23,"SAN FRANCISCO -- That ""please knock"" sign above your doorbell is there because the darn thing hasn't worked in a blue moon, but Pam Coxson and David Fairley disconnected their bell because it was needlessly drawing electricity.\""People can knock, or they can stand outside and say, `Hey, I'm here,'"" Coxson says.\Their light bulbs are compact fluorescents that consume one-third the power of regular incandescent bulbs. They haven't changed one since their son, Eugene, was born three years ago in August.\The mother of all energy efficiencies is that bright star above the Coxson-Fairley home in Noe Valley -- that and the solar photovoltaic system on their roof that converts sunlight directly into electricity.\There's more: Note the Pacific Gas & Electric meter on the side of the house. During the day, when the sun allows Coxson and Fairley to be independent power producers, it runs backward. They are selling clean solar energy, at retail rate, back to the utility -- earning a credit on their electric bill. At night the meter moves forward.\Laws authorizing this give-and-take with electric power grids, called ""net metering,"" are on the books in California and 19 other states, and momentum for solar and other renewable energy sources is gathering on several fronts.\At the Coxson-Fairley home there's a blend of environmental exuberance and fascination with technology. ""We went to a meeting of the Green Party, and they had all these Green Party bumper stickers. We thought, `Bumper stickers?' Get rid of your cars!'"" says Coxson, whose car is long gone.\At the United Nations in June, President Clinton announced an effort to install photovoltaic panels on 1 million rooftops in the United States by 2010.\British Petroleum is building a manufacturing plant for photovoltaic panels in Fairfield, Calif. The company believes it can generate $1 billion in annual sales from solar projects within the next decade. Another six or seven will open in the United States this year, compared with four that began operations last year.\In Sacramento, Joel Swift, like 400 other customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, allowed the utility to install a solar system on his roof and agreed to pay a $4 ""green"" premium each month as part of an effort to accelerate the commercialization of the technology.\""It's the cost of going out to dinner once a year, and we see it as a clean energy source -- an alternative to building nuclear plants,"" Swift says.\Net metering, which the California Legislature authorized in 1995, has begun on a very small scale. The Coxson-Fairley home was the first in San Francisco to install solar energy under the code, and only a few other homeowners have followed.\However, the solar industry believes net metering is one more inducement that will help a domestic market sorely needing to grow. Right now, more than 70 percent of U.S.-manufactured solar cells and modules are exported to Europe, Asia and developing countries.\""We believe this is a strategic technology for the U.S. in that fossil fuel energy resources 30, 40, 50 years from now may be much more lean, much scarcer,"" says Leonard May, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Solarex Corp., of Frederick, Md., the largest American-owned solar equipment manufacturer and a joint venture of Amoco Oil and Enron.\In most systems, solar-generated current flows into batteries that store electricity for rainy days, but the contractor for the Noe Valley job, Occidental Power of San Francisco, recommended the owners channel their excess power through a two-way meter to PG&E. The simplicity, reduced cost and maintenance of a system without batteries is better suited to an urban environment, says engineer Colleen O'Brien of Occidental.\Coxson and Fairley didn't stop there. They replaced an inefficient refrigerator with one that uses half as much power as the old one. They measured ""phantom loads"" drawn by many household appliances even when turned off (television, 2.9 kilowatt hours a month wasted energy; power strip with surge protector, 0.36 kilowatt hour a month, for example) and unplugged them. Even the doorbell went.\In the name of conservation, the family is close to receiving all their power from their nine 53-watt solar panels. Since installing the solar system at the 92-year-old, three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot home in March, the family's monthly electric bill has dropped from $24 to $7.\""It used to be that conservation meant experiencing a little hardship,"" Coxson says. ""But now there are so many ways that don't involve hardship at all. And the light bulbs, the panels, the refrigerator -- they will pay for themselves."""
24,"OKLAHOMA CITY – Energy business owners, industry observers and environmentalists said they're optimistic an interim study will help advance an underused resource in the state.\The legislative request to examine the economic benefit of solar power was approved July 7. State Reps. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City; Claudia Griffith, D-Norman; Ben Loring, D-Bartlesville; and Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, proposed analyzing potential job growth from solar power and what's preventing its development. The request also proposes examining how solar power is connected to the grid and studying existing state rules for consumers who resell surplus electricity to a utility, known as net metering.\Steve Wilke, business development manager of solar photovoltaic panel installation company Delta Energy + Design, said the study is an important first step to presenting to the Legislature and to regulators a clear picture of the solar market's potential. That will help both bodies make more informed decisions. The interim study presents both an opportunity and a challenge.\""The question is whether or not it will go anywhere, and who decides what is important,"" Wilke said.\He said his biggest concern is that utility companies dominate the conversation on proposed changes to the solar photovoltaic market.\Oklahoma Gas and Electric Co. spokesman Brian Alford said the interim study didn't have much detail yet, but he said the company's employees are always interested in having an opportunity to share what they've learned about the company's solar pilot project. OG&E installed 2.5 megawatts of solar photovoltaic panels near the Mustang power plant in 2015.\""With each passing day, we're learning more about solar,"" Alford said. ""We're looking forward to announcing a new project very soon.""\Sierra Club Oklahoma Director Johnson Bridgwater said net metering rules favor utilities and create disincentives for consumers interested in adding rooftop solar. Other rules that prevent more solar adoption is a ban on third parties leasing space for panels.\In San Antonio, third-party solar rooftop leasing allowed the industry to expand. There is as much solar-generated electricity in poor neighborhoods as in rich neighborhoods, Bridgwater said. Homeowners can either get paid for leasing their roof or get discounted electricity bills.\Oklahoma ranks 47th in the nation for solar power, according to trade group Solar Energy Industries Association. But the state has enough sun to be sixth in the nation, Bridgwater said.\Jim Roth, clean energy practice group director at Phillips Murrah, said Oklahoma has enough solar radiation to export electricity to other states in the region. Projections for the Panhandle and western Oklahoma show the state is as lucrative as the southwestern U.S. The Sooner State gets the best sun in the early afternoon, so with battery storage, that could help support peak summer electricity demand.\The interim study is important, despite an unfortunate negative year for renewable energy at the Capitol, Roth said. He previously represented the solar industry at Oklahoma Corporation Commission proceedings.\The state's solar potential could be a boon to both the private and public sectors, if some rules were changed.\""I'd like to see Oklahoma schools become solar arrays, so they're earning money to export to the grid,"" he said. ""Other public sector spaces like cities and hospitals could bring energy to the market.""\Roth said he's optimistic that the interim study and the work Energy and Environment Secretary Michael Teague is doing to understand so-called distributed generation will help move the industry forward.\""The collaborative conversations will lead Oklahoma to figure out what the potential is,"" Roth said. ""This is all positive momentum.""\House Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka, authorized the study, but before it can advance, he must schedule it.\CREDIT: Sarah Terry-Cobo"
25,"OKLAHOMA CITY – Solar energy companies in the state are seeing a decrease in demand but an opportunity for investors.\Delta Energy and Design business developer Steve Wilke said that the costs for investors to take interest in the solar industry are at an all-time low.\""Module prices are record low,"" Wilke said. ""Lower than I ever expected them to be.""\Developments at Tesla show the solar industry is offering consumers longer-term solutions such as solar roofs or shingles, instead of traditional mounted solar panels.\""I'm interested in solar shingles and cautiously optimistic,"" Wilke said.\Wilke said the numbers that have been released by Tesla so far still demonstrate that a traditional composite roof and regular solar panels are significantly less expensive. He also said that he doesn't believe that the cost differences will change drastically between the options any time soon.\Delta Energy saw a decline in solar market growth in Oklahoma when Senate Bill 1456 was put in place in 2014. The bill placed a unique tariff on those wanting to use solar technology in their homes or businesses.\""They chilled the market dramatically with the passage of that legislation,"" Wilke said. ""And the market has yet to recover.""\Delta Energy has improved sales by building parking structures made of solar panels and also shade pergolas.\""For Oklahomans, if there is one thing we need more than solar power, it's shade,"" Wilke said.\He said solar power customers in the state are a mix of residential and small commercial businesses. Wilke said solar panels on industrial spaces are not as popular because the rates are so low to use other sources of energy. That is why it makes more sense for large energy consumers to use an energy grid than solar, Wilke said.\He said that the challenges solar faces are primarily regulatory. Wilke said that allowing third-party ownership or leasing of solar energy and repealing SB 1456 would change the market.\""Third-party ownership is the financial vehicle that has driven markets across the United States and it is against the law here,"" Wilke said.\Kylah McNabb, energy policy adviser for the Oklahoma secretary of energy and environment, said that solar energy in Oklahoma has to make sense from a cost standpoint. She said that since Oklahoma has one of the lowest costs of electricity in the nation, consumers are more likely to stay with it.\""Folks want the cheapest power possible and we already have that within the state,"" McNabb said. ""The cost of solar right now is getting better and is working in some instances, but it's still not the cheapest source of energy.""\Travis Roach, assistant professor and renewable energy economist at the University of Central Oklahoma, said that although there has been growth in the solar industry because manufacturing has become cheaper and easier, it doesn't necessarily mean that solar is more efficient.\""You can only eke out so much energy from each single panel,"" Roach said.\The traditional solar panels are being updated for durability, adding thinner photovoltaic cells and tracking the sun instead of staying in one position, Roach said. As for the new developments from Tesla, Roach said that more people might be willing to install the roof because it could be less of a burden than installing panels.\Net metering is another issue in the state, Roach said; consumers receive no incentives for producing more energy than they are consuming. He also said renewable sources in this state have a negative connotation, which could contribute to the lack of people using them. As for SB 1456, Roach said that he doesn't see any benefit to having a unique tariff.\""I think politics won out over good policy,"" Roach said.\Jim Roth, an attorney who leads the clean energy practice group at Phillips Murrah, said the problems with clean energy around the state are not just singular to solar.\""Oklahoma's legal scheme is to favor monopoly electric providers,"" Roth said.\He said Oklahomans can add panels today but they have to own the system, which can be pricey. He said SB 1456 was a supposed solution to a problem that doesn't exist.\""We need to be focusing, in my opinion, on unlocking this energy potential that every Oklahoman has access to,"" Roth said.\CREDIT: Kateleigh Mills"
26,"OKLAHOMA CITY Oklahoma has the sixth-highest potential among all 50 states for developing solar power. Yet, Oklahoma was among the nation's worst in adding new solar capacity in 2018, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association's latest market report.According to the report, the state was No. 43 in the installation of new solar photovoltaic capacity last year, a sharp drop from No. 31 in 2017.Dan Whitten, SEIA's vice president of public affairs, attributed some of Oklahoma’s lag in solar power to “the evolution of the energy sector."" He said solar investment tends to follow investment in wind, as the state has made in recent years.“It’s a matter of evolution. It’s going to happen in Oklahoma,” Whitten said. “When solar was more expensive 10 years ago, it made a lot of sense not to do solar, so Oklahoma didn’t do it. But now the cost argument is just too good.”Surrounding states varied in their rankings, with Texas moving to No. 2 in 2018 from No. 4 in 2017. Arkansas jumped to No. 18 from No. 43, while Missouri jumped to No. 32 from No. 39 and New Mexico went to No. 21 from No. 26.California maintained its No. 1 ranking, which it held in 2017 and 2016.Solar Power Rocks, a research and advocacy group, awarded Oklahoma an “F” for its solar energy policy. The organization, however, credited the state for “remarkable progress” in wind power.Whitten said states like California began investing in solar power about 10 years ago, before it became as profitable as it is now. Other states are catching up, he said.Whitten said Oklahoma’s higher ranking in 2017 could be due to one big project.“(Large jumps are) reflective of states that have not yet adopted solar at a very high rate,"" Whitten said. ""(Oklahoma is) a state with incredible potential, but in states like Oklahoma one big project can make the difference between a good year and a bad year.”The market report projected continued growth in residential solar projects and a rebound of utility-scale solar projects, which will lead to national growth in solar projects in 2019 and 2020.According the state Department of Commerce, solarpowercan provide up to 44.1 percent of electricity in Oklahoma from 19,300 solar panels.In 2010, the state Legislature enacted House Bill 3028, the Oklahoma Energy Security Act, calling for 15 percent of total installed generation capacity in Oklahoma to be derived from renewable sources by 2015. The policy received criticism from solar energy advocate groups like Solar Power Rocks for being voluntary, not containing a solar carve-out or specific target for solar energy, and the lack of a stricter net metering policy.Whitten said while some policies are better for boosting solar power, the recognition of the value of solar power is just as important for states.“There certainly are policies that have led to greater adoption,"" he said. ""There’s also more of a commitment to clean energy than there was before. Now people are seeing they can invest in clean energy at a lower cost. It just makes too much sense.”In 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission reported the 2015 capacity for electricity generated by renewable energy to be 25.9 percent, a 5.05 percent increase from the previous year.Kenneth Wagner, Oklahoma secretary of energy and environment, said while the state has not come close to reaching its solar power potential, it is important to consider the strides it has made in other areas that “far outpace the majority of other states in the country.”“We’re among the leaders in emissions reductions,"" Wagner said. ""It’s just we’ve accomplished ours through the introduction and conversion of natural gas and the introduction of wind.""Wagner said Gov. Kevin Stitt’s administration is working to remove barriers preventing solar energy from reaching its potential in the state.“I think solar needs to be an important and vital part of our diversification of fuel sources,"" Wagnersaid. ""We want Oklahomans, whether they’re individuals or businesspeople, to be able to make informed decisions about which fuel source is right for them.”Despite Oklahoma's low ranking, Whitten said SEIA is excited about the state's solar prospects.“It is an energy state,"" Whitten said. ""We think solar is going to stack up well over the next few years.” \CREDIT: Daisy Grant"

29,"Mike Bergey finally has the wind to his back.\As proof, the owner of Bergey Windpower of Norman said last week his company is experiencing its best business environment ever.\""I thought this day would come,"" he said. ""I just thought it would come a heck of a lot quicker than it turned out to be. I guess we are kind of a 30-year-old overnight success.""\While he acknowledges the company had to be ""tornado tough"" to simply survive this long, Bergey attributes the recent surge in business to a $30,000 federal tax credit that goes to purchasers of small wind systems.\In recent years, there have been subsidies for large wind power efforts, which has helped create a $12 billion industry, but small wind systems have been kept in low gear by a lack of federal support.\""Now we have a tax credit for the next six years, and we think that will allow us to finally get up to mass production and start lowering the prices,"" Bergey said.\If the weather starts straightening out around the country, Bergey forecasts that the company could install almost 1,000 turbines this year.\Although there's no better place to erect a wind turbine, very few of those sales will be in Oklahoma.\Bergey Windpower exports its products to 100 countries, but most of his customers are on the East and West coasts, where electricity rates are higher and states offer additional subsidies to purchasers.\""The numbers don't favor small wind in Oklahoma,"" Bergey said. ""We are happy to take all the orders we can get, but we don't push it very strongly.""\In Southern California, residential users pay up to 40 cents a kilowatt-hour, four times what most Oklahomans pay, and the state provides $20,000 cash rebates for the purchase of one of Bergey's home-sized units.\""The payback period can be three or four years, compared to 12 to 15 years in Oklahoma,"" Bergey said.\Nationally, wind power is making headway against conventional energy sources such as coal and oil.\""The cost of conventional energy has increased and the cost of renewable energy has come down, so there's not the big gulf that changes the competitiveness if the Saudis open the spickets,"" Bergey said. ""Wind is becoming competitive with other generation alternatives and a utility CEO isn't doing their job well today unless they have wind power somewhere in their portfolio.""\That wasn't the case 20 or 30 years ago, when Bergey and his father, Karl, became early disciples of wind power.\If someone proposed wind power then, Bergey said, ""they would have been considered part of the lunatic fringe.""\The best example of the difference between then and now, Bergey said, has been the reception at the state Capitol.\""We got a civics lesson at the Capitol in 2001 when we tried to pass an RPS (renewable energy portfolio standard) and were soundly defeated at the last minute,"" Bergey said. ""\Since then, all the major utilities have substantially increased their investments in wind power without having any mandates imposed on them.\The abundance of natural gas in Oklahoma has to be credited for much of wind power's growth.\""You have to have a backup power source for wind, and natural gas is the best energy source to provide that backup,"" Bergey said.\Bergey said his systems in remote locations have been using three-quarters wind and one-quarter natural gas for three decades.\On the grand scale, Bergey said similar methods could be put in place that would allow Oklahoma to generate more than 50 percent of its electricity from wind, using natural gas and hydro power to supplement it.\""I certainly appreciate the efforts of natural gas, and I am a supporter of compressed natural gas vehicles,"" he said.\The real value of wind power, according to Bergey, lies in its ability to produce electricity inexpensively over a long period of time.\""We are trying to produce electricity inexpensively rather than reduce the carbon footprint,"" Bergey said.\He credits the University of Oklahoma's early support of the concept and his Norman work force for the company's ability to outlast all other small wind power companies in the U.S.\""We've had a lot of offers of money financing and favorable tax treatment from other states, but we are deeply rooted here,"" Bergey said.\Credit: Tom Lindley"
30,"Over the past two decades, U.S. companies have been slashing costs to survive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. By stripping away layers of management, employing more part-time workers and replacing laborers with new equipment, corporations have tried to increase efficiency.\Those changes have paid off. Since the start of this decade, the stock market's value has tripled and corporate profits have roughly doubled.\But now that businesses have mastered the art of belt-tightening to boost earnings, a new challenge is emerging: Do American businesses know how to manage in these good times?\In recent years, companies have treated workers as if a recession were still raging. Since 1989, the economy has grown 18 percent, but wages and benefits have grown only 2.8 percent after adjusting for inflation, according to the U.S. Labor Department.\The disparity between gains for investors and wages for workers is starting to rankle. The bitter strike by Teamsters at United Parcel Service is essentially a test of whether companies can continue to clamp down on wages, benefits and work hours while the economy is booming and the unemployment rate is 4.8 percent.\At UPS, the 90-year-old shipping giant, management has long been known for running an efficient and profitable company. Before the 1990s, the work force shared generously in the company's wealth, with good wages, benefits and a pension plan.\But starting in the late 1980s, the big, happy family way of doing business was put to a severe test. Fierce new competitors, such as Federal Express and RPS, began muscling into the delivery business. As the demand for faster, cheaper service grew more intense, UPS responded with great skill. Managers ordered drivers to deliver more packages, at greater weights and in less time with the help of new tracking equipment. At the same time, they made a dramatic shift to hiring part-time workers. In the past four years, more than 80 percent of the union jobs created at UPS have gone to part-timers.\While many of these part-time workers are being thwarted from moving into full-time positions, the company's owners have been enjoying record-breaking income. The disparity between profits for owners and austerity for part-timers has sparked an ugly strike.\Managers understandably have no desire to abandon the labor practices that helped UPS flourish in the harsh environment of the early 1990s. But workers understandably want a greater share of the prosperity of the late 1990s.\By sticking to the practices that worked so well six years ago, managers have brought the company to a standstill today, with workers shouting from picket lines and customers switching to other delivery services. UPS, so savvy in hard times, is getting jammed up in good times.\Big Brown and other prosperous companies now have to decide: How much longer can the belt stay tight around workers while shareholders grow fat? If too much is given out in wage hikes, companies could end up in trouble when the next recession hits. But if they resist workers' demands for bigger shares of the profits, companies could find themselves being destabilized by strikes and other labor problems.\Managing well in good times may turn out to be even tougher than surviving in hard times.\Marilyn Geewax is an editorial writer for the Atlanta Journal- Constitution."
31,"Natural gas never drifted far from the discussion Thursday as the Oklahoma Clean Energy Independence Commission delved into whether Oklahoma should join most states in adopting renewable-energy standards or goals.\The tone was set early in the meeting by Tom Price of Chesapeake Energy Corp., whose 15-page handout titled ""Using Oklahoma's Comparative Advantage to Strengthen Our State Economy"" laid out a strong, almost patriotic case for making natural gas the cornerstone of the state's energy future.\""No other states are as well-positioned to take advantage of natural gas as Oklahoma,"" Price said, a reference to its existing infrastructure and newly discovered shale gas plays.\If only it were that simple.\The more complex question, as Oklahoma Secretary of Energy Robert Wegener described it, is whether there is a way to devise a policy that promotes both natural gas and renewable fuels and has a positive economic aspect for business and consumers.\""I don't think that there is anything more important than understanding what the long-term capacity of natural gas,"" Wegener said.\That led to more questions, starting with whether it's in the state's best interest to adopt a renewable portfolio standard and a separate set of goals that promotes the use of natural gas, similar to what has occurred in Texas.\Thirty-five states now either have standards or goals in place pertaining to renewable energy generation. The push for an RPS or a set of stated energy goals in Oklahoma has been tied to economic development opportunities in both wind and natural gas, to tougher ozone regulations that could impact Oklahoma negatively and to the climate change drumbeat that is in getting louder in Washington, D.C.\""In a state that has both natural gas and wind, a policy of natural gas or cleaner is the right one for the majority of Oklahomans,"" said Price, Chesapeake's senior vice president of corporate development, when asked whether Oklahoma should formalize its renewable-energy policy.\Price said Oklahoma also could consider authorizing the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to promulgate an ""Oklahoma-first fuel"" dispatch order that would increase the reliance on clean, indigenous energy sources, such as natural gas.\Representatives of Oklahoma Gas and Electric and Public Service of Oklahoma, meanwhile, indicated they wouldn't favor combining natural gas with renewables in any RPS stardard because the process would be too complicated and that they supported energy-efficiency measures. They also said that if the state does pursue an RPS, they would prefer that the standards or goals be based on a kilowatt formula.\State Sen. David Myers, R-Ponca City, also made it clear that he prefers setting goals instead of establishing mandates, whether it comes to renewable fuels such as wind or solar power, or clean fuels, such as natural gas.\Myers said it would be important for the state to establish a definition that establishes natural gas as a clean fuel because ""some people think natural gas is an ugly fuel"" because it produces some levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide.\Price also was on the offensive, claiming that coal lobbyists have been intellectually misleading in their portrayal of natural gas as the ""crack cocaine of fuels.""\Myers said he hopes the commission will help fill in the specifics of RPS legislation he has introduced and that could be taken up at the upcoming legislative session.\At the same time, Meyers said most Oklahomans agree that it's important to protect the environment.\""Politicians are guided about what people think,"" Meyers said.\Price said any bill before the Legislature should take into account the broad-based economic and environmental impact on Oklahoma.\""It's painful for me to look at the state budget deficit we've got and hear people talk about alternatives that don't have anything to do with our underlying issue, which is how do we takes steps legislatively to improve overall quality of life in Oklahoma?"" he said.\The 12-member commission, which was formed last year by the Legislature to promote clean energy and help the nation become energy independent within five years, will discuss transmission issues at its February meeting.\Credit: Tom Lindley"
32,"The embattled lesser prairie chicken picked up a few more friends in high places this week as state and Oklahoma Gas and Electric Corp. officials reached an agreement in principle on a $4.9 million habitat protection package.\The money will come in the form of a fuel-rate adjustment to customers of power that will be generated by the 13,000-acre CPV Keenan II Wind Farm in Woodward County, a 151-megawatt project that is expected to be on line this fall.\The announcement was made at a hearing at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which is overseeing OG&E's attempts to increase its wind portfolio.\Much of the day's discussion focused on if what's good for the prairie chicken is automatically bad for business and consumers and how the state should meet the challenge of converting to more renewable energy.\While none of the larger issues were resolved, the prairie chicken, which numbers no more than 3,000 in a state where 90 percent of the species has been eradicated - won somewhat of a reprieve.\""This is a very prudent expenditure that will demonstrate to the federal government that we are doing everything we can to develop wind in concert with prairie chicken preservation,"" Oklahoma Secretary of Environment J.D. Strong said.\The prairie chicken's plight has been complicated by the fact that most reside where the wind blows the hardest on the shortgrass, open prairie, which also happens to be the best spot to erect wind towers, one of the bird's nemeses.\It's also put a strain on conservationists, who want to see more green energy but not at the expense of putting more species on the endangered list.\Richard Hatcher, director of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, said he believes the latest habitat agreement with OG&E is an important step ""because we will be able to look at some of the best quality remaining habitat and either try to purchase it outright from willing sellers or put on a conservation easement that would require protection of the habitat or implement contracts with landowners to make habitat improvements on their property.""\Hatcher said a similar $3.75 million agreement with OG&E negotiated for OU Spirit Wind Farm already has been parlayed into almost $9 million in federal funds.\Still, Hatcher admitted that it's too early in the process to predict the future of the prairie chicken.\While he applauded OG&E for its willingness to be part of the solution, Hatcher said that under a formula being developed by Oklahoma and other Midwest states that are home to the prairie chicken, it could take as much as $30 million to offset the impact that the Keenan Farm could have on the habitat.\The cost of saving the prairie chicken and future economic development opportunities also were on the minds of the state' three corporation commissioners, who approved the prairie chicken agreement and OG&E's recovery of cost of its wind power purchase at Tuesday's hearing.\Commissioner Bob Anthony expressed concern about setting a precedent in granting OG&E a fuel-rate adjustment and quizzed Strong about the need for Oklahoma to adopt a Renewable Portfolio Standard for energy sources.\Pat Shore, an attorney with OG&E, said the company's decision to purchase 151 megawatts from Kennan and another 130 megawatts from the Edison Mission Energy Farm near Taloga in Dewey County will double the utility's wind capacity.\""It is a significant investment for us in terms of meeting customers' needs and expanding our renewable energy resources,"" he said.\Shore said OG&E's research shows that the Keenan Farm will produce about $25 million in savings versus fossil fuels in its first 10 years of operation.\Strong said some renewable-energy manufacturing companies are using the adoption of an RPS as a litmus test for whether they will locate there, similar to the way manufacturers gravitated to right-to-work states.\""The proactive approach we have taken without an RPS has gotten us as far down the road as many states who have an RPS have gone, but it's worth having a great debate about whether we are missing out on renewable-energy manufacturing as a result of our state not having an RPS,"" Strong said.\Credit: Tom Lindley"
33," Some officials with existing fossil-fuel utility companies took exception Monday to proposals that they bear part of the cost of expanding use of renewable power resources and generate a portion of their energy sales through renewable energy.\ As explained by Mike Bergey of Bergey WindPower, Norman, the Oklahoma Renewable Energy Foundation has drafted a legislative proposal calling for a ""system benefit charge"" of $0.0002 to be added to all retail kilowatt-hour retail sales over a five-year period.\ Bergey said that this would cost about $2.70 per capita annually, or about $9 million each year. He envisions funding being set aside for renewable energy initiatives, education, a small wind turbine manufacturing initiative, an emerging technology rebate program and administrative costs.\ System benefit charge programs are in use in about 14 states, some implemented as part of industry restructuring efforts. Oklahoma legislators are currently reviewing the restructuring process. A final report on their study is due by year's end.\ Proponents of the system benefit charge concept said that over time it would actually benefit the utilities, saving them money when fossil-fuel costs rise in the future.\ Jim Wilson, with OG&E, said that a system benefit charge program would impact some customers more than others. Other industry representatives expressed concern, however, that funding the program in this manner could increase their industrial customers' costs disproportionately.\ ""If it's a good policy for the state of Oklahoma, maybe the state should pay for it,"" said Floyd Dill, representing AEP/PSO. ""We're not for anything that causes an increase in customers' electric bills.""\ Dill also said that most system benefit charge programs are established in states where energy costs are high.\ Bergey said he is not certain whether other states charge large industrial customers a lower system benefit charge.\ Boyd Lee, with Western Farmers Electric Cooperative, asked whether there might be constitutional issues involved in requiring all utilities to levy a system benefit charge that would benefit only part of the energy industry.\ Bergey said he does not believe there are constitutional implications with such programs, which have operated for several years in other states without litigation.\ ""But it's a very good political question,"" Bergey said.\ Wendell Kropp, with OG&E Energy, said that a more equitable approach might be to offer direct tax benefits for generation of renewable energy, rather than adopting a system benefit charge program.\ The foundation is also recommending that Oklahoma adopt a renewable portfolio standard program.\ Under this mandate, 8 percent of retail energy sales would be required to come from renewable energy sources by 2010, phased in by equal annual steps. All utilities with retail sales would be required to participate, new facilities only. Those using hydroelectric power and landfill gas would be excluded.\ The proposal calls for costs and benefits of this part of the program to be passed through to ratepayers. However, there was discussion at Monday's meeting as to whether this requirement would require action by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission regarding reasonableness of such charges.\ Wilson said that some type of pass-through mechanism should be established. He also pointed out that the existing utility firms would still need to maintain other energy sources to back up the portion of their sales that would be generated through wind or some other renewable source.\ Bergey, appearing at a forum on renewable energy chaired by Rep. James E. Covey, D-Custer City, said that Oklahoma has several renewable energy resources to draw from, including wind, biomass, solar, hydroelectric and geothermal. Bergey's firm manufactures small wind turbines.\ Worldwide, Bergey said, wind power is really taking off.\ ""We've been outpaced by Europe and other places,"" he said.\ With larger turbines and improved technology, Bergey said, the cost of wind energy has dropped from about 40 cents per kilowatt hour in 1969 to between 4 and 6 cents last year.\ He said that Oklahoma ranks eighth among the states in by windfarm energy potential.\ Bergey said each 100 megawatts of wind energy brings in by around $1 million in by local property tax revenue annually, generating one or two new jobs during construction and two to five permanent jobs per every 50 to 100 MW. However, he said that each MW per year of small wind turbine production creates 50 full-time skilled manufacturing jobs.\ ""Small wind turbines are excellent generators of jobs,"" Bergey said."
