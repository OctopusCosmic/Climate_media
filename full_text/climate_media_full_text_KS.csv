Lt. Gov. Mark Parkinson is counting on scientists at Kansas University and elsewhere to solve the world's global-warming problems.
\
That's because government leaders, he figures, simply don't have the knowledge, expertise or political will to get the job done.
\
""Everything that we have been doing to cure the climate change problem has been wrong, because what we have been doing is depending upon politicians -- like me -- when, in fact, the only real answer is in science,"" Parkinson told about 150 students, faculty and others gathered Tuesday afternoon to hear him discuss ""National Policy and Climate Change"" at Spooner Hall on campus. ""Politicians cannot solve this problem, but scientists can.""
\
Scientists need to continue their drive to create more efficient energy grids, searching for more efficient renewable energy sources and -- yes -- coming up with a new kind of zero-emission energy, one that doesn't emit carbon or otherwise threaten the environment, he said.
\
But until then, he said, political leaders need to continue their push for encouraging conservation, spurring innovation and avoiding additions to the problem that shows few signs of abating in the decades ahead.
\
After his speech and a question-and-answer session, Parkinson deflected questions about his potential for becoming Kansas governor, should Gov. Kathleen Sebelius win Senate confirmation as President Barack Obama's secretary of health and human services.
\
Sebelius has vowed to veto legislation that would permit construction of two coal-fired power plants in Holcomb, and Parkinson, on Tuesday, didn't sound like the kind of guy who would veer from that stance should he move into the governor's office.
\
""I don't see a dramatic policy shift,"" he said, while declining to discuss the specific legislation.
\
Parkinson said that he would prefer to see tax revenues generated by any ""cap-and-trade"" program be pumped into research-and-development efforts to create clean energy.

1,"Trail safety\I am a resident of the Lake Shawnee area and frequent the trail that circles the lake. I am concerned that the bicyclists are using the trail to do speed work.\They whiz by walkers and runners at blinding speed, sometimes without so much as a word. There are some cyclists who warn they are coming around on the left as they pass, but lots of them are traveling too fast to avoid hitting you if you step the wrong way.\I propose the county post speed limit signs as they do in other areas of the county and let the people who want to go faster use the highways. We have already lost one person's life to a crash on this trail, does it need to happen again before we act?\NANCY TOELKES,Topeka\Stupid upon stupid\It is not clear what our president thinks the rest of us should learn from his teaching moment. Apparently, he wants us to understand that different rules apply to him.\By his rules, it is acceptable to judge others and publicly criticize and insult them without having been there or knowing the facts. When he realized his mistake and owed someone an apology, his rules allowed him to divert attention from his errors by doing something even dumber.\Rules for the rest of us require that a person of reasonable intelligence be humble enough to issue an apology when due. Us common folks were taught early in life that drinking alcohol is never the route to settling differences. We are aware, although our president apparently isn't, of the efforts of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Alcoholics Anonymous to educate us about a substance that many of us cannot handle and that has led to disastrous consequences.\Many of us, for medical or religious reasons, do not drink alcohol, and an invitation to come over for a beer is seriously inappropriate. If our president is aware of any of this, he respects none of it. Under these circumstances, for him to preach that we should learn from the teaching moment is beyond arrogance.\If he thinks drinking alcohol together is the route to settling differences, he can bring our troops home and solve everything by drinking beer with the heads of state from enemy nations. Or maybe he will simply talk them to death. The trillions saved could be used to pay for health care.\It seems that he has a little learning to do, beginning with why his approval rating has dropped.\HELEN ROSER,Manhattan\Disturbing behavior\There may be some good reasons to oppose President Barack Obama's initiatives on health care, the economy or the environment, but you wouldn't know it from the methods taken by the militant right. Instead of engaging in meaningful discussion of the issues, they have taken to the airwaves with tactics of disruption. There seems to be no attempt to argue the case intelligently.\The tactics include focusing on questions about Obama's birth certificate (already firmly documented), even going to the extent of presenting amateurishly forged ""foreign"" birth certificates as fact.\They present lies about health care initiatives, such as claiming the government plans to euthanize the elderly. They shout down opponents on their news shows to keep the opponents' arguments from being heard. And now -- stimulated by former congressman Dick Armey, funded by the insurance lobby and egged on by the likes of John Boehner -- they are busing their minions to various town hall meetings.\This last is probably the most disturbing. In a democracy, everyone is supposed to have a chance to be heard. A town hall meeting is the essence of democracy. Yet, if someone says something counter to what the right-wing fringe wants to hear, these hooligans shout him or her down. They even shout down citizens who ask hard questions counter to their prejudices.\As a student of history, I see some parallels to this kind of obstructionism, the most notable and most recent example of which occurred during the rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.\The party of ""no"" has nothing to add to the discussion, so it tries to stifle any progress at all. As Tom Lehrer once said, ""If you have nothing to say, the very least you can do is shut up.""\DOUGLAS B. MCGAW,Emporia\Obama and energy\Some people don't buy Rep. Lynn Jenkins' assertion that MIT estimates we could see up to a $3,000 increase in our annual utility bills because of the cap and trade legislation. But President Barack Obama himself stated that electric rates would necessarily skyrocket because of this bill.\Our rates have already increased, and Westar again asks for another rate hike to start paying for green energy initiatives.\We will pay for the transmission lines, wind towers and the solar energy plants that destroy 10 square miles of desert ecosystem and use 60 billion gallons of water a year. The consumer will be tapped for these boondoggles when we should be searching for better ways to clean coal-powered plant emissions and new technology for nuclear energy. These are power sources we can use with our current transmission systems.\I am more concerned, however, with the health care bills before Congress. Of the 47 million people the Democrats want to insure with taxpayers' money, 10 million are illegal immigrants. Democrats unanimously voted down a Republican amendment that would prohibit the use of government funds to insure illegal immigrants.\Because Obama has a Democratic majority, he will be able to give blanket amnesty to illegal immigrants. The combination of lax enforcement of immigration laws and free health insurance will result in a massive influx of illegal immigrants. This will tip the balance of power decisively to the Democrats, and they will be in power for life.\CHARLOTTE BOGER,Manhattan"
2,"The Hutchinson News, June 18:\We need U.S. Rep. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and other farm-state members of Congress watching out for the interests of farmers in proposed climate change legislation.\But everyone needs to expect that so-called cap-and-trade environmental legislation will come with an expense, not just for farmers or any other single group but for society at-large.\That isn't a tax, as some have characterized it. It represents the cost of environmental damage. The goal isn't to raise government revenue but to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.\Moran and other lawmakers questioned Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack earlier this month during a House Agriculture Committee hearing on the proposed bill.\Moran said he is concerned about a significant increase in prices of gasoline, electricity, fertilizer, natural gas and propane -- all important inputs for farming operations.\Likely, cap and trade would lead to higher prices for those commodities. And American consumers should expect those costs to be passed along and lead to higher prices in the grocery store. Again, damaging the environment is a societal cost for which we all will -- as we should -- pay. ...\We are glad Moran and others are pointing out the specific omission of agriculture in the bill. ...\But we disagree when Moran characterizes cap and trade as a ""huge tax increase"" on American farmers.\Carbon emitters will have higher costs of doing business, but that is a tax only in so much as tobacco companies have been taxed to pay for the health effects of their product. Regulation is effectively accomplished through allocation of the expense of the outcome to the producer.\And although it starts with the producer, the bill ultimately will go to the users, having been passed through middlemen like farmers."
3,"By Tim Carpenter\THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrators appear willing to step into the middle of Kansas utility permitting issues if the governor allows an amendment designed to undermine state pollution regulators becomes law, officials said Monday.\Karl Brooks, regional administrator for EPA in Kansas City, Kan., said a budget amendment shepherded through the 2010 Legislature with backing from Republican Sen. Tim Huelskamp, of Fowler, might strip the Kansas Department of Health and Environment of its power to enforce the federal Clean Air Act. But the amendment, which could be vetoed this week by Democratic Gov. Mark Parkinson, can't keep EPA from its work.\""States do not have the discretion to apply state laws in a manner that does not meet the minimum federal standards,"" Brooks said in a letter to KDHE Secretary Rod Bremby. ""EPA will exercise its oversight authority as appropriate.""\EPA officials said Huelskamp's amendment wouldn't absolve Westar Energy, of Topeka, or Sunflower Electric Power Corp., of Hays, from compliance with federal regulations. The utilities expressed concern on behalf of 1 million Kansas customers that cutting out KDHE and pulling EPA deeper into the process could complicate or delay future projects.\Huelskamp, who is seeking the GOP nomination for the 1st District House seat, said he authored the amendment because state and federal regulators demonstrated a willingness to accept flawed science on global warming and to push for unreasonable controls on greenhouse gas emissions. He rejected the proposed federal cap-and-trade regulations that would limit the quantity of gases emitted each year and allow companies to trade in emissions permits.\In December, the EPA declared greenhouse gases a danger to humans. Huelskamp doesn't want this federal endangerment finding to be manipulated by KDHE to inhibit coal projects in Kansas.\""It's a question of whether you want to roll over for the EPA or take them on,"" Huelskamp said. ""I just feel compelled to fight the cap-and-trade proposal.""\He said Bremby betrayed the state's economic interests by working since 2007 to thwart expansion of the coal-fired power plant in Holcomb operated by Sunflower. The cooperative wants to develop an 895-megawatt addition to a unit that burns coal to generate electricity. Much of the new power would be sold to customers in Colorado.\First District congressional candidate Rob Wasinger, who previously worked for U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback in Washington, D.C., said on Monday the regulatory adjustment required of KDHE by the Huelskamp amendment could jeopardize Sunflower's expansion project.\""There is zero room for rookie mistakes and ham-handed legislation like this,"" Wasinger said.\Wasinger said it was wrong for Huelskamp and Sen. Jim Barnett, an Emporia Republican and another contender in the 1st District race, to vote in support of the amendment. All three of the men are seeking the seat now held by Rep. Jerry Moran, R-Kan.\""If signed by the governor,"" he said, ""the poorly drafted Huelskamp amendment would incorrectly give the EPA regulatory authority over our utilities and could shut down job creating projects such as Sunflower's plant expansion.""\Huelskamp said Sunflower would likely obtain from KDHE the required air-quality permit for the Holcomb project before EPA could adopt a new regulatory scheme on greenhouse gas.\The governor was taking these concerns into account as he reviewed numerous provisions of the $13 billion budget approved by the GOP-led Legislature, said Parkinson spokesman Seth Bundy. The deadline for issuing veto decisions on individual budget items in the bill is Friday.\Tim Carpenter can be reachedat (785) 295-1158 ortimothy.carpenter@cjonline.com."
4,"Rep. Dennis Hedke, the chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee, left this past weekend's American Legislative Exchange Council conference in Chicago with new ideas and new data to show his legislative colleagues. \Hedke, R-Wichita, said he sat on a task force that examined energy, environment and agriculture issues during the ALEC conference, the first he has attended. \""I was very impressed by the broad range of contents we deliberated,"" Hedke said via email. ""I would certainly say that the overall group was very diverse, with a great number of states represented, expertise appearing in panels, and other very valuable metrics."" \ALEC brings together lawmakers and corporate lobbyists who sit on task forces and subcommittees and craft ""model bills"" that then can be introduced in statehouses across the country. That process isn't open to the media. \Legislation that closely resembled model bills in areas like union rights, environmental protection and public education was introduced in the Kansas Legislature last year. Some bills, like one restricting public employee paycheck deductions for political activities and another repealing local ""prevailing wage"" ordinances, passed. \Others, like several school choice initiatives and bills to rollback renewable energy standards, sputtered. \Hedke said his ALEC task force discussed two new approaches to state renewable portfolio standards, or RPS. They were called the ""Market-Power Renewables Act"" and the ""Renewable Energy Credit Act."" The first model bill would allow consumers to choose whether they wanted to purchase electricity from renewable sources from their utilities. Both would remove the state mandates that require utilities to get a certain percentage of their energy from renewables. \""Careful study of these models may result in the development of legislation that can bring benefit to Kansas consumers, while encouraging stability in our total energy consumptive mix,"" Hedke said. \Hedke said his committee also discussed a ""Resolution in Opposition to a Carbon Tax"" that he ""strongly supported, and which passed by a wide margin."" \The European Union, the Netherlands and Australia have adopted such ""cap-and-trade"" regulations that penalize carbon emissions that have been linked to global climate change. \But Hedke, who has said he is unconvinced by the evidence for such a link, said ""such a tax would have an immediate and dramatic effect on gasoline and other transportation fuels in America, immediate and substantial increases on electricity costs and would put our country at a competitive disadvantage."" \Hedke, a contract geophysicist who has worked for oil and gas companies, was one of 11 Republican legislators who used state dollars to pay their $475 ALEC conference registration fee in advance. They included six senators: Garrett Love, of Montezuma; Terry Bruce, of Hutchinson; Jeff King, of Independence; Julia Lynn, of Olathe; Mary Pilcher-Cook, of Shawnee; and Jim Denning, of Overland Park. \House Republicans requesting the subsidy in advance were Hedke, Rob Bruchman and Marvin Kleeb, of Overland Park; Kevin Jones, of Wellsville; and Ron Ryckman Sr., of Meade. \Other legislators paid their own registration fee to attend and may choose to be reimbursed at any time during the fiscal year that ends July 2014. \House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, and Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, are on ALEC's national board of directors. \A keynote address by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was one of the few portions of the conference made public this year. \Bush stumped for more ""school-choice"" initiatives like public charter schools, private school vouchers and online education. \Bush also expressed support for the Common Core K-12 education standards, which came under fire from a group of Kansas conservatives last year, causing the Legislature to take up a bill to freeze funding for the initiative that was narrowly defeated in the closing hours of the session. \Other speakers at the Chicago conference included Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and Arthur Laffer, the economist hired to mastermind Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback's income tax cuts. \Last weekend's gathering was ALEC's 40th annual meeting. The group's profile and detractors have grown in recent years, following Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's bitter battle with unions and the proliferation of ""Stand Your Ground"" gun laws based on ALEC's ""Castle Doctrine Act."" \Thousands of protesters were reportedly in the streets surrounding the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago where the conference was held. \Sen. Jeff Melcher, R-Leawood, told a Chicago CBS affiliate that they were demonstrating against their own interests by opposing ALEC's free-market principles in favor of ""big government."" \""Historically it's shown to work to their detriment,"" Melcher said. ""Whenever we free up the marketplace, the market seems to settle a lot of problems on its own.""\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
5,"Jenkins' vehicle\I recently received in the mail a large glossy ""special report"" from Rep. Lynn Jenkins. The mailing outlined the fact that Jenkins was against cap and trade and went on to present the usual scare tactics regarding taxes.\There was no mention whatsoever of our environment, pollution, global warming or any of the other issues that are driving the proposed cap and trade legislation.\Jenkins is clearly using this forum as a vehicle to promote her opinions and corporate propaganda regarding the issues. She took an oath to represent us -- not to tell us what to think.\Regardless of your views about global warming or cap and trade, the fact that Jenkins is using tax money to shill for moneyed interests should be of concern to all.\STUART YOHO,Topeka\It's really a tax\Is there anyone in Topeka, especially among Mayor Bill Bunten and the Topeka City Council members, who believes that the $576,000 the city will receive in additional revenue from Westar Energy franchise fees actually came from Westar?\The fact is that franchise fees charged to utilities for the use of public rights-of-way are passed directly on to their customers. If you don't believe me, simply look at your electric bill.\A franchise fee charged by a city really is a tax by another name, a sneaky way for our governing body to raise revenue while pretending to not raise taxes.\MICHAEL PFENDER,Topeka\Debt burden\Much has been made of the fact that for the first time in history, the U.S. budget deficit for a single year will top $1 trillion this year. That was bad enough, until we saw a study on why the only way out is likely to be ""monetizing debt"" via inflation -- just printing the money.\The national debt is now $11.4 trillion. The U.S. has another $57.9 trillion in unfunded liabilities -- for such things as future social security benefits. That's a total public debt of $69.2 trillion, nearly 10 times total private debt, estimated at just over $7 trillion.\Now, consider that only 46 percent of the nation's 307 million people pay taxes. It works out to total public debt per taxpayer of $490,000, nearly 10 times the average private debt per taxpayer.\That, in a nutshell, explains what critics of out-of-control spending mean by ""generational theft.""\MIKE MEIER,Tecumseh\Japan's surrender\It was a glorious day, Aug. 15, 1945, for Americans and for all peace loving people around the globe, especially for those of us at Okinawa, some 500 miles from Japan -- which was to be the next World War II battleground and the only remaining barrier to total victory for the United States and its allies. After nearly four years of fighting and the loss of 416,800 American lives, at last the war was over.\Following victory in Europe on May 8, 1945, battle-hardened troops fresh from fighting there had been sent to Okinawa to join forces who had fought their way, island by island, from Guadalcanal to Okinawa for a combined invasion of Japan, which had been scheduled for November. A huge part of the U.S. naval fleet was setting offshore with amphibious craft standing ready along the beaches -- my LCT being one of them.\All forces were expecting to take part in the impending invasion. When it was announced that Japan had surrendered, a tremendous celebration broke out within minutes. The sky was filled with colorful tracer shells and horns and whistles were blasting. Aboard my craft, we all yelled and danced with joy.\Apparently, a Japanese submarine crew didn't get the word and that night blasted a huge hole in the side of a merchant ship loaded with supplies. My LCT was ordered to help unload its cargo. No other such instances occurred and the celebration went on.\The events that led to Japan's Aug. 15 surrender occurred a few days earlier, when U.S. planes dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6 and on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, taking nearly 200,000 lives.\It was a terrible tragedy to be sure, but thought by many to be a better alternative than invading Japan with an estimated loss of 1 million American lives, the lives of 500,000 British servicemen plus Japan's civilian and military casualties.\Whether they were right can never be determined, but we know that Aug. 15, 1945, and Dec. 7, 1941, are days that will be remembered in infinity.\CHARLES VAUSBINDER,Topeka\Say something nice\My mom taught me that if you can't say something good about someone, don't say anything at all. It seems that Rep. Lynn Jenkins can't find anything good about what she is doing in Washington, D.C., so she reverts to trash talking anything and everyone else.\She was sent to Congress to represent Kansans, not the Republican Party. That's what got Jim Ryun thrown out of office. Why are we paying her a salary? Why not just put a check mark next to whatever the Republican National Committee's talking points are for the week and save the money?\And I don't want any more of her public funded advertising -- a four-color brochure. The taxpayers paid for that mailing, and it should not be some political commercial for her. The money allocated for those mailings was to be used to inform constituents of their representative's voting record on issues and give the public all the facts about bills that are before Congress, not just one side.\Also, I am sick and tired of hearing how being a CPA makes her a great representative. It doesn't, it just makes you a CPA, so give it a rest\Negotiating, compromising and voting for what is best for Kansas' 2nd Congressional District is what will make her a great representative.\JIM LINN,Topeka"
6,"By Julie Hirschfeld Davis\THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\WASHINGTON -- Disgruntled voters, a sluggish economy and vanishing enthusiasm for President Barack Obama have put 75 seats or more in the House -- the vast majority held by Democrats -- at risk of changing hands and putting Republicans in charge.\The Democrats could become a victim of their own successes during the past two elections, when candidates were swept into power by antipathy for President George W. Bush and ardor for Obama. Now, eight weeks from Election Day, the Democrats are bracing for the virtual certainty of lost House seats and scrambling to hold back a wave that could hand the GOP the 40 it needs to command a majority\Obama, grasping for a way to turn the tide, today plans to propose $30 billion in new investment tax breaks for businesses to go along with tens of billions in spending he called for on Labor Day to invigorate the slow recovery. But even if Congress acts on the requests -- a long shot in a highly charged political season -- there is little time left for Democrats to salvage their election chances.\With Obama's popularity slumping and the party demoralized, dozens of first- and second-term Democrats -- as well as longer-serving congressmen who haven't faced serious challenges in years -- are toiling to hold jobs in places that tend to prefer Republicans. And polls show independent voters leaning toward the GOP.\When asked which party they want to control Congress, voters are split or leaning toward Republicans, national surveys say. Perhaps even more ominously for Democrats, voters are overwhelmingly sour about national issues, especially the economy.\More than 60 percent said the nation was in a state of decline and on the wrong track in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, in which voters likely to turn out in November gave Republicans a gaping 9-point edge when asked which party they wanted to control Congress.\Much can change between now and Election Day, and a GOP House takeover is far from sure. The political parties, individual campaigns and outside groups that spend heavily to influence elections have scarcely begun to distribute the hundreds of millions of dollars they plan to pour into key congressional districts across the country for advertising and on-the-ground organizing that can turn out crucial voters.\And most voters have yet to focus on the contests.\Still, Republicans are confidently predicting Democrats' defeat.\""Republicans have the intensity,"" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., head recruiter for House GOP candidates. ""The map is growing by the day.""\Democrats acknowledge the strong headwinds but counter that, with a solid fundraising advantage over Republicans and years worth of preparation for what they always knew would be a brutal election, they can fight off the GOP onslaught.\""We've got some very, very tough political territory on an off year with a weak economy, so it's a major challenge in a difficult political environment. That said, we will retain a majority in the House,"" said Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the party's House campaign chief.\The current breakdown is 255 Democrats, 178 Republicans and two vacancies that appear likely to be won by the GOP.\Democratic incumbents are at risk from California to New York and particularly in the unemployment-stricken Rust Belt, where six in Pennsylvania and five in Ohio face stiff challenges. Hotly contested races are unfolding in every region, including three each in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Indiana, and two in Alabama, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Wisconsin and Virginia.\Among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are freshmen Reps. Betsy Markey of Colorado, Steve Driehaus of Ohio and Tom Perriello of Virginia. They had little time to settle into elected office before casting votes for key elements of Obama's agenda that are proving controversial, including the health care law and the so-called cap-and-trade measure to curb carbon emissions. Markey and Perriello, like some four dozen other Democrats, are fighting to hold onto districts that voted for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008.\At the same time, a handful of influential, senior Democrats -- including Missouri's Ike Skelton, the chair of the Armed Services Committee, and South Carolinian John Spratt, the Budget chairman -- are facing formidable re-election battles in a year when voter dislike of elected officials, excessive government spending and the political establishment is on the rise.\Reps. Allen Boyd of Florida and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota -- both in the House more than a decade -- and Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania and Chet Edwards of Texas -- veterans of 20 years or more -- also face tough fights.\And Democrats are facing tight races to hang on to most of the 20 seats where the incumbent retired, left or is pursuing another office -- typically the most difficult for a party to defend. Those include two each in Arkansas and Tennessee, and long-shots in Louisiana, Kansas and upstate New York, where Rep. Eric Massa resigned in March amid an investigation into whether he sexually harassed male staffers.\Most of the 23 open Republican seats are not regarded as seriously in play, although Democrats have good chances of claiming two being vacated by GOP lawmakers running for the Senate, including one in Delaware now held by Mike Castle and one in the Chicago suburbs held by Mark Kirk.\Only a few Republican incumbents are at serious risk in otherwise Democratic districts, including Joseph Cao in New Orleans and Charles Djou in Hawaii. Democrats also believe they have shots at ousting Republican Reps. Dave Reichert in Washington and Lee Terry in Nebraska.\As bad as things are for Democrats, they do lead in the money race. However, with their list of endangered incumbents expanding, they face painful choices about which races to abandon in the interest of spending where they realistically can win. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put out an urgent fundraising appeal Tuesday beseeching supporters to help raise $500,000 by Friday for an ""Emergency Rapid Response"" fund to pay for TV ads defending Democratic candidates.\Otherwise, Pelosi wrote, ""we may not have all the resources we need for every race until November.""\The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's House campaign arm, had $36 million in cash at the end of July compared to the National Republican Congressional Committee's $22 million. But the gap has been closing steadily as Election Day nears, and a handful of GOP-backed outside groups have plans to pour tens of millions into House races in the coming weeks. Unions are also planning to funnel large sums into the contests on behalf of Democrats.\Democrats have booked $49 million worth of TV advertising time in 60 congressional districts, the vast majority to protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents, while Republicans have reserved $22 million for advertising in 41 districts, all but one now held by Democrats.\""The opportunity is there,"" to wrest the House, said Guy Harrison, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ""We just have to execute."""
7,"Obama disasters\Every aspect of our federal government is a current or pending disaster. Our president demonstrates zero leadership and executive ability. Heaven help us if we have another major disaster or threat requiring immediate action or a solution.\We can see a pattern where the Democrats have no respect for you and me.\- The Obama administration illegally put union cronies ahead of bondholders when restructuring Chrysler ownership.\- Eighty percent of Americans expressed satisfaction with their existing health care, but Obama passed reform by virtue of bribes and bailouts behind closed door deals.\- Frivolous lawsuits are a major component of health care costs. Democrats protected their alliance with trial lawyers by cutting Medicare by $500 billion rather than implementing tort reform.\- Illegal immigration is a disaster. It is more important to Obama to use comprehensive immigration reform as a stick rather than to protect the citizens of Arizona, which is a responsibility of the federal government.\- Declaring a moratorium on offshore oil drilling for six months not only impacts the drillers and people in the Gulf of Mexico but is a slap in the face to all of us who will pay a higher price for gasoline.\- The cap and trade bill, if passed, will be disastrous but will make billionaires of an elite group.\Obama's allegiance is not to the American people -- it is to George Soros and his radical Center for American Progress. It's to the unions, the environmentalists, other special interests and his commitment to transforming America. The bottom line is that the Democrats don't care about you and me. They have their own agenda, and it usually has nothing to do with us except cost us freedom and finances.\RANDY ELLIS,Topeka\Financial reform\At the beginning of the fiscal crisis our country entered in 2006, there were a great many people who, enamored of achieving some basic set of talking points of the American dream, fell into the subprime mortgage trap and wound up worse than they were before. This was the spearhead for a recession that had consequences the world over, and our children's children shall be picking up the pieces, wondering what we were up to and what we could have been thinking.\There is no greater moment than right now for the needed reform of monetary policy, starting with Wall Street. Congress is debating a bill that will have profound implications for the future of our finances. Among the many benefits to the taxpayer are doing away with hidden fees for credit cards and mortgages, cracking down on predatory lenders looking to mislead people into taking on debt that they cannot handle and, my personal favorite, never again being asked to bail out any bank that is ""too big to fail"" -- a turn of phrase that will live in infamy.\Money is a powerful thing. It has a lure to it because of the leverage it allows one to wield. That leverage should be regulated strictly and fairly so the unassuming and naive are protected.\I hope others will join with me in supporting adoption of the Wall Street reform bill that's now before Congress. It's a positive first step in fixing the holes in the ship of state.\STEPHEN HILL,Lawrence\Saving animals\I wonder how many of the dedicated volunteers who helped saving a pelican from the deadly oil in the Gulf of Mexico have other birds for dinner.\They are not alone. Most people are appalled by the devastation of animal life by the gulf oil spill yet subsidize the systematic killing of other animals for their dinner table. They know that meat and dairy harm the environment and their family's health, but compartmentalize this knowledge when shopping for food.\And it goes beyond dietary flaws. We tolerate the killing of innocent people when our government and media label them terrorists. We ignore the suffering and starvation of a billion people, except when our government and media tell us to care because an earthquake or tsunami has struck.\Our society would benefit greatly from more original thinkers, and our personal diet is a great place to start.\THOMAS JARDINE,Topeka"
8,"
State legislation bearing the fingerprints of state senator and congressional candidate Tim Huelskamp, R-Fowler, has stirred a fracas in the 1st District race.
\
Huelskamp is a critic of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but his amendment in a state budget bill to thwart greenhouse gas regulations could result, unintentionally, in expanding the EPA's role in Kansas.
\
At least that's what concerns Sunflower Electric Power Corp., Hays, and Westar Energy Inc., Topeka, which want Gov. Mark Parkinson, a Democrat, to strike the language from the budget bill. Parkinson must make his decision by Friday. A spokeswoman for the governor said Monday he was continuing to review the budget, offering no hint how he might deal with the greenhouse gas provision.
\
Despite the position of Sunflower Electric, which supplies power to cooperatives serving central and western Kansas, Huelskamp isn't backing away from his amendment and he doesn't want Parkinson to veto it.
\
Rob Wasinger, a Cottonwood Falls Republican who was Sen. Sam Brownback's chief of staff and a candidate in the 1st District primary, issued a press release chastising the two state legislators in the race: Huelskamp and Sen. Jim Barnett, R-Emporia.
\
""I join Sunflower Electric and Westar Energy in urging the Governor to veto the Huelskamp amendment and call on Huelskamp and Barnett, both part of the Topeka establishment which boasts a meager 26 percent approval rating, to stop the political grandstanding and put job-creation above their ambitions for a promotion to Congress,"" Wasinger said in the release.
\
""With the federal government looking to expand its power over our lives at every opportunity, there is zero room for a rookie mistake and ham-handed legislation like this,"" Wasinger said.
\
The Huelskamp amendment that made its way into the budget bill passed on a voice vote. It isn't known how Barnett voted. He was on the campaign trail Monday, and efforts to reach him were unsuccessful. Both Huelskamp and Barnett voted against the overall budget bill.
\
Earlier in the session, Huelskamp offered a different but related Senate resolution opposing EPA's greenhouse gas regulations by rulemaking. That particular resolution garnered 34 votes in the 40-member Senate, including Barnett's vote.
\
Huelskamp wants to block what he sees as a move by the Obama administration to implement a cap-and-trade carbon dioxide emissions policy through administrative action. He said the EPA's endangerment finding is based on a climate change study that has been debunked.
\
Under Huelskamp's amendment, during the state fiscal year from July 1 through June 30, 2011, no money appropriated to state agencies could be spent ""to plan, draft, propose, promulgate, finalize, or implement"" any rules regarding the Clean Air Act involving greenhouses gases identified in the final rule in the endangerment findings.
\
A May 10 letter by EPA Regional Administrator Karl Brooks to Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Rod Bremby expressed concern about the language. He noted that if a state lacks the authority to apply requirements after Jan. 2, 2011, the EPA ""will exercise its oversight authority as appropriate."" Brooks also referred to the permitting process but did not specifically mention Sunflower Electric, which has an air permit application pending for a new coal-fired generating plant in Holcomb.
\
Sunflower Electric anticipates it will secure its permit from the state before the end of this year, according to Clare Gustin, a vice president at the utility.
\
""I guess we're going on record for those that come behind us,"" Gustin said, of Sunflower Electric's concern about the amendment and its ""unintended consequences.""
\
Years ago, the KDHE was given the role of implementing the Clean Air Act, and this amendment would have the effect of taking a piece of that act and saying Kansas staff wouldn't implement those rules. Rather, EPA staff would step in and enforce them, Gustin said.
\
""The EPA is clearly overstating it, as they tend to do, and they're coming in and trying to enhance their authority,"" said Huelskamp Monday.
\
Huelskamp noted that his ""explanation of vote"" entered in the Senate Journal in May explains the aim of the amendment to the budget bill: No state dollars are going to be used to help promote the cap-and-trade proposal.

Topeka - If there were a bill in Congress that required states to buy Kansas beef, the Kansas congressional delegation would be first in line to vote for it, Gov. Mark Parkinson said Wednesday.
\
So he questioned why some Kansas members were not supporting legislation that contains national renewable electricity standards that could result in states buying electricity produced by Kansas wind farms.
\
Parkinson made the comment to about 700 people at the Kansas Wind and Renewable Energy Conference.
\
""A strong, national RES is the single most important piece of legislation for Kansas that is in Congress this year,"" Parkinson said. He said the Kansas delegation should ""lock up in favor"" of this, as he put the telephone numbers of the Kansas congressional members on a screen.
\
A national RES would require the production of a certain percentage of electric power from renewable sources. Parkinson said he sees a national requirement as being a boon for wind development in Kansas, which sits in the middle of the ""wind belt"" and has been ranked as the No. 3 state in wind energy potential. States that don't have the wind resource of Kansas would have to buy energy from Kansas, he said.
\
A national RES was part of a bill designed to reduce climate-changing greenhouse gases that was approved this summer by the U.S. House, 219-212. The measure would cap greenhouse gas emissions and then allow the buying and trading of emission allocations under that limit. The bill also would establish a renewable electricity standard and improved energy efficiency for a combined total of 20 percent of energy use by 2020.
\
The two members of Congress representing Lawrence split on the vote. U.S. Rep. Dennis Moore, D-Kan., voted for it, while U.S. Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kan., voted against. Kansas' two other House members -- Republicans Jerry Moran and Todd Tiahrt -- also voted against the bill.
\
Jenkins said the cap-and-trade part of the bill dealing with emissions would result in increased energy costs and loss of jobs.
\
""While Congresswoman Jenkins opposes the job-killing cap-and-trade legislation, she continues to pursue an all-of-the-above approach to energy independence that includes looking at a renewable energy standard and assessing the potential positive impacts on the Kansas economy,"" her office said Wednesday.
\
Moore had an opposite take on the bill, saying that it would spur development.
\
""Changing the way we create and use energy will not only create new industries and jobs throughout the country -- jobs that can't be shipped overseas -- it will revitalize our economy by making the United States a leader in the energy industry and increase our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil,"" Moore said.
\
The Senate version of the climate bill was introduced last week and doesn't include a national RES, but separate bills do have it.
\
Parkinson said the demand for wind energy that would be created by a national RES would increase wind generation in Kansas tenfold, from 1,000 megawatts to 10,000 megawatts, while also helping clean the environment.
\
""We're not asking (the Kansas congressional delegation) to vote for bad public policy, and it will be great for Kansas,"" he said.

However, ""right-wing extremism"" is an oxymoron, since radical far right isn't right by definition. Left or right of right is still left in its degrees.\Definitions and concepts change over time. A liberal of the 18th century or a Democrat of the 1950s or '60s is not the same as those in our postmodern culture.\President Barack Obama's increasingly radical-left and traditional Chicago-style politics, ideology and agenda necessitate absolute power and degrees of oligarchy in areas not granted by our Constitution. A case in point is illegal immigration.\I have friends and acquaintances who have gone through the legal documentation and steps to come here, live, work and prosper, citizens and not.\The government has a constitutional requirement to protect its citizens, which includes our borders. If the federal government can't do this, the states are granted certain constitutional rights.\It's unbelievable that some try to compare this issue with states' rights and the civil rights issues of the 1950s and '60s. The problem then was the states' rights to segregate conflicted with the Constitution and human rights and protection. Illegal immigration is not a constitutional and human right, and is a threat to U.S. citizens and the illegals themselves. Likewise, gay marriage exposes a similar constitutionally fallacious argument.\Back in the late 1800s or early 1900s, a prominent American Indian chief put it well when he said something like, ""We all gradually opened up our borders, and look what happened!"" One man's inclusion is another's exclusion, or even oppression -- they all judge and exclude their opposite based on moral standards.\I'm offended by our postmodern secular culture and those offended by me. But the same Constitution that protects us, our borders and all legal immigrants, and ensures our freedom to disagree, does not protect us from being offended.\GRIFF ARGO,Topeka\Wasinger has plan\The bleak numbers released by the Census Bureau showing massive population losses for rural Kansas are just another reason why I'm voting for Rob Wasinger in the Aug. 3 Republican primary.\While all the candidates have the same stances on basic issues, only Wasinger, a native of Hays and fourth-generation Kansan, has a plan to stop the out-migration of our most precious commodity here in Kansas, our children.\Wasinger's New Homestead Act, which nearly all of rural Kansas would qualify for, is a package of tax incentives to repopulate rural America and is named after Abraham Lincoln's original Homestead Act to populate the west.\Rural Kansas can do better, and I know Wasinger would get burdensome taxes, regulations and big government out of our way so businesses, farmers, ranchers and energy producers could grow, expand and create jobs for rural Kansas.\MAURICE CUMMINGS,Hutchinson\Kill cap and trade\America's energy policy and economic policy are like two horses connected by a double harness, and it's essential to have them pulling in the same direction. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case in Washington, D.C.\The federal government is pushing unrealistic plans for reducing carbon emissions that would kill jobs and push the economy deeper into a hole.\The primary offender is the Environmental Protection Agency, which is threatening to impose regulations on carbon dioxide. The regulations would punish small businesses and squeeze taxpayers by forcing states to absorb the cost of enforcing EPA regulations. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, introduced a resolution prohibiting the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases but didn't get the necessary votes.\Greenhouse gas emissions and their possible link to climate change represent a national policy issue that should be addressed in the comprehensive energy and climate bill Congress is considering. But there is some support in Congress and the White House to include a complicated ""cap and trade system"" for trading carbon emission permits.\This system would make a handful of Wall Street insiders richer, but would do nothing to protect the environment or revive the economy. It would create new volatility in energy prices.\We can't afford to destroy traditional jobs as the price of creating ""green"" ones. That's a lesson any Kansas family could explain to the ""experts"" inside the Beltway.\MICHELLE HIGGINS,Topeka\Include more facts\I realize the letters to the editor column is a portion of The Capital-Journal's Opinion page, but some of the letters would be more interesting if the authors, such as one who recently wrote about President Obama's ""disasters,"" included some facts.\Bill Roy, in his column published July 5, ""Obama inherited mess,"" did provide several facts in his piece. However, he didn't include the fact Republicans have sat around drawing a salary for 18 months complaining about the mess Democrats have created without offering meaningful suggestions to help the American people.\Republicans are waiting around in the belief the American public will elect more of them to bungle things, like they did the previous eight years.\My thinking is, if you aren't part of the solution, you are part of the problem.\For the Obama bashers, some of us know what the real problem is with Obama. However, that is a subject for another time.\For the people who are really interested in changing the way things are done in this country, hold to the fire the feet of some of those people you voted for in the last congressional elections, like you are doing Obama.\A president generally only makes suggestions, vetoes and signs laws -- and sometimes starts wars.\JIM MURRAY,Topeka"

Topeka - A measure tucked into the state budget could prevent Kansas from implementing Environmental Protection Agency rules on greenhouse gases.
\
The proposal was shepherded through by Sen. Tim Huelskamp, R-Fowler, during the final days of the legislative session that ended last week.
\
""Instead of supporting sound science and common sense, the EPA has chosen to take the radical path of attempting to regulate carbon dioxide and methane,"" said Huelskamp, who also is running for the 1st District congressional seat, currently occupied by Jerry Moran.
\
""I'm determined to do what is best for our Kansas economy, and that is to oppose the EPA implementation of their cap-and-trade regulatory scheme at every possible opportunity,"" he said.
\
The amendment to the appropriations bill would prohibit any state agency from spending state funds ""to plan, draft, propose, promulgate, finalize or implement any rules and regulations pursuant to the Clean Air Act involving the greenhouse gases identified"" in the EPA's endangerment finding.
\
EPA has declared that climate-changing greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare and need to be regulated. Those gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride.
\
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment, which enforces environmental rules, is the target of the amendment, and a major issue before KDHE is a pending permit for an 895-megawatt coal-fired electric power plant in southwest Kansas, known as the Sunflower Electric Power Project.
\
In 2007, KDHE Secretary Roderick Bremby denied the permit for the project, citing the effects of the proposal's potential carbon dioxide emissions on health and environment.
\
In 2008 and 2009, Sunflower Electric and Colorado-based Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which would own most of the power from the project, pushed through legislation to overturn Bremby's decision. Then-Gov. Kathleen Sebelius vetoed that legislation several times.
\
When Mark Parkinson became governor in 2009, after Sebelius' departure to join President Barack Obama's Cabinet, Parkinson made a deal with Sunflower and Tri-State to build a smaller project.
\
The amendment to the budget bill is now in the hands of Parkinson, who can let it become law or apply a line-item veto to it. Parkinson's office said the governor has not yet received the appropriations bill but that once he does he will thoroughly consider every proviso before taking any action.
\
Environmentalists are unhappy with the amendment but, ironically, they are not asking for Parkinson to veto it.
\
Given Parkinson's deal-making with Sunflower on the coal plant, they don't see much help coming from the Statehouse.
\
""At this point, we're not inclined to use the legislative process to combat these special interests anymore,"" said Stephanie Cole, a spokeswoman for the Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club. ""The legislative process is being abused. We will focus on the Sunflower project in the courts.""
\
Scott Allegrucci, director of the Great Plains Alliance for Clean Energy, said the provision wouldn't stand up in court and probably would invite more scrutiny from the EPA on Kansas environmental regulation.
\
""We might consider more direct oversight by EPA a much more responsible and dependable pathway to regulatory certainty in Kansas,"" Allegrucci said.
\
EPA's Regional Administrator Karl Brooks has already written a letter to Parkinson and Bremby expressing concerns about any provision that would block federal rules.
\
In that letter, Brooks warns that if a state doesn't follow federal pollution laws, the EPA will exercise its authority to make sure that projects seeking permits adhere to federal requirements.

We need a green stimulus package.
\
The federal government has placed at least $700 billion on the table to bail out the reckless finance industry. However, it's done little to subsidize the alternative fuel industry, which had nothing to do with the current economic crisis but holds the key to the economy's - and the environment's - recovery.
\
The Democrats, with the blessing of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke, are suggesting a stimulus package of about $200 billion. We should use at least half of that to move America away from our dependence on petroleum and reduce our carbon footprint on the planet.
\
Green Jobs for America Campaign, a coalition of environmental and labor groups, is calling for a $100 billion green stimulus program that would include a combination of tax credits, loan guarantees and public investment in environmental technology that it says will create roughly 2 million jobs over two years.
\
The program, outlined in a report written by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and the Center for American Progress, calls for investing in new power sources, including wind, solar power and ""next-generation biofuels."" It also recommends ""expanding mass transit and freight rail,"" ""retrofitting buildings to improve energy efficiency"" and ""constructing 'smart' electrical grid transmission systems.""
\
The $100 billion program, the report says, ""could be paid for with proceeds from auctions of carbon permits under a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program.""
\
The environmental benefits of such a program seem obvious. We would burn less fuel, spewing less carbon into this atmosphere. And we could spare our coastlines and the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge from the ravages of oil drilling.
\
But the benefits would go well beyond the positive impact on the environment. According to the report, investing in green technologies would create a broad range of employment opportunities, especially in construction and manufacturing work.
\
It also would lower energy costs for public and private buildings, making more money available for more productive endeavors.
\
The public infrastructure portion of the program - upgrades to public buildings, public transportation and the electrical grid - could be enacted quickly, according to the report. But to do so would take a commitment to public works spending that the Congress and the executive branch have not demonstrated in more than a generation.
\
Now is a crucial moment to demonstrate that commitment again, but this time with a green focus.

15,"By Tim Carpenter\THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\Rod Bremby's desk on the fourth floor of Curtis State Office Building in Topeka is 342 miles from the tiny community of Holcomb.\For all the drama he's endured as secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment about planning for expansion of a coal-fired power plant in that southwest Kansas town, his office might as well have been inside one of the old 3,000-degree furnaces Sunflower Electric Power Corp. relies upon to generate electricity at the facility.\It was Bremby who became the first state regulator in the nation to justify rejection of an air quality permit for a new coal plant by declaring carbon dioxide emissions a public health hazard.\In return, he was inundated by political and industry advocates of a coal rush. Environmentalists spiced the conversation by declaring investment in coal a fool's errand. And there were regular folks who seek nothing more than a reliable source of power when flipping the light switch at home. These actors hit the stage with scene-stealing lobbying campaigns, tight votes on coal legislation, gubernatorial vetoes, brokered backroom deals and lawsuits.\The rural electric cooperative is now pressing for authority to build a 795-megawatt coal unit at Holcomb. KDHE will gather public comment on the permit through Aug. 15, and then focus on the latest permit decision.\""We're going to try to make this as transparent as we can,"" Bremby said.\Relighting the fuse\Sunflower, which serves customers in western Kansas with a 360-megawatt coal-burning plant, has sought to expand for a decade. The current proposal is the third since Sunflower executives asked KDHE in 2001 for permission to put up a 660-megawatt unit called Sand Sage.\KDHE issued the permit in 2002 and the agency, led by Bremby, granted an extension in 2004. The permit expired without a shovel being turned. In 2006, KDHE received Sunflower's plan for construction of three 700-megawatt coal-fired units. Public hearings in Garden City, Topeka and Lawrence drew 600 people, while 600 others submitted written comments to KDHE. In 2007, Sunflower condensed the proposal to 1,400 megawatts of production capacity. The project would be a partnership with Tri-State Generation and Transmission Cooperative, of Colorado; Golden Spread Electric Cooperative, of Texas; and Midwest Energy, of Kansas.\The process went sideways when Kansas Attorney General Paul Morrison issued a legal opinion declaring Bremby had authority to deny a permit if the project was deemed a threat to people or the environment. Less than one month later, Bremby rejected the permit. He said the rise in carbon dioxide emissions was an unacceptable risk.\Earl Watkins, Sunflower's president and chief executive officer, said the decision was ""arbitrary and capricious"" because the federal government didn't regulate the compound as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.\The coal debate consumed the 2008 legislative sessions. Gov. Kathleen Sebelius vetoed three bills written to reverse Bremby's decision. The stalemate dragged on until Sebelius resigned in 2009. In short order, Gov. Mark Parkinson negotiated an agreement allowing Sunflower to proceed with an 895-megawatt expansion. A bill was passed to prevent Bremby from stepping beyond federal law on emissions. Sunflower agreed to build transmission lines, invest in wind power and promote energy efficiency.\Another run\In January, Sunflower requested the new air permit for an 895-megawatt generating unit. The company's latest public estimate pegged the cost at $2.8 billion.\""We need base load power,"" said Cindy Hertel, a spokeswoman at Hays-based Sunflower. ""The demand for energy continues to increase. We need diverse generation resources, but certainly base load power is essential to our way of life.""\Hertel said KDHE had 18 months to issue a final decision. That deadline could send the outcome to December 2011. If approved, 48 months to 52 months would be required for construction, which could place the opening in 2016. She said Sunflower's demand for electricity would grow in 2019 with expiration of a power purchase contract with Jeffrey Energy Center northwest St. Marys.\""There will be 200 megawatts allotted for Kansas. It's going to effect 500,000 people in Kansas,"" she said.\The out-of-state cooperatives would invest heavily in the project to guarantee access to a majority of energy generated at Holcomb II. Sunflower would earn management fees from its partners.\Tri-State spokesman Jim Van Someren said the Colorado cooperative's board of directors had made no final commitment to the Kansas project. The bond rating firm Fitch Ratings reported in May regulatory and environmental push back on Holcomb meant ""Tri-State has revised its power supply plan and pushed the planned construction of a single Holcomb unit beyond its original 2013 start date to 2016 at the earliest.""\Van Someren said speculating about a completion date was unproductive because so many external forces were in play. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could flex its regulatory muscle in Kansas. Congress could pass a cap-and-trade measure altering the financial landscape for new coal units. In the interim, Tri-State is investing in a wind farm in Colorado and solar facility in New Mexico.\""We're on record saying we support and believe in traditional generating resources,"" he said.\Poison legacy\Scott Allegrucci, executive director of the Great Plains Alliance for Clean Energy, said the expansion of Holcomb was ""inconsistent with the historic values of our state.""\""The current project ... would import coal from Wyoming, deliver electricity to Colorado and rely upon Kansas air and water for decades,"" he said.\Allegrucci said financial, scientific and regulatory elements changed since Sunflower built its lone unit 30 years ago.\""We know a lot more today about the impacts of these previous bad decisions,"" Allegrucci said. ""The risks associated with outdated 20th-century technologies incurring significant additional debt and unknown additional environmental costs, are not the legacy we wish to leave our children.""\Stephanie Cole, who works with the Sierra Club in Kansas, said the tide was pulling against development of coal-fired plants in the United States. No single coal plant broke ground in 2009, she said. Twenty-nine projects were shelved. Developers voluntarily walked away from projects, she said, citing financial risks to ratepayers, diminished demand for electricity and the uncertain regulatory future.\""They're not doing it because they're members of the Sierra Club,"" Cole said.\Bremby will conduct public hearings in Overland Park, Salina and Garden City before making a final ruling on Sunflower. He might not finish before installation of a new Kansas governor in January. The decision might fall to the next KDHE secretary. Regardless of party or philosophy, the case will be a magnet to the person in the hot seat at Curtis Office Building.\""We know there is a lot of interest out there,"" Bremby said."

To the editor:
\
Energy markets do not account for the ""external"" or social costs of using fossil fuels. If I dump my garbage in your backyard, you're right to insist that I pay for that privilege, assuming you are willing to let me do it at all. And if you do not insist, you can be pretty sure that I will keep on dumping my garbage there.
\
Carbon emissions must have an associated cost that reflects their toll on people and the environment. An emissions trading system (cap and trade) or a tax (carbon fee and dividend) has to be created, and that does not happen by the ""invisible hand"" of the marketplace. It happens through government action.
\
According to the Paris Climate Accord, we need large-scale renewable power, coupled with dramatic increases in energy efficiency, demand management and storage. A price on carbon will push demand in the right direction, but it needs to be reinforced by the pull of public investment in innovation.
\
Major technological developments are not produced by the private sector working alone. Edison and Westinghouse developed electricity, but the government built the delivery system. Same was true with the telephone system, the interstate highway system, nuclear power, the Internet, digital computers, satellite communications, weather forecasting and global positioning systems. They all took public and private effort sustained over decades. We need to stop demonizing government and recognize its crucial role in doing the most important thing that markets do not do: prioritizing and sustaining the common good.

Topeka - The anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity on Monday called on political candidates to sign a pledge stating they would not increase taxes to deal with climate change.
\
""We hope future Kansas lawmakers will put taxpayers above any feel-good environmental legislation that will wreak havoc on our economy,"" said Alan Cobb, state director of AFP's Kansas chapter.
\
The group said it started contacting candidates at the federal, state and local levels, asking them to oppose taxes on carbon emissions and similar policies.
\
A candidate who signs the ""No Climate Tax and Local Pledge"" vows ""to the taxpayers of the state of Kansas that I will oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in state or local government revenue.""
\
Cobb stated: ""Many Kansans have concerns about the environment, but politicians should not play on those fears by using environmental policy as a means of pulling even more tax dollars from Kansas families to fund unrelated spending increases.""
\
The issue of climate change has been front and center in Kansas.
\
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius has blocked construction of two 700-megawatt coal-fired plants in southwestern Kansas because of concerns about carbon dioxide emissions and its effect on global warming.
\
Hays-based Sunflower Electric Power Corp. and its Colorado partner are trying to overturn Sebelius' decision in court.
\
Meanwhile, both presidential candidates - Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain - agree that climate change must be confronted.
\
And both say they back a cap-and-trade system that would set limits on greenhouse gas emissions.

18,"U.S. Rep. Lynn Jenkins filed for re-election Tuesday in a bid to win a third term in Congress -- and she engaged in verbal sparring with the Democratic challenger that may set the tone for the next five months of campaigning. \Jenkins, who began her political career in the Kansas Legislature in 1998, also served as state treasurer before defeating a Democratic incumbent for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. After that narrow victory in the 2nd District, which includes Topeka, she easily won re-election in 2010. \""The issue is jobs and the economy, and creating the right environment at the federal level to foster job growth,"" she said. \Jenkins, 50, was raised in Holton and graduated from Kansas State University and Weber State College.

19,"Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent. Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.\So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.\The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. The meeting adjourned with essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.\The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised."" The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of theCopenhagen conference.\There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, the two most populous nations. On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth -- together they account for 26 percent of emissions -- jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades. Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them. But do not really embrace them.\Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel. When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""\In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago. Then intelligent people agreed that global cooling threatened human survival. It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average.""\Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures. For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement -- people eating locally grown foods from small farms -- actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.\A Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:\They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf.""\In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes. As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed and none have hit the U.S.\George Will's e-mail address is georgewill@washpost.com.\Washington Post Writers Group"
20,"Most details about how plans to limit greenhouse gases could affect Kansas remain up in the air, and state environmental officials expressed concerns they won't have time to write comprehensive rules. \Tom Gross, air monitoring and planning chief for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, spoke at the Kansas Corporation Commission's Topeka headquarters Tuesday afternoon. Three representatives from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's region seven office, which oversees Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa, also gave a presentation and answered questions. \The EPA is developing rules to regulate greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, with the goal of mitigating climate change. It isn't clear whether those rules will mostly affect power plants, or whether other ways of reducing energy usage, such as weatherization programs, will count toward meeting the carbon dioxide standard, Gross said. \Once the EPA announces its final rules in June 2015, Kansas and all other states will have one year to write their own plan to meet the standards, Gross said. That will be a challenge, given the complexity of the issues, he said, and it might take closer to five years to fully vet them. If Kansas fails to come up a plan, it would fall under a federal one.  \An important question is whether utilities that already took measures to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, such as adding more energy from wind and natural gas to their portfolios, will get credit for those efforts, Gross said. If wind energy already in development counts, Kansas could meet the standards with relative ease, he said. \""The wind is the big, big one in Kansas,"" he said. ""If we get the right kind of rule from EPA, I guess I'm optimistic that this could be a straightforward process."" \President Barack Obama set a goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent from their 2005 levels. The EPA isn't guaranteed to use 2005 as its base year, however, so what year it chooses will affect how much states have to reduce their emissions, Gross said. Other unanswered questions include what role interstate power pools might play, and whether a cap and trade system will allow companies that emit more pollution to buy credits from those that have reduced their emissions more than required. \How Kansas approaches greenhouse gas regulation also depends on whether the EPA decides to regulate methane, which traps heat more efficiently than carbon dioxide, said Joshua Tapp, chief of the air planning branch in the EPA's region seven office. If it does so, changing how confined animal feeding operations do business could be a part of Kansas' strategy, he said. \Tapp said the EPA intends for the process to allow states flexibility in deciding how to meet the standards. \""Our preference would be to let the state work with the options, make the choices,"" he said.\Credit: Megan Hart megan.hart@cjonline.com"

Topeka - The state Senate today will consider legislation aimed at getting two coal-burning power plants built in southwest Kansas despite the objections of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and several environmental groups.
\
But while legislative leaders pushed for the plants, which would emit 11 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, Kansas' top environmental official renewed his call for a reduction in greenhouse gasses.
\
Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Roderick Bremby said his agency was preparing a statewide inventory of CO2 emissions that could lead to future regulations.
\
Bremby said the inventory was needed ""so that we know how big this issue is in Kansas.""
\
Last year, Bremby rejected the two 700-megawatt plants citing concerns about carbon dioxide emissions and global warming. Legislative supporters of the plants have vowed to reverse that decision.
\
Under questioning Tuesday from legislators, Bremby said his agency will have ready in two months a catalog of CO2 emissions by sector, such as transportation, agriculture and energy.
\
With that in hand, KDHE would start a public process aimed at limits of CO2, he said.
\
Bremby said ""the stick"" of those limits would be used in the process of considering permits to modify equipment at existing coal-fired plants.
\
When lawmakers expressed displeasure with that approach, Bremby said federal legislation was on the way that would likely force the issue.
\
""There are bigger sticks that are out there,"" he said.
\
Bremby said it is almost certain that a federal ""cap and trade"" system will be enacted within the next three years that would create a price for carbon dioxide emissions similar to those in Europe. Industry experts think the cost would likely be $20 to $30 a ton, he said.
\
""We are choosing not to ignore the impending federal legislation,"" Bremby said. ""We want to work with industry to develop strategies today to mitigate those future regulations.""
\
Meanwhile, the bill before the Senate would allow construction of the plants and limit KDHE's ability to deny permits for other coal-burning plants.
\
Also on Tuesday, the House Energy and Utilities Committee recommended a bill that would allow the two plants but also require utilities to generate 10 percent of their electricity from renewable resources, such as wind, by 2010.

Sitting in her home in Lawrence, Lynate Pettengill may not strike the casual observer as a typical Washington lobbyist. But in effect, that's what she is, even though she spends most of her time working from home.
\
Pettengill is one of only a handful of paid staff members with a relatively new grassroots organization based in California called the Citizens Climate Lobby which, despite its small staff, boasts more than 6,000 volunteers and activists nationwide.
\
And they believe they've come up with a bill to reduce carbon emissions that even conservatives who oppose government regulation can embrace.
\
""It's kind of a carrot-and-stick approach,"" she said. ""If you don't like this option (regulation), then here's an alternative you can get behind. I think that's been a motivation.""
\
Pettengill and a handful of other Lawrence activists recently joined hundreds of other Citizen Climate Lobby activists from around the country in Washington, D.C., where they converged to lobby their local delegations to support the legislation.
\
The bill is called a ""fee and dividend"" proposal, which is somewhat similar to the ""cap and trade"" model that some Democrats have embraced but most Republicans have rejected.
\
Under the plan, first introduced by Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it would assess a fee on carbon-based fuel at the earliest point of production: either the well, mine or port of entry. The fee would be based on the number of tons of carbon emissions the fuel would generate.
\
The fee starts out small, then gradually rises each year, causing slow but predictable increases in the price of carbon-based energy. Theoretically, supporters say, that would send a signal to markets to invest in cleaner energy alternatives.
\
However, the tax would be revenue-neutral for the government because 100 percent of the money generated would be rebated to American households, helping them absorb the higher energy prices.
\
""There is quite a bit of motivation among conservatives (to come up with a solution) that is market-based,"" Pettengill said.
\
Pettengill said about 600 Citizen Climate Lobby activists took their message to Washington June 22-24, each meeting with his or her own local congressional delegation. Others from Lawrence who took part included Emily Reno, Frank Schwaller, Tony Schmidt, and Chris and Nona Golledge.
\
""Oh my gosh, this was an incredible year,"" Pettengill said. ""Quite a few members of Congress said they'd never seen anything like that from a volunteer organizaiton. This was my third year, and each year has gotten a more positive response than before.""
\
A single mother with a 19-year-old son who attends Kansas University, Pettengill said she took an unusual route to becoming an environmental lobbyist.
\
Pettengill grew up in Warrensburg, Mo., and attended Truman State University where she earned a degree in sociology with a minor in psychology. She worked as a fundraiser for various organizations most of her career and also earned income as a massage therapist.
\
But she said she became concerned about global warming after reading the book ""Storms of My Grandchildren,"" by James Hansen, the former director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The book is about the threats posed by global warming to people and continued life on Earth.
\
Pettengill said that's when she began doing volunteer work for the Citizens Climate Lobby, and it eventually turned into a regular paying job.
\
""When I found out about this work, I was a single mom at that time, kind of balancing three part-time jobs,"" she said. ""My first thought was there was just no way I had time to do this. Then as I thought about my son and what his generation faces, I just said I have to make the time. It's pretty important to me.""
\
The fee and dividend bill, S.332, was introduced in the Senate in February 2013. It was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works, where no further action has been taken.

TOPEKA -- After accomplishing little in recent years regarding energy conservation, lawmakers concerned about the state's growing energy consumption hope to pass new conservation policies this session.
\
Some legislators also hope to expedite alternative energy production, particularly from new wind farms.
\
The state remains far behind several other states pushing greater renewable energy -- biofuels, wind and solar -- and energy conservation. And, Kansas has done nothing to address what some see as a threat to climate change.
\
At least one western Kansas lawmaker says global warming should be a top state concern for both the economy and the environment.
\
To address it, Sen. Janis Lee, D-Kensington, believes regulation of carbon dioxide releases from major sources, such as power plants, is necessary.
\
Such regulation, which most expect will come at the federal level, could usher in a cap-and-trade system where carbon emissions would be capped and those who reduce it could earn credits.
\
""I'm looking forward to it, it presents opportunities for agriculture,"" Lee said.
\
She anticipates farmers in the future will earn income by selling credits for the carbon they've sequestered in their soils through no-till farming and other methods. Preventing carbon's release into the atmosphere is a step toward addressing climate change, which most scientists now attribute to man-made emissions.
\
Education for everyone
\
To reach a point where farms can benefit, Lee said, there has to be more education of the public and policymakers.
\
""It will take time for people to see how it can be a positive for Kansas overall,"" she said. ""Most people now recognize that global warming is an issue.""
\
Another lawmaker from the state's southwest, Rep. Carl Holmes, R-Liberal, House Utilities chairman, suggested carbon regulation should be left to Congress.
\
But when it comes to wind power, he's got a set of proposals he's shopping among legislative colleagues for the session, which starts Monday.
\
The bills would offer state-financed incentives for community-owned wind farms as well as those of private companies.
\
""It would put incentives in place for wind generation from community wind all the way up to large generators and for wind projects that would go in on industrial, agricultural or commercial activities,"" Holmes said.
\
Any type of production facility in a rural setting -- such as meat packing or ethanol plants -- could use the incentives to build a wind farm, according to Holmes' bills.
\
Nuclear incentives
\
He also is proposing a conservation effort for public buildings and new tax incentives to encourage more biofuels production and use of waste energy, leftovers from a power plant or other production facilities.
\
In addition, Holmes has an incentive proposal to prepare for the possible construction of a second nuclear power plant in Kansas. The Wolf Creek facility in Coffey County is the state's only reactor.
\
Holmes said he ""firmly believes"" Congress will regulate carbon emissions within three years. Kansas should be ready, he said, by building alternatives such as wind and nuclear generation.
\
In response to global warming, Holmes also is proposing a CO2 Reduction Act, which would allow property tax breaks for carbon sequestration from any man-made process.
\
Among other proposals in the upcoming Legislature, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius plans to push for conservation. Legislative passage would be a major step for a state that ranks near the bottom nationally in its efforts to curb energy use.
\
As for new power sources, both the Legislature and Kansas agricultural leaders have signed on to the national 25 x 25 initiative -- a pledge that 25 percent of the state's energy consumption will come from renewable energy by 2025.
\
Several states now require utilities to use at least some renewable energy.
\
""I don't know if we could get it through,"" said Rep. Annie Kuether, D-Topeka. ""I don't like mandates.""
\
As Rep. Tom Sloan, R-Lawrence, said at the close of last year's session, ""It takes two to three years to educate and build the case for policy changes and so we're looking at the '07 session to make significant inroads.""

U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback called for party unity while speaking at a Leavenworth County Republican Party barbecue Saturday in Tonganoxie.
\
Brownback, presently the lone candidate for governor in the 2010 race, noted that in the past 50 years, of 11 Kansas governors, six have been Democrats in a predominately red state.
\
""If Republicans are fighting, we can't win,"" Brownback said to more than 150 people at the event. ""If Republicans aren't fighting, we can't lose.""
\
Platform issues
\
Brownback, running unopposed after fellow Republican and current Secretary of State Ron Thornburgh recently dropped out, also voiced opposition to cap-and-trade legislation. As for energy policy, he said the environment was important, but should be met with ""innovation and investment"" and not taxation.
\
As for President Barack Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court, Brownback said he opposes Sotomayor because he thinks she legislates from the bench.
\
""If she wants to be a legislator, run for office,"" Brownback said.
\
Several Republican candidates joined Brownback at the function, including Todd Tiahrt, current U.S. representative who is running for Brownback's soon-to-be vacant Senate seat, and Kris Kobach and J.R. Claeys, who are running for secretary of state.
\
Kobach is a former Kansas Republican Party chairman, while Claeys is a Salina businessman. Claeys said he wants to ""cut red tape"" in Kansas if elected and outlined some of his principles: protecting the unborn, growing the number of jobs in the state and ""getting Kansas out of this (economic) slump.""
\
Kobach, noting he lived just 8 miles from Tonganoxie to the east, said he was running for secretary of state because he wanted to fight voter fraud. He spoke critically of ACORN, a grassroots community advocacy organization of low- and moderate-income people, and the election of Democrat Al Franken as U.S. senator from Minnesota. The Minnesota Supreme Court recently determined Franken the winner of a tightly contested November 2008 race against Republican incumbent Norm Coleman, a nearly eight-month saga complete with a recount.
\
Election identification
\
Kobach told the group he would fight for the requirement of providing proof of citizenship at election booths. He said photo identification is required when boarding a plane or buying certain spray paints and medication. He wants the same when trying to combat voter fraud.
\
A professor of law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kobach kept the mood light with a political joke. He asked what President Obama and God had in common, with the punchline being neither has a birth certificate.
\
The difference between the two? God only takes 10 percent of a person's income, Kobach joked.
\
Tiahrt told Republicans in Tonganoxie he would fight for Kansas jobs if elected to the U.S. Senate and spoke about working in Washington, D.C., or, as he called it, ""Disneyland East.""
\
Jerry Moran, Tiahrt's opponent in the 2010 Republican primary, could not attend because of a previous engagement, but a Moran staffer was at the event.
\
A handful of other legislators from Leavenworth County, as well as U.S. Rep. Lynn Jenkins, spoke to the crowd. Jenkins said she was a proud member of the party of ""no,"" adding she was saying no to ""bad legislation.""
\
She said the country's condition wasn't ideal when President Obama took office, adding ""I think Republicans spent too much"" also. But she's concerned about the direction the Obama administration and Democrat-controlled Congress has gone in the last six months, ""in charge of the whole kit and caboodle.""
\
Leavenworth County Republican chairman John Bradford said he was impressed with Saturday's turnout.
\
""I think it's fabulous,"" Bradford said. ""Beyond any of my expectations.""

Washington ? Most people don't remember Obamacare's notorious Section 1233, mandating government payments for end-of-life counseling. It aroused so much anxiety as a possible first slippery step on the road to state-mandated late-life rationing that the Senate never included it in the final health care law.
\
Well, it's back -- by administrative fiat. A month ago, Medicare issued a regulation providing for end-of-life counseling during annual ""wellness"" visits. It was all nicely buried amid the simultaneous release of hundreds of new Medicare rules.
\
Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., author of Section 1233, was delighted. ""Mr. Blumenauer's office celebrated 'a quiet victory,' but urged supporters not to crow about it,"" reports The New York Times. Deathly quiet. In early November, his office sent an e-mail plea to supporters: ""We would ask that you not broadcast this accomplishment out to any of your lists ... e-mails can too easily be forwarded."" They had been lucky that ""thus far, it seems that no press or blogs have discovered it. ... The longer this (regulation) goes unnoticed, the better our chances of keeping it.""
\
So much for Democratic transparency -- and for their repeated claim that the more people learn what is in the health care law, the more they will like it. Turns out ignorance is the Democrats' best hope.
\
And regulation is their perfect vehicle -- so much quieter than legislation. Consider two other regulatory usurpations in just the last few days:
\
On Dec. 23, the Interior Department issued Secretarial Order 3310 reversing a 2003 decision and giving itself the authority to designate public lands as ""Wild Lands."" A clever twofer: (1) a bureaucratic power grab -- for seven years up through Dec. 22, wilderness designation had been the exclusive province of Congress, and (2) a leftward lurch -- more land to be ""protected"" from such nefarious uses as domestic oil exploration in a country disastrously dependent on foreign sources.
\
The very same day, the president's Environmental Protection Agency declared that in 2011 it would begin drawing up anti-carbon regulations on oil refineries and power plants, another power grab effectively enacting what Congress had firmly rejected when presented as cap-and-trade legislation.
\
For an Obama bureaucrat, however, the will of Congress is a mere speed bump. Hence this regulatory trifecta, each one moving smartly left -- and nicely clarifying what the spirit of bipartisan compromise that President Obama heralded in his post-lame-duck Dec. 22 news conference was really about: a shift to the center for public consumption and political appearance only.
\
On that day, Obama finally embraced the tax-cut compromise he had initially excoriated, but only to avoid forfeiting its obvious political benefit -- its appeal to independent voters who demand bipartisanship and are the key to Obama's re-election. But make no mistake: Obama's initial excoriation in his angry Dec. 7 news conference was the authentic Obama. He hated the deal.
\
Now as always, Obama's heart lies left. For those fooled into thinking otherwise by the new Obama of Dec. 22, his administration's defiantly liberal regulatory moves -- on the environment, energy and health care -- should disabuse even the most beguiled.
\
These regulatory power plays make political sense. Because Obama needs to appear to reclaim the center, he will stage his more ideological fights in yawn-inducing regulatory hearings rather than in the dramatic spotlight of congressional debate. How better to impose a liberal agenda on a center-right nation than regulatory stealth?
\
It's Obama's only way forward during the next two years. He will never get past the half-Republican 112th what he could not get past the overwhelmingly Democratic 111th. He doesn't have the votes and he surely doesn't want the publicity. Hence the quiet resurrection, as it were, of end-of-life counseling.
\
Obama knows he has only so many years to change the country. In his first two, he achieved much: the first stimulus, Obamacare and financial regulation. For the next two, however, the Republican House will prevent any repetition of that. Obama's agenda will therefore have to be advanced by the more subterranean means of rule-by-regulation.
\
But this must simultaneously be mixed with ostentatious displays of legislative bipartisanship (e.g., the lame-duck tax-cut deal) in order to pull off the (apparent) centrist repositioning required for re-election. This, in turn, would grant Obama four more years when, freed from the need for pretense, he can reassert himself ideologically and complete the social-democratic transformation -- begun Jan. 20, 2009, derailed Nov. 2, 2010 -- that is the mission of his presidency.

26,"
The Douglas County Department of Enlightenment and Coercion paid me a visit the other day, along with the Lawrence Office of Environmental and Social Supervision. Also in attendance were representatives of the Free State Bureau of Restrictions and the Pioneer Office of Entitlements. I counted 42 cars and trucks, each driven by a single individual. (Separate vehicles give individuals quiet time to dream up new regulations and growth prevention initiatives, I learned.)
\
A forklift was required to unload Vision 5050, the manual which the county has compiled to determine its future for the next 3,000 years. The purpose of the visit was to designate ""viewsheds"" on my property. I was informed of this by Officer of Visions, Walter Utopia, whose degree in Apolcalyptic Ecology qualified him to identify natural beauty and to fine tune the interactions of human beings with the environment.
\
I observed that for every worker, there were three supervisors. The first thing they did was to go on break. Within moments, the hillside was filled with sonorous snores. An hour later, a bell tinkled and the crew went to work, some carrying stopwatches to time their movements. (Union rules require that they make no more than 15 movements in a 60 second period, including yawns, blinks and scratches.)
\
The workers peered through V's formed by their index and middle fingers, crying out, ""Viewshed!"" from time to time. After what seemed like an eternity, they had identified 17 vistas on my hilltop which qualified for protection. There was a small problem, Utopia said.
\
""Whereas, your house is blocking some of the views, it will have to be moved.""
\
""This all seems a bit subjective,"" I said.
\
""That's a demerit,"" Utopia barked.
\
""But...but,"" I sputtered.
\
""And that's another one,"" cried Utopia. Fifteen demerits would earn me a day in the pillory, where citizens would pelt me with rotten organic, locally grown, sustainable produce, he said.
\
""It may surprise you to learn that we know what's best for you,"" he said. ""People like you don't make our job any easier. By the way, the county's Happiness Index has shot up since we've taken charge of everyone's life. So shut up and don't ask questions.""
\
After the scenic view search, the workers confiscated my weed eater, chain saw and tiller.
\
""According to the provisions of the county's energy independence ordinance, use of the gasoline engine has been prohibited,"" Utopia declared. ""We must prepare right now for the day when the world runs out of oil. So get acquainted with your shovel and hoe. It will improve the air quality and your own health.""
\
Someone spotted the spray tank mounted on my four-wheeler. I was water-boarded on the spot and blurted out a confession: I had been spraying noxious weeds.
\
""But the county will fine me if I don't,"" I said.
\
""You can no longer spray without supervision and a license,"" he said. ""You might kill an endangered plant. And even noxious weeds are entitled to a humane and dignified death. The approved method is gentle removal from the soil by hand, along with a non-denominational funeral service."" Not a stone may be moved, nor a blade of grass disturbed without a hearing, a permit, a wildlife impact statement and a waiting period of 18 years, he said. I got another demerit for asking if ""wildlife"" included the feral cats that prey upon my songbirds and the carpenter bees that are turning my barn into sawdust.
\
Just then cries went up from within my house: ""Shame! Scandalous!"" Utopia's inspectors had opened my refrigerator. Out went the bacon, the cheesecake and the baby back ribs.
\
""Your meat eating days are over,"" said Utopia. ""No more high fructose corn syrup for you. You can subsist on nuts, roots and berries. Nightcrawlers and grasshoppers are a plentiful source of protein.""
\
Utopia wrote up his report. My infestation of thorny hedge trees had been designated a ""woodland."" A puddle of water had become a ""wetland."" Before parting, Utopia delivered a brief oration. Polluting industries were to be replaced with crafts such as knitting and wood carving. The demand for hunters and gatherers would reduce the ranks of the unemployed. To address over-population, the county was going to introduce a cap and trade program to discourage people from having babies. A new law would require lights out at sunset to conserve electricity.
\
""We must plan ahead for the day the sun burns out,"" Utopia said. ""And please stop referring to this piece of land as 'my' property,"" he said. He invited me to take the new oath of allegiance to the county. Then he ordered me to practice self-criticism and to report to the pillory the following day.

27,"Cheers for Wilson\Rep. Joe Wilson's intonation that President Obama lied about the specifications of his proposed health care bill was met with widespread consternation. Wilson was charged with violating the equally famous rules of ""civility."" As of this writing, the House of Representatives has issued a vote of disapproval in regards to Wilson's outburst.\Not since Sen. Joseph McCarthy indicted the Senate as the ""unwitting handmaidens of the Communist Party"" and elicited from his colleagues a vote of censorship, has anyone stirred up a controversy of equally cacophonous tremors.\Two questions arise. Was Obama lying? Was Wilson out of line? The answer to each is a resounding but qualified no.\The bill that Obama was attempting to elucidate does indeed preclude abortions and illegal alien recipients. One suspects the president, a lawyer by trade, will allow the courts to rectify these two issues and then give a speech about respecting the ""rule of law."" As for Wilson, he spoke in an older, pre-lawyerly manner, which does not render applause to lawyers for being able to deceive the public with sophisticated jargon.\First Amendment advocates should give three cheers to Wilson for illustrating that civility is the methodology utilized by the upper classes to control the lower.\There really are two Americas.\MATTHEW M. O'CONNELL,Topeka\Don't close KNI\As the guardian, advocate and friend of a young man who lives a healthy, happy life at Kansas Neurological Institute, I am alarmed that the Governor's Facilities Closure and Realignment Commission is considering closing the facility.\The commission's charge is to study and evaluate state facilities for possible closure, realignment or alternative uses. On Monday and Tuesday, the commission will meet in Topeka to discuss KNI and Parsons State Hospital and is expected to make at least preliminary recommendations about whether to propose closure of one or both. I encourage anyone who cares about the well-being of the special needs citizens of Topeka to make your concerns known.\The needs of people are not even close to being met, and we're considering closing a facility that provides critical services for the people who live there? We all know the budget situation, but do we really want to be a society that takes support from those who need it most? As the voice and advocate of one of the people for whom KNI is vital, I must answer no.\Caring for people with severe, handicapping conditions requires skilled, well-trained and caring staff members. I wish the dedicated employees of KNI received more compensation for what they do, but at least the pay, training and benefits allow KNI to maintain its excellent staff.\A society is judged by how it treats its weakest and most vulnerable members. Please add your voice to their silent ones and tell the Facilities Closure and Realignment Commission that Topeka does not want KNI closed.\ANN PERRIN RIGGS,Topeka\Teaching values\I recently opened my newspaper at 6:15 a.m. and was reading along as I was busy getting my four children ready for school and trying to meet all their varying needs. As I flipped through the paper, I was moved by a letter to the editor from Kelli Bodenheimer.\I would like to know if Bodenheimer has any children. Is she a parent? If so, does she include herself among the ""idiocy"" of parents? She said anyone who excluded their children from listening to President Obama was an idiot. Not only are we idiots, but we also are the parents of the children who do not hear at home that they are to pay attention to adults and try their hardest in school.\I did not listen to Obama's entire speech, but I was not offended by anything he said to the children. However, I am vastly offended by Bodenheimer's pompous, degrading and condescending remarks. I certainly hope she is not in a position to make decisions that will affect my children someday.\The rights that allowed me to have a voice in whether my children heard the speech are the same rights that allowed Bodenheimer to voice her opinion. I hope readers understand that there is at least one family in northeast Kansas who does teach their children morals and values and certainly doesn't rely on the same ""political"" teaching as Bodenheimer. That is, if she even has children.\HEIDI BAUMGARTNER,Burn\Energy solutions\Reports by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy demonstrate that if the current cap and trade bill were strengthened, we would see direct improvement in our economy and environment.\By 2030, Kansas alone would see thousands of jobs created and individual households would save money on energy bills. This type of energy savings would also help us reduce our dependency on coal plants, which are polluting our air and water and will become very costly with pending carbon regulations.\We will all benefit if Sens. Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts vote in favor of the American Clean Energy and Security Act. It is crucial that we look to the simple and obvious answers to solve our economic and environmental challenges.\Energy efficiency is the low-hanging fruit that will help reduce our carbon footprint while creating a prosperous economy.\GARY E. ANDERSON,Meriden\Smoke shocking\My wife and I spend a lot of time in various places and lots of restaurants and are shocked when we step into a restaurant that still allows smoke.\If we are someone's guests, we attempt to tolerate it. But it reminds us how backward the area is. Those who cry out that they have a right to smoke forget that the rest of us have the right to protect our health and our children's health.\JACK HELLER,Topeka"
28,"Fighting obesity\I'm writing in response to The Topeka Capital-Journal's Sept. 14 story on nutrition and area schools battling obesity.\The beverage industry understands that solving the obesity issue requires all of us -- schools, communities and businesses -- to work together. I would like to update you on how the beverage industry is working to make a contribution on this front, changing the beverage mix in schools in Kansas and across the country.\We, too, believe that childhood obesity is a serious problem. That is why we teamed with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation to develop national school beverage guidelines as part of a broader effort to teach kids about the importance of a balanced diet and exercise. The guidelines remove full-calorie sodas from all schools and provide more lower-calorie, nutritious and smaller-portion beverages. In two years of a three-year implementation, beverage calories available in schools have dropped by 58 percent and nearly 80 percent of schools under contract with bottlers are already in compliance.\Our industry is leading in schools by creating guidelines that strike the right balance, drawing the support of parents and health professionals.\This voluntary commitment by the beverage industry is well under way and having a meaningful impact in schools. For more information on the National School Beverage Guidelines, please visit: www.schoolbeverages.org\RON HEIN,executive director,Kansas Beverage Association\GOP in idle\When I was in high school years ago, I was taught by teachers Una Funk and Gwendolyn Pullins that there is more to life that the ABCs of the high school curriculum. So I became interested in politics.\I have seen 14 or 15 presidential speeches to joint sessions of Congress. They were all the same. Not in content, of course. But in regards to respect for the office of the presidency. What I saw recently sickened me. A Republican jumped to his feet and shouted, ""You lie."" And three or four other Republicans waved pieces of paper at the president while standing up?\It was disgraceful. It reminded me of the House of Commons in England. In the last election, this country got rid of a man who thought he was King George of England. Now, it seems that the current crop of Republicans want Congress to look like the British Parliament.\Also, the Republican members of the House and Senate -- who were sent to Washington, D.C., to do the will of their constituents -- did nothing on the subject of health care from 2000 to 2008. They knew there was a health care crisis, but chose to ignore it.\Now, a little more that eight months into Obama's presidency, a light bulb has been lit and all of a sudden they know everything that's bad.\It seems the GOP is waiting for Obama's plan to fail -- while they sit on their hands and submit no workable plan -- so the insurance companies, drug companies and big corporations can go back to the days of business as usual.\LARRY STECK,Council Grove\Abortion is cruel\Perhaps the animal rights group that declared an Iowa egg hatchery to be perhaps the ""cruelest industry"" in the world for disposing of live defective chicks in a grinder should arrange to transport the chicks to an abortion mill, where like millions of live humans in utero they could be burned to a crisp, sliced into pieces or have their brains suctioned out.\Indeed, there would be a ""choice"" along with the abortion zealots' reassurance that since a child in utero is but a mere blob of tissue, the chicks are merely a blob of feathers void of the ability to experience any pain.\Thus, set free from worry over the plight of the chicks, the group could enjoy their anti-meat meals while contemplating the necessity of getting a life.\JEANENE A. GILL,Topeka\Choosing leaders\We recently received a survey from one of the political parties. One of the questions was, ""What are the top three most pressing issues for you and your family in Shawnee County?""\The issues listed were: the economy and employment, family values, illegal immigration, judicial appointments, federal spending, education, national defense and homeland security, health care reform, social security, a cap and trade national energy tax and the environment.\Pick the top three, they asked.\Are they kidding? Is this a sick joke? These are all critical.\A survey like this says at least two very sobering things to us -- our nation has so many very serious things wrong that we can only hope to deal with three of them, and we have failed to select competent, wise, ethical and moral leaders.\And let us understand, these problems haven't exploded on us in the past few years. They have been coming on us for many years.\The survey also tells us at least one more thing. It says we must come out of our lethargy, wake up and do what we must to be informed and make wise and responsible decisions in who we choose to lead us from now on.\CHARLES AND RUJIRA RIGHTMEIER,Topeka\Polarizing talk\Glenn Beck is trying to rip our country apart by polarizing races, and we need him to stop.\How will this country heal from our bloody history and get over our racial fear and paranoia if Beck won't stop?\Let's heal our land and tell Glenn Beck to stop perpetuating hateful rhetoric that plays on Americans' fears. Let's use our collective voices to stop Beck.

\
Kansas is a pioneer on a number of fronts, including innovations and milestones in agriculture, aviation and civil rights. Unfortunately, our state will soon be recognized for a more dubious distinction if legislators in Topeka have their way: the first in the nation carbon tax.
\
Following the protracted battle that resulted in the denial of an air quality permit needed to build two electric utility plants in Holcomb, ""compromise"" legislation was quietly crafted and is now being fast tracked for consideration in the House and Senate this week. Upon careful review, however, the ""compromise"" at hand is actually our state's economic future and should be voted down accordingly.
\
The twin bills before the Kansas Legislature, HB 2711 and S515, would effectively impose a new, unprecedented carbon tax, as well as create a variety other harmful regulatory measures that pose enormous long-term economic implications. Gov. Kathleen Sebelius also opposes these proposals, but for all the wrong reasons. In short, she would like the tax to higher and the regulations left open to arbitrary decision making.
\
Rather than providing the needed flexibility of a market-based approach to address our current and future energy needs through a well-established, well-adhered to regulatory framework, the legislation, in addition to imposing a new tax, also places new unreasonable, statutory caps on carbon emissions. The absolute carbon emissions caps called for under these proposals add new regulatory obstacles that will only serve to increase energy bills for households, businesses and government.
\
Proponents of this legislative course believe that these bills will create greater regulatory certainty in our state. Yet the ""compromise"" now being debated simply replaces one set of weak regulations with new punitive ones that would leave open to question how committed our state is to attracting future capital investment.
\
Sunflower Electric followed the regulatory process in good faith and was denied a permit that it should have received. Following the arbitrary, politically motivated rejection of that permit, a concession prize has now been offered in its place, but with a host of new restrictions, regulations and taxes that will adversely impact our economy and our ability to produce needed energy for decades.
\
With the exception of government and cooperative energy providers who retire aging facilities, the legislative proposals prohibit new construction or expansion of merchant utilities from fossil fuels. As a result, free market competition to drive down future costs through more efficient technologies and plant operations would be effectively eliminated. The bills also subject Kansas taxpayers and businesses to preference categories for fuel sources, effectively picking winners and losers in the energy market.
\
Leaving room for regulatory uncertainties and political manipulation will simultaneously deter future inbound investments into the state while exporting in-state investments elsewhere. Such economic and regulatory environments are not just frowned upon by major employers and businesses who might wish to call Kansas home, they are universally avoided wherever possible. As a result, other states will likely seek to gain competitive advantages, offering incentives to businesses and investors accordingly.
\
The people of western Kansas and Sunflower Electric deserve better than what Gov. Sebelius' Administration gave them throughout this process, but everyone in our state deserves better than what is now being proposed in the legislature.
\
Our legislators would be wise to scrap the current proposals and craft new policies that would allow Sunflower to pursue its original plans, while avoiding such unprecedented taxes and undue regulatory requirements. Together, let's send a message that Kansas is open for business and welcomes new development.
\
We all share concerns over balancing our energy and environmental needs, but Kansas should not serve as a test case for public policies that are far outside the mainstream of public opinion and ignore economic realities.

30," By James Carlson\ THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\ Proponents of expanding a coal-fired power plant in southwest Kansas continued their testimony in the Statehouse on Tuesday, one day after three major banks announced more rigorous standards for financing coal-based energy.\ The Senate and House utilities committees heard the opinion of those who support a bill that would allow for the construction of two new units at a plant in Holcomb.\ Opponents of the expansion will have their chance to testify today and Thursday. Both committees plan to vote on the proposal on Friday.\ On Monday, Citigroup Inc., JP Morgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley announced they expected federal regulations on carbon emissions soon. The banks' new standards establish a process to include the impact of future regulations on the loan risk of building new coal-fired power plants.\ Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association Inc., of Westminster, Colo., says it has done the math on any carbon tax passed.\ ""It's certainly something we're aware of, and we account for the potential for regulations in our view towards the resources,"" said Lee Boughey, spokesman for Tri-State, one of the companies that would own the new plant expansion.\ But the Sierra Club says the price of the proposed units in Holcomb could shoot up if new federal legislation mandates caps or other restrictions on the carbon emitted by coal plants.\ ""The proposed energy bills in the state Legislature would not shield Sunflower from the pending congressional action on global warming predicted by the big banks,"" said Craig Volland, air- quality committee chairman for the Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club.\ Sen. Roger Reitz, R-Manhattan, left the Senate hearings on Tuesday expressing reservations about the carbon tax proposed under the bill. That provision would assess a $3 per ton carbon tax on new power generators that exceed limits on carbon emissions set in the bill.\ ""Three dollars is a pittance,"" Reitz said. ""I'm afraid they'll just pay the three bucks and move on.""\ Reitz said he has been told by Roger Rice, a soil specialist and professor at Kansas State University, that a roughly $30 per ton carbon tax is a more realistic deterrent.\ The Kansas Chamber of Commerce didn't even like the $3 tax.\ ""(The bill) would make Kansas the first state in the nation to adopt a carbon tax by statute instead of going through a well- established regulatory framework,"" said Amy Blankenbiller, president of the chamber.\ In October, Rod Bremby, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, denied an air-quality permit for the $3.5 billion addition at Holcomb, citing evidence of the environmental dangers posed by emitted carbon dioxide.\ The majority of the 1,400 megawatts of power produced by the two new units would be used by out-of-state customers of Tri-State and Golden Spread Electric Cooperative, of Amarillo, Texas. Sunflower would control 200 megawatts.\ The current legislation would allow Sunflower to build the two generators but would also enact the state's first rules on carbon dioxide emissions. It also sets energy-efficiency standards for new state and public school buildings and takes steps to encourage consumers to install and use their own solar-powered generating systems.\ James Carlson can be reached\ at (785) 233-7470\ or james.carlson@cjonline.com."
31," By James Carlson\ THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\ The House utilities committee on Tuesday followed its Senate counterpart by passing an energy bill allowing expansion of a coal- fired power plant in western Kansas but deleting all regulations of carbon dioxide pollution.\ The House differentiated its bill from the Senate version by requiring utilities to increase the percentage of energy coming from renewable sources in the coming years.\ Following four hours of debate on the bill and 28 proposed amendments, the House panel voted by voice to send the measure to the floor for consideration. The Senate energy committee on Monday passed a similar bill, and the full chamber is expected to debate the bill on the floor later this week.\ Because of a procedural move in committee, the Senate legislation, if passed on the floor, would go to the House for an up- or-down vote without possiblity of House floor amendments.\ Both chambers' versions strip the state's top environmental regulator of the power to regulate emissions beyond what the federal government already regulates.\ Rod Bremby, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, angered many in western Kansas when, in October, he denied the permit for the proposed addition to the Holcomb plant sought by Sunflower Electric Power Corp. Bremby, in making his decision, cited the dangers of CO2 gases, which many scientists believe are contributing to global warming.\ The 1,400 megawatts of power produced by the plant would mostly serve out-of-state customers, with Kansas receiving approximately 200 megawatts of the energy.\ The House Energy and Utilities Committee on Tuesday voted to reduce the percentage of the state's overall energy portfolio coming from coal-fueled power. The approved amendment would require utility companies to generate 10 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2010 and 25 percent by 2025.\ ""This would send a message that Kansas is forward-thinking and concerned about our rates not just tomorrow but 20 to 30 years from now,"" said Rep. Josh Svaty, D-Ellsworth, who offered the amendment.\ Public utility companies, under the proposal, would be eligible for a one-percent return on any investment made to comply with that standard. Critics said the return would end up in customers' bills.\ ""We just voted to allow higher energy rates in Kansas,"" said Rep. Peggy Mast, R-Emporia.\ Electric cooperatives and municipal utility companies wouldn't be eligible for the same one-percent return.\ The House committee, like the Senate panel, voted to remove the bill's limits on CO2 emissions and the accompanying so-called carbon tax for exceeding those limits. Legislators said regulations of CO2 pollution should come from the federal government so that all states are on equal footing in terms of drawing businesses.\ ""If we take the lead in Kansas then we've shut the door to huge amount of economic development in the state,"" said Rep. Forrest Knox, R-Altoona.\ There was a move to delete language that would implement net metering, or allowing customers to bank extra power generated by their personal solar systems. But Rep. Annie Kuether, D-Topeka, warned committee members against stripping the measure so bare it couldn't pass.\ ""If you're going to take this out as well as the carbon mitigation, you're just going to see some folks drop off of this,"" she said.\ Likewise, a carbon mitigation amendment offered later was supported by those who are seeking construction of the power plant.\ ""We need to get this passed, and to do that we need to bring along people who live east of Highway 81,"" Rep. Tom Moxley, R- Council Grove, said, alluding to the general divide between western residents who seek low-cost energy and those in eastern Kansas wary of the environmental effects of the proposed coal plant.\ In the Senate Utilities Committee on Tuesday, Bremby announced KDHE was compiling a catalog of all carbon dioxide pollution emitted in the state.\ He told committee members the report might be finished in two months.\ It would track emissions across all sectors of the state, including agriculture, industry and transportation. The information could be useful as the state decides how to proceed with power generation, he said.\ ""So, we'll know what we're dealing with,"" Bremby said.

He cited a danger of adding carbon dioxide to the air from burning more coal. It was the first time KDHE attempted to regulate CO2 as a pollutant.\ The coal-fired units at Holcomb would add 1,400 megawatts of capacity, but most of the power would be consumed outside Kansas by customers of Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association Inc. of Westminster, Colo., and Golden Spread Electric Cooperative, in Amarillo, Texas. Sunflower would control 200 megawatts.\ Gov. Kathleen Sebelius endorsed Bremby's decision and offered utility companies a compromise allowing construction of a single 700 megawatt unit if the carbon was sequestered in the ground. She said her alternative was rebuffed by Sunflower's executives who indicated interested in adding a third unit at the site.\ ""They say it's not enough,"" Sebelius said in an interview.\ Advocates of the bill return today in the House and Senate, while opponents get attention of the committees Wednesday and Thursday.

35," By James Carlson\ THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\ With charged debate but few substantive changes, a controversial energy bill received tentative approval Wednesday night from the Kansas Senate.\ The action is the first step of many to come on what one senator called the issue of the year.\ ""I know that each session we come here, we end up with the debate of the session,"" Sen. Phil Journey, R-Haysville, said in his remarks on the floor. ""One year it was the marriage amendment. I think this is our date today.""\ The Senate will take final action today.\ The bill would allow expansion of a coal-fired power plant in Holcomb and pits the energy and economic interests of western Kansas against people worried about the environmental impact of such a project.\ The House energy committee passed a similar measure this week, and on Wednesday Speaker Melvin Neufeld, R-Ingalls, said the House would work its version of the bill, not the Senate's.\ The proposal received four days of hearings in committees in both chambers of the Legislature after leadership put the measure on a fast track.\ Many in the Statehouse are still seething from the October decision by Rod Bremby, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, to deny an air-quality permit for the proposed 1,400-megawatt coal plant expansion sought by Sunflower Electric Power Corp. Bremby said it was in his capacity as the protector of state residents' health to reject the permit because of dangers posed by carbon dioxide pollution.\ Critics of the decision said the secretary didn't have the authority to deny the permit based on a greenhouse gas that the federal government doesn't regulate. The current bill would cement in statute that the head of KDHE can't limit emissions beyond what the federal government regulates.\ Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, on Wednesday attempted to remove that language from the bill, in part, because she said a lawsuit currently in the court system should give some guidance on whether Bremby's ruling was within his power.\ That elicited an outcry by one senator.\ ""We cannot let a bureaucrat override 166 people!"" said Sen. Jay Emler, R-Lindsborg, referring to the number of legislators in the Statehouse.\ Sen. John Vratil, R-Leawood, said Bremby's decision was arbitrary, not based on any regulation or law and suggested it was made based solely on Bremby's personal belief that carbon dioxide was harmful to the environment.\ ""That would be like the secretary of corrections releasing 1,000 felons because he thought they wouldn't be any risk to public safety,"" Vratil said.\ Francisco's amendment lost.\ The measure each chamber's committees first worked had provisions to limit CO2 emissions and would have enacted a so-called carbon tax for exceeding those limits.

36," By James Carlson\ THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\ With charged debate but few substantive changes, a controversial energy bill received tentative approval Wednesday night from the Kansas Senate.\ The action is the first step of many to come on what one senator called the issue of the year.\ ""I know that each session we come here, we end up with the debate of the session,"" Sen. Phil Journey, R-Haysville, said in his remarks on the floor. ""One year it was the marriage amendment. I think this is our date today.""\ The Senate will take final action today.\ The bill would allow expansion of a coal-fired power plant in Holcomb and pits the energy and economic interests of western Kansas against people worried about the environmental impact of such a project.\ The House energy committee passed a similar measure this week, and on Wednesday Speaker Melvin Neufeld, R-Ingalls, said the House would work its version of the bill, not the Senate's.\ The proposal received four days of hearings in committees in both chambers of the Legislature after leadership put the measure on a fast track.\ Many in the Statehouse are still seething from the October decision by Rod Bremby, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, to deny an air-quality permit for the proposed 1,400-megawatt coal plant expansion sought by Sunflower Electric Power Corp. Bremby said it was in his capacity as the protector of state residents' health to reject the permit because of dangers posed by carbon dioxide pollution.\ Critics of the decision said the secretary didn't have the authority to deny the permit based on a greenhouse gas that the federal government doesn't regulate. The current bill would cement in statute that the head of KDHE can't limit emissions beyond what the federal government regulates.\ Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, on Wednesday attempted to remove that language from the bill, in part, because she said a lawsuit currently in the court system should give some guidance on whether Bremby's ruling was within his power.\ That elicited an outcry by one senator.\ ""We cannot let a bureaucrat override 166 people!"" said Sen. Jay Emler, R-Lindsborg, referring to the number of legislators in the Statehouse.\ Sen. John Vratil, R-Leawood, said Bremby's decision was arbitrary, not based on any regulation or law and suggested it was made based solely on Bremby's personal belief that carbon dioxide was harmful to the environment.\ ""That would be like the secretary of corrections releasing 1,000 felons because he thought they wouldn't be any risk to public safety,"" Vratil said.\ Francisco's amendment lost.\ The measure each chamber's committees first worked had provisions to limit CO2 emissions and would have enacted a so-called carbon tax for exceeding those limits. The bill also had increased energy- efficiency standards for new school buildings.\ But all of those items were removed in committee. On Wednesday, Sen. Chris Steineger, D-Kansas City, attempted to put back in the CO2 limits and carbon tax.\ ""CO2 is proven harmful to our health in a macrobiological way,"" he said.

39,"Rep. Dennis Hedke, the chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee, left this past weekend's American Legislative Exchange Council conference in Chicago with new ideas and new data to show his legislative colleagues. \Hedke, R-Wichita, said he sat on a task force that examined energy, environment and agriculture issues during the ALEC conference, the first he has attended. \""I was very impressed by the broad range of contents we deliberated,"" Hedke said via email. ""I would certainly say that the overall group was very diverse, with a great number of states represented, expertise appearing in panels, and other very valuable metrics."" \ALEC brings together lawmakers and corporate lobbyists who sit on task forces and subcommittees and craft ""model bills"" that then can be introduced in statehouses across the country. That process isn't open to the media. \Legislation that closely resembled model bills in areas like union rights, environmental protection and public education was introduced in the Kansas Legislature last year. Some bills, like one restricting public employee paycheck deductions for political activities and another repealing local ""prevailing wage"" ordinances, passed. \Others, like several school choice initiatives and bills to rollback renewable energy standards, sputtered. \Hedke said his ALEC task force discussed two new approaches to state renewable portfolio standards, or RPS. They were called the ""Market-Power Renewables Act"" and the ""Renewable Energy Credit Act."" The first model bill would allow consumers to choose whether they wanted to purchase electricity from renewable sources from their utilities. Both would remove the state mandates that require utilities to get a certain percentage of their energy from renewables. \""Careful study of these models may result in the development of legislation that can bring benefit to Kansas consumers, while encouraging stability in our total energy consumptive mix,"" Hedke said. \Hedke said his committee also discussed a ""Resolution in Opposition to a Carbon Tax"" that he ""strongly supported, and which passed by a wide margin."" \The European Union, the Netherlands and Australia have adopted such ""cap-and-trade"" regulations that penalize carbon emissions that have been linked to global climate change. \But Hedke, who has said he is unconvinced by the evidence for such a link, said ""such a tax would have an immediate and dramatic effect on gasoline and other transportation fuels in America, immediate and substantial increases on electricity costs and would put our country at a competitive disadvantage."" \Hedke, a contract geophysicist who has worked for oil and gas companies, was one of 11 Republican legislators who used state dollars to pay their $475 ALEC conference registration fee in advance. They included six senators: Garrett Love, of Montezuma; Terry Bruce, of Hutchinson; Jeff King, of Independence; Julia Lynn, of Olathe; Mary Pilcher-Cook, of Shawnee; and Jim Denning, of Overland Park. \House Republicans requesting the subsidy in advance were Hedke, Rob Bruchman and Marvin Kleeb, of Overland Park; Kevin Jones, of Wellsville; and Ron Ryckman Sr., of Meade. \Other legislators paid their own registration fee to attend and may choose to be reimbursed at any time during the fiscal year that ends July 2014. \House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, and Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, are on ALEC's national board of directors. \A keynote address by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was one of the few portions of the conference made public this year. \Bush stumped for more ""school-choice"" initiatives like public charter schools, private school vouchers and online education. \Bush also expressed support for the Common Core K-12 education standards, which came under fire from a group of Kansas conservatives last year, causing the Legislature to take up a bill to freeze funding for the initiative that was narrowly defeated in the closing hours of the session. \Other speakers at the Chicago conference included Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and Arthur Laffer, the economist hired to mastermind Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback's income tax cuts. \Last weekend's gathering was ALEC's 40th annual meeting. The group's profile and detractors have grown in recent years, following Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's bitter battle with unions and the proliferation of ""Stand Your Ground"" gun laws based on ALEC's ""Castle Doctrine Act."" \Thousands of protesters were reportedly in the streets surrounding the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago where the conference was held. \Sen. Jeff Melcher, R-Leawood, told a Chicago CBS affiliate that they were demonstrating against their own interests by opposing ALEC's free-market principles in favor of ""big government."" \""Historically it's shown to work to their detriment,"" Melcher said. ""Whenever we free up the marketplace, the market seems to settle a lot of problems on its own.""\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
40,"
Topeka - Developers of the proposed coal-burning power plants in southwest Kansas said Tuesday that if the Legislature doesn't approve the project by June 1, it may not go forward.
\
""In dealing with a lot of people in the project, we have said that we think June 1 is a time when we should take a deep breath, look at the project and see what viability it still has,"" said Earl Watkins Jr., president and chief executive officer of Sunflower Electric Power Corp.
\
But Stephanie Cole, a spokeswoman for the Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club, said Watkins was trying to rush the process, which was happening nationwide on proposed coal-burning plants.
\
""There are desperate attempts to build coal plants because of a looming federal carbon tax and increasing public awareness of the dangers of coal plants,"" Cole said.
\
Watkins' comments came after the House voted 77-45 for a bill allowing construction of the two 700-megawatt, $3.6 billion plants near Holcomb.
\
The measure failed to get the two-thirds support - 84 votes in the 125-member House - it would need to override a veto from Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
\
Last year, Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Roderick Bremby denied permits for the plants because of the project's 11 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year and effect on global warming.
\
Sebelius and environmental groups across the nation supported Bremby, and now Sunflower Electric is trying to get the Legislature to overturn the decision.
\
Sebelius has offered to support construction of one plant, but Sunflower Electric and its partners have said both plants are necessary.
\
Approximately 85 percent of the project's output would supply electric needs in Colorado.
\
Brian Moline, chairman of the Alliance for Sound Energy, a coalition supporting the plants, said if Kansas turns down the project, it will be built in Colorado, and Kansas will lose all the construction jobs and accompanying economic development.
\
Under the proposal, Colorado-based Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association would own one 700-megawatt unit, while Sunflower Electric, Tri-State and Texas-based Golden Spread Electric Cooperative would own the other 700-megawatt unit. Sunflower Electric would run the units near its existing facility near Holcomb.
\
Watkins noted that Tri-State has purchased property and waters rights near Holly, Colo., for possible development of coal-burning plants there.
\
He said if Kansas rejects the Holcomb expansion, ""They (Tri-State) intend certainly to move ahead on their own if they're unable to move here.""
\
And, he said, Sunflower Electric also has looked at the possibility of participating with Tri-State in plants in Colorado.
\
""They're looking at alternatives, just as we're looking at alternatives in case we can't move forward at the Holcomb site,"" he said.
\
But Cole, with the Sierra Club, said she doubted Colorado officials would approve coal-fired plants.
\
The bill approved by the House also includes a mandate that utilities generate 5 percent of their electricity by 2012 from renewable resources such as wind. A Senate-approved bill contains no such provision. Both measures are expected to be reviewed in a conference committee.
\
Views on the bill
\
Here are statements representing opposing sides on the bill that will allow the construction of two 700-megawatt coal-fired power plants near Holcomb. The measure was approved by the House, 77-45
\
For the bill
\
State Rep. Bill Otto, R-Leroy
\
""I was raised with democratic values to stand up for the working people and to not export their jobs to India and China. To protect the poor and not raise their electric rates so high they cannot pay them. To care more about the people than care about the big gas companies who want to build more gas-powered electric plants to back up the wind power that will never do the job. To stand for the rule of law and not for the rule of bureaucrats, I still have my democratic values, so I vote yes on this energy bill.""
\
House Speaker Melvin Neufeld, R-Ingalls, joined by others:
\
""(The legislation) will stabilize the regulatory uncertainty currently pervasive in our great state. Regulatory uncertainty has already cost Kansas millions in new development. Producers have chosen to establish their operations in more business friendly climates. Surrounding states understand this vulnerability and are actively pursuing those currently planning to build and produce in Kansas. The state is now in jeopardy of losing literally billions of dollars in future development unless a reasonable and consistent policy is established. This bill does just that. For this reason, we vote yes.""
\
Against the bill
\
State Rep. Annie Kuether, D-Topeka:
\
""I represent a district that is interested in renewables, real net metering for solar and wind, and the original bill also banned merchant plants and had a carbon tax that made mitigation real.
\
I am not ready to let Washington decide our energy policy. I'm here to continue the discussion and look forward to continuing the debate. I vote no.""
\
State Rep. Paul Davis, D-Lawrence, and joined by others:
\
""For the past five years, KDHE has issued 1,883 permits for construction and 919 permits for operation for a variety of facilities that require regulatory oversight. Thirty-eight operating permits and 69 construction permits have been issued since the Holcomb denial. The reality is that the denial of the Holcomb application for a huge new coal project with significant health and environment impact on Kansas is the exception and not the rule. Holcomb is the only permit denial issued in the last five years by KDHE. The claim of regulatory uncertainty does not ring true.""
\
State Rep. Tom Sloan, R-Lawrence.
\
"" ... In committee, I successfully offered an amendment to create the Kansas Energy Science and Technology Commission to review available medical and scientific data on the impact of smokestack emissions and examine the technological capability to reduce those emissions cost-effectively. The commission would further provide scientific - not political - recommendations to the governor and the Legislature on what mix of fuel sources, including conservation, is best for Kansas so we can develop a comprehensive long-term energy policy. Because the Committee of the Whole removed the Kansas Energy Science and Technology Commission from the bill, I vote no ...""

43,"ENVIRONMENT \Climate changing \We reached a tragic milestone in May. Carbon dioxide levels hit 400 parts per million in our atmosphere, according to the May 9 issue of Scientific American. For hundreds of thousands of years, CO2 levels had not risen above 300 ppm. The last time CO2 was at 400 ppm was about 3 million years ago, before humans existed, and sea levels were much higher than today. \While already dangerously high, we can expect CO2 levels to continue rising from two to three ppm each year on our current course. The 350 ppm level, which a number of scientists regard as the safe limit, is growing smaller in our rear-view mirror. \We know higher carbon dioxide levels result in higher temperatures and, not surprisingly, our global average temperature rose by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century. If we do nothing to reduce carbon emissions, scientists predict global temperatures will increase by 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. \A recent survey of more than 12,000 peer-reviewed articles on climate change (published in the journal Environmental Research Letters) found this consensus among climate scientists: 97 percent agree global warming is happening because of human activities. \This does not have to be our future. We can take action to preserve a livable world. One solution, championed by Republican and former Secretary of State George Shultz, is a revenue-neutral carbon tax.

44,"
TOPEKA - (AP) - A bill allowing two coal-fired power plants in southwest Kansas easily won House approval Tuesday, but supporters still were searching for the votes they need to make sure it can survive a potential veto by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
\
The vote was 77-45.
\
Supporters want legislation that can pass with a two-thirds majority, or 84 of 125 votes, which is what they would need to override a veto. But they were seven votes short, with three House members not voting.
\
The bill's backers will get at least one more chance, however. The Senate approved its own measure last week, and three senators and three House members must draft a final, compromise version for both chambers to consider.
\
Sebelius' administration is blocking plans by Sunflower Electric Power Corp. to build the two plants outside Holcomb, in Finney County. The $3.6 billion project has bipartisan legislative support, and both chambers' bills would allow the Hays-based utility to move ahead.
\
The House bill includes ""green"" provisions, such as a mandate that utilities generate 5 percent of their electricity by 2012 from renewable resources such as wind. Such provisions are designed to pick up votes from House members who worry that carbon dioxide emissions from new coal-fired plants would contribute to global warming.
\
The House debated the bill for three hours Monday before giving it first-round approval on a 73-45 vote. They picked up four votes overnight, but seven members had failed to vote Monday.
\
House Speaker Melvin Neufeld, an Ingalls Republican who supports Sunflower's project, said Monday that he is confident House and Senate negotiators can draft something that will get a two-thirds majority, but he didn't speculate on its contents.
\
""The speaker's going to have to do a little trading,"" said Rep. Bill Light, a Republican from Rolla who also supports Sunflower's project.
\
Sunflower and labor unions, which support the project because of its potential construction jobs, continued to lobby Monday for the bill. Earl Watkins, Sunflower's chief executive officer, said: ""We're very encouraged with where we are.""
\
Neufeld and other supporters describe the measure as comprehensive energy policy. It includes provisions designed to encourage consumers to use small, solar-powered systems to generate their own electricity. There's also the renewable-resources mandate for utilities.
\
But the bill's critics still argued that its only real purpose was to see that Sunflower builds its plants.
\
Rep. Joshua Svaty, an Ellsworth Democrat, said legislators eventually must lessen the state's heavy reliance on coal-fired plants, which provide about 75 percent of Kansas' electricity.
\
""There's a lot said at the end of this debate about how this is a forward-thinking energy policy for the state, and I'm trying to find it in the bill,"" Svaty said.
\
In a statement, Sebelius said: ""Unfortunately, it looks like the final House version has less encouragement for either wind energy or carbon mitigation and further restricts the ability of the secretary of health and environment to protect the environment or the health of Kansans.""
\
Both the House and the Senate bills would prevent the secretary, the state's top environmental regulator, from imposing new emissions standards without legislative approval.
\
In October, Secretary Rod Bremby denied an air-quality permit for Sunflower's project, noting that state law gives a secretary the power to protect the environment and saying the state can't ignore the dangers of global warming.
\
Many legislators believe Bremby exceeded his authority. Also, he denied the permit after his staff said Sunflower's application met the technical requirements of state and federal air-quality laws.
\
The House Energy and Utilities Committee originally opted for softer restrictions on the secretary's power. But the House voted 72-47 to make them tougher.
\
""Sunflower went through all the hoops and the hurdles up to the very last one, and then the rules got changed,"" said committee chairman Carl Dean Holmes, a Republican from Liberal.
\
Views on the bill
\
Here are statements representing opposing sides on the bill that will allow the construction of two 700-megawatt coal-fired power plants near Holcomb. The measure was approved by the House, 77-45
\
For the bill
\
State Rep. Bill Otto, R-Leroy
\
""I was raised with democratic values to stand up for the working people and to not export their jobs to India and China. To protect the poor and not raise their electric rates so high they cannot pay them. To care more about the people than care about the big gas companies who want to build more gas-powered electric plants to back up the wind power that will never do the job. To stand for the rule of law and not for the rule of bureaucrats, I still have my democratic values, so I vote yes on this energy bill.""
\
House Speaker Melvin Neufeld, R-Ingalls, joined by others:
\
""(The legislation) will stabilize the regulatory uncertainty currently pervasive in our great state. Regulatory uncertainty has already cost Kansas millions in new development. Producers have chosen to establish their operations in more business friendly climates. Surrounding states understand this vulnerability and are actively pursuing those currently planning to build and produce in Kansas. The state is now in jeopardy of losing literally billions of dollars in future development unless a reasonable and consistent policy is established. This bill does just that. For this reason, we vote yes.""
\
Against the bill
\
State Rep. Annie Kuether, D-Topeka:
\
""I represent a district that is interested in renewables, real net metering for solar and wind, and the original bill also banned merchant plants and had a carbon tax that made mitigation real.
\
I am not ready to let Washington decide our energy policy. I'm here to continue the discussion and look forward to continuing the debate. I vote no.""
\
State Rep. Paul Davis, D-Lawrence, and joined by others:
\
""For the past five years, KDHE has issued 1,883 permits for construction and 919 permits for operation for a variety of facilities that require regulatory oversight. Thirty-eight operating permits and 69 construction permits have been issued since the Holcomb denial. The reality is that the denial of the Holcomb application for a huge new coal project with significant health and environment impact on Kansas is the exception and not the rule. Holcomb is the only permit denial issued in the last five years by KDHE. The claim of regulatory uncertainty does not ring true.""
\
State Rep. Tom Sloan, R-Lawrence.
\
"" ... In committee, I successfully offered an amendment to create the Kansas Energy Science and Technology Commission to review available medical and scientific data on the impact of smokestack emissions and examine the technological capability to reduce those emissions cost-effectively. The commission would further provide scientific - not political - recommendations to the governor and the Legislature on what mix of fuel sources, including conservation, is best for Kansas so we can develop a comprehensive long-term energy policy. Because the Committee of the Whole removed the Kansas Energy Science and Technology Commission from the bill, I vote no ...""

There is only one meaningful response to the horrific oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and that is for America to stop messing around when it comes to designing its energy and environmental future. The only meaningful response to this man-made disaster is a man-made energy bill that would finally put in place an American clean-energy infrastructure that would set our country on a real, long-term path to ending our addiction to oil.
\
That is so obviously the right thing for our environment, the right thing for our national security, the right thing for our economic security and the right thing to promote innovation. But it means that we have to stop messing around with idiotic ""Drill, baby, drill"" nostrums, feel-good Earth Day concerts and the paralyzing notion that the American people are not prepared to do anything serious to change our energy mix.
\
This oil spill is to the environment what the subprime mortgage mess was to the markets - both a wake-up call and an opportunity to galvanize a constituency for radical change that overcomes the powerful lobbies and vested interests that want to keep us addicted to oil.
\
If President Obama wants to seize this moment, it is there for the taking. We have one of the worst environmental disasters in American history on our hands. We have a public deeply troubled by what they've seen already - and they've probably seen only the first reel of this gulf horror show. And we have a bipartisan climate/energy/jobs bill ready to be introduced in the Senate - produced by Sens. John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham - that would set a price on carbon and begin to shift us to a system of cleaner fuels and greater energy efficiency, and unlock an avalanche of private capital to the clean energy market.
\
American industry is ready to act and is basically saying to Washington: ""Every major country in the world, starting with China, is putting in clear, long-term market rules to stimulate clean energy - except America. Just give us some clear rules, and we'll do the rest.""
\
The Kerry-Lieberman-Graham bill is an important step in that direction. It is far from perfect. It includes support for more off-shore drilling, nuclear power and concessions to coal companies. In light of the spill, we need to make this bill better. At a minimum, we need much tighter safeguards on off-shore drilling. There is going to be a lot of pressure to go even further, but we need to remember that even if we halted all off-shore drilling, all we would be doing is moving the production to other areas outside the U.S., probably with even weaker environmental laws.
\
Somehow a compromise has to be found to move forward on this bill - or one like it. But even before the gulf oil spill, this bill was in limbo because the White House and Senate Democrats broke a promise to Graham, the lone Republican supporting this effort, not to introduce a controversial immigration bill before energy. At the same time, Obama has kept his support low-key, fearing that if he loudly endorses a price on carbon, Republicans will be screaming ""carbon tax"" and ""gasoline tax"" in the 2010 midterm elections.
\
Bottom line: This bill has no chance to pass unless Obama gets behind it with all his power, mobilizes the public and rounds up the votes. He has to lead from the front, not the rear. Responding to this oil spill could well become the most important leadership test of the Obama presidency. The president has always had the right instincts on energy, but he is going to have to decide just how much he wants to rise to this occasion - whether to generate just an emergency response that over months ends the spill or a systemic response that over time ends our addiction. Needless to say, it would be a lot easier for the president to lead if more than one Republican in the Senate was ready to lift a finger to help him.
\
Our dependence on crude oil is not just a national-security or climate problem. Some 40 percent of America's fish catch comes out of the gulf, whose states also depend heavily on coastal tourism. In addition, the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast are part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge. It was created by Teddy Roosevelt and is one of our richest cornucopias of biodiversity.
\
As the energy consultant David Rothkopf likes to say, sometimes a problem reaches a point of acuity where there are just two choices left: bold action or permanent crisis. This is such a moment for our energy system and environment.
\
If we settle for just an incremental response to this crisis - a ""Hey, that's our democracy. What more can you expect?"" - we'll be sorry. You can't fool Mother Nature. She knows when we're just messing around. Mother Nature operates by her own iron laws. And if we violate them, there is no lobby or big donor to get us off the hook. No, what's gone will be gone. What's ruined will be ruined. What's extinct will be extinct - and later, when we're finally ready to stop messing around, it will be too late.

50,"CLIMATE CHANGE\No debate\It's time to accept the science regarding climate change. It's happening, and humans are the cause.\Some people are still debating whether we made it to the moon and whether the earth is flat. But these are not reasonable, informed discussions. The debate regarding climate change is similarly absurd.\Jim Powell, who was a member of the National Science Board for 12 years (first appointed by President Reagan and reappointed by President George H.W. Bush), conducted a search of peer-reviewed articles published between 1991 and 2012. Of the 33,690 authors who contributed to these articles, only 34 ""clearly reject global warming or endorse a cause other than CO2 emissions for observed warming.""\Why do a few, noisy individuals continue to reject the science of climate change? Perhaps it's because they feel there's no solution, and it's too overwhelming to consider.\Well, good news, there's a simple solution that effectively addresses climate change -- a revenue-neutral carbon tax. This is a market-based solution that would drive the economy to renewables, create new jobs, and protect the poor and middle class by returning all collected revenue to Americans on an equitable basis. Learn more at citizensclimatelobby.org.\As we celebrate Earth Day 2013, it's time to end the debate about climate change. The world is round, we made it to the moon, climate change is real and humans are to blame. Humans also have the capability to remedy the situation. Let's go for it.\LYNATE PETTENGILL, Lawrence\HIGHER EDUCATION\Support med school\Many of you may be aware of the recent budget cuts the Kansas Senate and House have proposed for higher education in Kansas. In light of the projected budget cuts, the administration at The University of Kansas has proposed closing our campus in Salina. This would be a huge loss to the state.\KU School of Medicine-Salina is committed to producing quality physicians who will return to rural Kansas. Ten of the 16 current students here are contractually committed to returning to rural Kansas, and three other students have verbal agreements to do so.\It has been proven that physicians will practice in environments similar to where they were trained. KU School of Medicine-Salina trains physicians in small town Kansas. To say we are concerned about losing our school is an understatement.\We are imploring Kansans to support preserving the Salina branch of the KU School of Medicine. Contact your members of Congress and let them know how important the Salina campus is to the state of Kansas.\JULIANNE RATHBUN, Salina\student, Salina campus\KU School of Medicine\GUN CONTROL\Confuse the issue\I congratulate Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., on having the courage to explain publicly recently why his was a no vote on legislation concerning the gun control issue.\However, his explanation as reported in The Topeka Capital-Journal paper did not make it clear why Roberts thinks extending background checks to online sales would infringe on anyone's Second Amendment rights. Instead, Roberts tried to confuse the issue by suggesting another approach, which he may think will not pass either, giving him an out on the issue.\DOROTHY HANGER, Topeka"

To the editor:
\
Calls for a ""carbon tax"" are misguided. If the goal is to reduce ""carbon footprints,"" then all products must be included. ""Green energy"" is not very green when the purchase/installation costs are barely paid for before expensive repair/replacement is needed. Manufacturing ""green"" products creates a carbon footprint that vastly outweighs the product's carbon benefit.
\
Driven by ethanol mandates, marginal ground has been carved up to produce corn, increasing water pollution and destroying conservation habitat. Ethanol will only be slightly better than using gasoline in 2022, but the trade-offs in fertilizer use and fuel consumption will take 48 years to reach the break-even point in greenhouse gas emissions. Production of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars is not environmentally friendly. Factoring in the carbon cost of transmission facilities and production, ""green energy"" is not green at all. How do those costs in terms of carbon footprint stack up against coal, natural gas or petroleum?
\
And it's been given special dispensation to damage and destroy the environment. Solar farms damage bird populations, and wind farms kill a good number of raptors with immunity. Where is the outcry from environmentalists? Silence. If an oil/gas company were causing the damage ""the hue and cry"" would be deafening. Just look at the Keystone Pipeline.
\
I, personal, like wind, solar and small-scale hydro, but I'm honest with myself about their real cost. How about the whole truth for once?

52," By James Carlson\ THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\ A bill that would allow the expansion of a coal-fired power plant in southwest Kansas is moving through the Senate Energy Committee so quickly that it is hindering full understanding of the legislation, a critic of the project said Wednesday.\ Responding to a question about the measure, David Springe, an attorney with the Citizens Utility Ratepayer Board, said he wasn't sure about the bill's specifics.\ ""I would assume before you would make judgment on the project or on the bill that you would have done an in-depth study,"" said Sen. Janis Lee, D-Kensington, who helped craft the bill.\ ""Well, if I had enough time to do an in-depth study, I would,"" Springe said.\ Lee responded later, ""If you're an energy company that has no baseload (energy) after 2012, how fast would you want to find a solution?""\ ""I would assume rapidly,"" Springe said. ""But perhaps not by next week.""\ The 28-page bill was introduced in both chambers of the Legislature last Thursday, and hearings began simultaneously in the Senate and House energy committees on Monday.\ Sen.

54,"A majority of Kansans believe Earth's climate is changing, but far fewer are sure humans are to blame -- or that scientists are in agreement about what is causing the change. \Yale University recently released a map of how Americans answered questions about their opinions on climate change, with responses broken down by state, Congressional district and county. Majorities of residents in all four Kansas districts said they agreed climate change is happening, though the number that agreed with that statement ranged from 52 percent in the western First District to 65 percent in the Third District, which only covers the Kansas City metropolitan area. In the Second District, which covers Topeka, 62 percent of residents said they thought climate change was happening. \A Kansas State University survey and discussion event in June 2013 found 77 percent of those polled were ""extremely sure"" or ""very sure"" climate change is happening. The data have some limitations, however, because of the small sample and the people surveyed were younger and more educated than the state average -- both characteristics associated with increased concern about climate change. \The Yale data was based on its own national survey and third-party surveys, and spokeswoman Bessie Schwarz said the researchers used the demographics of different areas to extrapolate. It does have a seven-point margin of error, however, which would be enough to change people who believed in climate change from a majority to a minority in the First District -- or to make them a more substantial majority. \Kansas already has warmed, with average winter temperatures rising 2.0 degrees from 1895 to 2009, according to the High Plains Regional Climate Center. Spring and summer temperatures rose more gradually, and autumn temperatures actually declined by 0.2 degrees. \Kansans were less sure climate change is caused ""mostly"" by human activities, according to the Yale maps. About 46 percent of residents in the Second District thought so, and the other districts had similar results, ranging from 42 to 48 percent. \Only one-third of the people in the Second District said they thought ""most scientists think global warming is happening,"" despite the fact that a larger percentage said they believe it themselves. About 97 percent of climate scientists believe that climate change is likely due to human activities, according to the National Academy of Sciences, and some others believe the climate is changing, but blame natural factors. \Most Kansans also didn't appear very worried about climate change, according to the Yale maps. In the Third District, 52 percent of people said they were worried, but that dropped to 49 percent in the Second District and 44 percent in the First District. Concerns increased, however, when it came to future generations. About 60 percent of people in the Second District thought future generations would be harmed, as did 65 percent of people in the Third District and 52 percent of people in the First. \Despite some skepticism about climate science, more than 70 percent of people in all four districts said they support funding research on renewable energy, two-thirds or more said they supported regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant and more than half said they supported ""strict"" limits on carbon emissions from existing coal-fired plants. More than half also said they support requiring utilities to produce at least 20 percent of power from renewable sources -- which Kansas already does. \The majority said they wouldn't support a carbon tax, however, even if some was refunded to each American household. \To view the maps, visit environment.yale.edu/poe/v2014.\Credit: Megan Hart megan.hart@cjonline.com"

\
Salina's legislators dug in their heels Saturday morning, reiterating their support for the energy bill vetoed Friday by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
\
""We have to guarantee that when you flip the switch, the light will come on,"" said Sen. Pete Brungardt.
\
The question of whether Kansas faces an electricity shortage -- less than 15 percent of the power from the proposed coal-fired plant in Holcomb would be for Kansas customers -- wasn't explored.
\
Brungardt and Reps. Charlie Roth, R-Salina, Deena Horst, R-Salina, and Josh Svaty, D-Ellsworth, were at a legislative forum organized by the Salina Area Chamber of Commerce.
\
Most of the questions from the audience focused on SB 327, which would have overturned the state's refusal to issue air quality permits for a pair of 700 megawatt coal plants and would restrict authority of the Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
\
Brungardt, Horst and Roth voted in favor of the bill; Svaty opposed it. Three said Saturday they would vote the same way if there is an attempt to override the governor's veto; Horst said she probably would, as much as she dislikes overriding a governor's veto.
\
She explained that most of the state's power plants are in eastern Kansas; currently, there is only one -- at Holcomb -- west of Salina. Western Kansans should be allowed to build plants, too, she said.
\
""It's a fairness issue to me,"" she said.
\
Svaty said it appears a re-vote won't happen.
\
""The rumor is there is a second bill being worked on and an override won't be attempted,"" he said.
\
He pointed out that the cost of building new coal plants has been skyrocketing, and the cost of coal itself has been rising sharply.
\
And then there's the prospect of a federal carbon tax. Svaty is guessing he knows which way the cost of coal-generated electricity is going: up.
\
""Every arrow is pointing in that direction,"" he said.
\
Westar Energy, citing massive increases in the cost of coal-fired power plants, recently announced it is postponing indefinitely its plans for new coal-fired plants. In documents filed with the Kansas Corporation Commission last year Westar estimated power from a new coal-fired plant would cost at least 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Meanwhile, it has a 20-year contract to buy wind energy at 4.1 cents per kilowatt-hour.
\
""Coal is the most risky investment now,"" Svaty said. ""It's become very clear the price increases in coal are skyrocketing.""
\
Roth said that everyone except for extremist environmentalists agree that new electricity generation is needed.
\
""It seems as though there is going to be a coal plant somewhere, sometime, in the future,"" he said.
\
Actually, not all those who question the assumption that new generation is needed are on the fringes. Many utilities are openly promoting efficiency as the cheapest alternative to new generation. In some states, such as Vermont, efficiency measures have all but halted growth in electricity usage. Kansas is one of fewer than a dozen states who through 2006 had reported no savings from efficiency measures.
\
Some of the questions put to legislators dealt with the budget.
\
""The Senate watchword has been no new spending,"" Brungardt said. ""I expect our (budget) will be last year's budget with a little inflationary increment.""
\
Svaty said that most new spending proposed by the governor has been removed. He said that programs such as those that provide legal representation for people who cannot afford a lawyer are struggling for lack of commitments that amount to less than $300,000.
\
""These are small appropriations that would make a huge difference,"" he said. ""We are losing attorneys on a week-by-week basis.""
\
But Roth said that much of the new spending is based on projected new revenue from gaming ventures whose legality is being challenged, and it is not yet clear how much revenue can reasonably be expected.

If a bank is too big to fail, it's way too big to exist. If an oil well is too far beneath the sea to be plugged when something goes wrong, it's too deep to be drilled in the first place.
\
When are we going to stop behaving so stupidly? We nearly wrecked the economy and we're all but buried in debt. But we can't break up the biggest banks, and we can't raise taxes. Now we're fouling the magnificent Gulf of Mexico and ruining entire communities along the southern Louisiana coast.
\
And, by the way, we're still fighting a futile war in Afghanistan that we've been fighting with nonstop futility for nearly a decade. (I'm sure the troops saddled with this thankless task were thrilled to see fans and teams demonstrating their undying support for their efforts by wearing fancy baseball caps on Memorial Day.)
\
For a nation that can't stop bragging about how great and powerful it is, we've become shockingly helpless in the face of the many challenges confronting us. Our can-do spirit was put on hold many moons ago, and here we are now unable to defeat the Taliban, or rein in the likes of BP and the biggest banks, or stop the oil gushing furiously from the bowels of earth like a warning from Hades about the hubris and ignorance that is threatening to destroy us.
\
BP and the Obama administration have been equally clueless about halting the millions of gallons of oil that have flowed into the gulf since the Deepwater Horizon explosion more than a month ago. President Barack Obama's top adviser on energy policy, Carol Browner, unintentionally underscored the monumental futility of the response in a comment she made on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.
\
""This is obviously a difficult situation,"" Browner said, ""but it's important for people to understand that from the beginning, the government has been in charge.""
\
Got that? No one has been able to bring the crisis under control, and no one expects it to be brought under control soon, but the important thing for us to know is that the government has been in charge of this epic failure all along.
\
However and whenever the well gets capped, what we really need is leadership that calls on the American public to begin coping in a serious and sustained way with an energy crisis that we've been warned about for decades. If the worst environmental disaster in the country's history is not enough to bring about a reversal of our epic foolishness on the energy front, then nothing will.
\
The first thing we can do is conserve more. That's the low-hanging fruit in any clean-energy strategy.
\
It's fast, cheap and easy. It's something that all Americans, young and old, can be asked to participate in immediately. In that sense, it's a way of combating the pervasive feelings of helplessness that have become so demoralizing and so destructive to our long-term interests.
\
People have talked about energy conservation for the longest time. But we have dawdled on making vehicles more fuel-efficient and weatherizing our homes and insisting that commercial buildings be more energy efficient, and so on. Turn those thermostats down a couple of degrees in the winter and up in the summer. Figure out ways to have a little fun while doing it.
\
We also need a carbon tax. The current crisis is the perfect opportunity for our political leaders to explain to the public why this is so important and what benefits would come from it.
\
Above all, I'd like to see the creation of a second Manhattan Project that would lead us in a few years to an environment in which alternative fuels are abundant, effective and affordable. We are a pathetically weak player in that game right now.
\
Instead of staring mesmerized at the tragedy in the gulf, like spectators at a train wreck, we should be trying to regain that innovative can-do spirit that made America the greatest of nations.
\
All around us is the wreckage of our failure to master the challenges confronting us. We see it in the many millions of Americans who remain out of work and whose hopes are not rising despite all the talk of economic recovery. We see it in the schools where teachers are walking the plank by the scores of thousands because of state and local budget problems.
\
We see it in the shrinking middle class and in the black community where depressionlike conditions are fostering not just a sense of helplessness, but despair.
\
What's needed is dynamic leadership (it doesn't have to come from the top) to reinvigorate the spirit of America and turn that sense of helplessness around.

Topeka - A new group will soon tackle the politically charged issue of reducing climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions in Kansas.
\
""Experts agree that Congress will institute a carbon tax in the coming years,"" Gov. Kathleen Sebelius said. ""By taking steps to prepare now, we better position our state for potential costs in the future.""
\
Sebelius has appointed 20 members to the Kansas Energy and Environmental Policy Advisory Group, including industry and scientific leaders. The group will have its first meeting May 20 in Wichita.
\
The Kansas Legislature has just ended its session after a bruising battle over a proposal to build two 700-megawatt coal-fired power plants in western Kansas.
\
Sebelius opposes the project because of the plants' annual emission of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide.
\
The new group will produce an inventory and forecast of greenhouse gas emissions in Kansas; recommend a plan to reduce emissions; and produce a preliminary report by the start of the 2009 legislative session in January.
\
Jack Pelton, president and chief executive officer of Cessna Aircraft in Wichita, will lead the group, called KEEP for short. KEEP will work with the Center for Climate Strategies, a Pennsylvania consulting firm, to develop a climate plan for Kansas.
\
""I am confident that the combined expertise of this group will lead to innovative solutions across all sectors of Kansas industry which helps every corner of our state,"" Sebelius said.
\
Appointed to the group are: Steven Baccus, Kansas Farm Bureau president; Amy Blankenbiller, Kansas Chamber of Commerce president and chief executive officer; Jim Boone, NorthStar Comfort Systems Inc. president; David Braaten, Kansas University geography professor; Casey Cassius, Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell Architects architect; Yvonne Cather, Kansas Sierra Club Council delegate; Patty Clark, Kansas Leadership Center director of operations; Johannes Feddema, Kansas University geography professor; Ashok Gupta, Natural Resources Defense Council director of air and energy program; Colin Hansen, Kansas Municipal Utilities executive director; Nancy Jackson, Land Institute Climate and Energy Project director; Mike Kelley, YRC Worldwide vice president; Mark Knight, owner of Knight Feedlots; State Rep. Annie Kuether, D-Topeka; Stuart Lowry, Kansas Electric Cooperatives Inc. executive vice president; William Moore, Westar Energy president and chief executive officer; Emil Ramirez, United Steel Workers District 11 assistant director; Charles Rice, Kansas State University agronomy professor; Bruce Snead, Kansas State University engineering extension program specialist; John Wong, Wichita State University Urban and Public Affairs interim director.
\
In addition, several state government officials will serve as ex-officio members: Rod Bremby, secretary of the Department of Health and Environment; Ken Frahm, Kansas Energy Council co-chair; Mike Hayden, secretary of the Department of Wildlife and Parks; David Kerr, secretary of the Department of Commerce; Deb Miller, secretary of the Department of Transportation; Lt. Gov. Mark Parkinson; Adrian Polansky, secretary of the Department of Agriculture; Tracy Streeter, Kansas Water Office executive director; and Tom Wright, Kansas Corporation Commission chairman.

\
TOPEKA -- Gov. Kathleen Sebelius zapped a coal-fired power plant bill with harsh criticism Thursday and said she'd sought to compromise with two western Kansas utilities on the issue but was rejected.
\
""Kansas would be the coal capital of the country,"" Sebelius said in response to the bill, introduced Wednesday by lawmakers upset at her administration for rejecting a permit for two $3.6 billion plants near Holcomb.
\
The governor said the measure would actually promote higher levels of carbon emissions, opening the door for a coal rush of companies seeking to build in the state.
\
""All the coal plants that have been denied permits or withdrawn applications in other states would be knocking at our door,"" Sebelius said in a news release. ""Why wouldn't they? Given the lack of zoning requirements in many of our counties, these plants could be sited anywhere.""
\
Her only praise was reserved for the bill's sections to increase energy efficiency in Kansas public buildings and vehicles.
\
The governor also referred to a letter she sent legislators on Thursday, outlining her attempts to compromise with Hays-based Sunflower Electric, which saw its permit to build two, 700-megawatt plants denied by a state regulator last fall.
\
Sebelius said she suggested that Sunflower and Midwest Energy of Hays, which plans to buy power from the new Holcomb plants, instead build a single coal plant and store the carbon emissions underground, but the companies declined the offer.
\
""As the dialogue on this issue continues, I think it's important for Kansans to know we have put forth a compromise,"" she said in the release. ""We will continue looking for ways to find clean, affordable and secure sources of energy to meet our growing demand as a state and a nation.""
\
Sunflower spokesman Steve Miller said the company hoped also to continue seeking a resolution ""in the best interest of Kansans.""
\
""We remain committed to further discussions with the governor's staff and the Legislature,"" he said.
\
Miller declined further comment on Sebelius' offer.
\
The legislation on the plants would bar the state's health and environment secretary from citing carbon emissions, which he used as a reason to reject Sunflower's permit the first time. The measure would allow for regulation of carbon dioxide, which is currently unregulated by state and federal law, only if legislators agreed to it.
\
Sebelius said the bill actually promotes greater carbon emissions, in contrast to several states that are enacting laws to reduce carbon emissions because they exacerbate global climate change.
\
Emler disagrees
\
A key bill sponsor disputed the governor's concerns.
\
""She's certainly entitled to her opinion,"" said Senate Utilities Chairman Jay Emler, R-Lindsborg. ""I would tend to disagree.""
\
Emler said the legislation was unique nationally because it would let Sunflower mitigate its carbon emissions by investing in research, wind power or other green initiatives. It also imposes a $3-a-ton penalty tax on carbon emissions for failure to meet the bill's standards.
\
Sebelius scoffed at the provisions, noting the bill offered no realistic change in emissions limits, and a $3 tax was far lower than the $20- to $30-a-ton estimates that utility companies, financial analysts and Congress are now considering as a potential federal carbon tax.
\
""If anything, it appears to be an attempt to mislead Kansans that significant action would be taken,"" Sebelius said.
\
The bill would also permit release of several million tons of new emissions in Kansas if the plants are built by Sunflower and co-investors.
\
Emler defended the measure, saying it could result in less pollution someday in the future as utilities phase out older plants that are less efficient and pollute more than modern plants.
\
""You take a look at how many plants are above what Holcomb would have to be,"" Emler said. ""Those older plants are going to die out, they'll have to be phased out.""
\
The bill contains no new emissions limits for existing coal plants in the state and does not require that older ones be phased out at a certain point.
\
Don't give a reason
\
House and Senate utilities committees plan next week to hold hearings and vote on the bills, an unusually quick process for a bill of such magnitude.
\
House Utilities Chairman Carl Holmes, R-Liberal, said Thursday that no energy bills would be allowed to move out of his committee ""until the Holcomb issue is resolved.""
\
""That's my decision. I don't have to give a reason,"" he told a reporter.
\
One lawmaker who said his constituents are calling for legislation to facilitate more renewable energy, including wind power, rather than more coal plants said that could pose a problem.
\
""Trying to hold bills hostage is not the right approach to take,"" said Rep. Paul Davis, D-Lawrence. ""There is certainly great interest in dealing with the Holcomb issue, but an even greater interest in dealing with energy policy as a whole and not holding up the process over Holcomb.""
\
The bills at issue: Senate Bill 515 and House Bill 2711.

PARIS - Switzerland freezes plans to build new nuclear plants, Germany raises questions about its nuclear future, and opposition to atomic reactor construction mounts from Turkey to South Africa.
\
Will explosions and other worries at a tsunami-stricken Japanese nuclear plant halt what has come to be known as the nuclear renaissance?
\
Fears about nuclear safety that took a generation to overcome after the accidents at Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island are resurfacing around the globe. They are casting new doubt on a controversial energy source that has seen a resurgence in recent years, amid worries over volatile oil prices and global warming.
\
""Europe has to wake up from its Sleeping Beauty slumber"" about nuclear safety, Austria's Environment Minister Nikolaus Berlakovich told reporters in Brussels. He suggested an EU-wide stress test for nuclear plants, much like European banks have been tested for their ability to cope with financial shocks.
\
Yet some experts and officials say those fears are overblown, given the exceptional nature of Japan's earthquake and ensuing tsunami. The Japanese blasts may slow the push for more nuclear plants but appear unlikely to stop it, given the world's fast-growing energy needs.
\
The governments of Russia, China and Poland said they are sticking to plans to build more reactors. Even earthquake-prone Chile says it won't discard a nuclear option. Spain warned against hasty decisions.
\
Japan's nuclear plant explosions come as the U.S. government looks to expand its nuclear energy industry by offering companies tens of billions in financial backing. Administration officials said the U.S. would seek lessons from the Japanese crisis but said the events in Japan would not diminish the United States commitment to nuclear power.
\
""It remains a part of the president's overall energy plan,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""When we talk about reaching a clean energy standard, it is a vital part of that.""
\
In Atlanta, the CEO of Southern Co. said Monday he does not expect Japan's problems to delay construction of two more nuclear reactors in Georgia, at the first nuclear plant in the United States to break ground in a generation.
\
Elsewhere, governments began questioning their vision of a nuclear-energized future amid rising threats of a meltdown at one Japanese reactor.
\
Switzerland ordered a freeze on new plants or replacements ""until safety standards have been carefully reviewed and if necessary adapted,"" Energy Minister Doris Leuthard said. The decision put on hold the construction of nuclear power stations at three sites approved by Swiss regulatory authorities.
\
Switzerland now has five nuclear power reactors that produce about 40 percent of the country's energy needs. It also has nuclear research reactors.
\
In Germany, the government said it is suspending for three months a decision to extend the life of its nuclear power plants. That also means that two older nuclear power plants will be taken off the grid shortly - at least for now - pending a full safety investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters.
\
A previous government decided to shut all 17 German nuclear plants, but Merkel's administration last year moved to extend their lives by an average 12 years.
\
""The pictures from Japan show us that nothing, even the worst, is unthinkable,"" EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger told Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio.
\
The European Union called a meeting Tuesday of nuclear safety authorities to assess Europe's preparedness in case of a nuclear emergency.
\
Individual EU members including Britain, Bulgaria and Finland also urged a nuclear safety review.
\
Meanwhile, opposition voices rose up in Turkey and Sweden to renounce or scale back governments' nuclear expansion plans. And anti-nuclear groups staged rallies around France, the world's most nuclear-dependent country, as the government sought to reassure the public that the risks remain minimal.
\
Environmental group Earthlife Africa said it wants South Africa, the only African country with an existing nuclear plant, to follow Germany's example. But South African government officials want to expand nuclear power.
\
German popular opinion continues to favor non-nuclear sources of energy. But elsewhere in Europe, people have become increasingly open to using nuclear power as memories fade of the accident in Chernobyl, Ukraine - the world's worst nuclear accident, 25 years ago next month. Eastern Europe sees nuclear energy as a way of gaining a measure of independence from Russia's burgeoning gas and oil empire.
\
Statistics from the International Atomic Energy Agency show there are 442 nuclear reactors in operation worldwide, with 65 new facilities under construction. Construction last year was started on 14 new reactors - in China, Russia, India, Japan and Brazil. In 2005, in comparison, ground was broken for only three reactors.
\
Boosters have argued that new-design reactors pose fewer safety risks, and that nuclear-produced electricity doesn't emit the pollution that causes global warming.
\
Even as Japan's damaged reactors were beginning to deteriorate Friday, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera told state television that ""the new so-called smart technologies are technologies that are absolutely earthquake-proof in terms of security. And that's why we are studying this option, because Chile can't categorically reject any alternative in energy generation.""
\
Pinera is planning to sign a nuclear energy accord with the U.S. during President Barack Obama's visit to Santiago next week.
\
The head of the Ukrainian Chernobyl Union called for setting up nuclear safety squads of professionals trained to respond to nuclear accidents who could be rapidly dispatched to any accident site.
\
""Nuclear accidents will continue happening as nuclear energy develops,"" Yuri Andreyev told the AP.
\
Experts said it was too early to evaluate all the consequences of the Japanese explosions.
\
""This is a massive earthquake, followed by a massive tsunami,"" said physics professor Paddy Regan of the University of Surrey at Guildford. ""Imagine if this would have been next to a chemical plant or a gas plant that would have exploded. ... There is a risk here but we have to keep the fears rational.""

Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives.
\
We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al Qaeda's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.
\
These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together.
\
Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.
\
We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.
\
The two of them shared the optimism of a Nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share - the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.
\
The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them.
\
Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up.
\
In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior.
\
It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect.
\
Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again.
\
The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.
\
No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last - an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.
\
This blueprint begins with American manufacturing.
\
On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number one automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
\
We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back.
\
What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring back every job that's left our shores. But right now, it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.
\
So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.
\
We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.
\
So let's change it. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.
\
Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here.
\
Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
\
My message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I'll sign them right away.
\
We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal - ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
\
I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration - and it's made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.
\
Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you - America will always win.
\
I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that - openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.
\
That's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.
\
Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.
\
I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers - places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.
\
And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It's time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.
\
These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.
\
For less than one percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning - the first time that's happened in a generation.
\
But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.
\
At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies - just to make a difference.
\
Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn.
\
We also know that when students aren't allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.
\
When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.
\
Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury - it's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.
\
Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.
\
That doesn't make sense.
\
I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.
\
The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.
\
You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who's willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.
\
After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.
\
Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.
\
Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right - eight years. Not only that - last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.
\
But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy - a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.
\
We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.
\
The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of thirty years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock - reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.
\
What's true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.
\
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ""I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.""
\
Our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs.
\
We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well tonight, I will. I'm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history - with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.
\
Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's another proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs.
\
Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.
\
During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.
\
In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive Order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.
\
There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.
\
That's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.
\
Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
\
We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, or faulty medical devices, don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better.
\
There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense. We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.
\
I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men.
\
And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid to college.
\
So if you're a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're required to write out a ""living will"" that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail - because the rest of us aren't bailing you out ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for them.
\
We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
\
And tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.
\
A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.
\
Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.
\
When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
\
Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else - like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both.
\
The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.
\
But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who need relief.
\
Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.
\
We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference - like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know it's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to their country's future, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last.
\
I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: Nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.
\
Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?
\
The greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco?
\
I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad - and it seems to get worse every year.
\
Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign it tomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa - an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.
\
Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything - even routine business - passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
\
The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient, outdated and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.
\
Finally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas.
\
I'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. That's why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and States. That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program.
\
On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.
\
The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can't achieve.
\
That is the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.
\
Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America.
\
From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.
\
As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana'a to Tripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest-serving dictators - a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change can't be reversed, and that human dignity can't be denied.
\
How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings - men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.
\
And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.
\
The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease; from the blows we've dealt to our enemies; to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back.
\
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the world, all of whom are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing; no, we can't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs - and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way.
\
That's why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of cyber-threats.
\
Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have earned - which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation.
\
With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I'm proposing a Veterans Job Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.
\
Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white; Asian or Latino; conservative or liberal; rich or poor; gay or straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind.
\
One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates - a man who was George Bush's defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president.
\
All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job - the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other - because you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there's someone behind you, watching your back.
\
So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we're joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.
\
Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.

64,"Sen. John McCain's call for Congress to legislate a ""gas tax holiday"" may get a few cheers as he travels along on his presidential campaign.\But it's a bad idea that, fortunately, isn't garnering much support among his congressional colleagues.\McCain, an Arizona Republican who has his party's presidential nomination in hand, has proposed suspending the federal government's 18.4 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cent per gallon tax on diesel fuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day.\He contends the tax break would give citizens a needed break in fuel prices during peak vacation time and spread relief throughout the economy by reducing the cost of shipping products across the country, which presumably then would be reflected in lower retail prices.\The flaw in his reasoning is that the tax reduction could be passed along to consumers at the gasoline pumps.\Gasoline prices are rising steadily upward this year - the national average price hit $3.511 on Tuesday - and some are predicting the price will hit $4 a gallon before summer is very far along. Last year, the national average price peaked at $3.23 in late May.\In such an environment, 18.4 cents a gallon can get lost pretty quickly, and who's going to be watching the big oil companies to determine whether their next 10 cent price hike is the result of higher oil prices or a move to swallow some of the 18.4 cent per gallon tax the government has left on the table?\There's no doubt the surging demand for oil from countries moving into the industrial age a century behind Europe and the United States, primarily China and India, is pushing crude prices. But with the oil companies reporting record profits each year for the past several years, it has become obvious to anyone paying attention that their pricing strategy calls for more than simply passing along their higher cost of oil.\Twenty years ago, reporting such profits when the rest of the economy was going in the tank would have elicited screams from the public and Congress. Today, for some reason, it hardly raises an eyebrow.\If that isn't enough to highlight the folly of McCain's proposal, consider that the federal government during the ""gas tax holiday"" would lose at least 25 percent of the money fuel taxes would raise this year for highway repair and expansion. That money is spent, and creates jobs, in every state across the nation.\We say at least 25 percent but the loss could be greater. While the three months between Memorial Day and Labor Day represent one-fourth of the year, those months traditionally are when travel and fuel consumption are at their highest.\We suggest McCain take a holiday from touting his fuel tax proposal and spend some time coming up with another stump speech, perhaps one that offers some real solutions to the troubles plaguing the economy."

SYRACUSE - Two years ago, voters here approved tax increases to keep the 25-bed Hamilton County Hospital open. The county sales tax went up by a half-cent and property taxes went up 20 percent, both permanent increases.
\
Now hospital officials are asking the county for another $3 million in ""no-fund warrants"" to support the facility's operations. Otherwise, the hospital faces the prospect of closing, said Phyllis Horning, the interim chief executive.
\
""We can probably go another month without doing something,"" Horning said. Closing ""is a possibility, but it's sure not where I want to be. I do believe the no-fund warrants issue will pass. I don't really have any doubt that it will.""
\
In March, commissioners unanimously approved the request for $3 million to be repaid over four years by county taxpayers.
\
However, a petition is circulating to put the measure to a countywide vote. If 63 signatures are collected by June 3, a countywide vote will be held sometime in July - pushing back to August the earliest the funds could be available.
\
Syracuse Mayor Joe Stephens, owner of the town's bowling alley and gun shop, is among the 55 or so people who so far have signed the petition.
\
""I signed the petition not as mayor, but as a citizen,"" Stephens said. ""We're trying to find out why they need $3 million to operate all of a sudden. We didn't arrive at this point overnight. It seems to be a pattern that about every two or three years they're coming and asking for more money. Nobody in their right mind wants to lose the hospital. But we can't just be taxed to death.
\
""They say they've lost revenue because they don't have doctors. Well, if my business falls off, we make whatever adjustments we have to make - if it's laying people off, cutting services, not supplying something. But we haven't seen any of that up there.""
\
Hospital officials are scheduled to make the case for the $3 million in bonds to the community 7 p.m. Friday at the Syracuse High School gymnasium.
\
""The meeting Friday is to explain to everybody how we got where we are and where we're trying to get to,"" Horning said.
\
Budget woes
\
Among the factors threatening to put the hospital's $5 million annual budget in the red is declining oil and gas tax revenue, the main variable behind the county's quarterly allotment to the hospital, said County Clerk Angie Moser.
\
In 2007, the hospital received $1.1 million from the county property tax when it was 15 mills, plus another $12,000 to $18,000 per month from the sales tax. In 2011, the hospital received only about $690,000 even after the property tax was raised to 18 mills. The sales tax revenue remained stable.
\
""Oil and gas production around here has really dropped. And the state assesses the valuation on public utilities, and that really dropped. And that's affected the hospital,"" Moser said.
\
Another hit on the hospital budget was the installation of a new $800,000 electronic health records system. Hospitals that don't have a digital records system by 2015 will receive reduced Medicare reimbursements from the federal government.
\
But by far the biggest factor behind the hospital's financial problems has been the lack of its own doctor, Horning said.
\
""Once we can get one hired, it should all turn around,"" she said.
\
In January, the hospital lost its doctor when it could not afford to renew its contract with Greeley County Health Services, which for five years had supplied Syracuse one to three part-time doctors.
\
Hospital officials were able to recruit a semi-retired physician from Atwood, Dr. Charles Zerr, to fill the void. But he only started last week.
\
Hospital board member Shannon Wharton said the board reached a ""handshake agreement"" with Zerr to work with the hospital while the hospital continues the search for a permanent doctor.
\
""He's willing to work with us. He's been wonderful as far as doing as much or as little as we need,"" she said.
\
Recruiting doctors
\
Wharton said a central element of the long-term strategic plan to be presented at Friday's meeting is changing how the hospital recruits doctors.
\
""We can't just rely on outside companies to do all of our recruiting for us. Now, it's going to be an ongoing process that never stops,"" Wharton said.
\
""We're not just going to recruit one doctor and sit back and say, 'We've got our doctor, we're in good shape.' We're looking at starting earlier with doctors in residency programs,"" she said, citing the University of Kansas residency programs in Salina and Wichita, which face possible elimination or reductions if some budget cuts proposed by the Legislature are enacted.
\
It's more challenging than ever to recruit doctors, Wharton said.
\
""There are not as many graduates going into family medicine like we need. A lot of them are going into specialties,"" she said. ""Rural doctors need to have more of a servant-oriented attitude. It has to be a passion for them. They have to be drawn more toward wanting to help the rural community - the people - versus becoming a rich doctor. It's a different mindset.""
\
Impact on the community
\
Pharmacist Todd Traylor said he thought supporting the hospital's $3 million request was ""pretty easy to justify.""
\
He said if approved, he expected his property taxes would go up $300 a year on his house and up to $600 a year on his business, the Hamilton County Drug Store.
\
""It's more than just the obvious benefit of having a hospital in town,"" he said. ""They are the largest employer in the county. If the hospital closes, it would take those families and children out of the school system, which would take a huge chunk out of the local economy. That in turn would destabilize the customer base for local businesses,"" including his own.
\
Traylor said if the hospital were to close, he would try to keep his drugstore open.
\
""But that hasn't worked in other communities,"" he said. ""In Walsh, Colo., the hospital closed and the pharmacy, and now you could drive right through that town and miss it. Ultimately, closing the hospital would lead to fewer citizens to take care of whatever tax burden is left. In essence, your taxes would go up anyway just for basic county services like having a sheriff or fire department.""
\
The rippling economic impact Traylor described is sometimes called the ""multiplier effect.""
\
According to a 2012 Kansas Hospital Association study, the average statewide multiplier for communities with a hospital was $1.48, which means that every $1 of income generated by hospitals results in another 48 cents generated for other sectors of the economy.
\
But many rural hospitals cannot sustain themselves the same way as urban hospitals because they have the expenses of around-the-clock operations but a smaller population base from which to defray the costs, said Cindy Samuelson, a spokesperson for the hospital association.
\
""That presents a very difficult environment,"" she said, ""to be able to provide (around the clock, year- round) services. ... But you don't have a lot of people coming in to utilize the services.""
\
Most communities seem prepared to support a county hospital with occasional bond issues, Samuelson said. Only one frontier hospital comparable to Syracuse has closed in the last decade: Cedar Vale Hospital - a privately owned facility employing about 30 people - shut down in 2006.
\
In that southeast Kansas community, there was talk of issuing a bond or increasing taxes to save the hospital but nothing more than talk, said Beverly Tolle, who works at the town's remaining rural health clinic.
\
She said most of the hospital employees left town - though some now commute 30 minutes west to work in Arkansas City.
\
""We lost our grocery store after the hospital closed. I think that was directly a result of the population loss. We didn't have jobs, so people left town,"" Tolle said.
\
As of the 2000 census, there were 723 people in Cedar Vale. By 2010, there were 569.

66,"
DAYTON, Ohio - On the road in a tour bus this week, the U.S. transportation secretary is spreading some bad news: The government's Highway Trust Fund is nearly broke. If allowed to run dry, that could set back or shut down projects across the country, force widespread layoffs of construction workers and delay needed repairs and improvements.
\
Anthony Foxx kicked off an eight-state bus trip in Ohio to whip up public support for congressional approval of legislation to keep federal transportation aid flowing to states for another four years, and possibly longer. But Congress will have to act fast. The trust fund - the source of much of the aid - is forecast to essentially run dry sometime before the end of the federal fiscal year Sept. 30, and possibly as early as late August.
\
If that happens, the government will have to slow down or even halt payments to states, which rely on federal aid for most major highway projects. Uncertainty over whether there will be enough funds in the coming months is already causing officials in states like Arkansas, California and Colorado to consider delaying planned projects.
\
Foxx's warnings this week echo ones by President Barack Obama, who cautioned in February that unless Congress finished a bill by summer's end then ""we could see construction projects stop in their tracks."" But there is little interest among politicians in an election year to consider raising gasoline taxes.
\
Many transportation insiders, including Foxx's predecessor, Ray LaHood, predict Congress will wind up doing what it has done repeatedly over the past five years: Dip into the general treasury for enough money for to keep programs going a few weeks or a few months, at which point the exercise will have to be repeated all over again.
\
But keeping highway and transit aid constantly teetering on the edge of insolvency discourages state and local officials from moving ahead with bigger and more important projects that take many years to build. In 2012, Congress finally pieced together a series of one-time tax changes and spending cuts to programs unrelated to transportation in order to keep the trust fund solvent for about two years. Now the money is nearly gone.
\
""Tell Congress we can't slap a Band-Aid on our transportation system any longer,"" Foxx urged state and local officials at a stop Monday to view one of Ohio's biggest construction projects. Other states on the tour are Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
\
Foxx is promoting Obama's four-year, $302 billion plan to shore up the trust fund with savings from proposed changes to corporate tax laws. The White House has said that as much as $150 billion could come from its proposal to close corporate loopholes, such as ones that encourage U.S. companies to invest overseas.
\
""I feel it's clearly a crisis,"" Fox said in an interview, ""but we have a responsibility to put a proposal out there that casts a longer-term vision, that helps Congress and the country quite frankly think past our noses, and that's what we're doing.""
\
It would also be a one-time fix, but it would generate enough money to ratchet up transportation for several years. Rep. David Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House's tax-writing committee, has also proposed a one-time, $126.5 billion infusion into the trust fund over a period of eight years. But his plan is part of a much broader rewrite of corporate laws, which would require heavy lifting from Congress at any time, but especially in the hyper-partisan atmosphere of an election year.
\
""There doesn't seem to be much of an appetite to go after corporate tax reform this year, which is the only long-term funding source that has been proposed by both the administration and Congress,"" said Joshua Schank, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington transportation think tank.
\
But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told reporters last week that ""what seems to be coming forward as a consensus is a piece of tax reform"" rather than shifting money from the general treasury or raising fuel taxes.
\
Foxx cited the modernization of Interstate 75, which rumbles through the heart of this middle-sized Ohio city, as an example of the kind of much-needed improvements communities want but may have to forgo. The $381 million project is intended to expand the highway's capacity, reduce traffic congestion, and eliminate dangerous and confusing left-hand exits. More than a third of the project's cost is being paid with trust-fund dollars.
\
The interstate highway program, launched in 1956, has been funded primarily through federal gas and diesel taxes under the principle that users of the system should pay for its construction and maintenance. But it's been clear for nearly a decade that fuel taxes haven't been keeping pace with transportation needs as the nation's population grows and its infrastructure ages.
\
The 18.4 cents-a-gallon federal gas tax was last increased in 1993 as part of a deal between President Bill Clinton and Congress to raise money to help reduce the federal deficit and pay for transportation programs. Clinton was fiercely criticized by Republicans as a tax-raiser, and the issue was one of several reasons Democrats lost control of the House and Senate the following year.
\
It was a lesson lawmakers in both parties took to heart.
\
""People don't want to vote to increase the gas tax,"" LaHood, a former Republican congressman, said in an interview.
\
With encouragement from Congress, some states are stepping up their use of tolls to help pay for projects. But tolls aren't practical for all projects.
\
""Congress is stymied,"" said John Horsley, former executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. ""We're all scratching our heads.""
"
67,"TOPEKA — Locked-down businesses, surging unemployment and consternation about a possible coronavirus recession Monday prompted downgrading of Kansas’ tax revenue projections in the next two years by $1.3 billion to force state lawmakers into the position of contemplating cataclysmic budget cuts.\The group of economists and analysts responsible for revising the state revenue estimates predicted tax collections in the fiscal year ending June 30 would be down by $815 million. In the fiscal year starting July 1, tax revenue was expected to drop off $549 million because of damage caused by COVID-19 in Kansas. \In anticipation of a bleak revenue forecast, Gov. Laura Kelly said she instructed state agencies Friday to eliminate discretionary spending, shelve requests for salary increases and leave vacant job openings not required during the pandemic. She requested fee-funded agencies of state government follow the same preemptive moves.\“These initial steps are just the start of what will likely be needed to ensure long-term fiscal stability,” the Democratic governor said.\The Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, which met in private to update state government revenue projections last adjusted in November, pointed to anticipated decline in sales, income and oil-and-gas tax revenue. It was a sharp pivot from the group’s expectations five months ago when their consensus was Kansas could expect steady employment, rising wages and economic growth into 2021.\The 2020 Legislature and Kelly traditionally rely on the April updates of revenue forecasts to sort out budget details for each fiscal year starting July 1. It isn’t clear whether the House and Senate will return next week to Topeka as scheduled to address the revenue collapse or delay action on the problem to a point in May or June in which risk of infection may not be as great. \A wildcard in the financial and political debate will be the amount of federal aid the state receives to soften economic fallout from COVID-19. It is also unclear when Kansas officials will authorize reopening of economic activity.\“Lost jobs, business uncertainty and this unprecedented shortfall is a call for action,” said Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita. “We need a plan to open up safely and we need it soon.”\
Chamber’s input
\The state’s most prominent business advocacy organization recommends the plan for loosening and eliminating stay-at-home, mass-gathering and other statewide coronavirus restrictions set by Kelly must be keyed to public health metrics and accompanied by tax and regulatory relief. \The Kansas Chamber, which represents businesses interests, endorsed a 40-point proposal that would condition movement back to normalcy with a requirement that the state’s health care system be equipped to treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care.\The state also should be able to test everyone with symptoms of COVID-19 and monitor confirmed cases and contacts, the chamber said. In addition, the organization said the decision on initiating commerce beyond essential business activities ought to be linked to a two-week reduction in case volume.\“Kansas businesses closed because of the statewide stay-home order as well as those who have had to lay off or furlough employees are anxious to reopen and get back to work,” said Alan Cobb, president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber, which has often been at odds with the governor on tax and budget policy. “But the health and safety of their employees and customers are a top priority.”\The chamber’s list included a pause on state tax audits and a state tax break on coronavirus loans and grants to businesses. It ought to feature suspension of state or local inspections required to reopen a business temporarily closed because of COVID-19, Cobb said.\He said the state should give business and residential property owners a 90-day extension on property tax payments. Consideration needs to be given to a tax credit to defray costs of out-of-pocket medical expenses for treatment of the virus. Business owners need liability protection from allegations by patrons who blame companies for contracting the virus, he said.\The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported Monday that 100 Kansas residents have died and 1,986 have tested positive for the virus. Infection has been documented in 69 of the state’s 105 counties, KDHE said.\The outbreak at Lansing Correctional Facility widened to include 47 staff and 40 inmates, the Kansas Department of Corrections said. The agency also reported the first confirmed COVID-19 infection of a staff member at Topeka Correctional Facility, the prison housing women felons. In addition, a Wichita work release inmate who tested positive was transferred to Lansing.\
Virus ’body blow’
\David Toland, secretary of the Kansas Department of Commerce, said unraveling of the state’s economic fabric occurred with speed and without exception.\“Like most states,” he said, “the Kansas economy has taken a body blow from COVID and that extended from the ag sector to manufacturing to the service sector, professionals. Everybody has been hit. It’s urban, rural, suburban across the board.”\The state commerce department distributed $5 million in bridge loans to almost 350 hospitality businesses. The no-interest loans were designed to help bars, coffee shops and motels stay afloat until U.S. Small Business Administration loans became available or individual businesses could restructure bank debt. Demand for the state program called HIRE exceeded available cash: 1,000 applicants didn’t get a piece of that pie.\He said the federal Paycheck Protection Program in the SBA delivered forgivable loans to 20,000 Kansas businesses that averaged $187,000.\That money won’t have to be repaid if used to keep staff on the payroll during the pandemic, Toland said.\The $350 billion earmarked nationally for PPP is gone, but congressional Democrats and the White House worked Sunday on a new relief package that included $300 billion to replenish the PPP fund. The legislation also is likely to contain $50 billion for the SBA’s disaster relief fund, $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing.\Toland said a separate federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan offered businesses working capital at an interest rate of 3.75%. There have been complaints EIDL dollars aren’t moving to businesses quickly enough, he said.\“We’ve been hearing a lot of frustration from folks who have not been able to tap these dollars,” he said.\
A work in progress
\Kelly, who has issued two dozen executive orders related to the pandemic since March 16, said she would reveal an economic-transition plan by early May.\She said an outline of action proposed by President Donald Trump, who has spurred interest in protests to pressure governors to flip the switch, included broad testing as a prerequisite.\“One of the things that it says right at the very beginning is that we've gotta have the testing and the contact tracing in place before we can take the second step,” she said. ""I'm working with state public health officials, our emergency management team and an assortment of other experts to explore how we can tailor this guidance to Kansas.""\She said the restart in Kansas could be phased in a way that reflected differences in how severely COVID-19 impacted communities.\Sixty-nine Kansas counties have reported at least one positive test for the virus, but 10 counties account for more than 80% of the 1,849 total. Half of these cases are in Wyandotte, Johnson and Sedgwick counties. COVID-19 has claimed 92 lives in 14 counties, but three-fourths were residents in Johnson or Wyandotte counties.\The full extent of the virus’s spread in Kansas is unknown because the state ranks near the bottom nationally in per-capita testing.\“We will be moving back to normal as the science allows,” Kelly said.\Tim Carpenter, The Topeka Capital-Journal"

In a citizen survey the city of Salina conducted earlier this year, only 29 percent of responders rated the city's quality of street repair as good or excellent.
\
That served as confirmation for City Manager Jason Gage, who on Monday unveiled a proposed, 2007 city budget that included a $1.5 million initiative to improve street maintenance and related issues.
\
""Just driving around, it's pretty easy to see the need,"" said Gage, who recently completed his first year as Salina city manager. ""That same need, we feel, was pretty well reflected in our citizen survey. A lot of the responses to questions regarding street work and street maintenance weren't glowing. We just felt it was time we really need to do something in that area if we have the resources and if the commission has a desire to put them into that.""
\
The matter will be discussed at Salina City Commission study sessions before it's voted on, Gage said.
\
Mayor Donnie Marrs was traveling Tuesday and said he hadn't had time to look at the proposed transportation initiative. It would complement the city's $1.3 million budget for major street maintenance.
\
""I think there's a certain amount of that that's necessary,"" Marrs said. ""I'll have to look at it to determine whether I agree with the level that's being proposed.""
\
Spend the sales tax
\
Gage's proposal is to fund the initiative through the city's special quarter-cent sales tax, which is devoted to capital-improvement projects, social service grants and economic development. The tax will generate about $10 million for capital improvements before it sunsets in 2010.
\
""Quite honestly, that's the only source of funding we have available that we could allocate to this right now,"" Gage said. ""Prior to the quarter-cent sales tax, it was a challenge just to maintain the same level (of street maintenance), because the gas tax is a flat amount. It really is a flat tax; it doesn't grow.
\
""Certainly, the cost of asphalt grows, the cost of concrete grows, the cost of construction grows, but the revenue source has remained stable. We really haven't been able to keep up.""
\
The city's share of gasoline taxes typically is used for street maintenance. Because it's a per-gallon tax, the increased cost of gas doesn't help generate more money. In fact, any drop in demand caused by the increased price of gas has a negative effect on the amount the city has to spend on streets.
\
In 2005, the city brought in about $1.5 million in gas tax. It budgeted for $1.6 million in 2006, but that number has since been revised to about $1.49 million.
\
Should the city commission approve the $1.5 million in quarter-cent sales tax for the transportation initiative, it would go toward:
\
* Additional street maintenance and sidewalk replacement
\
* Additional curb and gutter repair
\
* Streetscape/corridor aesthetic improvements
\
* Paving unpaved streets
\
Not eager to spend
\
While acknowledging somewhat of a need in that area, Marrs said he is leery about spending the quarter-cent sales tax.
\
""We still have to go back and remind everybody that the reason we initially enacted that was because we were losing some pass-through funds from the state,"" Marrs said. ""We did not cut anything out of the budget in the process of losing those funds, so I'm not real eager to just go and spend it because it's in the bank.""
\
Marrs said the city might have to apply part of the quarter-cent sales tax fund toward remediation of the groundwater contamination coming from the former Schilling Air Force Base. The contamination's been forecast to reach city water wells within eight years.
\
Local officials have been adamant that it's the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' responsibility to deal with the problem, which had been ongoing for years but only came to light publicly a year ago. Despite talks between local entities and the Corps, the Corps hasn't committed to address the problem.
\
A world of hurt
\
""We have this whole process with the Corps of Engineers that's not over til it's over, and I think the city's going to be on the hook for a big chunk of change before that's finished,"" Marrs said. ""I can't see letting it get worse than it already is. If we've got the ability to keep it where it's at and corral it and force the Corps to clean it up from there, I think we're better off than letting it march on while we're waiting for the Corps to do something.
\
""What reason does the Corps have to respond? They have drug their feet for how long now since the base closed (in 1965)? Why are they going to respond now?
\
""I think we've got to end this next year. We've got to make sure good progress is made, or we have to pursue them legally to do it.
\
""When you talk about a special sales tax, that's a pretty special thing, to protect our environment and protect our water source. We lose our water source, we're in a world of hurt.""

69,"
WASHINGTON - Still bruised by the summer battle over the debt ceiling, Congress reconvenes this week for what could be an equally painful confrontation over how to put Americans back to work.
\
Lawmakers returning to Washington after a monthlong recess are in accord on at least one thing: Jobs policy must be at the top of the agenda. But there's scant hope they will put aside their differences long enough to come up with legislation that makes measurable improvements either to the unemployment rate or Congress' dismal approval rate.
\
Even the main attraction of the first week back, President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress outlining his jobs policy, had to be pushed back a day, until Thursday. Republicans balked at letting Obama pre-empt their party's presidential debate on the first day the House is in session.
\
When Obama does get to the House podium, he's likely to get a cool reception from the GOP side of the aisle. Republicans may go along with tax break proposals but won't be friendly to ideas to extend jobless benefits or spend money on new construction projects.
\
House Republicans have prepared an autumn jobs agenda that centers on repealing what they say are job-destroying environmental and labor regulations. The first bill, slated for the week of Sept. 12, would prevent the National Labor Relations Board from restricting where an employer can locate in the United States. It grows out of a complaint issued by the NLRB that Boeing Co. was punishing union workers with plans to transfer an assembly line from Washington state to South Carolina.
\
The anti-regulation bills are likely to hit a dead end in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But the threat of them prompted Obama last week to scrap tougher Environmental Protection Agency regulations on ozone, a key ingredient of smog that causes asthma and other lung illnesses.
\
While talking jobs, lawmakers will have one eye on the initial meetings of the supercommittee established under legislation enacted in early August to increase the federal debt ceiling. The bipartisan committee has until Nov. 23 to come up with at least $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts. If it fails to do so or if Congress fails to approve its recommendations by Christmas, automatic spending cuts covering both defense and domestic programs would be triggered starting in 2013.
\
More immediately, Congress must stop itself from actually causing unemployment. Obama, in his address, is expected to urge lawmakers to act swiftly to renew aviation and surface transportation programs and avoid shutdowns that he said could put 1 million jobs at risk.
\
The Federal Aviation Administration has been operating on short-term extensions since 2007 because the House and Senate can't agree on a comprehensive plan for the future. Earlier this year, the FAA had to shut down for two weeks, resulting in tens of thousands of construction worker layoffs and $400 million in uncollected airline ticket taxes. The agency will shut down again on Sept. 16 unless Congress acts.
\
Similarly, the law that authorizes federal spending for highway and mass transit programs expires on Sept. 30. A stalemate there could disrupt collection of the 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal gas tax and have a far more devastating effect on construction jobs.
\
House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., said at the end of August that he would agree to one more short-term extension, the eighth, as he negotiates with the Senate on a long-term bill. Mica has proposed a six-year, $230 billion bill financed entirely by gasoline and diesel taxes. The Senate is calling for a two-year, $109 billion bill that would rely on $12 billion appropriated by Congress in addition to the fuel tax revenues.
\
Not all is negative on the congressional job front.
\
On its first day back today, the Senate will vote to move forward on the most extensive revamping of the patent system in six decades. Senate passage of the measure, already approved by the House, would send it to Obama, who agrees with most members of Congress that the legislation will make it easier for inventors to get their products to market and thus encourage hiring.
\
There's also some optimism that Congress will soon sign off on free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that have been in limbo since the George W. Bush administration.
\
Before the August break, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said they had agreed on a path forward for renewing a program that helps workers affected by foreign competition and passing the trade bills, and House Speaker John Boehner also promised a vote on the worker aid bill, which Obama says must be linked to the trade agreements.
\
The administration and supporters of the trade bills say they will generate tens of thousands of jobs. Some labor unions and other skeptics of free trade dispute that conclusion.
\
Also looming is the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, when Congress is supposed to have completed the 12 appropriation bills to fund federal agencies for the coming fiscal year 2012. So far the House has passed only half of those bills, and the Senate only one, and as in past years they will have to agree on temporary stopgap extensions to avoid a partial government shutdown.
\
Things are a little easier this year because the debt and budget pact sets the overall total for the 12 bills at $1.043 trillion, a $7 billion cut from current levels. Still, there will be heated debate as Democrats seek to restore cuts planned by Republicans to education, environment, foreign aid and other programs.
\
One such debate will be over funding the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has less than $800 million in its disaster fund as it faces the Hurricane Irene recovery operation. Democrats say emergency spending on natural disasters has never required repayment, but Republicans say that in this new age of austerity, disaster aid must be paid for with cuts to other federal spending.

70,"
This is the year for talk about which states are red and which ones are blue.
\
But in the midst of an energy crisis and rising concerns over carbon emissions, some are focused on a different color: green.
\
And in the past year, Kansas has been shaded as a murky brown.
\
In 2007, Forbes magazine ranked Kansas No. 31 when it comes to protecting the environment.
\
Environment America, in a report on the nation's clean energy policies, identified Kansas as one of 16 states where ""efforts lag significantly behind those in ... the rest of the country.""
\
In a state scorecard released by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, Kansas was No. 34, receiving poor marks for how much utilities spend on conservation, tax incentives, appliance standards and transportation policies.
\
One area where Kansas falls behind others, alternative energy advocates say, is the lack of compensation - known as net metering - that homeowners receive for the alternative energy they produce and do not use. That extra energy gets sent back into the electric grid.
\
""For Kansas, the matter now is not forward thinking; we are just trying to get into the 20th century,"" said Aron Cromwell, vice president and CEO of the Lawrence-based Cromwell Environmental.
\
Turning on the switch
\
According to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, Kansas is one of a half dozen states that don't have a net metering law.
\
The way most net metering laws work is that when customers who generate their own power, such as solar, generate more power than they actually use, they can in essence run their meter backward. But often the return is just less than half the true cost of the electricity, or roughly about 3 cents per kilowatt hour compared with a retail rate of about 7 cents.
\
Advocates for a net metering law would like the alternative energy producers to be paid the retail rate or something closer to that 7 cent marker.
\
""We have nothing in the state of Kansas to help us out,"" said Cromwell, who has installed photovoltaic and solar hot water panels in the region.
\
Net metering would encourage homeowners and particularly businesses to build larger solar power systems, he said.
\
Jim Ploger, manager of climate and energy programs for the Kansas Corporation Commission, said not having net metering discourages small wind and solar companies from selling their products here. Some vendors even ignore Kansas.
\
""The pay-out is so far out in the future, it's not economically viable,"" Ploger said.
\
More importantly, Ploger said, the very fact that Kansas doesn't have a net metering law can be a detractor for big-scale renewable energy businesses (like wind farms and turbine manufacturers) looking to locate to the state.
\
""We're not practicing what we preach. Net metering has no factor in commercial wind farms, but it is part of an image,"" he said.
\
Kansas and solar energy are a nice fit. The state has decent potential for capturing the sun's rays (not as strong as Arizona, but not as weak as New Hampshire). And, solar energy is often at its best when electric companies need it the most - on those 100-degree-plus days in August when air-conditioners are cranking.
\
Installing solar panels would help electric companies on those peak days.
\
""A few kilowatts here and few kilowatts there and pretty soon it starts to add up,"" Ploger said.
\
A good idea?
\
Not everyone believes that net metering is such a good idea or that it's fair. Among them is Dick Rohlfs, Westar Energy's director of retail rates.
\
Rohlfs agrees that electric companies should pay small alternative energy producers more than just the fuel costs. The reimbursement should also cover the savings from incremental operation and maintenance costs and the energy that is lost to get the electricity from the plant into the system.
\
But the retail price isn't a fair one either, he said.
\
Of Westar's 670,000 customers, only 50 to 60 of them produce energy that can be sent back into the electric grid. And, only around five produce more energy than what they take from Westar in a given month.
\
When the wind stops blowing and the sun no longer shines, those customers rely on Westar for backup energy. And they expect the company to have generation equipment and transmission lines to provide them with electricity, he said.
\
But, if those alternative energy producers were reimbursed at retail rates, that capacity is a cost they wouldn't be paying, Rohlfs said.
\
""We are there to serve them whenever they demand energy,"" Rohlfs said.
\
And David Springe, consumer counsel for the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board, is afraid it's a cost that will get passed along to everyone else who pays the electric bills. As the appointed representative for utility consumers, Springe sees net metering as a way to subsidize electricity for those who have the thousands of dollars to install solar panels.
\
Those who couldn't afford them would be on the losing end, Springe said.
\
If there are going to be subsidies, Springe said he would prefer they go toward energy conservation efforts for low-income housing.
\
State Rep. Tom Sloan, R-Lawrence, said there needs to be a middle ground.
\
""Yes we need to provide incentives to assist in meeting the total energy need. But we also need to recognize that a utility has the responsibility to be a provider of last resort. And they have costs associated with that responsibility,"" Sloan said.
\
From proposal to law
\
At the last legislative session, a net metering law for solar energy was proposed as part of a packaged energy deal. Overshadowed by the political fireworks from the proposed coal-fired power plant in Holcomb, it received little attention.
\
It wasn't the first time the matter was before state lawmakers. And Sloan suspects it will come back.
\
Cromwell is among those who would like the issue to return to the Capitol.
\
Cromwell testified before the Missouri Legislature, which passed a net metering law last year. He predicts that it will take more lobbying and funding before something similar is enacted in Kansas.
\
""It's just the beginning. It's just a small step,"" Cromwell said. ""But it's sad if we fall behind Missouri in our level of progressiveness.""

71,"By Angela Deines\THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\Homeowners and business owners who want to use renewable energy, such as wind or solar, now will be able to financially benefit from a law passed by state lawmakers last year and approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission this past summer.\The Senate substitute for HB 2369, known as the Net Metering and Easy Connection Act, allows business and residential utility consumers to get what is called a ""one to one"" payback from investor-owned utilities, such as Westar Energy, Empire and Kansas City Power & Light.\""It is dollar for dollar, penny for penny,"" said Bev Smalley, who helps her husband, Bill Smalley, operate Smalley Energy, an offshoot of the couple's Topeka-based heating and cooling business. ""Now it's retail value. If you produce 8 cents worth of energy, you get 8 cents back. That's true net metering.""\Through the process of net metering, utility consumers connect their renewable energy systems, such as a wind turbine or solar panels, to the utility's electric grid through a meter. If during the billing period the consumer generates more power than they use, the utility gives the consumer a credit for generating the surplus power.\The most common wind turbine Smalley Energy sells is a 45-foot-high Skystream model. Smalley said the tower and turbine costs about $18,000, but there is a $5,400 federal tax credit that brings the cost down to $12,600.\Kansas had been criticized for not adopting net metering sooner. However, many have argued that with less expensive utility costs than many other states, the payback for using renewable energy in Kansas is years, if not decades, into the future.\Still, Cara Sloan-Ramos, spokeswoman for the KCC, said with passage of the net metering law, the environmental benefits of using renewable energy sources outweigh the costs.\""I think any opportunity Kansans have to take advantage of net metering is a benefit to them and the environment,"" Sloan-Ramos said. ""We feel these regulations are still in the best interests of Kansans.""\Bill Smalley, who started Smalley Heating and Cooling in 1996, is active with the Wind for Schools program at Kansas State University. The program, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Center Laboratory, awards grants for schools to install wind turbines for instruction.\Smalley has volunteered with the program for the past three years, pouring the foundations and helping with the installation of Skystream turbines at some of the awarded schools. He was instrumental in helping Topeka's Hope Street Academy install a wind turbine on the school's property in April.\Having built his own air-to-air solar collector energy system in the 1970s for his own use, Smalley puts his belief of renewable energy into practice.\""Being energy-efficient and providing renewable energy is just common sense and good stewardship,"" he said.\As it stands now, residential-use wind turbines aren't allowed by ordinance within Topeka's city limits but are allowed through conditional-use permits. Currently, those turbines can't exceed 62 feet in height. Turbines outside the city, but in Shawnee County, are held to the same height requirement.\Both the city and county's planning directors say they are working on draft amendments to their ordinances that govern small wind systems. Both said the draft amendments, which first have to be presented to their respective planning commissions, would increase the current height restrictions and expand where small wind systems -- not wind farms -- can be used.\Angela Deines can be reached at (785) 295-1285 or angela.deines@cjonline.com."

74,"A bill to cut the reimbursement rate utility companies pay customers who feed energy back to the grid has gotten the attention of solar advocates. \Mark Moser, of Manhattan, is the inventor and owner of the Konza Solar Tracker, a device that moves solar panels with the sun to make them more efficient.

""As the proverbial solar tracking mustard seed, the Konza Solar Tracker will have to find more fertile ground to grow in elsewhere."" \Bills to end net metering have been introduced in the House and Senate and are supported by utility companies like Westar Energy and Kansas City Power and Light. \Mark Schreiber, Westar's executive director of government affairs, told legislators that under current law his company ""is paying net-metered customers a retail price for a wholesale commodity"" and that the 1-to-1 kilowatt credit doesn't account for infrastructure costs like power plants and power lines. \""When a customer generates some of his or her own power and gets paid the full retail rate of 10 cents, the result is that other customers pay his share of the cost of the entire infrastructure that he continues to use,"" Schreiber said. ""Rooftop solar systems don't remove a customer's reliance on the utility grid of power plants -- they just save fuel."" \The Vote Solar Initiative, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that helped push for California's net metering law, said the benefits outweigh the costs in that state by $92.2 million per year. \The organization acknowledged the cost of lessening utility company revenues used for infrastructure, but said customers who produce their own electricity save everyone money by lessening the amount of infrastructure needed within the grid, reducing the amount of electricity lost as it is transmitted over power lines, and preventing pollution. \""Actual costs and benefits are specific to each utility,"" a Vote Solar Initiative handout against the Kansas bills states. ""However, the size of California's solar market and its unique tiered rate structure make it a strong test bed for the economics of net metering. A net benefit in California indicates a likely net benefit in other states as well."" \Schreiber said the bills before the Legislature would still compensate consumers ""at a premium for their excess electricity"" but lower the reimbursement to the ""utility's avoided cost"" rather than the ""full retail price."" \Otherwise, Schreiber said his company might be forced to raise rates on customers who don't generate their own electricity, as the number of those who do rises. \""We are already seeing an increase in the number of net-metering applications we receive each month,"" Schreiber said. \Senate Bill 280 is in the Senate Utilities Committee, while its counterpart, House Bill 2458, is in the House Energy and Environment Committee. \Kansas Interfaith Power and Light, a group of religious leaders against climate change, has made the net-metering bills a top priority, alongside measures to roll back renewable standards that fizzled in the Legislature last year but are expected to reappear. \Meanwhile, the coal industry is weighing in more broadly with a study titled ""Energy Cost Impacts on Kansas Families."" Mike Duncan, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity in Washington, D.C., said in a news release that renewable energy is driving up costs. \""As we have witnessed throughout this historically cold winter, a rapid shift to fuel sources that are less reliable, less abundant and more costly than coal for electricity generation has severely undermined American families' access to affordable heat when they need it most,"" Duncan said. ""For the good of all Kansas families, we must work together to fully take advantage of all the abundant, low-cost resources within our borders."" \But Moser told legislators that the cost of solar energy is dropping due to devices like his, while the costs of burning fossil fuels like coal go beyond power generation and include health and environmental damage. \""The rest of the planet is going solar now,"" Moser said. ""When the coal dust finally settles and we are done with the age of fossil fuels your names will be attached to this monumental transition that our global civilization must now make.""\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
75,"A House committee unexpectedly tabled Tuesday a ""net metering"" bill that worried solar power advocates, but the committee chairman said it could return. \The House Energy and Environment Committee's 9-7 vote put the bill on hold, but Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, said it still ""can come off the table"" at some point. \""The vote surprised me, and we were short a couple of people who probably would have voted against the motion to table,"" said Hedke, the committee chairman. \House Bill 2458 would end net metering, which requires utility companies to compensate homeowners with a one kilowatt credit for every one kilowatt they put back on the grid through solar panels or other means. \Utility companies testified for the bill, saying a lower level of compensation would be more fair because homeowners who generate some of their own electricity still benefit from the infrastructure of the energy grid. \Rep. Tom Moxley, R-Council Grove, said that may be a consideration for the state down the road, but private power generation by solar panels or other means is still rare and the amount of kilowatt credits utility companies are handing out is small. \""I think the upshot is, there's no pressing need for this bill,"" Moxley said.\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"

Salina Journal
\
It took more than six months to work out the details, but a change in Saline County code that will allow individuals to install their own wind-generated energy systems received final approval Tuesday.
\
The Saline County Commission unanimously approved the amendment, which will accommodate about a half-dozen people who have approached Planning and Zoning Director Vicki Koepsel in the past year about installing their own wind systems.
\
County resident Richard Nelson told commissioners that he primarily uses propane and wood-burning appliances to heat his home, but said he would like to convert to wind.
\
""I'm getting older, and someday I might not be able to cut firewood,"" Nelson told commissioners Craig Stephenson, Sherri Barragree and Randy Duncan. ""Even though I won't pay for this in my lifetime, (wind energy) is still something I can utilize to reduce my utility bills, and then pass it on to somebody else.""
\
Koepsel said she developed the new regulations in response to the requests she has received from people and because of the national shift away from oil, which is selling at record highs, and coal, which is believed to be harmful to the environment.
\
""As costs associated with the use of conventional energy resources like oil, coal and natural gas continue to increase, renewable energy alternatives become more and more attractive to consumers,"" Koepsel wrote in her report to the commission, which she presented at Tuesday's meeting. ""Until recently, however, renewable energy was more expensive than conventional fuels. However, with advances in technology, renewable energy is now saving consumers money.""
\
The amendment to county code means that those who wish to install wind energy systems no longer have to obtain conditional-use permits, which cost about $150 and take about two months to obtain. Conditional-use permits must be reviewed by and receive approval from the county planning commission.
\
The amendment also sets out various regulations for such operations, including:
\
-- One single turbine shall be permitted for all legal lots of record in unincorporated Saline County up to 80 acres in size.
\
-- The total height of any single turbine shall not exceed 200 feet.
\
-- The lowest point of the rotor blades shall be 25 feet above ground level at the base of the facility.
\
-- Turbine markings and lighting must meet Federal Aviation Administration requirements.
\
-- Wind facilities shall maintain a galvanized finish or be painted a color in conformance with the surrounding environment, such as white, gray, pale blue or pale green.
\
It took a long time
\
Sidney Shultz, who has been critical of Stephenson and Barragree and will run against Stephenson in this fall's elections, chided the commission for taking so long to approve the measure. The county commission considered the amendment in December but sent it back to the county planning commission for fine-tuning.
\
""I don't know why we would drag our feet at all for this kind of energy,"" Shultz said. ""We've got wind, and we've always had wind in Kansas. We've got to use it.""
\
""I think we've all been proponents of wind energy,"" Stephenson responded. ""We wanted to make sure we did it right so there wasn't a problem with your neighbors.
\
""We need to promote it as much as we can. Talking to the three county commissioners is not the real place where the discussion needs to take place. True net metering is where it needs to take place. The state legislators need to get off their duffs and get something done on true net metering.""
\
Net metering is a method of metering the energy consumed and produced by home wind generators that allows owners to get full reimbursement for excess electricity produced. Federal law allows utilities to purchase individual producers' excess energy at the wholesale price, rather than retail price. Net metering gives producers credit for excess energy at the higher retail rate.

77,"The top Democrat on the House Energy and Environment Committee warned members of her party Monday that another push to repeal renewable energy standards may be coming. \The House voted 44-77 last week against the Senate-passed proposal to eliminate the standards that require the state's utility companies to glean 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. \But Rep. Annie Kuether, D-Topeka, told her colleagues during a Democratic meeting that she doesn't believe supporters of the repeal effort will allow it to die. \""They're going to try something,"" Kuether said. \Kuether speculated that the repeal bill could be attached as an amendment to another bill related to renewable energy. The most likely candidate, she said, is a bill to alter ""net metering,"" a state policy that refunds consumers who put energy back on the grid using devices like solar power on a kilowatt-per-kilowatt basis. \Kuether emphasized that she hadn't heard anything from the chairman of the House energy committee, Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita. \When asked Monday if the repeal bill might be attached to the net metering measure, Hedke said he had no comment. \Americans for Prosperity, a free market advocacy group, has made repealing the renewable standards a top priority this year, running a six-figure statewide TV and radio ad blitz. A spokesman for the group has said it isn't ready to throw in the towel this session. \Karin Brownlee, a former legislator who is now spokesperson for the group Kansans for Wind Energy, said those who support maintaining the standards remain vigilant. \""There's a fair amount of fervor on the other side,"" Brownlee said. ""We'll continue to be very watchful and talk to legislators to make sure they're educated."" \Brownlee said tacking the repeal measure onto the net metering bill would be a risky maneuver that could scuttle both measures. \Kuether said the net metering bill was a compromise between both sides and a ""hard-fought agreement"" but her instructions to the Democrats were clear in the event it is paired with another attempt to repeal the Renewable Portfolio Standards. \""If the RPS goes on it, kill it,"" Kuether said. ""Just like last time.""\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
78,"Kansas has more than 27,000 jobs in the clean energy sector with a projected growth of 2.3 percent employment over the next 12 months, but the state is lagging behind others in the region. \A ""Clean Jobs Midwest"" report released Tuesday highlighted the clean energy employment sector in 12 Midwestern states. Overall, the region reported almost 569,000 jobs, with projected employment growth of 4.4 percent. \Kansas and Indiana both had below-average predicted growth in the sector, said Ian Adams, director of public affairs for the Chicago nonprofit Clean Energy Trust, which released the report along with Environmental Entrepreneurs and other partners. Missouri leads with a projected growth of 8.3 percent. \""This sector is large, and it's growing in every state,"" Adams said. \The report, which Adams called the most comprehensive look at the state's energy employment sector to date, found 89.2 percent of the Kansas jobs are in energy efficiency, which includes work in HVAC, lighting, Energy Star appliances and advanced building materials. About 1,780 people, or 6.59 percent, work in renewable energy; 2.02 percent in clean fuels; 1.74 percent in advanced transportation; and 0.46 percent in advanced grid. \Aron Cromwell, of Cromwell Environmental, saw his business grow 33 to 35 percent last year in numbers of employees and revenue, he said. It is a pattern that occurred in 2014, too. \""We've had a very good amount of growth in the last few years,"" he said. ""There's certainly nothing to complain about for us in that area. Most of our work these days is in Kansas. We've worked in about a dozen states solar-wise, but 95 percent of our work right now is in the state of Kansas."" \The solar work done by Cromwell Environmental is split about 50/50 between residential and commercial clients, he said. Customers fall into three basic groups. \""You've got people who are interested in saving money, and you've got people who are interested in helping to save the environment, and then we've got a third group of customers who are interested in being independent,"" he said. \For Manhattan businessman Marc Cameron, operations manager at Diamond Roofing, a solar division opened by his company about five years ago took off too slowly. The business was initially strong, he said, and Diamond put solar panels on a school in the Kansas City area and did a lot of work in Greensburg as the town rebuilt after a tornado. But Cameron cited the state's lack of support for green energy as one reason business dried up enough that his company closed its solar division. \Solar Power Rocks, a business that promotes solar power usage, ranks each state for its solar energy policies and costs. It gives Kansas a D on its 2016 policies. \""Lately, though, the state has been taking 1 step forward and 15 or 20 steps backward on clean power,"" the website said. ""In 2015, the state's Renewable Energy Portfolio standard was repealed, and a voluntary system was put into place. This leaves the utility companies free to keep charging ever-increasing rates, while they shore up their own giant wind and solar farms, instead of helping homeowners take control of their energy future."" \Cameron said he is hopeful the market will revive as more private money becomes available for people to invest as they recover from the recession. \""Whether or not it revives to the point of being sustainable without significant government or public funding is the question that everyone has,"" he said. \Adams agreed that state policies have an impact. \""Smart policy can accelerate job creation,"" he said. ""In particular, state-level renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency resource standards help drive investment in this sector and create jobs."" \Cameron said he isn't as concerned about energy policies as he is about working with the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities, to maintain net metering in the state. Net metering allows people generating energy through solar or wind to connect to public utilities, and whatever power they don't use is transferred to the utility to offset their energy costs. \Cameron said he and other solar companies have been ""battling"" to keep net metering in place for years. On net metering, Solar Power Rocks gives Kansas a B, one of the few grades above a D the state received. \""As an industry, we're creating good jobs,"" Cameron said. ""We don't want a massive tax credit in the state. We just want to be allowed to compete with the energy monopolies that exist here."" \Cromwell Environmental employs 32 people.\Credit: Morgan Chilson morgan.chilson@cjonline.com"
79,"As the House Energy and Environment Committee finished a hearing on a bill that would repudiate President Barack Obama's climate change plan, one representative expressed frustration at the amount of time the committee has spent debating climate issues. \""It's a little disappointing that we can't come to some scientific certainty about some of these issues,"" Rep. Russell Jennings, R-Lakin, said. ""We heard last year from scientists on this issue, seemingly endlessly, as I recall, with charts and graphs on both sides."" \Jennings said he wondered if the committee could come to some consensus on the president's plan without including an overarching statement about climate change itself. \""There's somewhere in the middle here where I think we can all agree,"" Jennings said. \But agreement on the committee remains elusive -- on whether human-caused climate change exists and on the appropriateness of renewable energy mandates. \Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, the chairman of the committee and a climate change skeptic, led an unsuccessful effort to roll back the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards last year. \Hedke's committee has added two new members this year who could be more sympathetic to that cause and Americans for Prosperity has bankrolled a statewide television and radio ad blitz, but there appears to be no guarantee of victory for RPS repeal this session either. \Last week Hedke's committee tabled a bill to eliminate ""net metering"" -- the requirement that utility companies compensate kilowatt-for-kilowatt customers who put energy back on the grid through methods like solar power. \Hedke said that bill isn't dead, but the 9-7 vote to table it surprised him. \The renewable energy standards, passed in 2009, require the state's utility companies to get 20 percent of what they produce from renewable sources by 2020. \Proponents say utilities are having little trouble reaching that goal, thanks largely to a wind energy boom that has driven commerce to parts of the state starved for it. \Those who want to repeal the standards say they aren't against wind, they just don't like government mandates. They also say the standards are driving up energy bills. \The Kansas Corporation Commission testified that two of the state's largest utilities, Kansas City Power and Light and Westar, reported rate increases of ""less than 1 percent"" and 1.7 percent, respectively, due to purchasing wind power. \Attempts to repeal the renewable standards last year failed in part because of moderate Republicans like Rep. Marshall Christmann, R-Lyons, who consistently voted with Democrats to keep them in place. \During the legislative session, Christmann was shuttling back and forth from Topeka to Pratt County, in his district, where local zoning decisions were paving the way for energy giant BP to build a wind farm. \In March, with the session underway and RPS repeal on the table, BP suddenly pulled its permit application. \""Which of course scared me,"" Christmann said. ""I want those jobs."" \Christmann said he didn't know if BP's decision was prompted by the RPS repeal talks, but he wasn't taking any chances. \The wind project was slated to produce 500 jobs for up to four years. That represents more than 5 percent of the population in Pratt County, which, as of August 2013, had an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent. \""Every time I voted and revoted and voted again, it was always with my district in mind,"" Christmann said. \BP is now ""back in the game"" in Pratt County, Christmann said, but he is no longer on the energy and environment committee. \He and Rep. Phil Hermanson were replaced by Rep. Joe Seiwert, R-Pretty Prairie, and Rep. Ken Corbet, R-Topeka. Hermanson was replaced because he resigned from the Legislature. \Christmann said his reassignment to the House Veterans, Military and Homeland Security Committee, while not unsavory, wasn't his decision. \Christmann received a one-sentence email from House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, announcing the move. \Merrick's spokeswoman, Rachel Whitten, said it was part of the normal shuffling that occurred in a House chamber that lost seven members from the year before. \""Once you make one adjustment, it's kind of like a domino (effect) in the other committees,"" Whitten said. \Christmann said he is still tracking the renewable standards issue as one that is important to his district. \He also said he has heard the commercials ripping the standards and attempting to tie them to former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and the federal health care reforms she is leading that are unpopular in Kansas. \""Somebody is spending a lot of money,"" Christmann said. \Jeff Glendening, the state director of Americans for Prosperity, said that repealing the renewable standards remains a high priority for his organization and he would be ""disappointed"" if the Legislature doesn't take another crack at it this year. \""We see it as a free market issue,"" Glendening said. \There have been no hearings scheduled on it yet, but Glendening said he believes that will change. \""We fully expect it to be an issue this session,"" Glendening said. ""We just don't know when."" \Forbes and other news outlets have reported that Americans for Prosperity is funded in part by Charles and David Koch, Wichita brothers who have made billions in the oil and natural gas industry. \Hedke himself has ties to that industry, as a contract geophysicist who has worked for dozens of regional oil and gas producers. \He has said that his views on climate change are based on careful consideration of the scientific evidence and he believes in protecting the environment. \But his views clashed with environmental groups like the Kansas Sierra Club at the hearing on Obama's climate plan, where he took the unusual step of testifying at a hearing he chaired. He also found himself opposite environmentalists when he testified Thursday for a bill to encourage completion of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. \The pipeline hearing was in another committee, but the one on net metering was also in Hedke's and some members of his committee seem burnt out on the debate over fossil fuels versus renewable energy. \Rep. Julie Menghini, D-Pittsburg, asked if committee members were ""just spinning our wheels"" by spending over an hour debating whether to protest Obama's climate plan. \""Do you really think passing this achieves any practical action or purpose?"" Menghini asked. \""Well, I hope it will open some people's eyes and minds to attempt to understand that not everyone agrees with the president's climate action plan,"" Hedke said. \""I think everyone understands that,"" Menghini said.\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
80,"The Hutchinson News, June 2:\New federal and Kansas incentives for residential and other small-scale wind generation likely won't cause homeowners to rush to start erecting their own wind turbines, but that now is a more feasible possibility.\Installing a small wind turbine to generate electricity for a home or small business is more cost sensible now. For one, federal economic stimulus legislation has removed the cap on a 30 percent tax credit for installation of renewable energy systems -- not only wind generation but also solar water heaters, photovoltaic cells, fuel cells and geothermal heat pumps.\A separate federal grant and loan program, meanwhile, is available for commercial and agricultural industries that install renewable energy systems.\And the big Kansas development is the enactment of net metering. This allows a homeowner to receive credit from his power company for excess electricity generated from a wind turbine. ...\While this is progress, the environment for residential wind generation still leaves more to be desired.\One is expansion of the state net metering law. ... Also still needed are changes in county and city zoning laws to facilitate residential turbines. These don't need to be so liberal that every household could put up a wind turbine but at least make it possible on larger lots -- regulations are being drafted for the city of Hutchinson, for example, for lots of one-half acre and larger -- and rural acreages.\A residential wind turbine isn't for everyone, and densely populated areas should be served by commercial wind farms -- as well as, of course, coal and other traditional power plants.\But if we are going to get consumers on board, the laws, regulations and zonings need to create the opportunity."
81,"
Kansas is not attracting investments in wind turbine fabrication plants and related businesses because many other states, including Iowa, Texas, California, Minnesota and Colorado, have passed legislation to draw that type of commerce. Iowa alone has three wind turbine fabrication plants either finished or being built. Kansas has none.
\
Those states I mentioned have renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and net metering laws in place. For example, Colorado's RPS law states that their utilities must be producing 10 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2015. And California has a true net metering law, meaning that when users with generating capacity produce more electricity than they use, their meters run backwards.
\
Although we live in a state that is one of the top three in the nation in wind energy potential, our heavily lobbied state government continues to give incentives to coal and nuclear energy interests. We may even build a couple of coal-fired plants, using precious Kansas water, and then sell that power to Colorado. If that happens, you can forget about any wind industry manufacturing coming to Kansas.
\
Is the premise of Thomas Frank's book, ""What's the Matter with Kansas,"" correct in suggesting that we continue to elect people who then vote for special interests and against their constituents' economic wellbeing?
\
For the past five years the wind industry has been growing at an average of 26 percent a year worldwide. The Vestas company a few months ago announced it will build a wind turbine fabrication plant in Colorado. The wind farm going up near Ellsworth and the recently announced system to be built near Concordia both will use Vestas wind turbines. Guess the location of the plant supplying that equipment?
\
Texas, with a slight edge over Kansas in wind potential, now has 3,352 megawatts of generating capacity installed, compared to 364 megawatts for Kansas. In August, Shell WindEnergy and Luminant announced plans to build a 3,000 megawatt wind farm with a compressed air storage system that will bring the total Texas capacity to more than 6,000 megawatts. Kansas' stated goal of 1,000 megawatts by 2010 and 2,000 megawatts by 2020 seems anemic at best.
\
A CNBC video report from the Wind Power Conference this year in Las Vegas noted that what is holding back the wind industry is a supply problem. The supply chain for wind turbines is about two years behind demand. Because the units are very large, it is more economical to have fabrication plants near where wind farms are built to cut shipping costs. So while we sit on our thumbs here in Kansas, surrounding states are attracting investments in the manufacturing side of this industry.
\
Almost all of the wind energy produced in Kansas is exported out of state. Any new wind farms that come online will sell the bulk of their energy east of Kansas because that is the greatest market.
\
A 1991 Department of Energy research project showed that Kansas could annually produce up to 1,070 billion kilowatt hours of electricity using the technology available at that time. If Kansas were to use the older technology, our state could produce about a quarter of all current electrical generation in the U.S. The average utility wind turbine installed in California in 1991 was rated at 300 kilowatts. The wind turbines that will be used near Concordia are rated at 3 megawatts, which is 10 times the power capability of the older turbines.
\
The Kansas wind energy potential is huge. Our state's utilities now produce less than 5 percent of our state's potential.
\
Critics say wind energy can't be stored for periods when the wind isn't blowing. However, there is a plant in Alabama and another in Germany that store electrical energy in the form of compressed air. Iowa is building an underground compressed-air storage facility to produce electricity when the winds die down, and another is planned for Texas. Kansas has some 6,000 depleted gas wells that store natural gas under pressure. Technologically, it is not a stretch to think we could store wind energy like Iowa and Texas are going to do.
\
Successful communities exploit their abundant resources and conserve their limited assets. We seem to be doing just the opposite as coal-fired plants are planned for western Kansas that will use our scarce water and foul our air. Forty Republican lawmakers have signed a letter of support for this Sunflower Electric Power Corp. project and sent it to Secretary Bremby at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. This is an embarrassment. I can't believe a majority of Kansans want a coal-fired generating facility built anywhere in our state while neglecting an obvious clean resource blowing overhead.

Topeka - Fight or compromise?
\
After Gov. Kathleen Sebelius vetoed legislation Friday that would authorize the construction of two coal-fired power plants, legislative leaders vowed to try to push for votes to override the veto.
\
That could set the stage for a dramatic showdown between the Legislature and Sebelius over the issue that has dominated the legislative session and attracted national attention in the debate over climate change and the effect of carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired electric generation plants.
\
""I strongly disagree with the governor on this very important public policy issue,"" said Senate President Steve Morris, R-Hugoton.
\
Sebelius made good on her promise Friday to strike down the legislation, saying the bill would harm the environment, jeopardize Kansans' health and lead to higher electric rates for customers. Along with the veto, Sebelius signed an executive order establishing an advisory panel of business leaders, energy experts and scientists to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Kansas.
\
""Instead of building two new coal plants, which would produce 11 million tons of carbon dioxide each year, I support pursuing other, more promising energy and economic development alternatives,"" Sebelius said.
\
Support for plants
\
Supporters of the two 700-megawatt units in southwestern Kansas decried Sebelius' position, saying the project would be the cleanest coal-fired facility in the state, comply with all existing regulations and benefit the economy.
\
""Not allowing clean coal technology to be part of Kansas' energy future will result in a devastating increase in the average Kansan's electric bill,"" Morris said.
\
Hays-based Sunflower Electric Power Corp. and two out-of-state companies proposed building the $3.6 billion plants near Holcomb. Under the proposal, about 85 percent of the power would be sold to customers outside of Kansas.
\
Last October, Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Roderick Bremby denied permits for the project, citing concerns about carbon dioxide emissions and their effect on climate change.
\
Legislators approved a bill that would essentially require that the permits for the plants be given and strip Bremby of much of his environmental authority.
\
Counting override votes
\
After the veto Friday, Morris and House Speaker Melvin Neufeld, R-Ingalls, said they would try to get the two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate that would be needed to override Sebelius' action. But neither said when they would try the overrides.
\
The legislation - House substitute for Senate Bill 327 - passed with more than a two-thirds majority in the 40-member Senate, 31-7, but fell short of the 84 votes needed in the 125-member House when it was adopted, 75-47.
\
State Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, voted against the bill and said the time is now for supporters of the plants to negotiate with Sebelius.
\
""We've squandered a lot of time trying to tie it to an issue of just these two coal plants instead of talking about where we need to go in terms of a statewide energy program,"" Francisco said.
\
But state Sen. Roger Pine, R-Lawrence, who has voted for the bill, said legislative leaders should conduct an override vote.
\
""I think that the Legislature has truly tried to come up with something that while, yes, it includes a coal-fired plant, it also includes some of the things that we need to do to have an energy policy in place, and have wind and other forms of renewables,"" Pine said.
\
House Democratic Leader Dennis McKinney of Greensburg also has voted for the bill but believes another piece of proposed legislation will be forthcoming that will include more ""green things.""
\
Francisco said an override attempt also opens up the legislative process to more arm-twisting and deal-making that may not be in the state's best interest.
\
""I would be concerned there would be an even greater attempt to limit other initiatives from going forward again over this single bill that addresses only 200 megawatts of energy for Kansas,"" she said.
\
In the past, Sebelius has offered to support one 660-megawatt coal-fired unit and a commitment from Sunflower Energy to increase wind power and make other environmental concessions. She said the deal is still there.
\
""I am hopeful that some serious consideration can now occur,"" she said.
\
Sunflower officials have refused the offer, saying it wasn't economically feasible.
\
Sierra Club statement regarding Governor Sebelius' decision to veto SB 327
\
The Sierra Club is pleased with Governor Sebelius' decision to veto energy bill 327 today. Kansas is in a unique position to demonstrate leadership in addressing climate change.
\
From a statewide poll that demonstrated support for Secretary Bremby's decision to deny Sunflower an air quality permit, to the hundreds of people who participated in Clean Energy Day this month, it's clear Kansans want clean energy and our state leaders should honor this wish by upholding the Governor's veto. The Governor's decision will allow Kansas to prepare for expected federal carbon regulations while protecting the environment, health and economy of Kansas. While other states are moving away from outdated energy technology and making efforts to reduce their carbon emissions, it would be unfair of Kansas to counteract their efforts by adding two coal plants that would collectively emit 11 million tons of carbon dioxide per year.
\
Statement from the Holcomb Station Expansion Project
\
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius today vetoed comprehensive energy legislation overwhelmingly approved by the Kansas Legislature.
\
Senate Bill 327 has broad support from Kansas business and industry, agriculture, labor, and most importantly, Kansas citizens who agree that sound energy policies are necessary.
\
""I am certainly disappointed by the Governor's veto,"" Earl Watkins, Sunflower's president and CEO said. ""This compromise bill was the result of many months of hard work by Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate. The legislation protects our environment, supports renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, and restores confidence in government.""
\
""If not overturned, this veto will unnecessarily raise electric rates for Kansas families and punish our Kansas workers and industries,"" Watkins said. ""We are experiencing significant growth on the Sunflower system, and we must add new coal generation to support our existing natural gas and wind generation assets.""
\
Earnie Lehman, Midwest Energy's president and general manager, agreed that failure of the bill will have a negative effect throughout the state.
\
""The governor's veto fails to meet our customers' need for reliable, efficient, and cost-effective around-the-clock energy,"" said Lehman. ""Midwest Energy's leadership in securing wind energy and expanding energy efficiency and conservation programs is simply not enough to meet our consumers' energy needs.""
\
""Quick action by Kansas legislators will allow us to keep existing businesses, attract new ones, and grow the economy while ensuring our environment is protected,"" said Brian Moline, chairman of the Alliance for Sound Energy Policy. ""This bill offers Kansas, for the first time, real progress on alternative energy -a renewable portfolio standard for our state's utilities, support for energy efficiency programs, and net metering. It is regrettable the Governor has passed up the opportunity to enact these reforms.""

Coal decision on target
\
Dear Gov. Sebelius: Thank you for having the courage to support the Department of Health and Environment's decision to deny Sunflower Electric Cooperative's request to build the coal power plant at Holcomb. I applaud your leadership to put peoples' health and wellbeing ahead of ""growth at all costs."" Building coal-fired power plants that would pollute the air with mercury, sulfur dioxides, fly ash aerosols and carbon dioxide, while using water from an arid area, with 85 percent of the electricity produced going outside Kansas, defies common sense.
\
If we could all reduce our wasteful consumption habits (U.S. citizens use more than twice as much energy as anyone else on Earth) and apply conservation practices we would save ourselves money and reduce the need for additional electric power plants. Germany has net metering and passed a National Energy Savings Act that provides their citizens incentives to install solar and wind electrical generation. As a consequence, Germany is well on its way to meet its declared goal of using 20 percent renewable energy by 2020.
\
Hope for a sustainable future is still possible if we all do everything we can do toward that end. Your action is the right thing to do and exemplifies the Quaker saying, ""Let Your Life Speak.""

A rush to judgment
\
I'm writing to comment on the (Oct. 29) letter to the editor entitled ""Aid Given Too Freely."" This letter was in reference to Emergency Aid-Food Bank and the concern that some are taking advantage of the aid they're receiving.
\
I wonder if the author has ever visited, volunteered or needed the food bank. Many biases often are made without ever having been with those we pass judgment upon. The author cites numbers as proof the food bank is being abused. However, numbers never tell the whole story. I experience both sides -- those who abuse the system and those who need the system. You can't have one without the other. This holds true for any system, profit or nonprofit. Knowing this, when we give as a society we should give from a place of nonjudgment.
\
The writer further admonished those who qualify for food stamps, but still use the food bank. We read the statistics but do we see those who actually receive aid? Those who use the food bank must show employee pay stubs and paid receipts for utilities. In doing so, they must prove they're deserving. Consider yourself fortunate if you've never had to prove you are in need of aid.
\
As we enter the holiday season, please remember the true intention of giving.

An economy of government
\
The city and Saline County spat regarding storage v. office space serves to recall a Journal item some months ago reporting that private sector employment showed little or no improvement for 2006, but some 2,500 new jobs in Kansas resulted from governmental hiring at local, county, state and federal levels.
\
To this senior citizen, the Salina-Saline County ado exemplified our present day uncivil society, to wit:
\
1. Diverse, ever bickering, impolite hoards whose egos run rampant and all have unfettered rights to the exclusion of rights for all. This phenomenon being due in part to the Supreme Court, Congress, Statehouse, courthouse and city hall -- and, yes, the ACLU (Anti Civilized Litigation Unlimited). The extent of this societal turmoil is observable in the courtroom, classroom, resource-officer-patrolled hallways, parking lot contraband-sniffing dogs, churches and even funerals.
\
2. The ""new"" employee out of office space represents the ever-political socialist economy based on ever-increasing governmental hirings, indexing and subsidizing creating a quivering house-of-cards economy. (Russia knows)
\
Out here in the Buffalo Commons, a county populated by some 3,700 with a primary economy of agriculture is grossly enhanced by new governmental employees, the most recent being a global information system administrator. This addition is merely one of some 200 city, county, state, school and federal employees -- or one for every 185 residents.
\
There is, out here, an abundance of vacant structures on our Main Street to accommodate Salina's now and foreseeable future requirements.
\
We are in dire need of economic development and revitalization.

Recall your school lessons
\
This is in response to the Journal's Nov. 5 front-page article ""Sunflower fights coal and Sebelius,"" pro-coal opinions and the back page ad ""Smiling Men.""
\
I admonish pro-coal advocates to simply recall elementary and middle school life cycle-food chain science, and maybe philosophy 101, as you consider environment, global warming and survival of living species.
\
If tomorrow all humans were dead, how would that affect planet Earth? The Earth would survive nice without us, thank you very much.
\
If tomorrow all insects were dead, how would that affect planet Earth? Insects pollinate plants, animals eat plants and other animals, humans eat plants and animals. Therefore, without insects humans would soon be extinct.
\
However, since humans presumably have the most developed brain of all living s pecies, we should have the ability, by virtue of our choices, to lengthen or shorten our survival time.
\
I therefore admonish Sunflower Electric and the Kansas Legislature to accept the forward-thinking leadership of the Sebelius administration's rejection of more coal-fired plants.
\
Furthermore, moving vigorously toward even more wind energy has the greatest potential for erasing the ""smiles"" of Putin, Chavez, Ahmadinejad, and Cheney as we use less oil and natural gas from the Middle East and less coal from Wyoming.

Press use irresponsible
\
Your constant harping on freedom of the press is an insult to anyone of average intelligence. The example of Federal Emergency Management Agency actions you mention in Monday's paper borderlines on a criminal offense. Nothing to do with freedom of speech.
\
Most reporters use the First Amendment as license to reveal military intelligence secrets and other sensitive information with impunity. One good example was the release by the press the fact that our military was monitoring the cell phones of Osama bin Laden and his cohorts. A valuable source of information. Guess what? Correct, the source dried up. You can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater when there is no fire. How long is it going to be before the press challenges that on the basis of an infringement on free speech?
\
I think the First Amendment, as it pertains to reporters, should be changed to ""Guarantee of Irresponsibility.""

84,"
TOPEKA - (AP) - A bill allowing two coal-fired power plants in southwest Kansas easily won House approval Tuesday, but supporters still were searching for the votes they need to make sure it can survive a potential veto by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
\
The vote was 77-45.
\
Supporters want legislation that can pass with a two-thirds majority, or 84 of 125 votes, which is what they would need to override a veto. But they were seven votes short, with three House members not voting.
\
The bill's backers will get at least one more chance, however. The Senate approved its own measure last week, and three senators and three House members must draft a final, compromise version for both chambers to consider.
\
Sebelius' administration is blocking plans by Sunflower Electric Power Corp. to build the two plants outside Holcomb, in Finney County. The $3.6 billion project has bipartisan legislative support, and both chambers' bills would allow the Hays-based utility to move ahead.
\
The House bill includes ""green"" provisions, such as a mandate that utilities generate 5 percent of their electricity by 2012 from renewable resources such as wind. Such provisions are designed to pick up votes from House members who worry that carbon dioxide emissions from new coal-fired plants would contribute to global warming.
\
The House debated the bill for three hours Monday before giving it first-round approval on a 73-45 vote. They picked up four votes overnight, but seven members had failed to vote Monday.
\
House Speaker Melvin Neufeld, an Ingalls Republican who supports Sunflower's project, said Monday that he is confident House and Senate negotiators can draft something that will get a two-thirds majority, but he didn't speculate on its contents.
\
""The speaker's going to have to do a little trading,"" said Rep. Bill Light, a Republican from Rolla who also supports Sunflower's project.
\
Sunflower and labor unions, which support the project because of its potential construction jobs, continued to lobby Monday for the bill. Earl Watkins, Sunflower's chief executive officer, said: ""We're very encouraged with where we are.""
\
Neufeld and other supporters describe the measure as comprehensive energy policy. It includes provisions designed to encourage consumers to use small, solar-powered systems to generate their own electricity. There's also the renewable-resources mandate for utilities.
\
But the bill's critics still argued that its only real purpose was to see that Sunflower builds its plants.
\
Rep. Joshua Svaty, an Ellsworth Democrat, said legislators eventually must lessen the state's heavy reliance on coal-fired plants, which provide about 75 percent of Kansas' electricity.
\
""There's a lot said at the end of this debate about how this is a forward-thinking energy policy for the state, and I'm trying to find it in the bill,"" Svaty said.
\
In a statement, Sebelius said: ""Unfortunately, it looks like the final House version has less encouragement for either wind energy or carbon mitigation and further restricts the ability of the secretary of health and environment to protect the environment or the health of Kansans.""
\
Both the House and the Senate bills would prevent the secretary, the state's top environmental regulator, from imposing new emissions standards without legislative approval.
\
In October, Secretary Rod Bremby denied an air-quality permit for Sunflower's project, noting that state law gives a secretary the power to protect the environment and saying the state can't ignore the dangers of global warming.
\
Many legislators believe Bremby exceeded his authority. Also, he denied the permit after his staff said Sunflower's application met the technical requirements of state and federal air-quality laws.
\
The House Energy and Utilities Committee originally opted for softer restrictions on the secretary's power. But the House voted 72-47 to make them tougher.
\
""Sunflower went through all the hoops and the hurdles up to the very last one, and then the rules got changed,"" said committee chairman Carl Dean Holmes, a Republican from Liberal.

85,"ATLANTA -- Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe on Monday called opponents to the extension of a federal tax break for the wind industry ""unAmerican."" \He made his remarks at the WindPower convention, which has a projected 12,000 attendees. \""Anyone standing in the way of this industry, frankly, they're unAmerican,"" he said. \The industry is seeking a five-year extension to a tax break set to expire at the end of this year. \Industry officials note the production tax credits have bipartisan support. Democrats like Beebe and President Barack Obama favor the extension. \It also has backing from Republicans like Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, who also addressed the convention and called for renewal of the production tax credit. Brownback, however, called for a four-year phaseout that other supporters oppose. \Both governors are at least partly motivated by the number of jobs in their states with companies that manufacture wind-turbine components. There are an estimated 30,000 wind-manufacturing jobs in the United States. \Both states are also seeing more electricity generated with wind, which is becoming a draw for other factory jobs from consumer-products companies. For example, Mars Chocolate North America is building a new plant to make M&M candies in Topeka so it can tell its customers it is powered completely by environmentally friendly wind. A company already in Kansas wants to expand for the same reason, but he declined to identify it. \Brownback said, ""In addition to wheat and cattle, I want Kansas to become known as the Renewable State."" \Beebe described wind power as vital to energy independence which would free U.S. foreign policy from having to be focused on oil and natural gas imports from countries ""who don't like us."" \Congress hasn't passed any tax legislation this year, largely over budget concerns. A repeat of last year's debt-ceiling debate is coming early next year. \Before then, House and Senate leaders are struggling to prevent large spending cuts set to trigger automatically in December as the result of the failed Super Committee negotiations. Those cuts are politically unpopular because they include Medicare and the Pentagon. \""It's a difficult political environment,"" Brownback said of his conversations with former congressional colleagues. ""It's a very difficult financial environment."" \Brownback noted his state has changed policy to attract the industry. It exempts turbine sites from property tax for 10 years, allows full expensing of capital equipment in the first year and net metering. The policy also exempts small corporations, like many start-up energy firms, from income tax. \Beebe also highlighted his state's interest in attracting the tripling of manufacturing jobs that experts predict will come from the tax break's extension. \""I want to encourage all the potential investment out to my state, and spend as much money and employ as many people as you possibly can,"" he told the attendees. ""We will help you in any way that we know how.""\Credit: Walter C. Jones MORRIS NEWS SERVICE"

Topeka - Developers of the proposed coal-burning power plants in southwest Kansas said Tuesday that if the Legislature doesn't approve the project by June 1, it may not go forward.
\
""In dealing with a lot of people in the project, we have said that we think June 1 is a time when we should take a deep breath, look at the project and see what viability it still has,"" said Earl Watkins Jr., president and chief executive officer of Sunflower Electric Power Corp.
\
But Stephanie Cole, a spokeswoman for the Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club, said Watkins was trying to rush the process, which was happening nationwide on proposed coal-burning plants.
\
""There are desperate attempts to build coal plants because of a looming federal carbon tax and increasing public awareness of the dangers of coal plants,"" Cole said.
\
Watkins' comments came after the House voted 77-45 for a bill allowing construction of the two 700-megawatt, $3.6 billion plants near Holcomb.
\
The measure failed to get the two-thirds support - 84 votes in the 125-member House - it would need to override a veto from Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
\
Last year, Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Roderick Bremby denied permits for the plants because of the project's 11 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year and effect on global warming.
\
Sebelius and environmental groups across the nation supported Bremby, and now Sunflower Electric is trying to get the Legislature to overturn the decision.
\
Sebelius has offered to support construction of one plant, but Sunflower Electric and its partners have said both plants are necessary.
\
Approximately 85 percent of the project's output would supply electric needs in Colorado.
\
Brian Moline, chairman of the Alliance for Sound Energy, a coalition supporting the plants, said if Kansas turns down the project, it will be built in Colorado, and Kansas will lose all the construction jobs and accompanying economic development.
\
Under the proposal, Colorado-based Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association would own one 700-megawatt unit, while Sunflower Electric, Tri-State and Texas-based Golden Spread Electric Cooperative would own the other 700-megawatt unit. Sunflower Electric would run the units near its existing facility near Holcomb.
\
Watkins noted that Tri-State has purchased property and waters rights near Holly, Colo., for possible development of coal-burning plants there.
\
He said if Kansas rejects the Holcomb expansion, ""They (Tri-State) intend certainly to move ahead on their own if they're unable to move here.""
\
And, he said, Sunflower Electric also has looked at the possibility of participating with Tri-State in plants in Colorado.
\
""They're looking at alternatives, just as we're looking at alternatives in case we can't move forward at the Holcomb site,"" he said.
\
But Cole, with the Sierra Club, said she doubted Colorado officials would approve coal-fired plants.
\
The bill approved by the House also includes a mandate that utilities generate 5 percent of their electricity by 2012 from renewable resources such as wind. A Senate-approved bill contains no such provision. Both measures are expected to be reviewed in a conference committee.

As part of Greenpeace's international day of action, a Lawrence-based event focused on a very local issue: Kansas's potential for wind energy and its heavy reliance on burning fossil fuels.
\
In conjunction with the United Nation's climate talks in Poznan, Poland, this month, Greenpeace groups across the country and world gathered to urge leaders to take immediate action to stop global warming.
\
Saturday's event at Kansas University's Ecumenical Christian Ministries was host to about 30 people and seven speakers, many of whom referenced Sunflower Electric Power Corp.'s battle with the state to build two coal-fired power plants in southwest Kansas.
\
After Health and Environment Secretary Rod Bremby denied the plants more than a year ago, the issues has been a contentious one among Kansas lawmakers. As part of his decision, Bremby cited concerns over potential carbon dioxide emissions and global warming.
\
""This decision will impact discussions on energy policy for the rest of my life,"" said Scott Allegrucci, who is director of the Great Plains Alliance for Clean Energy.
\
While wind energy isn't the ""silver bullet"" solution, Allegrucci said the state has to move away from its dependence on coal. Right now, about 74 percent of the state's energy comes from coal and around 2 percent from wind, according to Eileen Horn with the Climate and Energy Project.
\
The Climate and Energy Project, which is under Salina-based The Land Institute, has proposed an energy portfolio that would have wind, solar and hydroelectricity make up 20 percent of the state's energy sources and another 10 percent saved from energy efficiency by the year 2020.
\
""Then we can significantly back off of coal,"" Horn said.
\
Dan Nagengast, with the Kansas Rural Center, listed five ways Kansas could bring more wind energy to the state:
\
- Build a renewable energy portfolio.
\
- Implement effective net metering laws.
\
- Create tax credits for renewable energy projects.
\
- Allow schools to own and profit from building wind turbines.
\
- Encourage community-based and environmentally based economic development.
\
Right now, Kansas is ranked third in the country in its potential to harness wind energy.
\
""How we develop that has a lot to do with if Kansas remains a good place to live 50 to 100 years from now,"" Nagengast said.

The very nature of a compromise is that neither side is entirely happy with the results.
\
That is the case with the surprising compromise Gov. Mark Parkinson announced Monday with Sunflower Electric Power Corp. to allow the construction of one coal-fired electric power plant near Holcomb.
\
The timing of the announcement, only a week after Kathleen Sebelius left the governor's office to join President Obama's Cabinet, was particularly surprising. An agreement coming so soon after Sebelius' departure is an indication of how much of a political standoff this issue had become. Sebelius had attempted to negotiate an agreement about a year ago to allow the construction of one coal-fired plant, but to no avail. Whether it was a matter of substance or personalities, Parkinson obviously had a different experience.
\
The agreement will allow the construction of one 895-megawatt coal-burning plant instead of two 700-megawatt plants and will require Sunflower to step up its development of wind energy and construction of transmission lines that can help move wind energy produced by Sunflower and other developers.
\
Parkinson has made the agreement contingent on passage of comprehensive energy legislation that includes renewable portfolio standards, net metering and other provisions that are essential to the state becoming a player in the alternative energy industry. It also includes a new restriction on the Kansas Department of Health and Environment's use of CO2 levels as justification to deny a permit to build power plants. The legislation will require KDHE to rely on federal clean air standards in its decision-making process. That is a significant issue now, but it may not be for long if, as expected, federal CO2 standards are set by the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
It's a tradeoff. Sunflower officials are elated because they will be allowed to build what they say will be one of the cleanest coal-fired plants anywhere. Assuming they can meet the financial and regulatory requirements to start construction, they have an obligation to the people of Kansas to do just that.
\
Alternative energy proponents also have reason to be pleased that the state now can move forward on additional wind power and transmission lines, as well as finally having regulations in place to help the state attract additional power developers and manufacturers of alternative energy equipment.
\
No one got everything they wanted, but the state now will be able move this troublesome issue off the legislative agenda and push ahead on efforts to take advantage of alternative energy opportunities.

A Lawrence company this week began installing on the roof of BOLD LLC's office and warehouse in Hutchinson what's billed as the state's largest privately held solar array.
\
The 200-kilowatt system will supply an estimated 80 percent of the electricity consumed by the 110,000 square feet of office space and warehouse in the former Peel's Beauty Supply Complex, 1125 E. Fourth Ave.
\
The company is making other energy efficiency improvements in the building, including motion-activated and more efficient LED lighting, with a target of 100 percent of its power supplied by solar, said Bob Peel, president of BOLD 3PL.
\
The system's electrical generation will be equal to that required to supply 25 average homes, Peel said.
\
The array will include 768 solar panels installed on the warehouse roof, facing southwest. The dimension of the individual 260-watt panels, attached to a racking system made of recycled plastic sitting on the surface of the roof, is about 40 by 70 inches, and the panels weigh about 40 pounds each, said Mark Merena, supervisor on the project with Good Energy Solutions.
\
They will daisy-chain wiring from a dozen panels together in a series, which increases the voltage from the panel, and then string that wire to one of four combiner boxes, Merena said. From there, they run to converter boxes inside the building.
\
WINAICO, a multinational corporation headquartered in Taiwan, manufactured the monocrystalline silicone ingot collectors, which sit at about a 15-degree pitch and are not visible from the ground.
\
The installation started this week and they anticipate completing it by June 15, said David Thiel, office manager at Good Energy Solutions.
\
""Economically it made sense, and environmentally,"" Peel said of the $570,000 investment. ""It's a better work environment, and it's a small way for us to give back to the planet.""
\
""In our volatile Kansas weather, it was a great way to prevent power outages for our customers and prevent any down time on our 24-hour shipping guarantee,"" Peel said.
\
BOLD Office Shares leases space in the former Peel's salon supply store to small businesses, allowing tenants to share many of the operating expenses, while BOLD 3PL is a neighboring third-party warehouse and distribution center.
\
The solar panels are warranted to sustain being struck by a 1-inch steel ball at 100 feet, Peel noted.
\
""We're hoping our notorious hailstorms will not affect it,"" he said.
\
An unanticipated side benefit, said Peel, is that the panels will shield the roof from the sun, gaining a 5-degree temperature drop in the warehouse.
\
The installation will qualify for a 30 percent federal tax credit and also will take place before the state's net metering law changes June 30, which will lower the maximum qualifying size of a commercial system from 200 to 100 kW, Thiel said.
\
""Solar panel technology costs have come down significantly and utility rates are still climbing,"" Thiel noted. ""So the outlook for solar is just getting better and better. It's becoming more and more competitive with coal and any other electrical generating source.""
\
A 510 kW project at Fort Riley is apparently the largest array in the state, although Midwest Energy, based in Hays, has signed an agreement with Clean Energy Collective of Colorado to build a 1-megawatt ""solar garden,"" with customers buying individual panels.
\
Prior to BOLD's project, the largest private array in the state was a 118 kW rooftop installation at Peeper Ranch in Lenexa.

The Hays cooperative is working with Texas and Colorado companies to develop the expanded coal plant at Holcomb.\The focus of public policy in Kansas should be on creating a reliable supply of electricity, economic development and job growth, Knox said.\""This is about doing business in Kansas,"" he said. ""The bottom line is our energy needs will not be met without conventional energy production.""\The Kansas Chamber and the Sierra Club have engaged in spirited lobbying campaigns on the coal issue since KDHE Secretary Rod Bremby rejected Sunflower's application for an air-quality permit in 2007. Bremby said 11 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted from the proposed plant was an unacceptable health risk to Kansans. The action by KDHE was unprecedented because neither the state nor federal governments had previously regulated CO2 as a pollutant.\The Legislature failed three times to pass a coal bill with a veto-proof majority in the 2008 session. There were enough votes in the Senate for an override, but not in the House.\Under the new energy bill, the state would promote energy efficiency, improve access to ""net metering"" for people producing power from wind or solar units, and mandate utility companies meet renewable energy standards.\Rep. Jason Watkins, R-Wichita, gained approval 66-53 for an amendment prohibiting cities, counties and property associations from stopping homeowners from placing solar panels on a house roof.\The House rejected an amendment by Rep.

93,"By Tim Carpenter\THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL\The House is ready for a revealing vote in the protracted battle over a proposed $3.5 billion coal-fired power plant expansion that is squeezing lawmakers between business and environmental lobbyists.\House members gave first-round approval Thursday to the energy bill, which could pass the House today and advance to the Senate. Gov. Kathleen Sebelius has threatened to veto the bill if legislators left in a provision stripping the power of state regulators to deny permits for new coal plants.\House Speaker Mike O'Neal, R-Hutchinson, and Senate Majority Leader Derek Schmidt, R-Independence, expressed confidence their respective chambers could muster two-thirds majorities to override a veto. That requires 84 votes in the House and 27 in the Senate.\Rep. Forrest Knox, a Fredonia Republican who led House debate, said the measure would overturn a Kansas Department of Health and Environment decision to deny a permit to Sunflower Electric Power Corp. The Hays cooperative is working with Texas and Colorado companies to develop the expanded coal plant at Holcomb.\The focus of public policy in Kansas should be on creating a reliable supply of electricity, economic development and job growth, Knox said.\""This is about doing business in Kansas,"" he said. ""The bottom line is our energy needs will not be met without conventional energy production.""\The Kansas Chamber and the Sierra Club have engaged in spirited lobbying campaigns on the coal issue since KDHE Secretary Rod Bremby rejected Sunflower's application for an air-quality permit in 2007. Bremby said 11 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted from the proposed plant was an unacceptable health risk to Kansans. The action by KDHE was unprecedented because neither the state nor federal governments had previously regulated CO2 as a pollutant.\The Legislature failed three times to pass a coal bill with a veto-proof majority in the 2008 session. There were enough votes in the Senate for an override, but not in the House.\Under the new energy bill, the state would promote energy efficiency, improve access to ""net metering"" for people producing power from wind or solar units, and mandate utility companies meet renewable energy standards.\Rep. Jason Watkins, R-Wichita, gained approval 66-53 for an amendment prohibiting cities, counties and property associations from stopping homeowners from placing solar panels on a house roof.\The House rejected an amendment by Rep.

The Energy Bill came to the Senate floor this week in the form of a conference committee report that ultimately passed the House on a vote of 75 - 47; 84 House votes will be required to override an expected governor's veto. The Senate passed the measure 31 - 7, a comfortable margin over the 27 Senate votes needed to override a veto. The bill now goes to the Governor who has 10 days to veto it.
\
The bill creates a renewable resources requirement for electric utilities to encourage greater development and use of wind, solar and other environmentally friendly energy sources, and requires certain electric generation facilities to begin CO2 capture or reduction technologies. A key provision requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) to grant the construction permit of the Holcomb Sunflower Energy Plant unless the permit is found to violate current law. It would allow the KDHE Secretary to hold future permit applications to stricter standards than those established by the federal government if those stricter standards have been approved by the legislature. Neither the federal government nor the state of Kansas currently has a standard set on CO2 emissions.
\
Whether or not you approve of a new coal-fired plant anywhere in Kansas, it is important to remember the proposed plant expansion at Holcomb would operate under the most restrictive air quality permit of any plant in the country; it would be far more efficient than existing plants, allowing older, dirtier coal plants to be taken offline; the new plant would encourage greater investment in transmission lines which are critical to the development and expansion of wind energy, and it would keep the $3.6 billion dollar project with its jobs and tax benefits here in the state.
\
Just out of curiosity, I asked Westar officials what would happen to the cost of electricity if we converted the coal-fired facility near Lawrence back to natural gas. Their response was that electric bills would increase dramatically - 4 x higher - because natural gas is much more expensive than coal (i.e. if an average bill was $100/mo with the coal-fired plant, it could increase to $400/mo if the switch was made to natural gas). Natural gas also emits CO2. Certainly wind, solar, nuclear, bio-fuels and natural gas will all play key roles in our energy future. But for baseload energy at a cost virtually all can afford, we would be shirking our responsibilities if we ignored the use of coal.
\
It is interesting to note that other states have found coal-based resources appropriate for meeting their base-load energy requirements. Currently, 33 coal-based units are under construction across the country, including eight plants in four states surrounding Kansas: 3 in Colorado, 2 in Nebraska, 2 in Missouri, and 1 in Arkansas. Construction in other Midwestern states include: 2 in Iowa, 4 in Illinois and 6 in Texas.
\
The bill also establishes energy efficiency standards for state buildings, enacts the Net Metering and Easy Connection Act, provides tax incentives for energy efficiency improvements in residential rental properties, and establishes the Kansas Electric Generation Science and Technology Commission.
\
Finally, the Senate came out forcefully in support of Boeing upon hearing the news that the U.S. Air Force had awarded to French manufacturer Airbus a $40 billion contract to build the next generation of air refueling tankers. Boeing has built tankers for the Air Force for more than 50 years. We unanimously passed a strong resolution calling upon the President and Congress to halt the process and reconsider the decision.

Topeka - In a stunning development, Gov. Mark Parkinson and Sunflower Electric Power Corp. on Monday signed an agreement over the coal-fired electric power project that has strangled Kansas politics for nearly two years.
\
Under the deal, Sunflower Electric will reduce the size of its proposal from two 700-megawatt coal-fired plants to one 895-megawatt coal-burning plant in southwest Kansas.
\
The agreement includes mitigation projects aimed at reducing the carbon dioxide footprint of the plant and is contingent on the Legislature adopting green energy provisions pushed by Parkinson during the current wrap-up session.
\
Combining the mitigation and green energy proposals, Parkinson said, ""It is entirely possible that the carbon impact print of this plant is zero or perhaps even less than zero.""
\
If enacted, the proposal would end a political standoff that started in 2007 when Kansas made international news after the state's Health and Environment secretary, Rod Bremby, rejected the project because of concerns about carbon dioxide emissions.
\
Supporters of the plants were furious and pushed through legislation to try to force Bremby to allow the project, but former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius vetoed those bills four different times.
\
She criticized the plants as polluters that would add to global warming, while most of the power from the project would go to out-of-state customers. She had offered to let Sunflower build one 660-megawatt plant, but Sunflower and its main partner, Colorado-based Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, said that wasn't economically feasible.
\
Sebelius' lieutenant governor, Parkinson, was one of the project's staunchest critics. But last week, Sebelius was named secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, elevating Parkinson to the governor's job.
\
Almost immediately upon taking office, Parkinson said he reached out to see whether there was room for negotiation with Sunflower.
\
At a news conference Monday, standing beside Sunflower Electric's president and CEO, Earl Watkins, Parkinson said the proposed deal would be ""a win-win for the entire state"" because it would produce jobs while establishing in law renewable energy standards and encouraging wind development.
\
Watkins was just as effusive.
\
""This project will be the cleanest project from virtually every emissions perspective, especially from a CO2 perspective,"" he said.
\
Opponents not persuaded
\
The Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club said it was disappointed in the deal.
\
""Today, Kansas took a big step backward. We cannot build new coal plants and claim to want to slow global warming at the same time,"" the group said in a statement.
\
Tom Thompson, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said the organization would evaluate the agreement closely before deciding what to do about it.
\
State Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, also expressed concerns. ""We need to be reducing the amount of electricity we are getting from coal,"" she said. The Lawrence City Commission had opposed the project.
\
But state Sen. Tom Holland, D-Baldwin City, said he was encouraged by the developments.
\
""My initial read of this agreement is that this is very good news for the state of Kansas,"" Holland said.
\
Combines coal, wind
\
Under the deal, Sunflower Electric would build an 895 megawatt coal-burning power plant that would emit 6.672 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. That is down from the proposal to build two 700-megawatt plants that would have emitted 11 million tons of CO2 per year. Kansas would still only use 200 megawatts of power, while the remaining 695 megawatts would be sent to other states, primarily Colorado.
\
As proposed, the project will include offsets to reduce CO2 emissions by 3.016 million tons per year.
\
These offsets include developing 179 megawatts of wind energy; achieving renewable energy standards; using 10 percent of biomass fuel; development of two transmission lines for the western grid, which can be used to transmit wind energy; decommissioning oil-fired power units in Garden City; and development of a biodigester to capture methane, and an algae reactor.
\
The agreement is contingent on passage of a comprehensive energy package that includes making federal clean energy air standards the guidance for state regulations; renewable portfolio standards; net metering; energy efficiency; state vehicle fuel economy standards; expanded authority for the Kansas Electric Transmission Authority; and compressed air energy storage.
\
Jobs needed, some say
\
Holland said the estimated 1,500 jobs created by construction of the plant combined with the additional wind energy that will result from the project made it worthwhile.
\
""The one plant deal is contingent on passage of a comprehensive energy plan by the Legislature, and we also come away with an additional 180 megawatts of wind as well as transmission lines that can link our Kansas wind farms to the western U.S. grid,"" he said.
\
But Francisco said another provision in the energy package that Parkinson wants would allow more electric cooperatives to opt out of oversight of the Kansas Corporation Commission.
\
""That would be reducing protections for individual members of cooperatives,"" she said.
\
Senate President Steve Morris, R-Hugoton, House Republican leaders and the Kansas Chamber of Commerce praised the deal.
\
Should the Legislature enact the energy package and Sunflower receive state permits, it may still face opposition on the federal level, where President Barack Obama has signaled a willingness to regulate CO2 emissions.
\
But Sunflower's Watkins sounded optimistic, saying, ""If there is federal legislation that comes out that puts a burden on a coal plant, I'd rather have a coal plant that is the most efficient, least emitting coal plant,"" he said.
\
He said construction on the plant could start in a year to 18 months, and then take four years to complete.
\
Parkinson and Watkins signed the agreement to dissolve a federal lawsuit Sunflower filed against the state.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, legislators, justices, cabinet officers, elected officials, leaders of Indian nations, honored guests, and my fellow Kansans.
\
Good evening.
\
As we gather again to assess the state of our State, I want to welcome the new members of the House and Senate and our new House leadership. On behalf of all Kansans, I thank you for your willingness to run for office and serve during a difficult time in our history, pledging to put people before partisanship. I look forward to working with all of you to meet our challenges and secure our future.
\
And I welcome back the returning members of the Kansas legislature. I look forward to working with you once again. Many of you know better than anyone the challenges before us and that heavy burdens can be lifted when all of our hands lift together.
\
Since we met for the state of the State last year, we have two new State officials. Attorney General Steve Six is with us tonight, and I want to once again thank him for his willingness to leave the bench and serve as the Attorney General for Kansas.
\
Also with us is our new State Treasurer Dennis McKinney, sworn in just one week ago. Dennis while you'll be greatly missed in the House, we thank you for taking on new responsibilities as you continue to serve Kansas.
\
Our new Chief Justice, Bob Davis, is here tonight and Chief we wish you well in your leadership role in the Supreme Court. Over the last 3 decades, Justice Kay McFarland served on the Kansas Supreme Court. Her leadership as Chief was historic and heroic, leading the Court during some very contentious times.
\
On behalf of all Kansans, who are the beneficiaries of her extraordinary service, I want to thank former Chief Justice Kay McFarland, who unfortunately could not be with us tonight.
\
And while we are recognizing long service to the state of Kansas, I want to acknowledge the three leaders of great Kansas universities who will retire at the end of this academic year: Kansas State University President Jon Wefald, University of Kansas Chancellor Robert Hemenway, and Pittsburg State University President Tom Bryant.
\
Our universities are one of our State's greatest assets. By educating young Kansans they promote generational change and contribute to the knowledge economy that will move Kansas forward. We thank these three leaders for their tireless dedication and considerable contributions to the State.
\
Everyone I recognized tonight shares one thing. They've all made difficult decisions to benefit our State and its citizens. In fact, the history of Kansas is a series of difficult decisions made by many other humble men and women who served the greater good: Would we be a free or a slave state? How would we put people back to work during the Great Depression? How would we aid the war effort during the two World Wars? How would we preserve our agricultural sector during the farm crisis of the 1980s? And, more recently, how would we provide quality education for our children while protecting our most vulnerable citizens?
\
The common thread that has enabled Kansans to answer those challenges and succeed is found in the quality and character of our people and our public servants. In meeting past challenges Kansans took care to provide the foundation for the good years. After each difficult period, there were good and prosperous times. And there will be again. In fact, tonight we can mark the beginning of the path toward better days.
\
The state of our State is not defined by ending balances or revenue receipts. It's about the quality and character of the Kansas people. And I'm proud to report that, in that regard, the state of our State has never been stronger.
\
We meet tonight at a time when a recession has hit every state, every community, and every American. We're experiencing a shared struggle that requires us to develop shared solutions.
\
The steps we take now will help us survive this economic crisis and create the foundation to move us ahead. Let us come together, as we have in the past, to find common ground and to work for the common good.
\
Our focus tonight and over the next 90 legislative days should be on the people we serve: our priorities to educate our children, to provide for public safety and protect health services for our neediest citizens, to spur economic recovery and job growth, to build the infrastructure to move our goods and workers from product to market, and to encourage innovation and research as the core elements of a knowledge economy.
\
The revised 2009 and the proposed 2010 budgets will be covered in detail beginning tomorrow and in the weeks to come. I'll present to the legislature budgets that balance, without proposing new taxes on our citizens, who are already struggling to make ends meet.
\
Ultimately, the role of government is to use our collective resources to do what individuals cannot do alone. We must look to the future and determine what strategic investments we can make to give Kansans the tools they need to prosper in the 21st Century.
\
In an economic downturn, decisions can have dire consequences and a lifetime impact on future generations. No student can afford to 'miss' a few years of quality education. No Kansan can be denied lifesaving care while waiting for the economy to improve.
\
Even in a time of shortfalls, we do have resources. Our treasury is stronger than many other states. We have a trained and able workforce. And we are still, proudly, this nation's breadbasket. So when we ask ourselves if government has a positive contribution to make through wise use of these resources, the answer to that question is a resounding ""yes.""
\
In all of our endeavors, we recognize that jobs and capital are best expanded in the private sector. But without resources and workers from government, the massive undertakings needed to promote the common good would likely fail.
\
When we faced the challenge of under funded schools, it was made clear in the courtroom, in the boardroom, and in the classroom that new investments had to be made. And we shared the work of finding a solution.
\
We invested millions in our schools, our students, our teachers, and our future. And even now, looking through the lens of today's economy, that investment was worth it and worth keeping.
\
Six years ago we developed shared solutions when our prisons were crowded, beds were full and staffing was short. We were faced with spending millions of dollars on new prisons to house the expanding population.
\
Instead, we developed bipartisan legislation that resulted in treatment programs for nonviolent drug offenders and innovative and collaborative release efforts for inmates returning to their communities. So today we have fewer inmates, less crime, lower recidivism rates, and more funds for other state needs. And the Kansas model is being replicated around the country.
\
But it is not just in the crafting of legislation that we came together for a common purpose. When bases across the country were being closed and communities emptied - we protected our military assets and brought the Big Red One home. We opened Fort Riley's doors - and the entire state - to new soldiers, new families, and new investments in Kansas.
\
Working together across communities and universities, we made our case for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility and we are proud to be its future home. We look forward to the contribution Kansas will make to our national security and to NBAF's positive impact on our state for generations to come.
\
Now, the NBAF effort would not have succeeded without the extraordinary leadership and vision of our Congressional delegation, key members of the Kansas legislature, Kansas State University, Manhattan community leaders, the BioScience Authority, private sector stakeholders, and our administration all working together.
\
The same principle that guided those successes should guide us now: Working together, we can succeed.
\
So let's commit ourselves to balancing the budget with common sense, strategic investments, and a commitment that we're all in this together - every agency has a role to play and a contribution to make.
\
Let's commit to focusing on priorities: investing in public schools and public safety, continuing basic state services to our most vulnerable populations, putting Kansans back to work, and including all state agencies in a dialogue that results in shared solutions.
\
My budget recommendations for 2009 and 2010 make significant reductions in most agencies, while trying to protect essential services. The budget also eliminates programs, closes facilities, and freezes new hires. We're asking our state workforce, once again, to do more with less and I am confident they will meet the challenge.
\
Yes, these are difficult times and we face difficult decisions, but by working in a bi-partisan fashion we'll once again find answers and experience success.
\
While we address our problems as a unified State, I'll continue the dialogue with the new President and our Congressional delegation on a stimulus package. But we shouldn't wait for or rely on Washington to solve our problems.
\
I have confidence in our capacity to meet our challenges. And, I also believe that our greatest successes lie before us. Along with the challenges, there are opportunities we cannot afford to ignore.
\
This is not the time to take our eye off the future. We must continue to look to the horizon for new opportunities. Already, we have several ongoing initiatives that can aid our economic recovery.
\
The Kansas Innovation Consortium is a group of business leaders representing our most promising economic growth sectors. They've come together to advise me and Cabinet secretaries on the best use of government resources to continue to grow private industry.
\
Joerg Ohle, the CEO of Bayer Animal Health, who helped lead the effort to brand an ""animal health corridor"" from Manhattan, Kansas to Springfield, Missouri and promote our NBAF success, is leading this strategic effort.
\
Seizing opportunities and creating jobs to stimulate our economy is important to our state's recovery. And, transportation is a critical component of both.
\
T-LINK, the task force led by Tim Rogers from the Salina Airport Authority and our Transportation Secretary Deb Miller, will soon complete their work and recommend new approaches for transportation, new collaborative partnerships and new funding formulas. Their efforts will provide the framework for our future transportation strategies.
\
Jack Pelton, chairman, president and CEO of Cessna Aircraft, is leading the statewide dialogue to develop a plan for reduced greenhouse gas emissions while Kansas continues to thrive.
\
KEEP, the Kansas Energy and Environmental Policy Advisory Group will give us the strategic framework to make good decisions about growth and environmental impact in the future.
\
None of these initiatives cost state dollars, and in each endeavor we have tapped the best of Kansas - the ingenuity and innovation of our private sector leaders - who give their time so Kansas can grow and prosper.
\
Among the myriad of issues on the horizon, two demand our attention this Session. The American energy crisis provides Kansas with challenges we must face and opportunities that together we must seize.
\
The energy crisis is real on many fronts affecting our economy, our national security, and our environment. Our own scientists at Kansas State University and the University of Kansas have joined with an overwhelming number of experts around the world who tell us that our time to solve these problems is running out.
\
While we know that the incoming President has promised a new federal energy policy and swift action, there's uncertainty about the exact rules and financial liabilities Congress will impose.
\
Kansas is already one of the nation's worst offenders in per capita carbon emissions, which makes us vulnerable to the costs and penalties of imminent federal regulation.
\
Recently, the Kansas Energy Council confirmed that we have adequate electricity to power us for years into the future; and no state is better suited to lead the country in renewable power than is Kansas. To do so, we must harness all of the energy that we can from wind, and we've already made significant progress.
\
Two years ago we entered into a voluntary agreement with our utilities to generate 1,000 megawatts of wind power in Kansas by 2010. Tonight, I'm happy to announce that we achieved that goal two years early.
\
But, we've just scratched the surface. The time will come when we reach our potential of 10,000 megawatts of wind from the prairies across Kansas-power used both here in our state and exported to supply the country with clean and renewable energy.
\
In fulfilling our potential we can attract billions of investment dollars for both transmission lines and the wind farms. We can create thousands of new jobs. And, Kansas landowners will see the benefit of millions of dollars of lease payments for their wind.
\
Just as Dwight Eisenhower led the effort to develop an interstate highway system to move goods and people across the country, Kansas can lead the development of an interstate transmission system to move power to market.
\
I am committed to work with the Kansas Corporation Commission to bring the competing companies together to reach a compromise on building new transmission lines in Kansas.
\
And I pledge that we'll continue to work with neighboring states in encouraging the Southwest Power Pool to accelerate development of a fair and progressive rate structure for a new transmission grid across our region.
\
But the cleanest and cheapest energy is energy we don't use in the first place, so I'm directing the Kansas Corporation Commission to work with our utility companies on measurable and significant energy efficiency programs to further extend our available power well into the future.
\
We must change our outdated rate structure, which currently rewards consumption, instead of conservation, and fully engage Kansas consumers in reducing their energy use.
\
I ask the Kansas Legislature to work with me on a green energy proposal which has already been endorsed by two of our major utilities and includes net metering, new building codes, and statutory goals for renewable energy in Kansas. This legislation will send a clear signal to private investors and renewable manufacturers that Kansas is embracing a clean energy future, and will help to spur investment and innovation.
\
Finally, I am pleased that Len Rodman, CEO of Black and Veatch, a Kansas company that provides strategic advice throughout the world on green energy initiatives, has agreed to Chair my newly created GreenWorks Advisory Council, to expand our opportunities to add more renewable energy jobs in Kansas. Thank you, Len.
\
With all of us working together, we can and will seize this opportunity. Kansas will become a hub of wind power, a heartland center for green industries, and we will lead the country and the world out of the energy crisis we face.
\
Along with the energy crisis, we also face many personal challenges with disease and illness. Cancer has affected many Kansas families. The personal toll in lost lives and unrealized potential cannot be calculated.
\
The cost to the health care system is also great. The American Cancer Society estimates that it costs our state approximately $4.4 million a day in lost productivity and direct medical costs.
\
Over the past few years, scientists have made tremendous strides in early detection and treatment, so that a cancer diagnosis is no longer an immediate death sentence. We're fortunate to have a team of researchers at the University of Kansas who are already finding new cures.
\
We now have an opportunity to create a Comprehensive Cancer Center. And much like the effort to bring NBAF to Kansas, this will be a muti-year collaborative effort including private sector partners, our research universities, health allies from across the region, the Midwest Cancer Alliance, and the Bio Science Authority.
\
The application for National Cancer Institute designation will occur in 2011; and, if successful, has enormous potential as an economic engine, estimated to generate $1.3 billion dollars annually, and create nearly 10,000 new jobs within a decade.
\
Just as important, Kansans won't have to travel out of state for cancer care, and our State will contribute to the national goal of finding cures in our lifetime.
\
The National Cancer Institute designation is another prospect on the horizon, with the potential to impact our state and our citizens for generations to come.
\
These major opportunities to create jobs and expand our economy are part of a long-term strategy to continue progress in Kansas. We have to keep them in the forefront as we craft short-term budget solutions.
\
The role Kansas can play in addressing major issues confronting our state, nation, and world can be significant. The promise of our future must not be forgotten in the problems of the moment.
\
We have the ability by working together to correctly identify assets, mobilize efforts, unify our resolve, and get the job done for Kansas today and tomorrow.
\
Our state's motto is as true today as it was in 1861. We will overcome our difficulties; we will reach the stars yet again. There will be a better day.
\
The U.S. and the Kansas economies will rebound, and we'll return to positive growth. We will create jobs. And the opportunities Kansans have enjoyed for generations will not go away. This time of shared struggle will result in shared solutions and a stronger Kansas.
\
Thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the Great State of Kansas.

"
101,"
The venerated Yogi Berra is credited with saying, ""It's like deja vu all over again."" I'm reminded of it now because the Renewable Portfolio Standards are under attack again, just like last year about this time.
\
In brief, the Kansas Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) sets a goal that by 2020, at least 20 percent of peak energy demand will be provided through renewable resources.
\
At present, the state exceeds the current 15 percent standard and is well on its way to meeting 2020 goals.
\
It is unfortunate that leadership in the Legislature, and members of the House Energy and Environment Committee, appear to be giving consideration to eliminating RPS policy. The Hutchinson/Reno County Chamber of Commerce is an advocate for public policy that is conducive to job creation. Removal of the RPS is a step in the wrong direction for two reasons: It puts good jobs now in Hutchinson at risk, and it hinders future efforts to recruit industry to the state - even business not related to the energy sector.
\
Similar policies are common in other states. When considering a business location, business representatives and site consultation firms regularly request that states describe the percentage of energy produced from coal, natural gas, solar, etc. States deriving a higher percentage of energy from renewable resources are more competitive when recruiting new employers and industry.
\
Companies view renewable energy as a way to save on long-term operating costs and shareholders often favor locations providing environmentally sound energy resources.
\
With so much competition between states for job creation projects, why would we consider inflicting a competitive disadvantage upon ourselves by eliminating renewable standards?
\
Harnessing the natural resource of wind in Kansas can provide an advantage when vying for the attention of prospective employers.
\
It appears that Kansans understand this. A recent poll by North Star Opinion Polls, commissioned by the Climate and Energy Project, found that 75 percent of Kansas voters support the RPS, 91 percent support using renewable resources and 85 percent believe renewable energy will aid job creation efforts.
\
Siemens Wind Energy is a critical anchor company in the Kansas Enterprise Industrial Park, an engaged corporate citizen and an employer of more than 330 people. If Kansas had not put RPS goals in place, can there be any doubt that Hutchinson would have been viewed by Siemens as a less desirable location for this project?
\
Furthermore, support for RPS policy does not come at the exclusion of other industries. The Chamber and the State Department of Commerce aggressively pursue opportunities to recruit industries, which include food processing, packaging, plastic components, logistics, general manufacturing, assembly, aeronautics and, yes, traditional fuel extraction and processing.
\
According to the Kansas Corporation Commission's Rate Impact Report, the RPS has not substantially added to the cost of electricity. Of the increased cost in energy experienced by Kansans, only 1.7 percent can be attributed to RPS, according to the KCC.
\
In addition to all of the pragmatic reasons to continue current energy policy goals, it makes good economic sense. Energy producers see an opportunity to limit future cost increases by leveraging wind. In January, Kansas City Power and Light announced plans to nearly double wind energy use, saying it will generate approximately $600 million in savings over 20 years.
\
If supporting economic growth is one of the goals of our Legislature, then state RPS policy should remain in place unchanged.
\
It does not drive up the cost of energy. It protects the jobs we already have and supports efforts to recruit new jobs.

Topeka ? The Kansas House and Senate could start acting as early as Wednesday to repeal a 2005 law that requires electric utilities to produce at least 20 percent of their power from renewable resources such as wind by 2020.
\
Besides replacing the ""20 by 2020"" mandate with a voluntary ""goal,"" the bill, which has passed the House and won approval in a conference committee, also reduces the current lifetime property tax exemption for renewable energy projects to 10 years.
\
What may be most remarkable about Senate Bill 91 is that neither the electric utilities covered by the current mandate nor their customers who pay the electric bills asked for the legislation.
\
The state's two largest electric utilities -- Westar Energy, which serves Lawrence and most of eastern Kansas, and Kansas City Power & Light -- have both taken neutral positions on the bill. And neither reported receiving complaints from customers about the mandate.
\
""Our customers have expressed preference for renewable energy,"" said Westar spokeswoman Gina Penzig.
\
Lobbyists Michael Morgan of Koch Industries, left, and Jeff Glendening of Americans for Prosperity chat with Rep. Dennis Hedke and Sen. Rob Olson, chairs of the House and Senate committees that deal with electric utilities, before a news conference to announce a deal to soften the state's renewable energy standards.

Lobbyists Michael Morgan of Koch Industries, left, and Jeff Glendening of Americans for Prosperity chat with Rep. Dennis Hedke and Sen. Rob Olson, chairs of the House and Senate committees that deal with electric utilities, before a news conference to announce a deal to soften the state's renewable energy standards.
\
Instead, the bill was the product of intense lobbying from groups that have philosophical objections to mandating how utility companies produce electricity.
\
""We believe the free market is the best place to decide where energy comes from,"" said Jeff Glendening, a lobbyist for the free-market political group Americans for Prosperity, when asked why the bill was introduced. ""We believe that's the most efficient, that consumers will benefit from a free market.""
\
Also pushing for the bill was the Kansas Chamber of Commerce and Wichita-based Koch Industries, whose owners, billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, are major funders of Americans for Prosperity and other conservative political groups.
\
""The Kansas Chamber supports a mix of energy sources, including wind, where demand is driven by a free market and not by mandates,"" chamber CEO Mike O'Neal said when the negotiated deal was announced at a news conference May 4 in Republican Gov. Sam Brownback's office.
\
The current rule began as a voluntary standard that was negotiated by former Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. The purpose was not only to help spur development of the wind industry in Kansas, but also to address a growing concern over carbon emissions and their impact on global climate change.
\
It was later enacted into law in 2009 and was signed by her successor, Gov. Mark Parkinson, as part of a compromise that also involved issuing a permit for a new coal-fired power plant in southwest Kansas. But that plant still has not been built, mainly due to litigation by environmental groups.
\
Critics of the law say it's unfair to fossil fuel industries that have to pay severance tax on the value of minerals they extract from Kansas. They also say it forces consumers to pay higher electric rates because renewable energy can be more expensive than electricity from coal or gas.
\
But others say those claims of higher costs have been exaggerated, and officials at Westar say their customers are not paying more.
\
""We have been able to meet the requirements under RPS (renewable portfolio standards) and negotiate rates that keep prices in line with the cost of electricity from other resources,"" Penzig said.
\
KCP&L spokeswoman Courtney Hughley said the Kansas City-based company supported the RPS rule when it was first passed, and said the company is still expanding its renewable energy portfolio.
\
""We have company owned assets and commitments in place that will increase our renewable portfolio to approximately 1,000 (megawatts) of wind, hydroelectric, landfill gas and solar power,"" Hughley said in an email. ""We believe that we are well positioned to satisfy the voluntary goals in Kansas through 2023.""
\
A compromise on taxes
\
The bill actually represents a compromise between the free-market groups and the wind industry in Kansas. The alternative, legislators and lobbyists have said, could have been much more harsh toward renewable energy.
\
State Sen. Marci Francisco
\
State Sen. Marci Francisco
\
""I think the concern was that other taxes for wind development were part of the packages the tax committees were reviewing,"" said Sen. Marci Francisco of Lawrence, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Utilities Committee. ""One of those was excise tax (on the value of renewable energy produced). Certainly there could have been a consideration for property tax. A concern was that wind development companies might have been taxed as utilities.""
\
The bill calls for renewable energy projects to be taxed as commercial property, which is assessed at a lower rate in Kansas than utilities.
\
Kimberly Svaty, who lobbies for the Kansas wind industry, helped negotiate the package coming up for a vote. Besides the threat of imposing higher taxes on renewable energy, she said the bigger danger was the likelihood of continued legislative battles in future years, battles that she said have already shaken investor confidence in the Kansas marketplace for wind energy.
\
""The alternative is that the fight continues, instability continues, and investment resources dwindle and start going to our neighbors to the north and south,"" Svaty said.
\
When the compromise plan was first announced, Francisco issued a statement praising the negotiated deal, especially the compromise on property taxes for renewable projects.
\
But she now says she does not intend to vote for the bill because the concept, including setting a renewable energy ""goal,"" was never fully discussed by the Senate.
\
""In previous committee meetings, we had talked about the renewable energy requirement, or standard. But we never talked about what is a reasonable goal for the state,"" she said.

103,"
Kansas is not attracting investments in wind turbine fabrication plants and related businesses because many other states, including Iowa, Texas, California, Minnesota and Colorado, have passed legislation to draw that type of commerce. Iowa alone has three wind turbine fabrication plants either finished or being built. Kansas has none.
\
Those states I mentioned have renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and net metering laws in place. For example, Colorado's RPS law states that their utilities must be producing 10 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2015. And California has a true net metering law, meaning that when users with generating capacity produce more electricity than they use, their meters run backwards.
\
Although we live in a state that is one of the top three in the nation in wind energy potential, our heavily lobbied state government continues to give incentives to coal and nuclear energy interests. We may even build a couple of coal-fired plants, using precious Kansas water, and then sell that power to Colorado. If that happens, you can forget about any wind industry manufacturing coming to Kansas.
\
Is the premise of Thomas Frank's book, ""What's the Matter with Kansas,"" correct in suggesting that we continue to elect people who then vote for special interests and against their constituents' economic wellbeing?
\
For the past five years the wind industry has been growing at an average of 26 percent a year worldwide. The Vestas company a few months ago announced it will build a wind turbine fabrication plant in Colorado. The wind farm going up near Ellsworth and the recently announced system to be built near Concordia both will use Vestas wind turbines. Guess the location of the plant supplying that equipment?
\
Texas, with a slight edge over Kansas in wind potential, now has 3,352 megawatts of generating capacity installed, compared to 364 megawatts for Kansas. In August, Shell WindEnergy and Luminant announced plans to build a 3,000 megawatt wind farm with a compressed air storage system that will bring the total Texas capacity to more than 6,000 megawatts. Kansas' stated goal of 1,000 megawatts by 2010 and 2,000 megawatts by 2020 seems anemic at best.
\
A CNBC video report from the Wind Power Conference this year in Las Vegas noted that what is holding back the wind industry is a supply problem. The supply chain for wind turbines is about two years behind demand. Because the units are very large, it is more economical to have fabrication plants near where wind farms are built to cut shipping costs. So while we sit on our thumbs here in Kansas, surrounding states are attracting investments in the manufacturing side of this industry.
\
Almost all of the wind energy produced in Kansas is exported out of state. Any new wind farms that come online will sell the bulk of their energy east of Kansas because that is the greatest market.
\
A 1991 Department of Energy research project showed that Kansas could annually produce up to 1,070 billion kilowatt hours of electricity using the technology available at that time. If Kansas were to use the older technology, our state could produce about a quarter of all current electrical generation in the U.S. The average utility wind turbine installed in California in 1991 was rated at 300 kilowatts. The wind turbines that will be used near Concordia are rated at 3 megawatts, which is 10 times the power capability of the older turbines.
\
The Kansas wind energy potential is huge. Our state's utilities now produce less than 5 percent of our state's potential.
\
Critics say wind energy can't be stored for periods when the wind isn't blowing. However, there is a plant in Alabama and another in Germany that store electrical energy in the form of compressed air. Iowa is building an underground compressed-air storage facility to produce electricity when the winds die down, and another is planned for Texas. Kansas has some 6,000 depleted gas wells that store natural gas under pressure. Technologically, it is not a stretch to think we could store wind energy like Iowa and Texas are going to do.
\
Successful communities exploit their abundant resources and conserve their limited assets. We seem to be doing just the opposite as coal-fired plants are planned for western Kansas that will use our scarce water and foul our air. Forty Republican lawmakers have signed a letter of support for this Sunflower Electric Power Corp. project and sent it to Secretary Bremby at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. This is an embarrassment. I can't believe a majority of Kansans want a coal-fired generating facility built anywhere in our state while neglecting an obvious clean resource blowing overhead.

Topeka ? In 2009, supporters of a bill to require an increase in the use of renewable energy said the proposal would make Kansas the ""Saudi Arabia"" of wind energy.
\
Four years later, the political wind is blowing toward repealing or changing the law.
\
Since 2009, wind energy capacity in Kansas has jumped from about 1,000 megawatts to approximately 2,700 megawatts in 2013, with other projects in the planning stages, according to state figures.
\
But conservative legislators, many affiliated with a national group that opposes mandated goals for renewable energy, plan to renew efforts from the 2013 legislative session to repeal the Kansas Renewable Portfolio Standard.
\
The mandate required major utility companies to have the capacity to generate 10 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2011. It also called for the companies to generate 15 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2016 and 20 percent by 2020.
\
State Rep. Tom Sloan, R-Lawrence, said the RPS has been a success, boosting the development of wind farms, wind industry businesses and transmission lines by establishing a market for wind energy. Sloan, chairman of the House Vision 2020 Committee, serves on several national energy panels.
\
""The potential is good for further development of our state's wind and solar resources as those transmission lines come on-line,"" he said. Repeal of the RPS ""would send a signal to investors that Kansas is not a good place to invest in meeting the nation's need and desire for renewable energy,"" he said.
\
Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, cut the carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that produce the greenhouse gases that most scientists say causes climate change.
\
Rabbi Moti Rieber, director of Interfaith Power and Light and rabbi at the Lawrence Community Jewish Congregation, said, ""There is a moral imperative to address global climate change."" Rieber's group includes religious leaders who push for energy conservation, efficiency and renewable energy.
\
ALEC opposition to RPS
\
One group opposed to the RPS is the American Legislative Exchange Council, which brings corporations and legislators together to write model legislation that is then debated in statehouses across the nation.
\
ALEC's Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force has recommended that states pass the Electricity Freedom Act, which repeals requirements that utilities have renewable energy sources. The Act says government mandates to produce renewable energy increase costs to taxpayers while benefitting politically favored industries.
\
Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, and chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee, held hearings last session on rolling back the RPS. He is also a member of the ALEC task force. Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, and House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, both active leaders in ALEC, have also spoken out against the RPS.
\
Hedke, a contract geophysicist in the oil and gas industry, says he does not believe in climate change.
\
The requirement to build wind energy capacity has increased electric bills, he said. ""The people on fixed incomes, I guarantee you they feel it,"" he said.
\
Hedke also said the giant wind turbines kill birds, including eagles, and that the energy necessary to build wind turbines and solar panels offsets the reduction in carbon emissions.
\
""Believing you are going to reduce the carbon imprint by using solar or wind is a losing argument,"" he said. ""There is no net reductions in emissions,"" he said.
\
Rieber said studies cited by Hedke have all been refuted.
\
""He is so convinced that there is no such thing as climate change, he wants to prevent, by legislation, any action to address it,"" Rieber said.
\
RPS was part of deal for coal-burning plant
\
But the Kansas Legislature's embrace of the RPS wasn't based on a green vision of the world.
\
Instead it was part of a controversial deal brokered by then-Gov. Mark Parkinson.
\
In return for passage of the RPS, Parkinson would help clear the way for Sunflower Electric Power Corp. to build an 895-megawatt, coal-fired plant in western Kansas.
\
Sunflower got its permit from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, but that plant has not been built, and its future is in doubt.
\
In October, the Kansas Supreme Court overturned the project's permit, ruling that KDHE failed to apply federal regulations on pollution emissions that had become effective several months before the permit had been issued. In a separate lawsuit, a federal judge ruled that the plant couldn't be built without a thorough environmental review.
\
Hedke acknowledged that some legislators' anger over EPA's rules and court actions blocking the Sunflower project is part of the move to repeal RPS.
\
But Sloan said legislators need to maintain a long-term view on energy policy.
\
""Dependence on one or two forms of generation is shortsighted,"" he said.
\
In 2009, Westar Energy, the state's largest electric utility, produced 300 megawatts of wind energy, about 6 percent of its peak load.
\
Since then, Westar has increased that to approximately 660 megawatts and that will go to 860 megawatts when a wind farm is completed in Oklahoma in the next two years.
\
That would put Westar over the 15 percent goal in 2016. In addition, Kansas' other major electric utilities, including Kansas City Power & Light, Sunflower Electric Power Corp., Kansas Electric Power Cooperative, Empire District Co. and Midwest Energy are on track to meet their goals, according to a 2013 Kansas Corporation Commission report.
\
And wind energy faces another political battle. In addition to the fight over renewable energy in the Statehouse, the federal wind production tax credit is set to expire at the end of the year, although any project that has broken ground by the end of 2013 would remain eligible for the break.

"
105,"Gov. Sam Brownback joined business and legislative leaders Monday to unveil legislation transforming the state's mandate to expand renewable energy into a voluntary goal and to reset tax policy for developers of power production facilities. \Provisions folded into a House bill emerged after the Legislature failed to repeal Kansas' renewable portfolio standard adopted in 2009 to jump-start construction of a coal-fired utility plant in Kansas. That project in southwest Kansas stalled, which prompted lawmakers to seek retraction of the RPS. The influential wind lobby pushed back. \""What I tried to articulate in the campaign was that for anything to happen the parties had to come together,"" Brownback said. \Potential implementation by the Legislature of an excise tax on alternative energy producers and the possibility the lifetime property tax exemption on existing wind farms could be undermined may have added urgency to negotiations. \""The wind industry, Brownback, legislative leadership and the fossil fools have brokered a deal to go for a 20 percent RPS, instead of a law-binding mandate, in exchange for no excise tax on renewables,"" said Zack Pistora, a lobbyist with the Kansas Sierra Club, who isn't part of negotiations. ""This should be a double-down on renewable energy -- not a double-back."" \In the state's RPS era, electricity production from Kansas wind farms has grown from 1,000 megawatts in 2010 to 2,900 megawatts at present. By next year, wind production is expected to grow by 850 megawatts. \Under the deal announced by Brownback, the requirement Kansas utilities draw 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 would become voluntary rather than a mandate. The state's utility companies are expected to reach that benchmark in about a year. \The bill would allow renewable energy facilities, primarily wind farms, to retain a lifetime exemption from payment of property taxes. New alternative energy units built after 2016 would be eligible for a 10-year property tax exemption. At the conclusion of that period, producers would be taxed at the 25 percent commercial rate instead of the 33 percent utility rate. \""This agreement is a good agreement,"" said House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell. ""Good day for Kansas."" \Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, said the compromise served to maintain the state's reputation as a state welcoming to progressive businesses and recognized diverse energy resources available in Kansas. \""A fair and stable tax structure can encourage these wind companies to increase their investments and go far beyond the state's targeted goal,"" said Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence. \The House Energy Committee approved the bill Monday within hours of the governor's Statehouse news conference. \Kimberly Svaty, who lobbies on behalf of the Wind Power Coalition and is a participant in negotiations on the bill, said the deal would bring policy and investment stability to the Kansas energy market. The RPS served a valuable service by contributing to the formation of 12,000 jobs and $8 billion in new investment in Kansas, she said. \""RPS has been an economic engine for the state of Kansas since it was enacted,"" she said. ""The state has virtually achieved its RPS. It was time for us to consider the next iteration of marketplace stability. We have led the nation in wind energy development and, with this development, we look to regain that status."" \Mike O'Neal, chief executive officer of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, said the compromise recognized the need to step away from a portfolio mandate. \""For us, it's about affordability and it's about a free-market system of delivering resources to our customers in a mandate-free environment,"" he said. \The RPS emerged from the ashes of a harsh political feud between the administration of Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and Republicans in the House and Senate on the issuance of a permit necessary for construction of the Holcomb coal-fueled plant. Sebelius, pointing to coal's contribution to global warming, denied the air-quality permit. \When Sebelius resigned in 2009, Gov. Mark Parkinson's behind-the-scenes talks produced legislation that exchanged adoption of the RPS for issuance of the Holcomb permit. Sunflower Electric Power Corp., of Hays, hasn't proceeded with the project. That fostered discussion among conservative Republicans about rolling back the renewable standard. \""You've had a lot of frothing about the policy issue"" Brownback said. \He characterized expansion of wind farming in Kansas as ""fabulous growth"" that delivered ""tremendous investment to the state of Kansas.""\Credit: Tim Carpenter timothy.carpenter@cjonline.com"

Topeka ? Demands from conservatives to jettison Kansas' renewable energy standards died down by halftime of the 2014 legislative session, but like the Kansas weather, that could change at any moment.
\
Asked if the effort to repeal renewable energy goals was dead for 2014, Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, responded. ""Oh no. The session is just starting.""
\
Wagle added, ""It's still a viable issue that people are concerned about. Typically the big issues are debated in the later half, so I wouldn't be surprised to see us debate that sometime soon.""
\
The Kansas Legislature adjourned last week for a brief break after the deadline for bills to win approval in at least one chamber. There are exceptions to the rule, but during the weeks before the deadline no movement was made on a proposal to get rid of what is called the Kansas Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS.
\
Approved in 2009, the RPS required major utility companies to have the capacity to generate 10 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2011. It also called for the companies to generate 15 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2016 and 20 percent by 2020.
\
Opponents argue the requirement to build wind energy capacity has increased electric bills and benefitted politically favored industries.
\
They are backed by the influential American Legislative Exchange Council, which brings corporations and legislators together to write bills that are then proposed in statehouses across the nation.
\
Wagle and House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, are both active leaders in ALEC and have spoken out against the RPS, as has state Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee and member of ALEC's energy task force.
\
The Kansas Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity also oppose RPS. Americans for Prosperity is a nationwide organization that describes itself as ""advancing every individual's right to economic freedom and opportunity."" It supports cutting taxes and government spending and was founded by Charles and David Koch, who run Wichita-based Koch Industries.
\
Supporters of the RPS say it has been a rousing success in putting Kansas on the wind energy map, creating jobs and development.
\
Jason Ball, president of the Hutchinson/Reno County Chamber of Commerce, said the RPS gives Kansas an advantage when vying for renewable energy companies. He said the RPS helped Hutchinson land Siemens Wind Energy, which employs 330 people.
\
And, he said, the Kansas Corporation Commission reported that only 1.7 percent of the increased cost in energy experienced by Kansans can be attributed to the RPS.
\
""Policies such as the Renewable Portfolio Standard support companies that currently provide jobs in Kansas, and it keeps Kansas competitive when recruiting new employers and investment to the region,"" he said.
\
And RPS supporters point to a poll that showed 91 percent of Kansans support using renewable energy and two-thirds of voters would support increasing the state's renewable energy law even if it meant a $1 to $2 increase in their monthly energy bill.
\
The poll, released by renewable energy supporters, surveyed 600 registered Kansas voters in January and had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
\
Wagle said repeal remains alive. ""There have been a lot of communications with chairs and leadership in the House and Senate and governor's office. Everybody is talking,"" she said.

Topeka ? Republicans in the Kansas Senate on Tuesday approved a bill that would repeal the state's renewable energy standards.
\
""Let's repeal this mandate and allow the free market system to work,"" said state Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe.
\
But wind energy advocates said what is called the Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS, has been a boon to the Kansas economy -- creating jobs, luring capital investment and providing payments to landowners.
\
""Wind is paying off,"" said state Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, who opposed the bill. ""We can continue to enjoy and benefit from the wind that has been blowing,"" she said.
\
The measure was sent to the House on a 25-15 vote. All 25 votes were cast by Republicans, while all 8 Democrats in the Senate and 7 other Republicans voted against the bill.
\
The bill would repeal the 2009 RPS, that required major utility companies to have the capacity to generate 10 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2011. It also called for the companies to generate 15 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2016 and 20 percent by 2020. Utilities have said they are on track to meet the standard.
\
The measure featured numerous groups, individuals and local chambers of commerce lined up in favor of the RPS against the statewide Kansas Chamber, Kansas Livestock Association and Americans for Prosperity, which financed a long-running ad campaign against the RPS.
\
AFP argued that since the RPS went into effect, some Kansans' electric bills had increased 15 times.
\
But those in favor of wind energy said those increases were essentially pass-throughs to comply with federal environmental rules and regulations. They also pointed to a state study that said renewable energy accounts for one-fifth of one cent of the 9.95 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity cost.
\
Opponents said the renewable standards were an example of government picking favorites, but supporters said no state dollars were expended for the standards, unlike numerous state programs that give tax breaks to business.
\
Immediately after the vote, AFP's Kansas director Jeff Glendening issued a statement, saying, ""Mandates like the RPS disable the competition that ultimately leads to lower costs.""
\
If approved by the House, the measure would go to Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican who is allied with legislative leaders and groups opposing the RPS. But in the past, Brownback has praised Kansas wind development.
\
The RPS was the result of a controversial deal brokered in 2009 by then-Gov. Mark Parkinson.
\
In return for passage of the RPS, Parkinson vowed to help clear the way for Sunflower Electric Power Corp. to get a permit for an 895-megawatt, coal-fired plant in western Kansas.
\
Sunflower got its permit from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, but that plant has not been built, and its future is in doubt.

Topeka ? Despite pleas from a growing wind energy industry in Kansas, a Senate committee Thursday voted to repeal the state renewable energy standards.

\
State Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, blamed the standards for increased electric costs and said it was an ill-advised government mandate that gave wind energy an advantage.
\
It would have been like mandating ""20 percent of the people to keep a Blackberry,"" he said.
\
State Sen. Forrest Knox, R-Altoona, also voted for repeal, saying, ""Let's let business do its thing.""
\
Renewable energy advocates said repeal of the standards would hurt Kansas' ability to recruit industries that say an RPS helps provide a reliable and equitably priced energy source.
\
State Sen. Marci Francisco
\
State Sen. Marci Francisco
\
""I'd hate for us to lose our spot on that map,"" of states with renewable energy goals, said state Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence.
\
The bill would repeal the 2009 Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS, that required major utility companies to have the capacity to generate 10 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2011. It also called for the companies to generate 15 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2016 and 20 percent by 2020. Utilities have said they are on track to meet the standard.
\
Wind energy advocates said the RPS helped spur development of wind-related industries that have produced thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in capital investment across the state.
\
And they pointed to state studies that showed the RPS had almost no impact on electric rate increases.
\
""Passing this (repeal) would not reduce the cost of any residential customers' utility bill,"" Francisco said.
\
The bill was approved by the Senate Utilities Committee on a voice vote. Only Francisco and state Sen. Tom Hawk, D-Manhattan, asked to be recorded as 'no' votes.
\
Francisco also opposed a move by Committee Chairman Pat Apple, R-Louisburg, to place the Senate bill in an already approved House bill and gut the contents of the House bill. That means if the Senate approves the repeal, the House could approve the bill without having a public hearing on the measure. The committee approved the maneuver over Francisco's protests.
\
Repeal efforts are being led by House and Senate leaders, backed by the Kansas Chamber, Americans for Prosperity, and American Legislative Exchange Council. However, Gov. Sam Brownback, who is closely aligned with the legislative leaders and these groups, has spoken in favor of wind energy.
\
The RPS was the result of a controversial deal brokered in 2009 by then-Gov. Mark Parkinson.
\
In return for passage of the RPS, Parkinson vowed to help clear the way for Sunflower Electric Power Corp. to build an 895-megawatt, coal-fired plant in western Kansas.
\
Sunflower got its permit from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, but that plant has not been built, and its future is in doubt.
\
Olson said if the RPS had been put to a vote back then by itself it wouldn't have been approved.

109,"Rival assessments of Kansas' renewable portfolio standard Thursday failed to resolve questions about the cost to consumers of a state mandate that utility companies blend more alternative energy sources into the power grid. \While a Boston think tank economist said the law stipulating 20 percent had to be derived from renewable sources by 2020 came at a cost of $660 a year for residential customers, an official with a Kansas environmental group dismissed the estimate as suspiciously inflated. \The issue is in the spotlight at the Capitol because Republicans in the House and Senate are sponsoring bills to delay or eliminate the state's RPS requirement adopted in 2009. In recent years, companies have invested billions of dollars in Kansas wind farms to take advantage of blustery conditions on the Plains. Utility companies are drawing that power into their systems as they move closer to the goal of 15 percent by 2015 and 20 percent by 2020. \Michael Head, research economist with Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University, said renewable energy generation from wind, solar and other sources was less efficient and cost more than conventional coal, natural gas and nuclear options. \""In order to prop up these new industries, governments enact energy mandates to force utilities to buy electricity from renewable sources,"" Head said. ""But, energy prices eventually manifest themselves. These higher costs are passed to electricity consumers."" \Head, brought to Kansas by the conservative Kansas Policy Institute, said the RPS would trigger a 45 percent spike in rates by 2020, which converts to a $660 annual surge for residential customers. The cost of this alternative power would be 18.4 cents per kilowatt hour by 2020, he said, and draw 12,000 jobs away from the Kansas economy. \Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate Energy Project in Hutchinson, said calculations in the year-old report by Beacon Hill Institute didn't ring true. \""I'm suspicious of a report by an organization using model data,"" she said. ""Our energy costs have increased here, but not because of wind power."" \The state RPS law caps the residential cost increase attributable to the RPS to 1 percent, which would translate to $13.80 a year. The cost of wind power is alternatively estimated by utility companies at 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour, rather than 18.4 cents. \In November, the law firm of Polsinelli Shughart, in a partnership with the Kansas Energy Information Network, released an assessment indicating wind power was equivalent or less expensive than new natural gas generation stations. The wind farms also poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the pockets of rural landowners and municipal governments. \""We don't need to guess about wind generation's economic impacts for the state of Kansas,"" said Alan Claus Anderson, of Polsinelli Shughart. ""It has also been a benefit to local communities, particularly those in rural areas, and provides electricity generation diversity, economic development and an intelligent hedge against rising costs of fossil fuels."" \Topeka Rep. Annie Kuether, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Environment Committee and an RPS supporter, said a swift rush to undermine the renewable standard didn't reflect the two-year process legislators completed to arrive at the energy mandate. The RPS was part of a deal to secure a state permit for a controversial coal-fired power plant, which hasn't been built in rural southwest Kansas. \""It's important for committee members to understand the history that brought forward the RPS,"" Kuether said.\Credit: Tim Carpenter THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL"
110,"As the House Energy and Environment Committee finished a hearing on a bill that would repudiate President Barack Obama's climate change plan, one representative expressed frustration at the amount of time the committee has spent debating climate issues. \""It's a little disappointing that we can't come to some scientific certainty about some of these issues,"" Rep. Russell Jennings, R-Lakin, said. ""We heard last year from scientists on this issue, seemingly endlessly, as I recall, with charts and graphs on both sides."" \Jennings said he wondered if the committee could come to some consensus on the president's plan without including an overarching statement about climate change itself. \""There's somewhere in the middle here where I think we can all agree,"" Jennings said. \But agreement on the committee remains elusive -- on whether human-caused climate change exists and on the appropriateness of renewable energy mandates. \Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, the chairman of the committee and a climate change skeptic, led an unsuccessful effort to roll back the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards last year. \Hedke's committee has added two new members this year who could be more sympathetic to that cause and Americans for Prosperity has bankrolled a statewide television and radio ad blitz, but there appears to be no guarantee of victory for RPS repeal this session either. \Last week Hedke's committee tabled a bill to eliminate ""net metering"" -- the requirement that utility companies compensate kilowatt-for-kilowatt customers who put energy back on the grid through methods like solar power. \Hedke said that bill isn't dead, but the 9-7 vote to table it surprised him. \The renewable energy standards, passed in 2009, require the state's utility companies to get 20 percent of what they produce from renewable sources by 2020. \Proponents say utilities are having little trouble reaching that goal, thanks largely to a wind energy boom that has driven commerce to parts of the state starved for it. \Those who want to repeal the standards say they aren't against wind, they just don't like government mandates. They also say the standards are driving up energy bills. \The Kansas Corporation Commission testified that two of the state's largest utilities, Kansas City Power and Light and Westar, reported rate increases of ""less than 1 percent"" and 1.7 percent, respectively, due to purchasing wind power. \Attempts to repeal the renewable standards last year failed in part because of moderate Republicans like Rep. Marshall Christmann, R-Lyons, who consistently voted with Democrats to keep them in place. \During the legislative session, Christmann was shuttling back and forth from Topeka to Pratt County, in his district, where local zoning decisions were paving the way for energy giant BP to build a wind farm. \In March, with the session underway and RPS repeal on the table, BP suddenly pulled its permit application. \""Which of course scared me,"" Christmann said. ""I want those jobs."" \Christmann said he didn't know if BP's decision was prompted by the RPS repeal talks, but he wasn't taking any chances. \The wind project was slated to produce 500 jobs for up to four years. That represents more than 5 percent of the population in Pratt County, which, as of August 2013, had an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent. \""Every time I voted and revoted and voted again, it was always with my district in mind,"" Christmann said. \BP is now ""back in the game"" in Pratt County, Christmann said, but he is no longer on the energy and environment committee. \He and Rep. Phil Hermanson were replaced by Rep. Joe Seiwert, R-Pretty Prairie, and Rep. Ken Corbet, R-Topeka. Hermanson was replaced because he resigned from the Legislature. \Christmann said his reassignment to the House Veterans, Military and Homeland Security Committee, while not unsavory, wasn't his decision. \Christmann received a one-sentence email from House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, announcing the move. \Merrick's spokeswoman, Rachel Whitten, said it was part of the normal shuffling that occurred in a House chamber that lost seven members from the year before. \""Once you make one adjustment, it's kind of like a domino (effect) in the other committees,"" Whitten said. \Christmann said he is still tracking the renewable standards issue as one that is important to his district. \He also said he has heard the commercials ripping the standards and attempting to tie them to former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and the federal health care reforms she is leading that are unpopular in Kansas. \""Somebody is spending a lot of money,"" Christmann said. \Jeff Glendening, the state director of Americans for Prosperity, said that repealing the renewable standards remains a high priority for his organization and he would be ""disappointed"" if the Legislature doesn't take another crack at it this year. \""We see it as a free market issue,"" Glendening said. \There have been no hearings scheduled on it yet, but Glendening said he believes that will change. \""We fully expect it to be an issue this session,"" Glendening said. ""We just don't know when."" \Forbes and other news outlets have reported that Americans for Prosperity is funded in part by Charles and David Koch, Wichita brothers who have made billions in the oil and natural gas industry. \Hedke himself has ties to that industry, as a contract geophysicist who has worked for dozens of regional oil and gas producers. \He has said that his views on climate change are based on careful consideration of the scientific evidence and he believes in protecting the environment. \But his views clashed with environmental groups like the Kansas Sierra Club at the hearing on Obama's climate plan, where he took the unusual step of testifying at a hearing he chaired. He also found himself opposite environmentalists when he testified Thursday for a bill to encourage completion of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. \The pipeline hearing was in another committee, but the one on net metering was also in Hedke's and some members of his committee seem burnt out on the debate over fossil fuels versus renewable energy. \Rep. Julie Menghini, D-Pittsburg, asked if committee members were ""just spinning our wheels"" by spending over an hour debating whether to protest Obama's climate plan. \""Do you really think passing this achieves any practical action or purpose?"" Menghini asked. \""Well, I hope it will open some people's eyes and minds to attempt to understand that not everyone agrees with the president's climate action plan,"" Hedke said. \""I think everyone understands that,"" Menghini said.\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
111,"A renewable portfolio standard that mandated Kansas utilities receive 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 is a couple of votes and a signature away from becoming history. \And that's fine, according to everyone -- Gov. Sam Brownback, legislative leaders and representatives of the fossil fuel industry and wind industry -- involved in crafting an agreement to make the 20 percent goal a voluntary one and adjust the taxing status of wind energy production facilities. \The Topeka Capital-Journal has been a supporter of wind energy and its positive impact on the state's economy -- from the cash it put in property owners' pockets to the factory it spawned in Hutchinson and the jobs it created in that community and across Kansas. Wind energy has been good to the state, but the industry is grown up now and moving to the next phase of its development makes sense. \The mandatory RPS had been the proverbial line in the sand between the fossil fuel and wind energy industries for years and a settlement of some sorts was needed. That the state's utilities expect to reach the 20 percent mark in another year created an environment conducive to retiring the mandate. \Under the agreement, which is incorporated in a bill approved by the House Energy Committee hours after the deal was unveiled, the 20 percent mark becomes voluntary, existing renewable energy facilities retain a lifetime exemption from property taxes and alternative energy facilities built after 2016 are eligible for a 10-year property tax exemption, after which they will be taxed at the 25 percent commercial rate. \House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, said the agreement signified a ""good day for Kansas."" Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, said the agreement's tax structure could encourage wind companies to increase their investments. \Bipartisan support for anything isn't common these days in Kansas. That the agreement on RPS draws support from both sides of the aisle says a lot about the fairness of the negotiated deal. \Kimberly Svaty, who represents the Wind Power Coalition and participated in the negotiations, noted the RPS had been an economic engine for the state but said it was time to consider the next step toward marketplace stability. \The wind industry was active in Kansas before there was an RPS mandate. Kansans can be confident the industry will survive without it and continue to contribute to the state's economy. \Members of The Capital-Journal Editorial Advisory Board are Gregg Ireland, Mike Hall, Fred Johnson, Ray Beers Jr., Garry Cushinberry, John Stauffer, Frank Ybarra and Sally Zellers."

Topeka ? Whenever people flip a switch on the wall, they expect the lights to come on. And unless there's something wrong with the wiring or the light bulb, it almost always does.
\
But what many people don't realize is that there's much more involved in getting electricity into that light socket than simply running wires from the local power plant. What makes the light come on even when that power plant is down for maintenance is an organization that most people have never heard of, but one that could play a significant role when the Kansas Legislature reconvenes next month and begins debating the state's energy policy.
\
The Southwest Power Pool, based in Little Rock, Ark., is an organization made up of dozens of utility companies and transmission companies stretching across nine states. Its job is to ensure the reliability of a vast, interconnected power grid 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
\
Established in 1941, its original mission was part of the nation's World War II effort. It connected 11 regional power companies to make sure an Arkansas aluminum factory was powered around the clock. After the war, the group's leaders decided it should continue to maintain reliability and coordination.
\
Today, it's one of 13 regional power pools that make up the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC.
\
""Essentially, it manages the reliable dispatch of electricity on the electric grid,"" said SPP spokesman Tom Kleckner. ""It manages the regional grid in our area with an eye on reliability, safety and public policy.""
\
It's in that area of public policy where SPP is likely to be a key consideration in the upcoming legislative session.
\
Renewable energy policy
\
As a general rule, Kleckner said, SPP is not concerned about how electricity is generated. Its job is to make sure there is a sufficient flow of electricity, from whatever source, across a wide, regional and interconnected power grid.
\
That region includes all or parts of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
\
But in the face of global climate change that's being caused in large part by carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, Kansas and many other states, as well as the federal government, have enacted policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions from power plants.
\
In 2009, then-Gov. Mark Parkinson, a Democrat, signed a bill establishing a renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, requiring most utility companies to produce at least 20 percent of their energy from renewable resources by 2020.
\
And at the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing a Clean Power Plan that would establish new limits for greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and require states to adopt plans to cut their emissions 30 percent by 2030.
\
Both of those policies are now coming under heavy political attack, especially in Topeka where Republicans and some industry groups want to roll back, or even repeal, the existing policy.
\
SPP's role in Kansas
\
Supporters of wind energy say the RPS bill was important in developing that industry in Kansas, and SPP played a key role in the development of transmission lines that carry electricity from wind farms in central and western Kansas to urban centers that make up most of the demand.
\
""They (SPP) are the ones that establish the interconnections between the power companies and transmission companies so you can move power form western Kansas to Chicago,"" said Rep. Tom Sloan, R-Lawrence, who has been closely involved in utility and regulatory issues at both the state and federal levels.
\
A recent analysis by the Polsinelli law firm, which lobbies on behalf of energy industry clients, said the wind energy industry has created, either directly or indirectly, more than 10,000 jobs in Kansas and generates $26 million a year in lease payments to landowners and other economic activity.
\
Political opposition
\
But RPS laws have come under attack in Kansas and other states from conservative groups including the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, which has written model legislation to be introduced in statehouses to repeal what it calls renewable energy ""mandates.""
\
The Kansas Senate passed such a bill in the 2014 session, but it was defeated in the House.
\
During the 2014 campaign, Gov. Sam Brownback said he would be willing to consider phasing out or repealing the RPS rule.
\
And the current chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee, Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, has been an outspoken critic of the science of climate change and the effects of carbon emissions in the atmosphere.
\
""Attempting to modify CO2 concentration with the goal of controlling Earth's temperature is a futile effort that has no basis in good science and virtually zero chance of success,"" Hedke wrote in a recent letter to editor of the Wichita Eagle.
\
SPP spokesman Kleckner said the power pool has no position on whether states should adopt RPS rules. But he said the power pool does have serious concerns about the proposed new EPA rules, which he said could force many older coal-fired plants to shut down before they can be replaced with cleaner-burning plants or renewable energy.
\
""If they were to take out all this generation we assume they're taking out, we don't have enough time to replace that infrastructure,"" Kleckner said. ""It takes about eight and a half years, using our process, to build an infrastructure project after it's been proposed.""
\
SPP has formally asked EPA to modify or rescind its Clean Power Plan. The Kansas Corporation Commission has also expressed opposition.

113,"Rep. Dennis Hedke, the chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee, left this past weekend's American Legislative Exchange Council conference in Chicago with new ideas and new data to show his legislative colleagues. \Hedke, R-Wichita, said he sat on a task force that examined energy, environment and agriculture issues during the ALEC conference, the first he has attended. \""I was very impressed by the broad range of contents we deliberated,"" Hedke said via email. ""I would certainly say that the overall group was very diverse, with a great number of states represented, expertise appearing in panels, and other very valuable metrics."" \ALEC brings together lawmakers and corporate lobbyists who sit on task forces and subcommittees and craft ""model bills"" that then can be introduced in statehouses across the country. That process isn't open to the media. \Legislation that closely resembled model bills in areas like union rights, environmental protection and public education was introduced in the Kansas Legislature last year. Some bills, like one restricting public employee paycheck deductions for political activities and another repealing local ""prevailing wage"" ordinances, passed. \Others, like several school choice initiatives and bills to rollback renewable energy standards, sputtered. \Hedke said his ALEC task force discussed two new approaches to state renewable portfolio standards, or RPS. They were called the ""Market-Power Renewables Act"" and the ""Renewable Energy Credit Act."" The first model bill would allow consumers to choose whether they wanted to purchase electricity from renewable sources from their utilities. Both would remove the state mandates that require utilities to get a certain percentage of their energy from renewables. \""Careful study of these models may result in the development of legislation that can bring benefit to Kansas consumers, while encouraging stability in our total energy consumptive mix,"" Hedke said. \Hedke said his committee also discussed a ""Resolution in Opposition to a Carbon Tax"" that he ""strongly supported, and which passed by a wide margin."" \The European Union, the Netherlands and Australia have adopted such ""cap-and-trade"" regulations that penalize carbon emissions that have been linked to global climate change. \But Hedke, who has said he is unconvinced by the evidence for such a link, said ""such a tax would have an immediate and dramatic effect on gasoline and other transportation fuels in America, immediate and substantial increases on electricity costs and would put our country at a competitive disadvantage."" \Hedke, a contract geophysicist who has worked for oil and gas companies, was one of 11 Republican legislators who used state dollars to pay their $475 ALEC conference registration fee in advance. They included six senators: Garrett Love, of Montezuma; Terry Bruce, of Hutchinson; Jeff King, of Independence; Julia Lynn, of Olathe; Mary Pilcher-Cook, of Shawnee; and Jim Denning, of Overland Park. \House Republicans requesting the subsidy in advance were Hedke, Rob Bruchman and Marvin Kleeb, of Overland Park; Kevin Jones, of Wellsville; and Ron Ryckman Sr., of Meade. \Other legislators paid their own registration fee to attend and may choose to be reimbursed at any time during the fiscal year that ends July 2014. \House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, and Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, are on ALEC's national board of directors. \A keynote address by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was one of the few portions of the conference made public this year. \Bush stumped for more ""school-choice"" initiatives like public charter schools, private school vouchers and online education. \Bush also expressed support for the Common Core K-12 education standards, which came under fire from a group of Kansas conservatives last year, causing the Legislature to take up a bill to freeze funding for the initiative that was narrowly defeated in the closing hours of the session. \Other speakers at the Chicago conference included Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and Arthur Laffer, the economist hired to mastermind Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback's income tax cuts. \Last weekend's gathering was ALEC's 40th annual meeting. The group's profile and detractors have grown in recent years, following Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's bitter battle with unions and the proliferation of ""Stand Your Ground"" gun laws based on ALEC's ""Castle Doctrine Act."" \Thousands of protesters were reportedly in the streets surrounding the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago where the conference was held. \Sen. Jeff Melcher, R-Leawood, told a Chicago CBS affiliate that they were demonstrating against their own interests by opposing ALEC's free-market principles in favor of ""big government."" \""Historically it's shown to work to their detriment,"" Melcher said. ""Whenever we free up the marketplace, the market seems to settle a lot of problems on its own.""\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
114,"WIND ENERGY \Under attack \A media blitz by the Koch-supported Americans For Prosperity that attacks Kansas' wind industry exploits lingering anger towards former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius for halting the Holcomb coal plant and promoting Obamacare. \While AFP clamors for repeal of the Renewable Portfolio Standard, the American Legislative Exchange Council is the actual ringleader behind the scenes. Dedicated ALEC members -- Senate President Susan Wagle, House Speaker Ray Merrick and House Energy and Environment Committee Chairman Dennis Hedke -- ardently promote ALEC's national interests while disregarding those of Kansans. \These anti-wind energy legislators seek repeal or weakening of Kansas's RPS knowing full well AFP's wind cost information is wrong. \Publicly available Kansas Corporation Commission data cites EPA mandated coal plant retrofits and transmission upgrades as primarily responsible for rate increases. \Repealing or weakening Kansas's RPS is ALEC's prime objective. Success in Kansas would be a springboard for repealing RPS legislation in other states. This outcome would have a negative effect on Kansas's economy as demand for low cost Kansas wind energy and Kansas built wind energy components would drop. \Sadly, these legislative leaders are sacrificing a growing wind export market and jobs for appeasing ALEC and their donors' far right ideology. \MARK RICHARDSON, Hutchinson\Plains States Coordinator\Red State Renewable Alliance \HEALTH CARE \What's the plan? \Gov. Sam Brownback's administration has been vocal about its opposition to the Affordable Care Act. However, I have not heard what it does envision for health care. I have to believe it is satisfied with the past, bloated expensive system, which left the poor to use the emergency room as their primary care provider. \I don't believe the Affordable Care Act is the final answer either, but it may be a start. It appears to be much more complicated than necessary and just an expansion of what we have had in the past. It offers the poor access to care through expanded Medicaid. \However, if a state such as Kansas chooses to opt out of Medicaid expansion, the poor are left out of health care. Presently, if you have limited or no income, there are no subsidies for payment of the premium because it was assumed these folks would be in the expanded Medicaid plans. \Again, the question is: What is Brownback's plan? \Brownback has expressed interest in enhancing prison reform. Prisoners receive health care while incarcerated. However, once released, the majority have no way to obtain the medications they were being provided in prison. \It bears repeating that just being poor does not qualify a person for Medicaid in Kansas. It is reserved for mothers of dependents and children. \It would seem as an innovative society we could come to some criteria for a basic health system for all that would not be necessary for all levels of care. \BECKY STAUFFER, Topeka"

Topeka ? TOPEKA -- The Kansas House bucked powerful business interests Wednesday and killed a bill to repeal state renewable energy standards just one day after the Senate had approved the measure.
\
A coalition of Democrats and Republicans, many from western Kansas, voted against the Senate-approved bill. A motion to concur with the bill failed, 44-77.
\
The repeal legislation was sought by the Kansas Chamber, Americans for Prosperity and other influential conservative groups that said the standards were anti-free market and resulted in higher electric bills.
\
Jeff Glendenning, director of the Kansas chapter of AFP, vowed that the fight wasn't over.
\
""We will be talking to a lot of the House members over the next week,"" Glendening said. ""A lot of them have campaigned over the past several years and told their constituents they oppose mandates and support free markets. This is a perfect opportunity to prove it.""
\
But supporters of the renewable standards say they have boosted the economy by bringing wind development, jobs and investment to struggling rural areas. They pointed to a state study that said the additional wind capacity had an insignificant impact on electric rates.
\
State Rep. Russ Jennings, R-Lakin, said those seeking repeal were ""nothing more than folks who want to exercise political power. This is about wanting to have a win for the sake of having a win without considering the potential benefit all this has.""
\
The bill would have repealed the Renewable Portfolio Standard, which required major utility companies to have the capacity to generate 10 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2011. It also called for the companies to generate 15 percent of their energy through a renewable source by 2016 and 20 percent by 2020. Utilities have said they are on track to meet the standard.
\
The Lawrence delegation in both the House and Senate voted against repealing the RPS.
\
On Tuesday evening, Republicans in the Senate approved the bill on a 25-15 vote.
\
The RPS was the result of a controversial deal brokered in 2009 by then-Gov. Mark Parkinson.
\
In return for passage of the RPS, Parkinson vowed to help clear the way for Sunflower Electric Power Corp. to get a permit for an 895-megawatt, coal-fired plant in western Kansas.
\
Sunflower got its permit from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, but that plant has not been built yet. Supporters of the plant, however, say they believe it may be built soon.
\
State Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, was in the House to listen to the debate Wednesday.
\
""I think representatives were making very good arguments and a lot of different arguments about how this made good sense for their districts,"" Francisco said.
\
She said the issue could always be revived, but she added: ""It would be hard at this point to know what would make a difference to change the minds of many of those legislators.""
\
AFP's Glendening countered: ""I still think a lot of them are unfamiliar with the issue. That will change over the next few days.""

116,"The House overwhelmingly voted to approve legislation Thursday repealing the 6-year-old renewable energy portfolio standard in Kansas requiring utility companies to generate one-fifth of power from renewable energy resources by the year 2020. \Adoption of the bill endorsed by Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, Americans for Prosperity and the Wind Power Coalition would bring to a close an intense, multi-year effort by conservatives to abolish the energy standard passed in 2009 in exchange for issuance of a permit for construction of a coal-fired power plant in Holcomb. \The House also sent to the Senate a bill legalizing distribution of a marijuana oil for treatment of chronic seizures, reducing sentences for first and second convictions for marijuana possession and allowing research on production of industrial hemp. \Under the negotiated energy deal unveiled Monday by Brownback and passed 107-11 by the House, the target of 20 percent renewable energy in 2020 would become an industry goal. The Senate is expected to follow the House by passing Senate Bill 91. \""This allows some free-market forces to go to work,"" said Rep. Dennis Hedke, a Wichita Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee. \Rep. Annie Kuether, a Topeka Democrat on the energy committee, attempted to persuade representatives to reject the measure. She said plans to dismantle the renewable portfolio standard were hammered out among lobbyists and Republican legislators behind closed doors. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and Kansans for Clean Energy, weren't in the negotiations. \""This is our business,"" Kuether told House members. ""You were elected to do this job, not unelected lobbyists."" \Incentive for wind farm developers to accept conversion of the RPS to a voluntary objective was provided by a threat to impose a 4.3 percent excise tax on energy produced at wind farms, said Rep. Boog Highberger, D-Lawrence. \The legislation didn't contain an excise tax, but included provisions that allow renewable energy producers to retain a lifetime exemption from payment of property taxes. New alternative energy units constructed after 2016 would receive a 10-year property tax exemption similar to the break provided facilities generating electricity from coal or natural gas. \The property tax paid in Kansas after that decade of operation would be the commercial rate of 25 percent rather than the utility rate of 33 percent. \""We should support business certainty in this state,"" said Rep. Russell Jennings, R-Lakin. \The state's RPS, along with federal tax breaks, drove expansion of wind farms from 1,000 megawatts in 2010 to 2,900 megawatts at present. \Meanwhile, the House voted 80-36 to adopt House Bill 2049 to reform the penalty for first and second offenses for possession of marijuana. Both offenses would now be misdemeanors, but the third conviction would stay a felony. \Extensive debate led to addition of an amendment offered by Rep. John Wilson, D-Lawrence, to create an opportunity to legally acquire marijuana oil shown to improve the quality of life for some children with seizures. \Wilson said the oil didn't have chemical properties causing intoxication like pot smoked by people. The new program would be regulated by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Fees would cover the anticipated cost to the state, he said. \Rep. Dick Jones, R-Topeka, said the underlying objective was legalization of medicinal or recreational marijuana. There is no scientific evidence marijuana improves human health, he said. \In addition, the bill was amended at the request of Rep. Willie Dove, R-Bonner Springs, to include provisions clearing a hurdle for research at state universities in Kansas on the potential of industrial hemp as a crop. The Kansas Department of Agriculture would develop rules for studies looking into required soils, seed selection, growing conditions and harvest methods. \Procedural objections in the House blocked an attempt by Rep. Bill Sutton, R-Gardner, to launch debate about repeal of the death penalty in Kansas and replace that sanction with life without the possibility of parole.\Credit: Tim Carpenter timothy.carpenter@cjonline.com"
117,"Wind farm supporters urged lawmakers Tuesday to uphold the requirement for utility companies to generate or purchase renewable energy. \The Senate Utilities Committee heard legislation that would sunset the Renewable Energy Standards Act adopted in 2009 by the end of the year. The act requires major electricity companies like Westar Energy to receive 10 percent of energy capacity from renewable sources. \The second part of Senate Bill 253 would delete the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) increases to 15 percent by 2016 and 20 percent by and after 2020. \Kimberly Svaty of The Wind Coalition said passing the bill would remove an effective policy and deter global investors from considering Kansas. She said it would be a missed opportunity to create more jobs. \""The states with favorable environments win capital investment,"" Svaty said. \Bruce Graham, Wind Energy Department chair at Cloud Community College, told lawmakers the student employment rate for wind energy technician positions is 100 percent. In 2013, Kansas ranked ninth for installed wind capacity with more than 1,700 turbines, according to the American Wind Energy Association. \Bill supporters said the standard creates higher utility rates for Kansans. Roger Woods with Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, said the current policy restricts flexibility in the market. \""There is sufficient wind energy production in Kansas for any business to meet their renewable goals without RPS mandates,"" Woods said. \Mike O'Neal, chief executive officer of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, said he supports the development of market-driven energy technologies, including wind. However, he also urged the committee to consider the costs to counties when wind farms are tax exempt. \""We don't need a mandate in Kansas for the wind to blow,"" O'Neal said. \The committee decided to extend the hearing until Wednesday to hear the remaining testimony.\Credit: Amelia Arvesen Special to The Capital-Journal"

\
Overland Park ? All three candidates for governor faced each other Friday during a debate in Johnson County, answering questions about tax policy, economic development, education funding and a variety of issues.
\
For the most part, though, the major candidates stuck to their key talking points, with Republican Gov. Sam Brownback boasting that his tax cuts are producing economic growth, while Rep. Paul Davis, the Democratic candidate from Lawrence, promised to restore cuts in base aid to public schools that have occurred under the Brownback administration.
\
Meanwhile, Libertarian candidate Keen Umbehr used the debate to promote his ""fair tax"" that would eliminate income taxes for everyone and replace them with a statewide consumption tax.
\
The candidates also tailored their remarks to the Johnson County audience, especially when criticizing each other.
\
""Representative Davis talks about more money for schools, but he's not talking about your schools. He is talking about your money,"" Brownback said, suggesting that Johnson County as a whole accounts for a large percentage of the taxes paid into the state and therefore helps subsidize the school budgets of less populous, less wealthy areas.
\
Davis fired back, saying Johnson County has suffered under the education cuts, which he blamed on Brownback's policy of cutting taxes.
\
""I talked to a school teacher the other day in Shawnee Mission who told me she's got over 30 kids in her class and she can't even get a paraprofessional,"" Davis said. ""That is not how we are going to grow our economy.""
\
The forum, sponsored by the Johnson County Public Policy Council, took place just as a new poll was released from Rasmussen Reports showing the race tightening, with Davis now leading Brownback by four percentage points.
\
An earlier Rasmussen poll showed Davis up by 10 points. It was the third poll in the last week showing Davis with a single-digit lead.
\
The candidates were also asked about their positions on health care and implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
\
Health care expansion
\
Brownback said he opposed the federal law, also known as Obamacare, and said implementing it in Kansas would cost more than $1 billion.
\
""You haven't seen the big hammer from Obamacare yet, that's coming after the election,"" Brownback said.
\
He also argued that if Davis is elected, he would expand Medicaid, and a large share of the $1 billion cost would come from Johnson County.
\
The $1 billion figure represents the total cost to the state over 10 years. Campaign officials said it comes from a study released in January that was commissioned by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. It includes the cost of insuring those who would become newly eligible if Medicaid were expanded as well as the cost of additional people who are already eligible and are expected to enroll because of new outreach efforts.
\
Davis has not committed to expanding Medicaid, but he has spoken favorably about it, saying Kansas hospitals are losing revenue by providing uncompensated care for people who could be insured if the state took part in the Medicaid expansion.
\
After saying that he also believes the federal law has problems, he turned the question around to criticize Brownback's own health care plan, the privatization of Medicaid known as KanCare. That plan was intended to reduce Medicaid costs through managed care administered by private insurance companies.
\
Davis argued that program is not working.
\
""We've got for-profit insurance companies that have not met any of the benchmarks that have been set out for them,"" Davis said.
\
When asked about their approach to tax policy, Brownback defended his record of dramatic cuts in income taxes, saying it has spurred economic growth, especially in Johnson County, which he said is attracting businesses from neighboring Missouri because of the lower taxes.
\
""This is the right direction for us to go, to get that income tax down,"" Brownback said.
\
Umbehr, however, said Brownback's tax plan is unfair because it allows business owners who receive pass-through income from their businesses to pay no tax, while lower income wage earners still pay tax.
\
""Our tax policy right now allows 191,000 business owners to pay zero while 1.4 million wage earners pay it all,"" Umbehr said.
\
Davis said Brownback's tax policies have not produced the economic benefits he promised.
\
""His own council of economic advisors several months ago documented the state of Kansas is lagging behind the surrounding states in virtually every economic growth indicator there is,"" Davis said.
\
Renewable energy
\
The candidates were also asked about their positions on energy policy, and specifically the state's ""renewable portfolio standards,"" or RPS, which require utility companies to produce at least 20 percent of the electricity they sell from renewable sources such as wind power.
\
Brownback has at times given conflicting statements, at one time saying he supports the wind industry and the renewable standards, and at other times saying he would also support phasing out the standards. On Friday, he said he wants the industry itself to come to its own consensus on what to do.
\
""What I have said is I want to see all sides come together,"" Brownback said. ""And if they come together around some proposal that says we want to do something different, like a tax credit, I could go with that. If they say not, I'm not going to do it.""
\
Davis said he supports the renewable standards and fought off efforts in the Legislature to repeal it.
\
""Without RPS, we are sending a very strong message to the wind industry that Kansas is not open for business,"" Davis said. ""We would be the first state in the country to repeal its RPS.""
\
Umbehr said he opposes the renewable standards and he opposes property tax abatements for wind towers, saying such abatements rob money from public school districts.

119,"
Topeka ? The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released its long-awaited Clean Power Plan on Sunday, setting the stage for what could be a pitched battle in Kansas over the federal government's authority to impose such regulations, and possibly over the entire science of climate change.
\
The new rules say that by 2030, the nation's fossil-burning power plants, such as the coal-fired Lawrence Energy Center, must reduce their carbon emissions by 32 percent from their 2005 levels, a more ambitious goal than originally proposed. It also requires each state to adopt its own plan for achieving that goal.
\
""We applaud the EPA's moving forward with these rules,"" said Rabbi Moti Rieber, director of Kansas Interfaith Power and Light, a faith-based group that lobbies the Kansas Legislature on environmental policy. ""People of faith from every tradition know that climate change isn't solely a scientific issue, but a moral one.""
\
The White House announced the new rules Sunday, along with state-specific information about the benefits that the Obama administration says will result from the new rules.
\
In 2013, the White House said, Kansas power plants emitted 33 million metric tons of carbon pollution, equal to the yearly pollution from nearly 7 million automobiles.
\
In addition to cutting carbon emissions, the administration said, the new guidelines will also cut other forms of pollution such as soot and smog, which it says will produce significant health benefits.
\
But utility companies are worried that the new standards, which have been in the works for more than a year, could force them to retire old coal-fired power plants before they have time to put new, cleaner generating facilities in place, something they say could threaten the reliability of the entire power grid.
\
""The rule will impact rates and could impact reliability, but it's too soon to say how much,"" said Gina Penzig, spokeswoman for Topeka-based Westar Energy. ""We work every day to improve reliability while keeping costs as low as we can.""
\
Penzig noted that Westar has already reduced its carbon emissions by 15 percent from 2005 levels. But Westar, along with Kansas City Power and Light, together recently invested $600 million upgrading the coal-fired La Cygne power plant in Linn County to meet other EPA regulations, money they are now seeking to recover through a rate increase.
\
Those utilities have argued that they should be allowed to recoup those kinds of costs at La Cygne and elsewhere before they are forced to retire those plants due to new regulations.
\
And business groups also worry that the rules will drive up the cost of electricity, which could have a significant impact on the manufacturing industry.
\
""The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected proposals to limit emissions that fail to take into account the cost of compliance,"" Kansas Chamber president Mike O'Neal said Monday. ""This proposal violates that rule by once again failing to account for the exorbitant and prohibitive cost of compliance.""
\
O'Neal was referring to a decision in June when the court, in a 5-4 ruling, struck down EPA limits on mercury and other toxic emissions from power plants, saying the agency must take costs into consideration when making such rules. The state of Michigan filed the challenge, and Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican, joined in that challenge.
\
""What we need are policies that encourage our manufacturers, not policies that are calculated to punish and penalize,"" O'Neal said. ""We support the viability of our economy, not some notion of what the current president envisions his 'legacy' to be.""
\
Schmidt's office said Monday that it is likely he will join in a challenge of the Clean Power Plan.
\
""We will be reviewing the plan carefully,"" his spokeswoman, Jennifer Rapp, said. ""However, it appears from the EPA's own summary that the Obama Administration has failed to accommodate the comments that were offered by the attorney general, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the Kansas Corporation Commission, and 4.3 million others regarding the EPA's massive restructuring of state economies through the regulation of the generation and dispatch of energy to consumers and businesses. Legal action is a likely outcome.""
\
Republican Gov. Sam Brownback also criticized the new rules.
\
""The EPA failed to adequately consider the negative impact this overreaching regulation has on Kansas rate payers, resulting in higher electricity rates and greater uncertainty in grid reliability,"" Brownback said in a statement released late Monday. ""The final rule released today is twice as bad for Kansas as the proposed rule released last summer and requires us to review not only the rule itself but reconsider the state's overall approach to the Clean Power Plan.""
\
Kansas has already cut carbon emissions from power plants by 11 percent since 2008, according to the White House. That is largely due to a state law, enacted in 2009, known as a renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, which required electric utilities to produce at least 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020.
\
Utilities in Kansas actually surpassed that goal last year when wind energy produced 21.7 percent of the state's energy. But Kansas lawmakers repealed the RPS law this year, replacing it with a voluntary standard.
\
They also passed a law setting up procedures that could make it difficult for Kansas to implement the Clean Power Plan.
\
The law authorizes the Department of Health and Environment to develop a state plan, in conjunction with the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates public utilities in Kansas.
\
But any plan they develop also must be approved by a special legislative committee that is headed by the chairmen of the House and Senate utilities committees.
\
Those two chairmen, Rep. Dennis Hedke of Wichita and Sen. Robert Olson of Olathe, have both stated publicly that they do not believe carbon emissions in the atmosphere are a cause of global climate change.

"
120,"
Democrat Rep. John Wilson and Republican Nick VanWyhe are campaigning to represent House District 10 in the Kansas Legislature.
\
The Journal-World asked the candidates to respond to a few of the issues dominating this election season. Below are their answers:
\
Tax policy: Should Kansas repeal some or all of the tax cuts enacted in 2012 and 2013; delay implementing future tax cuts; or, as Gov. Sam Brownback has suggested, ""hit the accelerator?""
\
Wilson: We should hit the brakes on Governor Brownback's tax plan, and follow that up with a thoughtful, inclusive, and evidence-based discussion about how we can strengthen our economy and fund our government in a way that is equitable and fair to all Kansans. I think an appropriate outcome would be a plan that balances property, sales and income taxes; ties tax cuts to specific and measurable outcomes; and ensures that all of us are contributing to a well-functioning, efficient and productive government.
\
VanWyhe: I don't believe that Kansas should repeal its tax cuts. The tax cuts that Kansans have received have helped the lower and middle class. Kansans work hard for their money and shouldn't have to give it up to the government to give them the ability to spend taxpayer dollars recklessly.
\
Education funding: Although the Kansas Supreme Court has addressed the issue of equity in the school finance formula, the question of adequacy - whether the state is making ""suitable provision"" overall for financing public schools -- is still before a three-judge panel. If that panel rules that the state must increase spending, how do you think the Legislature should respond?
\
Wilson: The simple answer is that we should fund education at the level the Supreme Court indicates. The challenge lies in our ability to do so given our dire budget situation. Before any good policy idea -- Medicaid expansion, funding our state water plan, investing early childhood programs -- can move forward, we must address our revenue shortfall. If the past two years are any indication, conservatives in the Legislature may try to punish the judicial branch by attempting to change how Justices are selected or even change the Kansas Constitution so that the pesky phrase ""suitable provision"" is no longer an issue.
\
VanWyhe: Cuts of wasteful spending can be made and still need to be made to allow more money to be allocated for education.
\
More elections coverage
\
Get to know the candidates: Kansas House District 10
\
What source of funding should be used to pay for any increased spending that may be ordered by the court?
\
Wilson: Unlike the federal government, Kansas cannot spend more money than it has. The Brownback administration is already doing the state government equivalent of scrounging through the couch cushions to find some extra change. All of the ""easy"" places to look have been tapped. Because education accounts for 63 percent of our state general fund budget, it's the only place where cuts could create the savings needed to balance the state budget -- but I will oppose any effort to do so. In order to increase spending on education, we'll need to re-address Governor Brownback's ruinous tax plan. While there is room for efficiency or modest cost-savings throughout our budget, that won't be nearly enough.
\
VanWyhe: My opponent had a platform in 2012 that included increasing funding for education, but when he was given the chance to do so this past legislative session, he voted no against the education bill. This is a prime example of hypocritical politicians, and we don't need them here in Kansas. The recent increase in funding is a step toward progress, however there is still room for improvement.
\
Higher education funding: Do you think the state of Kansas is providing enough funding for higher education in Kansas?
\
Wilson: State funding for higher education is not adequate. The situation is simultaneously jeopardizing our ability to stay competitive in a global economy and saddling students with mountains of student loan debt due to increased tuition costs. Investments in K-12 and higher education are among the best we can make.
\
VanWyhe: The economic downturn of a few years ago and the reduced state revenues as a result of the income tax reductions have exasperated a 20-year trend of the state providing a lower level of support to higher education. The result of lower state funding as a percentage of university operating budgets is higher tuition to pay for faculty salaries, laboratories, and computer centers necessary to provide a first-class higher education opportunity to Kansans. I support increasing state aid to students in tuition assistance and general aid to the universities, community colleges, and technical colleges.
\
What measures would you support to hold down the rate of tuition increases at state colleges and universities?
\
Wilson: We'll need to get creative given the budget crisis we face. The major elements of higher education funding are appropriations (from the state), tuition, and student financial aid. All three of those should be considered in collaboration amongst policymakers and university officials. It might also be valuable to explore incentives or tuition based on strategic state goals, like growing our healthcare, bioscience or arts sectors.
\
VanWyhe: The solution to many of our funding problems is to cut wasteful spending. Legislators -- especially my opponent -- have lost the ability to differentiate between a ""want"" and a ""need,"" and there is still a lot of wasteful spending, more than one thinks.
\
Water resources: While groundwater resources are rapidly being depleted in some parts of western Kansas, eastern Kansas faces its own challenges as reservoirs used for public water supply are silting up. What measures would you support to sustain the state's current water supplies for future generations?
\
Wilson: Any major operation to address existing water quality issues or silting issues will require significant amounts of money -- which we won't have if we stay on our current path. Like many things, prevention is key with water. There are some very tough political decisions that must be made regarding our agricultural practices. We as individuals also need to manage our water usage and adopt a habit and mindset of conservation.
\
VanWyhe: Existing state law states that the State will contribute $6 million per year into the state water plan. Governors and a majority of state legislators have not provided that funding for the past five years. I support such state general fund expenditures. We need to increase funding to reduce agriculture and urban run-off that contributes to siltation in our drinking water lakes. We also need to address the problem of blue-green algae in our drinking water supply lakes because it is a health hazard to humans and animals.
\
Health care: Do you support expanding the state's Medicaid program as allowed under the federal Affordable Care Act?
\
Wilson: Yes, without a doubt. Providing health insurance to over 100,000 Kansans is the right thing to do morally and financially. Not only will it help individuals by allowing them to access preventative care, treat chronic disease, and avoid financial ruin should they get really sick, but it also will bring billions into our economy. The challenge is that because of our budget crisis, there is no money to even make this a reality.
\
VanWyhe: I will fight to limit the effect Obamacare will have on Kansans. In order to accomplish this, we must push our future governor and attorney general toward taking a public stance against the President's detrimental legislation. we need to fight against the intrusive reach of the federal government into the lives of Kansas families.
\
What other measures would you support to reduce the number of Kansans who currently lack health insurance?
\
Wilson: I can't think of a better way to drastically cut the number of uninsured Kansans than to expand Medicaid. We've already seen that happen in states with governors and leaders who made the right decision to expand Medicaid.
\
VanWyhe: The Obama Administration has crossed the line by intruding in the lives of Kansans at home, in the classroom, and at work with the many overreaching policies that are directly affecting our state and its citizens.
\
Energy policy: Do you support the state's current Renewable Portfolio Standards which require utility companies to produce a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable sources, or do you believe as some have suggested that those standards should be repealed or phased out?
\
Wilson: Without question I support the RPS in Kansas, which is why I voted against repealing it. It's good for our health, good for the environment, and good for business.
\
VanWyhe: I support retention of the Renewable Energy Portfolio requirement. The RPS has contributed to the Siemens Company locating a factory in Hutchinson and it places Kansas among the leaders nationally in producing electricity without carbon emissions.

"
121,"A University of Kansas lecturer testified at a Senate hearing in 2014 against Kansas' renewable energy standards after a KU institute he leads received thousands of dollars from a Koch Industries-funded foundation to conduct research on the standards, emails show. \Art Hall, a KU lecturer and director of the university's Center for Applied Economics, wrote in a Nov. 25, 2013, email that the Fred and Mary Koch Foundation had agreed to spend $40,000 in 2013 on the center's payroll. \Hall said in an interview that donors -- whether it is a Koch-funded foundation or anyone else -- ask him to answer questions, but that he reports only on what he can prove with evidence. \The 2013 email was released last week as part of a settlement between Hall and a KU student who had sought his emails under the Kansas Open Records Act. \By the date Hall sent the email, the center had spent $35,865.40 of the Koch grant. \""A substantial portion of that sum financed,"" Hall wrote, ""background research on Renewable Portfolio Standard"" and ""work on a survey related to the local 'business environment' in Lawrence."" \According to an IRS disclosure report filed by the Fred and Mary Koch Foundation, Koch Industries -- which is involved in petroleum production -- is the organization's sole contributor. Hall's email was sent to Laura Hands, Koch Industries' community affairs director. \The renewable energy standards, also known as the renewable portfolio standards, required Kansas electric companies to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020. Gov. Sam Brownback and the Legislature were successful in making the standards voluntary this year after failed attempts at repeal in previous years. \Those attempts included a 2014 legislative push to get rid of the standards. Hall testified in favor of repeal at a Senate hearing in March 2014, after his center had produced Koch-funded research on the standards. \Hall said in an email to a reporter that the testimony was the only published work that came from his investigation into the standards. \In a follow-up phone interview, Hall said he enjoys trying to engage people who have a question they want answered, and crafting original research in a way that is compelling to the average Kansas legislator but also to academics who want to get up to speed quickly on a topic. \Hall said he enters his research with personal assumptions, such as a belief in the free market, but that he modifies his assumptions as he learns. \He said he has always been drawn to the public policy arena, as opposed to strictly academic settings. But, he said he still has an academic responsibility to make sure his opinions are supported by evidence. \""They're two distinct marketplaces. The public policy arena is not nearly as formal and peer-reviewed, but at the same time if you're going to be effective and compelling, you can't be blowing smoke, you've got to have evidence,"" Hall said. \A copy of the March 2014 testimony supplied by Hall notes that the viewpoints expressed by him were his alone, and not that of the University of Kansas or Kansas Board of Regents, which governs the state's public universities. Hall said any professor testifying would have to make a similar disclaimer. The disclaimer also says the viewpoints were based on his research and independent judgment. \The key points in Hall's testimony were uniformly negative toward the renewable energy standards. According to Hall, the standards were never needed unless the purpose of the mandate was explicitly to force consumers to buy electricity from a particular energy source. \In addition, he argued the wind industry in Kansas had become economically healthy and that maintaining special privileges for an economically healthy industry was a form of crony capitalism. Economic mandates are anti-entrepreneurial and anti-innovation, Hall said in his testimony. \At the hearing, each person who testified received 10 minutes, Hall said. \""It takes a lot of work to put a summer's worth of research into four paragraphs,"" Hall said. \Hall told a reporter that in 2013 he had been researching three issues in parallel that were related to the renewable energy standards. First, he said he had heard Kansas had the highest spread of any state between wholesale and retail electricity rates. He said he spent an ""inordinate amount"" of time attempting to verify the claim, but never could. \Second, Sen. Jeff Melcher, R-Leawood, spoke to him about the rate spread issue and was considering developing an electricity deregulation bill, which he did. Hall said as he investigated the rates, he did so in the context of understanding deregulation in other states. \And third, Hall said he got involved in the renewable energy standards issue because he had been wanting for some time to better understand the economics of wind energy in the context of Kansas economic development. \""I was never very excited about the projects I had considered in the past. The RPS issue allowed for a more defined investigation in a context that had more policy relevance,"" Hall wrote in an email to a reporter. \Koch ties \Koch Industries, one of the largest privately held businesses in the U.S., is run by Charles and David Koch. The two brothers are well-known for political activity at the national level, where they routinely spend large sums of money on candidates and causes. \Hall himself has ties to Koch Industries -- he served as chief economist for the company's public affairs group from 1997 to 2004, when he left for the Center for Applied Economics, which was founded in 2004. \Connections have previously been drawn between Koch Industries, which is involved in petroleum production, and opposition to the renewable energy standards. And the Wichita Eagle has reported a company official said Koch Industries was part of a coalition opposing the standards. \The Center for Applied Economics' research is also not the first time Koch funds have gone toward research on renewable energy standards. Utah State University's Institute of Political Economy produced research that disputed links between renewable energy and job growth. \The Eagle reported that Ryan Yonk, a research fellow at the institute, testified on the research before a Kansas Senate committee in March of this year. At the hearing, Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, cut off questioning from Sen. Tom Hawk, D-Manhattan, over the source of funding for the research. \After the hearing, Yonk said the Charles Koch Foundation had provided money to the institute. \Battle for records \Disclosure of Hall's emails comes amid an ongoing push to draw attention to Koch's presence at the University of Kansas. \KU released the November 2013 email, as well as other correspondence from Hall, last week after Hall reached a settlement agreement with KU student Schuyler Kraus, who had filed a records request seeking Hall's emails. Kraus is president of Students for a Sustainable Future, a group that seeks to expose Koch ties to academia. \Hall had fought disclosure of his emails, citing a need for academic freedom. The agreement ended the open records request but resulted in the release of a number of messages from Hall related to funding for the center. \Attempts to reach Kraus were unsuccessful. \In a September 2014 op-ed in the Lawrence Journal-World, Kraus listed Hall's ties to the Kochs and her reasoning for pursuing the records request. \""Ensuring an unbiased academic environment is in the interest of liberals and conservatives, alike. Yes, our primary focus is the Kochs; that is simply because they are the epitome of donors who exercise undue influence in academia and legitimize political agendas with questionable academic credentials. Frankly, we take issue with any private donor that seeks to do this, even if their interests were aligned with our personal beliefs. Our ultimate goal is to advocate for higher education,"" Kraus wrote. \The Center for Applied Economics, though self-funding, sits in KU's School of Business. The funding from the Fred and Mary Koch Foundation that went in part toward research on renewable energy standards came as part of the center's Kansas Economic Reform Initiative. \Correspondence released last week as part of the settlement agreement show the Foundation provided an initial $250,000 to kick-start the initiative in 2008. The foundation provided another $100,000 in 2009. \According to an Oct. 27, 2010, letter from Hall to Susan Addington, the foundation's community relations manager, the first $250,000 grant ""helped establish a still-ongoing pipeline of reform-oriented research projects"" and other initiatives that contributed to an ""intellectual foundation for policy change."" \""The 2009 grant of $100,000, dedicated to payroll, allowed the Center to continue the work made possible by the 2008 grant -- as well as inaugurate a Capitalism course in the KU School of Business for honor students university-wide,"" Hall wrote in the letter. \On its website, the center says it ""continually has an array of research products under development."" A list of dozens of publications is available for viewing, though none appear related to the renewable energy standards. \The Fred and Mary Koch Foundation isn't the only group to fund research at the center. Several of the publications note their underwriters. \A report on looming structural deficits in Kansas was underwritten by the Kansas Policy Institute. Another report, called ""An Economic Case for Increased Competition in the Sale of Beer, Wine and Spirits in the State of Kansas,"" was underwritten by the Coalition for Jobs and Consumer Choice. The group was formed by Kansas retail businesses to advocate for expanded liquor sales. \Hall sees the attention focused on him as stemming from misconceptions. People assume because of his associations he is somehow corrupt, he said. \""I think it's people bringing assumptions that are not warranted,"" Hall said.\Credit: Jonathan Shorman jonathan.shorman@cjonline.com"
122,"The top Democrat on the House Energy and Environment Committee warned members of her party Monday that another push to repeal renewable energy standards may be coming. \The House voted 44-77 last week against the Senate-passed proposal to eliminate the standards that require the state's utility companies to glean 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. \But Rep. Annie Kuether, D-Topeka, told her colleagues during a Democratic meeting that she doesn't believe supporters of the repeal effort will allow it to die. \""They're going to try something,"" Kuether said. \Kuether speculated that the repeal bill could be attached as an amendment to another bill related to renewable energy. The most likely candidate, she said, is a bill to alter ""net metering,"" a state policy that refunds consumers who put energy back on the grid using devices like solar power on a kilowatt-per-kilowatt basis. \Kuether emphasized that she hadn't heard anything from the chairman of the House energy committee, Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita. \When asked Monday if the repeal bill might be attached to the net metering measure, Hedke said he had no comment. \Americans for Prosperity, a free market advocacy group, has made repealing the renewable standards a top priority this year, running a six-figure statewide TV and radio ad blitz. A spokesman for the group has said it isn't ready to throw in the towel this session. \Karin Brownlee, a former legislator who is now spokesperson for the group Kansans for Wind Energy, said those who support maintaining the standards remain vigilant. \""There's a fair amount of fervor on the other side,"" Brownlee said. ""We'll continue to be very watchful and talk to legislators to make sure they're educated."" \Brownlee said tacking the repeal measure onto the net metering bill would be a risky maneuver that could scuttle both measures. \Kuether said the net metering bill was a compromise between both sides and a ""hard-fought agreement"" but her instructions to the Democrats were clear in the event it is paired with another attempt to repeal the Renewable Portfolio Standards. \""If the RPS goes on it, kill it,"" Kuether said. ""Just like last time.""\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
123,"Anti-tax conservative Grover Norquist attempted to convince Kansas legislators Thursday to support a bill to weaken a state law requiring utilities to draw 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020. \Subsequent votes by the House and Senate suggest lawmakers, at this time, weren't impressed. \Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said the Legislature ought to abandon the ""costly renewable energy mandate so as to mitigate its negative impact on the economy."" \However, the Senate responded by voting 17-23 to defeat Senate Bill 82 that would have postponed the deadline for complying with the Kansas renewable portfolio standard. Instead of Kansas utilities reaching 15 percent of power from wind, solar or other alternative source in 2016, the bill would have moved the date to 2018. The measure also pushed the 20 percent mandate to 2024 from 2020. \""We're at 10 percent, and I think it's a good time to step back and take a look at this,"" said Sen. Rob Olson, an Olathe Republican opposed to the renewable energy standard. \The House answered by voting 63-59 to send House Bill 2241 back to a committee for additional deliberation. This measure would amend the state's portfolio standard to declare 15 percent must be met by 2018, but the 20 percent target would be dropped. \House Republicans and Democrats supportive of the motion said previous House committee work on the bill was flawed, while other representatives questioned the goal of rewriting the state's renewable energy standard because the amendment would remove ""regulatory certainty"" for business. \""I would suggest we exercise prudent restraint,"" said Rep. Russell Jennings, R-Lakin. ""In fairness to business, and in fairness to the people of Kansas, they need some certainty."" \Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, and chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee, which had sent the bill to the full House, said his committee ""appropriately handled it."" \Gov. Sam Brownback, who has championed development of wind energy resources in Kansas, said $3 billion was invested in the state's wind system during 2012. A federal tax break was central to moving Kansas to third place in production behind Texas and California, but the renewable portfolio standard rule sparked interest among Kansas utilities. \The RPS was adopted in 2009 as part of a compromise ending a legislative stalemate blocking issuance of a state permit necessary for construction of a coal-fired power plant in southwest Kansas. \Construction on the facility to be operated by a Kansas cooperative hasn't started, and some legislators pointed to that reality as justification for ending an portfolio standard particularly beneficial to wind development. Some lawmakers said the state should emphasize production of power from more reliable sources, such as coal and natural gas. \""Experience has shown us that renewable energy mandates, like the one on the books in Kansas, hurt consumers,"" Norquist said. ""This command and control policy forces companies to procure energy from more costly and less reliable sources with the increased costs passed on to consumers in the form of higher utility bills."" \However, an official with Westar Energy in Topeka said the state's renewable standard was good public policy that had a ""relatively small"" influence on cost of energy paid by consumers. \Kimberly Svaty, who represents the Wind Coalition's turbine manufacturers, public interest activists and wind farm developers, said the state was closing in on the 15 percent requirement. She said the program helped to generate jobs and investment in the state.\Credit: Tim Carpenter THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL"
124,"The Guardian, a United Kingdom news company, is running an editorial that lists Gov. Sam Brownback as one of eight ""champions of climate change in the U.S. in 2013"" on the company's U.S. news website. \It is a somewhat unexpected honor for a conservative Republican governor who hasn't been particularly outspoken in the political debate over whether climate change exists and whether human activity has anything to do with it. \The compiler of the list, Anne Kelly, says Brownback is among political leaders ""who fought off cynical attacks to repeal state Renewable Portfolio Standards, which have catalysed thousands of wind and solar projects across the country and generated hundreds of thousands of jobs."" \Kelly is policy director for Ceres, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization mobilizing business leadership on climate change"" who appears to have missed the fact that legislation repealing the Kansas renewable standards never made it to Brownback's desk in 2013. \The House and Senate both had bills to roll back the standards to different degrees, but both fizzled. The Senate's bill was rejected 17-23 despite being a more watered-down measure that only postponed the renewable energy deadlines rather than repealing them. The House voted 63-59 to send its bill back to the House Energy and Environment Committee, despite the support of committee Chairman Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, a contract geophysicist who has worked for oil and natural gas companies and consulted with a Koch Industries lobbyist on the legislation. \In both cases, wind energy advocates lobbied heavily to retain the renewable standards. Brownback has expressed consistent support for wind energy in the past but tried to stay out of the fray on the renewable standards, specifically. \In fact, when the Lawrence Journal-World asked Brownback recently about the repeal bill resurfacing in 2014, which is likely, he didn't discourage it, saying, ""I don't issue veto threats."" \After Eileen Hawley, the governor's spokeswoman, saw the Guardian's list Tuesday she said she wasn't sure what criteria was used to compile it, but reiterated the governor's commitment to renewable energy as an economic driver. \""Two of the governor's highest priorities are job creation and increasing income for Kansas families,"" she said. ""The renewable energy industry is making significant contributions to both of those."" \Zack Pistora, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, released a significantly longer statement congratulating Brownback on making the Guardian list but also saying his group is ""unsure how truly deserving he might be of this title."" \""Certainly we applaud our governor's continued efforts in protecting our economically successful Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) for boosting renewable energy in our state, as well as striving to enact much-needed water conservation policies,"" Pistora said. ""However, we have yet to see Brownback keep his commitment to current and future generations of Kansans by taking an outspoken leadership role in addressing climate disruption as governor."" \Pistora said a majority of Kansans believe humans are contributing to climate change. \""The governor's ongoing silence on the issue has allowed other members of his party in the state Legislature to express positions of denial, ignorance and inaction to one of the most pressing issues of our time,"" Pistora said. ""If Brownback can confront these radical positions of climate denial in the Legislature, stand by the state's policies on renewable energy and traditional family farms and ask for limits on carbon pollution from power providers, then Gov. Brownback would certainly make Kansas history as a true champion on climate change."""
125,"A Republican legislator says Koch Industries privately tried to ensure that he vote to repeal renewable energy standards and arranged for the Kansas Chamber of Commerce to pull its endorsement of him because he questioned the company's lobbying methods. \Rep. Scott Schwab, R-Olathe, said a testy confrontation with Koch Industries executives led to him losing the Kansas Chamber's support in the 2014 election despite meeting an 80 percent pro-Chamber voting record threshold in each of the past 12 years. \Schwab sent an email to supporters June 12 questioning whether the Kansas Chamber -- one of the Statehouse's most influential lobbying groups -- is representing the interests of its member businesses or being used as revenge tool by Koch Industries representatives. \""The implications of such decision making are too numerous to name here,"" Schwab wrote. ""However, the largest is the integrity of the organization. The personal interests of one are jeopardizing the goodwill of the Kansas business community."" \Confrontation? \Mike O'Neal, president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber, said via email ""the recent Chamber PAC endorsements reflect the judgment of the PAC committee as to who will be receiving a campaign contribution in the balance of the primary cycle,"" and noted Schwab received a campaign donation from the Chamber after the run-in Schwab cited with the Koch officials. \""Rep. Schwab received a campaign contribution from Chamber PAC as recently as December and he is aware of the reasons he will not receive additional funds in this current cycle,"" O'Neal wrote. ""We are sorry and disappointed that he feels he should receive more funds than he has already received."" \Schwab's campaign had almost $29,000 in cash on hand at the beginning of the year, according to the latest campaign finance filings. John H. Wilson, Schwab's Republican primary opponent, had $50. \Schwab is on his fifth House term, is chairman of the House Elections Committee and previously was chairman of the Johnson County Republican Party. He ran for Congress in 2006. \According to Schwab's email, his troubles with the state's ""Renewable Portfolio Standards"" started last year when a Koch Industries lobbyist approached him after a hearing on repealing the standards. During the hearing, Schwab had commented on the fact that only think tanks and no Kansas businesses testified in favor of repeal. \""After the meeting, Jonathan Small asked if I was supportive of the bill,"" Schwab wrote. ""I responded by asking who was pushing it, and he admitted it was Koch Industries. I told him if he wanted me to vote for the bill, then we needed some Kansas businesses to advocate it, because right now it looked as an anti-business vote. He told me at the time only Koch wanted the measure. I recommended that Koch testify then. Jon said if they did that, people would not like them. My response was that people don't like them anyway, so just be honest."" \A call to Schwab went unanswered, and a message was left at Small's office Monday morning. \Koch Industries' activities \Koch Industries hasn't publicly testified on the bills to repeal the renewable standards that have appeared in the past two years. \But last year Small, the company's Statehouse lobbyist, had private conversations about it with Rep. Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, the chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee. \Koch Industries also is active in the American Legislative Exchange Council, and Schwab wrote that his clash with the company came to a head last year at an ALEC conference in Topeka. \According to Schwab, Mike Morgan, Koch's director of public and government affairs, and Mark Nichols, the company's vice president of the same division, confronted him at the conference about the renewable energy hearings. \Schwab wrote that Nichols ""took his business card, shoved it into my ribs on the left side and said from now on, if I wanted to talk to Jon Small, I needed to call him first for permission"" and Morgan ""aggressively let me know how horrible I was for not voting for the RPS bill (which I did vote for)."" \Schwab said he told Morgan that he needed some Kansas businesses to publicly say they wanted the renewable standards repealed, but Morgan wasn't mollified. \""He then said that I would vote to keep hookers working in Kansas if it meant no businesses ask for it,"" Schwab wrote. ""To which I said, 'Are you equating yourself to hookers?' Needless to say, Mike's tone spiraled."" \An email seeking comment from Morgan and Nichols was sent Monday to Koch Industries' director of corporate communications. \Aftermath \Schwab wrote that he believes the conversation with Nichols and Morgan lost him the Kansas Chamber's endorsement. He said he has gotten no explanation from the chamber's lobbyist and legislative liaison, except that his ""attitude is not right."" \O'Neal, in his email, didn't state why Schwab lost the endorsement, but said it wasn't because of the conversation with Nichols and Morgan. \""Given the support he received in December, his reference to an admittedly non-Chamber related matter that supposedly occurred last year is without merit,"" O'Neal wrote. \Rep. Tom Moxley, R-Council Grove, who serves with Schwab on the energy committee, called Schwab an ""independent thinker"" and said Schwab's independence appears to have ""been his downfall"" in this case. \Moxley, who has voted against repealing the renewable standards, said he read Schwab's email and found it insightful. \""It just lifts the covers off the Wizard of Oz so we know the Koch family is pulling the strings in the Kansas Chamber,"" Moxley said.\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
126,"Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, joined with a rabbi and a farmer from her district Friday to urge action on climate change and blast the American Legislative Exchange Council for attempting to roll back renewal energy standards. \Friday's news conference at the Statehouse coincided with national meetings of ALEC, a group that brings together state legislators and corporate lobbyists who write ""model bills"" that are then introduced in Statehouses across the country. \""ALEC denies, despite all the overwhelming scientific evidence, that climate change even exists and the legislative proposals it backs attempt to overturn good policies that are already on the books,"" said Moti Rieber, a rabbi and state director of Interfaith Power & Light, a group of religious leaders concerned about environmental issues. \Bill Meierling, a spokesman for ALEC, said the organization ""maintains no model policy on climate change."" \""We do have policies that support free market policies and market-based environmentalism, but nothing that pertains specifically to climate change,"" Meierling said via email. \Meierling said those policies are listed at www.alec.org. \House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, and Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, have served in leadership roles within ALEC, whose legislative membership is nearly all Republican. \Rieber said model legislation from the group was used to try to scuttle renewable portfolio standards passed in Kansas in 2009 that require utility companies to derive a certain percentage of their energy from renewable sources. \Most utilities say they have hit the standards with little trouble thus far, due to a boom in wind energy. \A plan to repeal those standards fizzled last year, despite arguments from some legislators who said they increase energy costs and distort the free market. Rieber said another repeal effort is expected in the 2014 session. \Francisco said she asked utility companies during last year's hearings what was driving energy bill increases and the answer was, to a large degree, construction of new scrubbers to reduce emissions from coal and other fossil fuels. \""The KCC (Kansas Corporation Commission) said that less than 2 percent of any utility increases were due to the RPS (renewable portfolio standards) and legislators know that,"" Rieber said. \Rieber also said economic development advocates in western Kansas have hailed the renewable standards as helpful to rural wind energy projects. \Wayne White, a Jefferson County farmer and author with a doctorate degree in sociology from Kansas State University, said he was glad to see Francisco and others begin to stand up to groups like ALEC, who he said ""don't use real science"" in Statehouse lobbying. \""It doesn't seem like the other side, the side of science, gets a fair hearing,"" White said. \White recommended the book ""Merchants of Doubt"" to learn more about the legislative debate over climate change, which he said has already caused polar ice melt that has changed the jet streams and, in turn, Kansas weather patterns. \""There is no scientific controversy about the reality of climate change,"" White said. \Francisco said legislators lately have been fed information on climate change that is agenda-based, rather than scientific. \Meanwhile, she said, climate change threatens Kansas' already tenuous water supply and other agricultural resources. \""We are still facing many challenges, not only in addressing all of these concerns, but also in getting accurate research and understanding,"" Francisco said. \Rep. Ed Trimmer, D-Winfield, couldn't attend Friday's new conference, but added written remarks. \""Scientists have settled the question of climate change,"" Trimmer said. ""We need policies that promote clean Kansas energy and protect the health of Kansans and their environment. The last thing we need is climate deniers from ALEC doing permanent damage to our state.""\Credit: Andy Marso andy.marso@cjonline.com"
127,"ENERGY \Kansas on right track \The Environmental Protection Agency has released a proposal that will place limits on carbon dioxide emissions for existing power plants. Fortunately for Kansans, our wind power expertise means we're well prepared for a new, low-carbon future. \Kansas wind power avoided more than 4.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2013, more than 10 percent of the whole power sector's carbon output. In doing so, Kansas wind offset the CO2 equivalent of taking 700,000 cars off the road. We already obtain nearly 20 percent of our electricity from wind, third best in the nation. \By supporting such smart policies as the renewable portfolio standard (RPS), we can keep this amazing trend growing. \Thousands of Kansans work in wind power, driving an engine of economic development that has attracted more than $7 billion in capital investment. The result is a robust industry that provides farmers with supplemental income, revitalizes rural communities and gives Kansans a homegrown energy source to be proud of. \Wind power is an affordable, reliable way to keep the lights on for more than 870,000 average homes and counting.

They and the teachers unions have run a smear campaign telling a slanted half-truth version of the teacher tenure and due process hearing changes recently enacted. \While state-mandated hearings were ended and teacher tenure rescinded at the state level, the education bill did what the people of Kansas have been asking for all along -- return vital education issues to the local level. \The following statement by Rep. Kasha Kelley, R-Arkansas City, chairwoman for the House Education Committee, as it appeared June 2 in the Wichita Eagle explains the true nature of the bill regarding those two issues. \""Tenure in the state of Kansas, due process in the state of Kansas, is now a local-level decision,"" Kelley said. She said some school boards will choose to keep the hearings, while others might lose them. ""But whatever they adopt is now between the school board and the local voters.

Board of Education ruling, our minority people in Shawnee County and Kansas still live in separate, unequal and disparate conditions in terms of quality of life and health care. According to the health experts referenced in a recent story in The Topeka Capital-Journal, the death rates for Shawnee County's black residents are about twice as high for strokes, 41 percent higher for cancer and 40 percent higher for heart disease. \Scant health data was given for Hispanic people and none for American Indian residents in Shawnee County. Apparently the American Indian population was too small to record. But if the health data was researched, it would show similar health conditions in our American Indian people. Data for the entire state indicates American Indians have the highest age-adjusted death rates of any racial or ethnic group (2011 Kansas Annual Summary of Vital Statistics, KDHE). Diabetes in particular takes a significant toll on our Indian people, with a death rate more than twice that of white non-Hispanics in Kansas. Cancers, chronic lower respiratory diseases, strokes, kidney disease, accidents, and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis were all higher for Native Americans in 2011. \As stated by a spokesperson for the Kansas Health Institute, disparate socioeconomic factors resulting in poverty and discrimination contributed to the cumulative mortality differences in African-Americans. Discrimination was cited by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Brown v.

128,"
Topeka ? Kansas lawmakers will get down to work this week dissecting the budget that Gov. Sam Brownback proposed on Friday, and many key legislators and interest groups have started chiming in.
\
Brownback's plan calls for a combination of spending cuts, fund transfers and tax increases to close a projected $714 million revenue shortfall for the next 18 months. It also calls for repealing the school finance formula and funding schools with direct block grants while calling on lawmakers to come up with a new formula.
\
The school finance plan is likely to draw the most attention, if only because K-12 education consumes roughly half of the state's entire general fund budget.
\
Brownback will likely have the support of most Republicans, who now dominate both chambers of the Legislature. During Brownback's State of the State address Thursday night, Republicans rose to their feet in applause while Democrats sat silently when the governor said, ""It is time for a new school finance formula.""
\
But how long it will take lawmakers to come up with a new formula remains a key question.
\
""With over 50 percent of our state budget dedicated to funding education, the time has long passed for reevaluating how those dollars are spent,"" House Majority Leader Jene Vickrey, R-Louisburg, said in a statement following the address. ""House Republicans will offer a student-centered, classroom-focused funding formula that will spend more dollars on educating students. K-12 funding must be transparent, accountable, and meet the needs of the students, not special interests.""
\
State Goverment
\

\
But the task will be more complicated than simply passing a bill through the Legislature because the state is still mired in an ongoing lawsuit over how much money the state puts into the formula.
\
""The court system has found over and over that the formula is not broken. It's just under-funded,"" said John Robb, lead attorney for the plaintiffs in that suit.
\
In December, a three-judge panel ruled that the current level of funding is unconstitutionally low, and suggested that as much as $548 million a year in additional money might be needed before funding can be considered adequate.
\
That decision is almost certain to be appealed. Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, whose office represents the state in that case, has until Jan. 29 to appeal that decision to the state Supreme Court.
\
The House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to get a briefing on the governor's school finance plan Thursday. The Senate Ways and Means Committee hasn't yet scheduled a hearing on school finance, but is expected to start looking at the governor's overall budget plan that same day.
\
At least one portion of Brownback's tax plan is already drawing support from public health groups. The budget calls for a 189-percent increase in the state cigarette tax, raising that to $2.29 per pack, from the current 79 cents a pack.
\
A coalition of health groups, including the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society and the Kansas University Cancer Center, issued a statement of support Friday.
\
""Increasing the price of tobacco products is one of the most effective steps Kansas can take to reduce the deadly toll of tobacco on our citizens,"" said Tracy Russell, tobacco prevention manager at the American Heart Association. ""This measure will prevent thousands of Kansas children from a lifetime of addiction and will help current users quit.""
\
Other issues
\
On Tuesday, the House Utilities Committee will hear a briefing on the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Program, a set of new regulations scheduled to be finalized July 1 that would require states to adopt plans to reduce carbon emissions from power plants 30 percent by 2030.
\
That could set the stage for future debates over the state's own Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS, which many conservatives want to repeal. That requires electric utilities in Kansas to produce at least 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020.
\
On Wednesday and Thursday, the Senate Public Health and Welfare committee will hear testimony on a bill to legalize medical marijuana.
\
Sen. David Haley, D-Kansas City, has introduced a bill called the Cannabis Compassion and Care Act that would allow the legal use of marijuana for certain debilitating medical conditions including cancer, glaucoma, HIV, hepatitis C, Lou Gehrig's disease and Alzheimer's.
\
Also on Wednesday, the House Vision 2020 Committee, chaired by Rep. Tom Sloan, R-Lawrence, will continue its hearings into the possible expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
\
Scheduled to appear that day are Susan Mosier, acting Secretary of the Department of Health and Environment, and Jon Stewart, CEO of Heartland Community Health Center in Lawrence.

When State Rep. Scott Schwab, R-Olathe, failed last week to obtain the usual re-election endorsement from the Kansas Chamber of Commerce political action committee, he was ""shocked.""
\
Schwab said his position on the proposed repeal or easing of renewable energy portfolio standards and a dustup with lobbyists for Koch Industries Inc. cost him the Chamber PAC's support. Schwab, originally from Great Bend and now living in Johnson County, vented in an email that lifted a veil on lobbying in Topeka.
\
Schwab serves on the Kansas House Committee on Energy and Environment. That panel considered a bill in 2013 to weaken the renewable energy mandate for utility companies. Areas with wind farms or wind energy jobs testified against the bill, including the Hutchinson/Reno County Chamber of Commerce, Kingman County Commission, and the Dodge City/Ford County Development Corporation.
\
In his email addressed ""Dear Kansas Chamber of Commerce Friends,"" Schwab described how he was told by lobbyist Jonathan Small, whose firm represents many clients including Koch, according to lobbying reports, that Koch was pushing the anti-renewable energy bill.
\
The hearing drew far more opponents to the bill than proponents. The Kansas Policy Institute, a think tank promoting the free market views of Koch, was one of a couple think tanks, along with former Republican state legislator Charlotte O'Hara, testifying for the bill.
\
Schwab said he told Small ""if he wanted me to vote for the bill, then we needed some Kansas businesses to advocate it, because right now it looked as an anti-business vote. He (Small) told me at the time only Koch wanted the measure. I recommended that Koch testify then. Jon (Small) said if they did that, people would not like them. My response was that people don't like them anyway, so just be honest.""
\
Schwab said he supported the Koch-favored bill, agreeing to send it from the committee to the House floor, and opposing a move to bounce it back to the committee.
\
However, when Schwab later encountered Koch lobbyists Mike Morgan and Mark Nichols at an American Legislative Exchange Council gathering in Topeka, they apparently thought Schwab had not been supportive of the Koch bill.
\
""Mark took his business card, shoved it into my ribs on the left side and said from now on, if I wanted to talk to Jon Small, I needed to call him first for permission. Mike than aggressively let me know how horrible I was for not voting for the RPS (renewable portfolio standards) bill (which I did vote for). I informed him it is hard to vote for a bill where Kansas businesses don't want it passed, and only think tanks do. I needed the Kansas business community to say they really wanted this.
\
""He then said that I would vote to keep hookers working in Kansas if it meant no businesses ask for it. To which I said, 'Are you equating your self to hookers?'
\
""Needless to say, Mike's tone spiraled. He made mention of the number of companies Koch Industries owned. I let him know I was looking forward to hearing from them in committee. Jon Small and his wife then stepped in to prevent Mike's aggression from escalating further.
\
""As I left, I said, 'If this is how I am treated when I voted for the bill, well, you will get your money's worth.' I have not voted for the bill since.""
\
Schwab further wrote in his email that denial of the Chamber PAC's endorsement after his 12 years of ""voting pro-business,"" is because of that personal conversation among Koch lobbyists and himself.
\
Schwab and the three lobbyists mentioned in his email - Small, Morgan and Nichols - did not respond to The News.
\
Kansas Chamber of Commerce President Mike O'Neal said the Chamber PAC gave Schwab's campaign a donation of $250 as recently as December 2013 - which would have been after the incident with the lobbyists.
\
""We are sorry and disappointed that he feels he should receive more funds than he has already received,"" O'Neal wrote in an email response to The News. O'Neal said Schwab is aware of the reasons he did not get the Chamber PAC's endorsement.
\
Schwab has won re-election comfortably in previous years. This year, he faces John Wilson, a Libertarian-turned-Republican, in the Aug. 5 GOP primary. Darnell Hunt is running in the Democratic primary.
\
Twice in 2014, the Kansas House voted on renewable energy and both times, Schwab voted with the pro-wind forces. Wilson said he would have voted differently. He would have voted to repeal the renewable energy mandate.
\
Wilson did not get the Chamber PAC's endorsement, either, although he said that might be because Schwab is a longtime veteran of the Legislature and Wilson said he is a ""neophyte at this."" Wilson, who moved to Kansas from California in 2008, said he is walking the House District and finding people unaware of who Schwab is, or, if they know him, they are less than satisfied, he said.
\
PAC endorsements
\
In March and again in May, the Kansas House rejected efforts to undo the renewable energy mandate, with the vote in May closer than the vote in March.
\
In western Kansas, the Chamber PAC endorsed a Republican primary candidate, Stan Rice, Lakin, who is challenging prominent renewable energy advocate Rep. J. Russell Jennings, R-Lakin. There are at least four other similar House races in Kansas: A Republican challenging a pro-wind energy Republican incumbent is the Chamber PAC's pick.
\
The Chamber PAC is backing some Republican incumbents in the region who voted for renewable energy in March but changed their vote in May. Generally, kawmakers who were consistently for renewable energy did not get the Chamber PAC's endorsement.
\
A couple of exceptions to that statewide trend are Reps. Joe Seiwert, R-Pretty Prairie, and Steven Johnson, R-Assaria.
\
The News asked the Kansas Chamber's O'Neal why Seiwert and Johnson, who cast pro-wind energy ballots, still obtained the Chamber PAC's endorsement. He said ""their endorsements, like others on the list, were well deserved.""
\
Seiwert has said he considered O'Neal, former Speaker of the House and formerly of Hutchinson, his mentor. Passage of the education funding bill was another key issue for the Chamber, and Johnson helped get that bill passed.
\
Jennings said before the Legislature voted on bills important to the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, legislators received an email reminder about the importance of their vote and that the Chamber would be watching.
\
The Chamber PAC's endorsement brings money not only from that PAC, but from other groups or businesses that follow the Chamber's lead, Jennings said.
\
Schwab wrote in his email that if people knew about the decision-making process behind how Chamber PAC dollars are allocated, they might not contribute.

What to know about the 2014 legislative session
\
Brush up on what you need to know about the upcoming session and what's happening with Kansas lawmakers this year.
\
* Who's tweeting under the Dome #ksleg
\
* Lawrence legislators sum up priorities for the upcoming legislative session
\
* Issues that will dominate the 2014 legislative session
\
* Funding of higher education, bioscience raising serious concerns
\
* Local officials begging Legislature to do no harm
\
Topeka ? Here are issues that will be debated during the session:
\
School finance
\
Depending on what the Kansas Supreme Court does with a pending school finance lawsuit, this could become the nuclear issue of the session.
\
In recent years, Gov. Sam Brownback and the Republican-dominated Legislature have failed to abide by a court-ordered funding schedule, and instead have cut taxes drastically.
\
A lower court panel told the state it can't renege on its constitutional obligation to fund schools and ordered the Legislature to increase funding up to $500 million per year.
\
That decision is pending before the Supreme Court.
\
Court fixing
\
Brownback and other conservative Republicans want to fix what they say is a flaw in the court system, while his opponents say Brownback wants to fix the system to his political liking.
\
The Kansas Supreme Court is appointed by the governor from a list of potential nominees supplied by a commission that vets applicants.
\
Conservatives have complained this system has produced a liberal-leaning court, and gives lawyers on the nominating commission more power than elected officials in selecting justices. Conservatives want a system where the governor selects a nominee and that nominee faces a confirmation vote before the state Senate.
\
During the last legislative session, Brownback helped push through this change for vacancies on the Kansas Court of Appeals. In the first vacancy under the new system, Brownback nominated his chief counsel, Caleb Stegall, to the bench.
\
But changing the way the Kansas Supreme Court is selected would require a change in the Kansas Constitution, which requires two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate and a vote of the people. Last year, the proposal received two-thirds approval in the Senate, but stalled in the House.
\
State Rep. Lance Kinzer, R-Olathe, and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has vowed to continue trying to get the measure adopted in the House. Meanwhile, the Kansas Bar Association supports the current system.
\
If Kinzer falls short, there have been proposals to speed turnover on the court by lowering the mandatory retirement age for justices.
\
Medicaid expansion
\
Half the states nationwide are taking advantage of a part of the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid at federal expense to provide health care coverage to millions of low-income people.
\
But Kansas, like many others dominated by the Republican Party, isn't. Anything associated with the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, has been vigorously opposed by Brownback and Republican legislators who say they don't trust the federal government to provide the funding.
\
But advocates for the poor, and the Kansas Hospital Association, say Kansas is passing up an opportunity to save lives, help hospitals and the state economy through the federal infusion of health care dollars.
\
The KHA has hired Mike Leavitt, who served as Health and Human Services secretary under President George W. Bush, to plead its case to legislators and Brownback.
\
State Rep. Jim Ward, the ranking Democrat on the House Health and Human Services Committee, said he will introduce a Medicaid expansion bill this week that he hoped would prompt hearings and a debate on the issue.
\
Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, said she is willing to explore ways Kansas could tailor a Medicaid expansion to its needs, but said the roll out of the ACA has been troubled and this upcoming session may be the wrong time to expand.
\
On another health-related front, hospitals are complaining of long delays in getting reimbursed under KanCare -- Brownback's privatization of Medicaid. But the Brownback administration said KanCare would deliver better health care and save money in the long run.
\
Wagle said the Legislature would consider a bill that would require prompt payment of reimbursements to hospitals.
\
Safety net
\
The number of Kansans receiving cash assistance through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families has dropped by a third in recent years.
\
Brownback says that shows the economy is rebounding, but advocates for the poor say it shows that the Brownback administration has put up more hurdles to getting help.
\
According to a recent report, for every 100 poor families nationally, 25.9 percent receive TANF benefits, while in Kansas that rate is 16.5 percent, a decrease from 21.3 percent in 2008.
\
State Rep. John Wilson, D-Lawrence, said he wilould push for hearings so that legislators can see whether the TANF program is being run appropriately.
\
Voter registration
\
Kansas' proof of citizenship rule to register to vote has put nearly 20,000 potential voters in limbo, launched lawsuits and placed the state and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who pushed for the requirement, at the center of voting rights disputes.
\
Because the state voter registration requirement and the federal voter registration requirement don't match up on proof of citizenship, there is the possibility that Kansas could have a two-tiered voting system, where some voters could vote in all contests, while others could vote only in federal congressional and presidential contests.
\
Brownback has said he doesn't want that to happen but he has tried to distance himself from the issue, saying that Kobach is the one driving it.
\
State Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau and state Rep. Jim Ward, D-Wichita, introduced the Protection Against Voter Suppression Act, during a special legislative session last year, but Republican leaders rebuffed it, saying they wanted to keep the focus of the session on a prison sentencing bill.
\
The two Democrats say they will try again during the regular session. Under the bill, people could register to vote if they swear they are U.S. citizens. If it turns out they're not, they could face a felony perjury charge.
\
But state Rep. Scott Schwab, R-Olathe, and chairman of the House Elections Committee, said he would like to wait to see how a federal lawsuit on voter registration issues is resolved before considering a state bill.
\
Energy
\
Conservative legislators, many of them affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange Council, which opposes mandated goals for renewable energy, are planning to try to repeal the Kansas Renewable Portfolio Standard.
\
Both Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, and House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell, have spoken against the RPS. ""We should allow energy open to the free market so we can purchase the least expensive energy available,"" Wagle said.
\
House Energy and Environment Committee Chairman Dennis Hedke, R-Wichita, said he would pursue repeal legislation this session.
\
Brownback, a supporter of wind energy, has declined to say what he would do if a repeal bill landed on his desk.
\
Immigration
\
Opponents of allowing undocumented immigrants who have attended Kansas high schools to receive in-state tuition rates are vowing to try to repeal the 2004 law. Previous repeal attempts have fallen short.
\
Abortion
\
Brownback has signed into law a bevy of changes in the state's abortion laws, many of which are being challenged in court. Some legislators have said they want to go further in restricting abortion, including a bill prohibiting abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detectable.
\
Last year, abortion opponents, led by state Rep. Pete DeGraaf, R-Mulvane, got a hearing on the fetal heartbeat bill, but it ran into opposition from some anti-abortion legislators who said the measure would have been on shaky legal ground in the courts. The proposal, which advocates said would eliminate 85 percent of legal abortions in Kansas, is expected to be debated again this year.
\
Pensions
\
Some conservatives want to convert Kansas' public retirement system into a 401(k)-type plan for new teachers and government workers. But other legislators say they want to see if recent changes to the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System will improve the system's finances.

"
131,"BERLIN -- On a recent Monday morning, Jan Peter Klatt sat in his office in Germany's Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy and strained to hear a recording of an interview with Kansas Sen. Forrest Knox, R-Altoona. \Knox was making one last unsuccessful pitch to repeal Kansas' renewable energy standards by citing Germany, where he said the transition from fossil fuels to renewables was ""de-industrializing"" the nation. \""It isn't,"" Klatt says. ""And especially it wouldn't be de-industrializing for the States (now). We have to differentiate between the past and the future."" \The future German leaders imagine is one in which their innovations in solar and wind energy enable them to produce enough domestic electricity to power their nation cheaply and reliably regardless of international instability in a power-hungry world. \Klatt, an expert on the renewable transition's economic impact, said those innovations are arriving, but Germans have shouldered a ""high financial burden"" in pioneering them. \Germany entered into long-term agreements to subsidize investments in renewable energy and the cost has ballooned as more providers have taken advantage. Leaders envision costs decreasing as the agreements run out and the renewable energy infrastructure remains, but it will be awhile. \While industry has been largely protected from the cost increases and isn't leaving the country in droves, Knox is correct in that energy-intensive manufacturers are worried about the reliability of the new energy grid and what will happen to their bottom line if they lose renewable surcharge exemptions and are forced to pay full freight for electricity. \For years environmentalists in the U.S. have pointed to European nations like Germany as models for the move to a post-fossil fuels industrialized world. But the consequences of Germany's aggressive push for a renewable revolution -- the Energiewende -- have some lawmakers abroad like Knox casting the country in unfamiliar territory: as an example of what not to do. \Klatt works for an energy division recently merged with economic affairs under a Parliament that, at the end of June, made changes to the Energiewende aimed at reducing costs. \While those could be seen as tacit admissions that Germany went too far, too fast in pursuit of renewable energy, Klatt and others say the short-term investments will pay off big in the long run and the Energiewende's labor pains paved the way technologically for states like Kansas, with its goal of gleaning 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. \Germany has already reached 20 percent, and plans to go much further. But the path has caused pause for some even within this more green-minded nation. \Residents bear cost burden \One wall of the office of German legislator Oliver Krischer is adorned with a collage of pictures of his family camping, fishing and bicycling. Another wall is covered by a bookshelf with titles like ""Global Energy 2008-2009"" and ""Clean CO2: Large Scale Enhanced Gas Recovery."" \Krischer is a spokesman for the German Green Party on energy economics. While the Greens remain a fringe political party in the U.S., in Germany's multi-party system they have grown into a force -- albeit a minority one. \Krischer, one of 63 Greens in Germany's 631-person legislative branch, the Bundestag, explained recently how Germans found the political will to embrace a renewable energy goal so audacious as to make Kansas' seem puny: to glean 80 percent of their energy from renewables by 2050. \""Germany pays 90 billion Euros ($121 billion) a year for imports for oil and gas and coal and we want not to pay the money to Mr. (Vladimir) Putin or to the kings of Saudi Arabia,"" Krischer said. ""We want that this money remains in Germany and Europe for our working people, for our companies and for our people who want to invest in renewables -- windmills, solar panels and so on -- in their area."" \To make it happen, Germany approved in 2000 a very different plan than Kansas, which simply mandated its utility companies reach the 20 percent mark by 2020. \The Germans established a ""feed-in tariff,"" added to the cost of most electricity bills, that paid companies a premium for every kilowatt of renewable energy -- mostly wind and solar, but also biomass, hydropower and geothermal -- they fed into the grid. \Germany soared from 6 percent renewable energy in 2000 to 20 percent renewable energy by 2011 and about 25 percent this year. \Krischer called the tariff ""the most important driver"" of the quick change. \""It gave the people who invested in windmills, solar power plants, biogas and so on, security, because they got a fixed amount of money over 20 years so they were able to plan and do the investments, but at the moment the feed-in tariffs have went down very, very strongly,"" Krischer said. \The tariffs dropped precipitously recently, but because of the 20-year contracts locked in at previous rates, the amounts German consumers pay continues to rise. \Krischer's party opposed a move earlier this summer by a coalition led by the ruling Christian Democratic Union to fundamentally change how the tariffs are awarded. \Since 2000, the feed-in tariffs were based on the amount of the investment in renewable production, not the market price of the energy produced. Joachim Pfeiffer, a Christian Democratic Union Bundestag member, said that distorted the market. \""Due to the 20 years state-guaranteed feed-in remuneration, the EEG did not stimulate incentives for innovations,"" Pfeiffer said via email. ""Therefore the innovation ratio in the renewable energy segment unfortunately is low -- particularly harmful for a young technology industry."" \It also created a financial burden in renewable surcharges, Pfeiffer said, that averaged almost 300 Euros ($402) per German when split among the country's 82 million residents. \""The system went beyond the scope of the costs,"" Pfeiffer said. ""The consumers -- both industry and private households -- were burdened with 24 billion Euros ($32 billion) in 2013 for the EEG apportionment. A development I would have liked to prevent."" \In Kansas, there were no special price mechanisms, just a renewable energy mandate placed on the utility companies, to be either absorbed by those companies or passed on to ratepayers. Utility rates are regulated by the Kansas Corporation Commission, which is required to annually report the cost of the Renewable Portfolio Standards. KCC reports that less than 2 percent of the wholesale electricity rate in the state is due to RPS. \Germans see the cost of Energiewende each time they receive their itemized utility bills, and appetite for reform grew as the renewable surcharge approached the equivalent of about 8.5 cents U.S. per kilowatt hour last year. \The recently passed reforms will lower the feed-in tariffs on new renewable investments and create an ""auction"" system in which companies will bid on tariffs, therefore tying renewable expansion to market prices to some degree. \But because of the 20-year guarantees, Germans might not see their energy bills go down any time soon. \Felix Matthes, research coordinator for Energy and Climate Policy at the Oko Institute in Berlin, said he believes the Energiewende will eventually pay off for residential consumers with lower overall prices, but the original tariffs stayed in place too long. \""I think the government has reacted too late,"" Matthes said. ""I think they should have done this two years ago."" \Krischer says the original tariffs have already produced an environment in which it is now cheaper to provide solar and wind energy domestically than importing oil and coal. The costs now, Krischer says, are tied to the innovations that brought the renewable technology to that point. \""What people in Germany have to pay now are the costs of the past,"" Krischer said. \There is also a bit of context that he and other fans of Energiewende like to point to: even with the tariffs, the average German family still pays a lower percentage of its income on electricity than the average American family. \But that is largely because German families use far less electricity than their American counterparts. \Reducing use is less of an option for some of Germany's most energy-intensive manufacturers. \Industry wary of renewable shift \At an ArcelorMittal factory in the harbor of Hamburg, a pile of scrap metal arrives on a conveyor belt and is dumped into a 3,000-degree (F) electric arc furnace, creating a light show of sparks and a deafening roar. \Plant manager Marc Holling says the arc furnace is one of the first steps on the scrap metal's journey to become reusable metal rods, a process that at his plant uses 830 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year, or about as much as a German city of 150,000 people. \Holling, a chemical engineer, says that if there were an easy way to produce the same number of rods with less electricity, he would do it. Energy costs, after all, make up about 21 percent of the plant's costs. \""Twenty percent of your production costs you cannot influence, you're depending on your local market,"" Holling said. ""So this is a tough situation."" \Hamburg's steel plant is a ""mini-mill"" by the standards of ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer. The 1 million tons of steel rods it produces each year represent about 1 percent of the company's global total. \Holling's location is one of more than 2,000 heavy energy users in Germany who gained a partial exemption from the renewable surcharges by arguing that having to pay it would cripple their operations. \The cost of the exemptions, about 5 billion Euro ($6.7 billion) last year, is passed on to the rest of the ratepayers and that has been controversial. \""Certainly we have a discussion between citizens, between people and industry, because the people say that's not OK that industry doesn't pay, that we have to pay much more,"" Krischer said. ""That's always a discussion."" \Holling says for his plant, the math is simple: it made about 18 million Euro ($24 million) in gross revenue last year -- before deduction of interest, tax and amortization. If its surcharge exemption was removed, Holling says, the plant would pay an additional 50 million Euro ($67 million) for electricity. \""We would be gone,"" Holling said. ""Basically, that's it."" \With the plant would go the 570 jobs ArcelorMittal provides in Hamburg right now, probably, Holling says, to a country with looser environmental and labor laws. \Holling's plant retained most of its exemption through the recent reforms, but saw its renewable fee raised from about 415,000 Euro ($557,000) to 860,000 Euro ($1.15 million). \Cost isn't Holling's only concern with the transition to renewable energy. \His production operation relies on a steady, strong stream of electricity and he and others in industrial manufacturing worry that won't remain in place in an electric grid increasingly reliant on strong winds and sunny skies. \Holling acknowledged that there have been no blackouts yet, but ""in 2012, it was rather close."" \""It was in February, it was very, very cold and therefore for two or three days I think everything that could produce electricity was in operation,"" Holling said. ""So this was a critical situation."" \Holling's company isn't alone in its concerns about energy prices or the grid. \Peter Willbrandt, CEO of Hamburg-based copper producer Aurubis said via email that even with its exemption, energy costs are higher in Germany than most places and the fluctuating energy supply is concerning. \""For years now Aurubis has increasingly been taking measures -- investments of double-digit millions -- in order to prevent irreversible damage in the event of potential blackouts or brownouts: risks amounting to tens of millions of euros,"" Willbrandt said.""Since any lengthy power outages will, for instance, lead to the copper and the sulfuric acid freezing."" \The German newspaper Der Speigel reported in August 2012 that Hamburg manufacturer Hydro Aluminum had invested 150,000 Euros ($201,000) in backup batteries to hedge against power loss and Holling said ArcelorMittal has also invested in backup generators to allow it to power down its plant safely. \Pfeiffer, the CDU parliamentarian, said the number of interventions like ""speed regulation"" and ""re-dispatch"" that German utilities have had to undertake to prevent blackouts have grown tremendously in recent years. \""The existing grids are not yet qualified for the uncontrolled feeding of generated renewable energy endangering the grid stability and more frequently leading to the verge of a grid collapse,"" Pfeiffer said. \Germany is also intent on phasing out nuclear power, so that is becoming less of an option as a backup source when wind and solar power isn't steady. Holling said the intent was to replace that with natural gas backups, but those plants aren't needed enough to be profitable. \""I would like to have these gas-fired power plant, but they are losing money like hell,"" Holling said. \Germans, therefore, find themselves subsidizing not only the renewable energy, but also paying to ensure their utility companies can reroute power quickly to avoid blackouts. \The grid concerns seem to have cropped up shortly after Germany passed 20 percent of electricity from renewables in 2011. \Klatt provided a report from the International Energy Agency on integrating renewables into the grid. The report, ""The Power of Transformation: Wind, Sun and the Economics of Flexible Power Systems"" stated that it is ""not a significant challenge"" to integrate up to 10 percent renewables into modern grids, and that while challenges increase above that level, adherence to a few basic principles of power distribution can compensate and even ""shares of 25% to 40% can be achieved from a technical perspective, assuming current levels of system flexibility."" \No Kansas manufacturers have testified about grid instability as the state has crept toward 15 percent renewables on its path to 20 percent. \Don Ford, renewable business solutions director for Westar Energy, said his company has had no complaints about grid reliability and he is confident it will be able to maintain that record as the state marches toward the 20 percent by 2020 goal. \""One of the things utilities have continually done is we tend to meet challenges head-on and somehow, some way figure out how to supply our customers,"" Ford said. \But Ford's confidence comes with a caveat: it takes investments to meet those challenges. \""The responses that have to be done cost money, and somebody does have to pay the bill,"" Ford said. \It is the same in Germany, where Tobias Knahl, the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce's expert on energy matters, said managing and updating the grid to ensure a steady energy supply will be important to industry going forward. \""I don't think we have any serious problems right now, but on the other hand, the energy system is getting more complicated,"" Knahl said. \According to Krischer, ""There are no indications that industry in an important amount is leaving Germany."" Electricity costs are just one factor in a business' decision about where to locate, with workforce readiness, infrastructure soundness and tax structure also playing strong roles. \But Holling said the energy policies are a factor in expansion decisions pointing to Austrian iron manufacturer Voestalpine's decision to build a new 550 million Euro ($739 million) plant in Corpus Christi, Texas. \Holling said that in 10 years maybe Germans will be able to say ""look at our cheap renewables,"" but at present the country's electricity bills are high and the continued push for renewables is less a practical plan and more about Germany being a ""showcase"" for a post-fossil fuel world. \""In Germany, Energiewende is kind of a religion,"" Holling said. ""People are very, very emotional about it and it's hard to make a proper discussion about it."" \The next generation of \renewables \In a white-walled office building next to an ancient church in central Stockholm, Swedish Bioenergy Association president Gustav Melin holds up a jar full of ground olive pits to show a visitor. \Yes, Melin confirms, olive pits are one of many organic substances that can be burned to make energy. \Melin, seated behind his desk in a spare office earlier in the day, said Germany went about its energy transition incorrectly, distorting the market to such a degree that they're paying for renewable energy that, at peak production times, is more than the country can use. \""Germany pays 10 times more for renewable energy than we do in Sweden,"" Melin said, speaking specifically of the tariffs. \Sweden gives its electricity providers renewable energy certificates that change in value depending on how much renewable energy is on the market. \Melin's country gets almost 60 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, one of the highest percentages in the industrialized world. \The Swedes benefit greatly from hydroelectric power -- a constant, controllable stream of renewable energy. But they have also harnessed the power of bioenergy burned from organic material that now accounts for about 9 percent of the country's electrical supply. \Sweden's biomass electricity comes mainly from wood byproducts and goes mainly to power the forestry industry. The goal is a sustainable loop of trees grown for paper pulp made in factories fueled by the leftover wood. \When told Kansas doesn't have much in the way of forests, Melin ticked off a number of other substances currently being burned for electricity, including sunflower husks. When told Kansas is known as the ""Sunflower State,"" Melin smiled. \""In Ukraine I've been negotiating contracts with factories that produce sunflower oil,"" Melin said. ""I was not interested in the sunflower oil but in the pellets that they produce from the husks. Some years ago they wasted all the husks. Now they use the husks for their own energy production in the factory."" \While wind has driven much of Kansas' push for 20 percent renewable electricity thus far, biomass is entering the mix as well. \Abengoa Bioenergia, a Spanish company, began construction of a plant near Hugoton in 2011 and it expects to be online soon, creating 22 megawatts of biomass electricity from a ""mixture of agricultural waste, non-feed energy crops and wood waste,"" according to the company's website. \Kansans will benefit from biomass innovations in Sweden, just as they benefit from wind and solar competition in Germany. \In a Berlin cafe a few hundred meters from the Brandenburg Gate, Matthes, the Oko Institute researcher, recently showed a foreigner how a smartphone app allows him to choose from among 120 electricity providers in the city. He scrolled through dozens of options, able to compare prices and energy mixes and even switch providers at the tap of a touchscreen. \Germany liberalized its electricity sector in 1998 and the Energiewende has further decentralized the grid, allowing Germans to pay small companies or even regional co-ops for their energy. That has allowed energy dividends to stay local, rather than going to a few large companies with regulated regional monopolies -- the system previously in place in Germany and still in place in the U.S. \Germany's continued energy revolution will depend in part on smart grids that route power where it is most needed and smart appliances like dishwashers and clothes dryers that can be set to kick on at times of low use on the grid. \Germany, Matthes said, will be at the forefront of that innovation, because it has to be. With fewer natural resources compared with its economic counterparts like Russia and the U.S., Germany has long relied on adding value to raw products. \Germans will continue to march toward 80 percent renewables, he said, with faith they will be able to upgrade their grid along the way to handle it. \""This is a technology-optimistic country because the whole economy is built on innovation,"" Matthes said. ""This is the explanation for its success and there is a deep belief that this can be managed."" \Matthes said thanks to innovations in wind and solar, the base price of renewable energy is now ""extremely competitive"" with fossil fuels in Germany, and as the old tariffs expire Germany will have a competitive advantage in having invested in a comprehensive, domestic energy plan. \In the short term, Klatt said, places like Kansas can benefit from Germany's investments. \""Yes, it was quite expensive, but as I already said, we paid the learning curve,"" Klatt said, ""and I would say Germany produced something like a public good."" \Editor's note: Topeka Capital-Journal reporter Andy Marso received a Heinrich Boll Foundation Climate and Energy Media Fellowship that included one week interviewing government and business officials in Europe.
