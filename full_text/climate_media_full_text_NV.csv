0,"To the editor:\On the news that Republican obstructionists under the influence of Big Oil and King Coal have put a temporary hold on a comprehensive energy and climate bill in the U.S. Senate, the key word is ""temporary."" This is not a victory by any stretch of the conservative imagination.\Nevadans have proved many times that they want this legislation and that we have a lot to gain from it. Unfortunately, we might have to be more patient. But proponents of this legislation are not going away, nor is Sen. Harry Reid's determination to improve his state's well-being by passing a strong bill that puts a price on pollution.\Make no mistake - consider this news about as temporary as obstructionists' existence in their current offices. \Pete Dronkers\Las Vegas\The writer is an environmental advocate with Environment Nevada, a statewide, citizen-based environmental advocacy organization.\Angle behind\To the editor:\Sharron Angle has been blasting Harry Reid for Nevada's 14 percent unemployment rate, but in the next breath stating it's not her job as a senator to create jobs. Now she is wondering why she is trailing by 7 points?\Matt Hafenbreadl\Henderson\Barely surviving\To the editor:\In Monday's letter to the editor, Bob Dubin was repeating the talking point that there are a lot of jobs but those on unemployment are just too lazy to take them because they're better off sitting at home collecting unemployment. Are these jobs that are being touted minimum wage jobs? If so, why would someone who was making a high five-figure salary take that job? Further, why would an employer hire and spend his resources training a person who is overqualified when he knows the new worker is going to quit the minute another job comes along?\The fact is, unemployment benefits are an immediate stimulus to the economy because the people on them are going to spend the money right away. Unemployment benefits are around $300 a week - I hardly think that is living a life of luxury. It's barely surviving.\Tim Rogan\Las Vegas\Work ethic\To the editor:\Regarding John L. Smith's commentary on the extension of unemployment benefits and Sharron Angle's position on the matter (Wednesday column), my grandfather a long time ago offered me this wisdom: If you pay someone for not working, they will not work. They will only continue to keep their hand out for more.\Today, this seems to be the norm rather than the exception. And isn't it odd that the Democrats extended the benefits until just after the mid-term elections?\Just wondering how Mr. Smith missed that.\George Pucine\Las Vegas\On the job\To the editor:\Bob Dubin (""Employers 0, employees just getting welfare,"" Monday letter) has fallen for Sharron Angle's theory of unemployment. I say ""theory"" because it's obvious neither has worked with people who are jobless.\If they visit a job center (government or nonprofit), they would meet many Las Vegans who have worked decades, been laid off, and are desperate to work - at any job - just to buy groceries.\Mr. Dubin and Ms. Angle complain the jobless are relaxing at home when there are many jobs available, if only people would accept minimum wage. I wonder if they're aware that some are so desperate they're accepting below minimum wage in this city to work 50-plus hours a week.\As a rehabilitation counselor, I challenge Ms. Angle and Mr. Dubin to produce evidence of all these jobs no one wants. I know dozens of Las Vegans who would gladly take them.\And yes, Mr. Dubin, they paid into unemployment insurance, just as employers do.\Kathleen Kenna\LAS VEGAS\Back pain\To the editor:\Watching young schoolchildren struggling to carry their overloaded schoolbook backpacks leads me to believe we have placed the health of these kids in jeopardy. Aren't there enough people with serious back problems? Do we need to have programs that force young people to lug heavy articles on their backs daily?\Has anyone studied how much damage this backpacking will do in later life?\I am not a doctor, but I do know back pain. Constant downward pressure on the shoulders can only compress and damage the spinal discs supporting the vertebra sooner than later. These young tots should not be asked to do the work of mules. Something must be done to help save the backs of the future generations. \Can this be a part of why many of our youth are not performing as they should? Picture yourself going and coming from work tired because you are carrying an extra load each day. Not too much fun, huh? Yet you allow the School Board to apply this punishment to your little ones?\I am a senior citizen without children, so I have no cross to bear, but watching some of the little people struggle blows my mind. Could a one-cent sales tax pay for a computer-type book storage reader to lighten the load? If so, bring it on.\Don Ellis\Henderson"
1,"By JENNIFER ROBISON\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\If you think Nevada's jobs market couldn't get worse, a Washington think tank begs to differ.\Just wait until federal legislation forces deep cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, says the American Council for Capital Formation, a group that promotes smaller government. If a bill pending before Congress passes, Nevada can expect to lose thousands more jobs, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in income, the council predicted in a Wednesday report.\But other research and advocacy groups call the study flawed, and say the bill would boost economic expansion and create jobs in the Silver State.\At issue is the American Power Act, which would use a carbon cap-and-trade mechanism to curb greenhouse-gas emissions from their 2005 levels. The bill calls for a 17 percent reduction in 2020, a 42 percent cut in 2030 and an 83 percent decrease in 2050.\To help policymakers understand how the bill would affect the economy, the council commissioned big research company Science Applications International Corp. to formulate several scenarios using modeling data the federal government has cited.\The findings? The bill would cost Nevada 600 to 900 jobs in 2020, and 10,100 to 13,200 jobs in 2030. Job losses would come from lower industrial production due to higher power prices; the cost of complying with mandated emissions cuts; and competition from overseas manufacturers with lower energy expenses.\What's more, as power companies looking to comply with the bill implement carbon capture-and-storage technology or swap out fossil fuel-powered generating plants with higher-cost renewable plants, residential electricity costs could jump as much as 47.2 percent in Nevada, the report said. Residential natural-gas expenses could spike as much as 56.1 percent, and gasoline costs could increase by up to 18.5 percent.\Higher energy prices, job losses and shrinking industrial output would cut Nevada's gross state product by as much as $324 million in 2020 and $3.8 billion in 2030, the council concluded.\Local businesses, trade associations and policymakers disagreed on whether the council's numbers look realistic.\Tom Brede, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said it's impossible to tell if the study's projections are valid because the authors didn't provide the assumptions they fed into their model.\""Rather than tearing down the American Power Act, the authors should spend their time working with us to design policies that would create jobs, reduce pollution, increase our security and make Nevada a clean-energy leader,"" Brede said.\And Daniel Weiss, senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, called the council's analysis ""a classic example of false predictions based on 'garbage in, garbage out.' ""\The council's report is fatally flawed because of unrealistically high assumptions about the bill's estimated cost of reducing global-warming pollution, Weiss said. Plus, independent analyses from federal agencies, universities and other sources contradict the study's findings. Nor can any existing analysis account for innovation that would result once a price is put on pollution, and that means today's studies overestimate costs and underestimate benefits.\Finally, Weiss pointed to nearly $2 million in funding the council received in the last 12 years from oil companies such as ExxonMobil and global-warming ""deniers"" including the Koch Family Foundations.\Weiss also noted that Science Applications International ""denies any responsibilities"" for the report's findings because ""the input assumptions, opinions and recommendations in this report are those of ACCF and SBE (the Small Business Entrepreneurship) and do not necessarily represent SAIC views.""\Also, the council's own numbers still show that national employment would grow by 6.8 million jobs, or 4 percent, from 2020 to 2030. Nevada would benefit from those job gains, Weiss said, while the bill would cost just 3 cents a day.\In fact, battling climate change will yield jobs for Nevada, local observers said. Nevada has the country's highest unemployment rate, as well as some of the nation's best potential for solar energy and other clean power, said Pete Dronkers, an advocate with Environment Nevada. Transitioning to clean energy might pose upfront costs, but substantial job formation will come from such a massive undertaking, Dronkers said.\""We have the ability to begin to change our energy infrastructure to one that is sustainable for the long run and will enjoy price stability instead of fossil-fuel price volatility,"" Dronkers said. ""A lot is on the line here, but most people writing these studies are doing so at the request of fossil-energy companies that have a lot of money for such expenditures.""\The council does get funding from groups in fossil fuel-related industries, Thorning said, but carbon-oriented businesses represent a small portion of the group's funding.\Plus, the council's results mirror July findings from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, Thorning noted. Similar scenarios in the administration's report yielded like results, with both the council and the administration predicting a 1.7 percent drop in the nation's gross domestic product in 2030 if the bill passes. The administration came up with 1.5 million jobs lost nationally, while the council predicted 1.9 million fewer jobs.\If anything, the council's numbers probably low-ball the bill's effects, said Ray Bacon, executive director of the Nevada Manufacturers Association. Heads of other state manufacturers' associations have told Bacon they expect power prices to rise roughly 60 percent under cap-and-trade, and he said he expects gasoline prices to jump to at least $4 a gallon - more than 25 percent beyond where they are now - and stay there. And no study can account for the unintended consequences of any cap-and-trade energy bill, Bacon said.\Representatives of local power utility NV Energy said they couldn't comment on the economic impacts of the bill until they know specifically what Congress wants to achieve. But they called the American Power Act a fair bill, and said they support climate legislation, particularly a law that would yield more clarity as to short- and long-term expectations and implementation timelines.\Republican Sharron Angle, the former state legislator who's running for Reid's seat, didn't respond to a request for comment.\For now, the American Power Act appears shelved because of congressional concerns about piling more costs onto businesses in a struggling economy, Thorning said. Still, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to begin regulating greenhouse-gas emissions on Jan. 1, and it's possible Congress could decide that a federal law would mean more efficient policing of carbon output. The bill might then re-emerge, she said.\The council offered a different option: an international approach that relies on technology-sharing and other forms of cooperation to curb emissions. Any policy that relies instead on mandates and leaves out major emitters such as China, India and Brazil will make the United States noncompetitive globally, Thorning said.\Brede said Reid hopes to find bipartisan support for his own clean-energy jobs and oil-accountability bill, which Brede said would create as many as 700,000 jobs. Reid's bill does not include carbon limits, Brede noted.\Contact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@review journal.com or 702-380-4512."
2,"By JENNIFER ROBISON\(c)2009 LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\For half of Nevadans, the debate over legislation designed to control the climate is just so much hot air.\A new Review-Journal poll found that 50 percent of the state's residents oppose federal cap-and-trade legislation that would allow the government to limit companies' abilities to emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that some say is warming the planet. Another 42 percent of Nevadans support the legislation, while 8 percent say they're undecided.\The poll revealed major variations in partisan support of cap-and-trade. Just 21 percent of Democrats oppose carbon caps, while 81 percent of Republicans are against such limits. Among independents, 57 percent call cap-and-trade bad policy.\An unscientific survey of locals tanking up Friday at a Terrible's gasoline station on Sahara Avenue found an even split between local supporters and detractors.\Steven Yague, a regional manager with a financial-services company, said he's for carbon cap-and-trade because limiting fuel emissions would benefit the health of both people and the environment.\Congress should consider ways to pay for the cap that wouldn't affect the price of energy or consumer goods, Yague said. The nation is spending billions of dollars a month on wars in the Middle East, for starters, so perhaps lawmakers could redirect some of that cash to buy down carbon emissions, Yague suggested.\But Lonnie Gandy isn't having any of it. The jewelry-industry retiree said he worries that cap-and-trade would have a ripple effect on the prices of virtually all consumer goods. What's more, he sees enough scientists arguing against global warming to make him question whether government efforts to control Earth's temperatures are worth it or would work. Worse still, capping U.S. emissions would be pointless when major global polluters such as China and India have no plans to curb carbon output.\""It'll just raise all my energy bills, and I'm not convinced yet that it would really do what they say it's going to do,"" Gandy said.\Local utility executives say the jury's still out on how cap-and-trade would affect consumers' power bills.\Chelsie Campbell, a spokeswoman for local power utility NV Energy, said it's too early to determine how cap-and-trade laws would affect the cost of energy because the Senate still has to write its own version.\But Campbell did say NV Energy supported the House proposal because it allowed utilities free carbon-emissions allowances for a period of years. The Senate version includes a price cap on carbon, and it's still unknown how that bill would call for issuing free allowances.\Keith Schwer, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said he wasn't sure why more voters oppose cap-and-trade than support it, but he did note that consumers in the midst of a recession typically have heightened concern about their economic well-being.\A springtime Gallup poll backed up Schwer's conjecture. The survey found that, for the first time in 25 years of polling, more Americans care about economic growth than the environment. Just 42 percent of people questioned said the environment should take precedence over growth, while 51 percent said economic expansion is more important.\Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, called the economy the ""overriding concern"" for voters, and he said he believes that's the major reason people are turning against cap-and-trade legislation.\""I don't think they (lawmakers) have made a compelling case that this bill is going to help the economy, and some could argue pretty strongly that it could hurt the economy,"" Coker said.\An Aug. 5 report from the federal Energy Information Administration backs up doubts about the bill's impact on the economy.\The administration's study found that the House's bill would increase the cost of energy, slash economic output, hurt purchasing power and cut $432 billion to $1.9 trillion from the nation's gross domestic product by 2030.\Coker said he thinks legislation fatigue could also be pushing voters away from cap-and-trade. From the$787 billion stimulus to the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to $1 trillion in health-care reforms, Americans are growing leery of big-ticket policy proposals.\""Cap-and-trade is like health care in that it's just another in this quick series of major policy changes. Nobody is quite sure what the details are, and people's heads are kind of spinning from all these proposed regulations,"" Coker said.\It's cost issues that give Nevadans like Ray Bacon pause.\Bacon, executive director of the Nevada Manufacturers Association in Carson City, said some of the state's - and country's - biggest and best-paying manufacturing sectors would suffer most from cap-and-trade. Cement plants, wallboard makers, manufacturers of wood products, plastics factories and chemical operations are all energy-intensive businesses that would see marked gains in expenses if cap-and-trade passes the Senate in the fall, Bacon said. Bacon said he recently toured a Northern Nevada cement factory whose operating costs would jump an estimated 30 percent to 40 percent.\Bacon also noted that Mexico's state-run cement maker is quietly opening distribution centers in California to ship cheaper, Mexican-made, cap-and-trade-free concrete products to the United States.\Bacon said consumers will pay substantially more for gasoline two to three years after the bill's passage. \Mason-Dixon Polling & Research of Washington, D.C. conducted the poll on Monday and Tuesday. The company surveyed 400 registered voters in the state and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL OPINION POLL\CAP AND TRADE\-- Do you support or oppose the cap and trade legislation approved by the House of Representatives to limit carbon dioxide emissions that some say causes global warning?\State Dem.

3,"Thomas Mitchell\commentary\You remember that old elementary school civics textbook illustration of how a bill becomes law - the rolled up bill with legs and eyes strolls from draft to committee to House and Senate votes, dodging presidential veto and finally gets signed by the president?\Well, forget it.\""Laws"" passed by Congress and signed by the president are not really hard-and-fast rules for behavior, bright lines over which one should not step. No, they are merely suggestions. The rules are written by the bureaucrats in the bowels of assorted government departments and agencies, and even those can be awfully flexible, depending on the whims and vicissitudes of politicians and functionaries.\Take, for example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - ObamaCare in the pejorative. One might presume that in more than 2,000 pages the drafters could've covered just about every conceivable circumstance, but no. The bill states 67 times that the ""secretary shall establish"" this or that procedure or guideline, leaving the gritty details and heavy lifting up to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and her minions.\When ObamaCare passed the House, it contained a Section 1233, which spelled out that Medicare would pay once every five years for a doctor to explain to a covered patient ""the continuum of end-of-life services and supports available, including palliative care and hospice, and benefits for such services and supports that are available under this title.""\When this was slapped with the ""death panel"" label, the section was excised from the final version signed into law by President Obama. \But the Obama administration has, oh so quietly, resurrected it as an annual program.\The final version of the bill did allow yearly physical examinations, but, according to a story first reported by The New York Times this past week, Health and Human Services has drafted rules to cover ""voluntary advance care planning,"" which includes discussion of end-of-life treatment. \The Times even hinted that such bureaucratic end-runs might become the norm.\""While the new law does not mention advance care planning, the Obama administration has been able to achieve its policy goal through the regulation-writing process,"" the newspaper says, ""a strategy that could become more prevalent in the next two years as the president deals with a strengthened Republican opposition in Congress.""\The Times, bemusingly, quoted an e-mail from a congressional supporter of the stealth rebirth.\An early November e-mail from the office of Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., warned, ""This regulation could be modified or reversed, especially if Republican leaders try to use this small provision to perpetuate the 'death panel' myth. ...\""We would ask that you not broadcast this accomplishment out to any of your lists, even if they are 'supporters' - e-mails can too easily be forwarded.""\This is not even the first circumvention of ObamaCare. When a mandate kicked in requiring companies to provide a minimum amount of health insurance coverage, instead of enforcing the written law, HHS instead issued more than 200 waivers to companies, insurers and unions, affecting 1.5 million people.\In addition, HHS has prepared a 136-page rule on how to determine if insurance rate hikes are ""unreasonable"" under ObamaCare. Though the rule says rate hikes should not exceed 10 percent this year, the agency retains the discretion to determine what is unreasonable, leaving insurers at the mercy of the flexible rationale of bureaucrats.\When Congress punted on an effort to pass a law that would impose ""neutrality"" on the Internet, the unelected appointees at the Federal Communications Commission stepped in, even though a federal court said it had no such power. New rules will allow some companies to charge extra for faster delivery of Internet content such as streaming video, but the FCC will require disclosure of such deals and reserve the power to reject them. The criteria are fuzzy, to say the least.\Because the Congress could not find enough votes to pass a carbon dioxide cap-and-trade law, the Environment Protection Agency took it upon itself to set standards for emissions of greenhouse gases, targeting power plants and refineries. That's still vague, too.\Though Congress passed a bill providing sanctions and trade embargoes on countries dealing with or sponsoring terrorists, according to another New York Times story, a division of the Treasury has been busily doling our licenses to companies to circumvent the embargoes for ""humanitarian"" reasons. These include companies that sell cigarettes, chewing gum, weight-loss remedies, sports equipment and Louisiana hot sauce.\How does selling weapons-grade Louisiana hot sauce qualify as ""humanitarian""?\And that, children, is how things really become ""law"" - or at least guidelines so vague no one really can tell when they are in violation until some bureaucrat tells them so.\Thomas Mitchell is senior opinion editor of the Review-Journal.

4,"As the Senate debates a global warming bill this week, will reality finally have a role in the debate?\Only if supporters of radically overhauling our energy policy will admit the actual costs of such an approach.\The Senate takes up legislation this week which is designed to reduce the nation's carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds within 40 years. Central to the 500-page proposal is a ""pollution allowance trading system,"" which essentially creates a system of rationing various sources of energy, and thus increasing prices.\What this will actually do to curtail ""global warming"" remains murky, especially since India and China won't be attending the parade - but that's just a minor detail to left-wing environmentalists, who see an opportunity to use this issue to cripple human advancement.\As debate on the measure approaches, at least a few brave souls - primarily on the Republican side, of course - have been highlighting the fact that this legislation will send energy prices through the roof.\Consumers are already struggling with gasoline approaching $5 a gallon and other utility costs that have been moving steadily higher for the past few years. New mandates placed on producers in the name of ""global warming"" will only make matters worse.\Even those who worship at the church of global warming agree that many Americans might not be eager to cap emissions if they realized the price.\""This debate is going to be mostly about costs,"" Daniel Lashoff, director of the Climate Center at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told The Associated Press. ""But we want to make sure in that debate we don't forget that the cost of inaction on global warming would be much higher than the cost of the emission reductions called for in this bill.""\In fact, Mr. Lashoff knows that this bill will do little - if anything - to actually impact any warming trend. In a paper for the Heritage Foundation, Ben Lieberman notes that ""a number of economists, including many who are far from global warming skeptics, warn of overly aggressive cap and trade measures imposing costs exceeding the benefits. In other words, the costs of implementing such measures would be higher than the value of the global warming damage that they would prevent.""\In reality, this legislation is a Trojan horse that will impose strict federal command-and-control regulations on the economy - for which consumers will pay billions over the coming decades.\""People are looking at this; they're seeing that it's going to do destructive things to energy prices and gasoline prices,"" Andrew Wheeler said, GOP staff director of the Environment and Public Works Committee, told The Washington Post.\Democrats don't appear to have the votes in the Senate to override a Republican filibuster. Let's hope the GOP acts accordingly."
5,"By BENJAMIN SPILLMAN\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\About 100 people turned out Monday morning to protest the National Clean Energy Summit 2.0.\They waved flags and carried homemade signs denouncing everything from carbon cap-and-trade proposals to reform for the nation's health care system to the presidency of Barack Obama in general.\By 10:30 a.m., the protesters were out in full force. Counter-demonstrators chanting in support of Obama and Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., had packed up mostly professionally made signs and headed out of the heat.\The Obama and Reid protesters remained in force on the corner of Swenson Street and Tropicana Avenue near the Thomas & Mack Center on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus, the site of the summit.\""How can you help the environment if you bankrupt the economy that has to do it?"" asked protester Greg Neff, 50, of Sandy Valley.\Neff hoisted a sign that said, ""Don't Tread on Me,"" and chatted with Bill Parson of Moapa, who was there to drum up support to campaign for Reid's U.S. Senate seat.\Because the event was an energy summit, many protesters focused on the proposed cap-and-trade program that would regulate carbon emissions. Reid, who is Senate majority leader, has great influence over the outcome of pending cap-and-trade legislation.\Carbon produced by burning fossil fuels is widely believed to contribute to a gradual rise in the Earth's temperature, which could eventually alter the climate to the point that it becomes less habitable for humans.\But protesters focused on the potential economic fallout of cap-and-trade programs, saying they would make it hard for the nation's economy to recover by making energy too costly.\""I'm a fan of green energy, but put it in place before you destroy what you have,"" Neff said. ""If you don't, you destroy a nation.""\While most of the protesters were friendly while speaking out on issues, some simply flung charges of socialism at Reid and Obama, and at least one small group had a sign that referred to Obama as an ""anti-American Arab.""\Protester Bettye Gilmore of Henderson said it would be unfair to lump all the protesters with fringe activists who attack Obama based on race or to suggest that criticism leveled at Obama is driven by corporate and high-level Republican sources who distribute talking points on the Internet.\Gilmore said her opposition to Obama was over the issues, not his status as the first black president of the United States.\""It is not a racial issue. I think Condoleezza Rice would have made a great president. She is a conservative,"" Gilmore said of the former secretary of state, who is black.\At the summit, speakers including former Vice President Al Gore and current Energy Secretary Steven Chu defended the position that shifting America's energy to non-carbon-producing sources is critical to the long-term health of the economy.\They also said a national-level effort - derided by protesters as socialism or a burdensome tax - is critical to preserving the planet.\""Just what the doctor ordered is a national program to repower America,"" Gore said. ""Sooner or later we are going to have to come to grips with the fact the climate crisis is threatening the future of our civilization.""\Organizers of the demonstrators who backed the energy agenda behind the conference said they counted about 275 supporters on hand. \The group included a woman who was laid off from her job as plumber and whose husband, an ironworker, also was out of work, the organizers said.\They targeted the summit as a demonstration site to show support for the creation of new jobs developing green energy.\""This is really a fantastic opportunity for environmental groups, for labor groups and people looking for jobs,"" said Robert Disney of the Sierra Club, who was with the supporters. ""For folks to be against it, it just doesn't make any sense.""\Contact reporter Benjamin Spillman at bspillman@reviewjournal.com or 702-477-3861."
6,"By JENNIFER ROBISON\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\Monday's National Clean Energy Summit 2.0 will bring a parade of celebrated public policy experts to Las Vegas to discuss greening the country's economy.\But as leaders including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger encourage investments in alternative energy, their policy prescriptions could face serious headwinds from changing public opinions.\Recent surveys show Americans cooling to global warming, and they're even less keen on environmental policies they believe might raise power bills or imperil jobs. Those sentiments could mean a tougher road ahead for elected officials looking to fund investments in renewable power or install a carbon cap-and-trade system.\""Right now, Americans are more concerned about the economy than the environment,"" said Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll. ""The politician who says, 'I'm going to cripple jobs and shut down factories' would be in trouble in this economy.""\what the numbers say\Here's what Gallup found: The number of Americans who say the media have exaggerated global warming jumped to a record 41 percent in 2009, up from 35 percent a year ago. The most marked increase came among political independents, whose ranks of doubters swelled from 33 percent to 44 percent. Republican doubters grew from 59 percent to 66 percent, while Democratic skeptics stayed at around 20 percent.\What's more, fewer Americans believe the effects of global warming have started to occur: 53 percent see signs of a hotter planet, down from 61 percent in 2008. Global warming placed last among eight environmental concerns Gallup asked respondents to rank, with water pollution landing the top spot.\Another recent Gallup study found that, for the first time in 25 years of polling, more Americans care about economic growth than the environment. Just 42 percent of people surveyed said the environment takes precedence over growth, while 51 percent asserted expansion carries more weight. That reverses results from 2008, when 49 percent of respondents said the environment was paramount and 42 percent said economic growth came first. In 1985, the poll's first year, 61 percent placed a bigger priority on the environment, while 28 percent ranked economic growth highest.\All those results indicate trends that pose big challenges for the environmental movement, Gallup's researchers concluded. More pointedly, the findings signal potential trouble for policies designed to curb global warming.\""It's a conundrum. You can't just say to those interested in global warming that they need to do a better job of PR because they have been trying so hard,"" Newport said. ""Al Gore won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. He made a widely seen movie, and his book sold many copies. Yet, with all that, it hasn't worked. You would have to say that, somehow, they're not getting the message across.""\Ask Daniel Weiss, a senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, why increasing numbers of Americans dispute global warming and place the economy ahead of the environment, and he'll say those findings are wrong.\""I don't accept their premise. I think the Gallup Poll is mistaken,"" said Weiss, whose organization will send its chief executive officer, former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, to Monday's clean energy confab. ""I would want to look at their questions to see how they got to this place.""\Weiss pointed to surveys that contradict Gallup's results. A Pew Environmental Group poll found that 77 percent of voters want law-makers to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and 55 percent said efforts to curb global warming will create jobs. Another poll from the National Wildlife Federation found that 55 percent of those polled strongly support a global warming plan that reduces pollution.\But it's not just Gallup that shows flagging concern about global warming. In a July Rasmussen poll, 56 percent said they didn't want to pay higher taxes or utility bills to generate clean energy and fight global warming. A January Pew poll placed global warming last among the top 20 priorities Americans have for 2009. Nos. 1 and 2? The economy and jobs. Even trade policy and lobbyists outranked global warming. And Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think-tank, pointed to a study from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association that showed 58 percent of respondents were unwilling to pay more than they currently pay for electricity to combat climate change.\'a huge amount of skepticism' \Most observers say the economy is behind changing attitudes. \When people face immediate concerns such as job security, more-distant problems fade into the background, Newport said.\Studies show a strong historical correlation between economic prospects and support for environmental causes. When the economy surges, public support for green initiatives rises, said Jerry Taylor, a senior fellow with the free-market advocate Cato Institute.\""We're in the midst of one of the deepest recessions since the Great Depression, and people suspect environmental policies have price tags that are not inconsequential,"" Taylor said.\The public's interest in climate change also rises with extreme weather events, and the nation hasn't seen widespread, catastrophic weather since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Taylor added.\Ebell said he doesn't believe the recession or the weather are eroding public concern about global warming. Rather, he said, publicity over the high cost of green policies in Europe and other regions, as well as indications that those policies haven't yielded results and a 12-year string of stable global temperatures, are changing Americans' minds.\European countries have imposed gasoline taxes of $3 to $4 per gallon to curb consumption, Ebell noted, and the TaxPayers' Alliance in Great Britain estimated that the average British family spends more than $1,200 a year on green charges and levies. Despite such investments, a December report from the United Nations showed that greenhouse gas emissions have grown by almost 10 percent worldwide since 1990, if you control for the emissions-curbing collapse of the Soviet Union and ensuing economic decline in Eastern Europe.\More importantly, said Ebell, the planet's average temperature hasn't risen since 1997, despite a 5 percent gain in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the same period. Twelve years doesn't make for a long-term trend, Ebell said, but every year that goes by with no increase in average temperatures makes it harder to assert the climate is sensitive to carbon dioxide.\""I think there's a huge amount of skepticism among the public. They've heard all these claims, and now they've been informed that there isn't any recent warming,"" Ebell said. ""The public, without having a lot of information about it, is pretty astute. I think the alarmists are having a hard time making the case for global warming simply because reality is against them and the public has figured it out."" (The Competitive Enterprise Institute has taken flak for accepting funding from oil giant ExxonMobil. Ebell said the financing ended several years ago, and the funding source didn't affect the group's policy positions, which were in place before the nonprofit sought the money and have remained intact since the agreement concluded.)\Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., responded that the science showing the greenhouse effect on Earth's climate is solid. He pointed to pictures from Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, which reveal the virtual disappearance of a glacier in the past 35 years.\Weiss added that ignoring the environment carries its own costs: The typical household energy bill has risen $1,100 in the past eight years, even without policies to fight global warming.\""Doing nothing has been very costly,"" he said.\Worse still, agreed Reid and Weiss, eschewing environmental policies hurts the economy. Prominent venture capitalists and executives from Fortune 500 companies such as General Electric say investing in green energy will boost the economy, creating millions of high-tech jobs. Even a policy as simple as retrofitting existing buildings and constructing new buildings according to green standards would bolster the construction sector, as well as reduce waste and pollution, Reid said.\""The country that makes the clean energy technologies of the future is going to be the one that dominates the world economy,"" Weiss said. ""Right now, China, Germany and other economic competitors are ahead of us because we've had eight years of doing nothing. Americans know we must change the way we generate and use energy. The question isn't whether we're going to buy clean energy technologies. The question is whether we're going to buy clean energy technologies made in the United States and marketed overseas, or whether we'll buy them from China and bring them here.""\still some selling to do\Bringing alternative power sources online and reining in greenhouse gases pose upfront costs, though, because the country's energy infra-structure was built around fossil fuels. Congress has appropriated more than $60 billion for clean energy initiatives in the past year, including $11 billion for a national ""smart"" electric grid, $5 billion for making homes more efficient and $2 billion to invest in advanced batteries.\Also, the federal Energy Information Administration released a report Wednesday that tallied up the costs of the American Clean Energy and Security Act, the carbon cap-and-trade bill that passed the House of Representatives in May and goes to the Senate for a vote in the fall. The agency's analysis found that the bill would increase the cost of energy, pare economic output, curb purchasing power and cut $432 billion to $1.9 trillion from the nation's gross domestic product by 2030.\And that's where all those polls showing that Americans aren't certain those costs are worth it might begin to matter. With so many surveys revealing that Americans have little appetite for environmental policies that they think could stall economic growth or pinch consumers' budgets, policymakers still have some selling to do, observers say.\Politicians might just need to work harder at educating the public on why they think green policies are important, Newport said.\Other elected officials could end up changing their stands on those policies because, after all, a politician's biggest goal is to keep his job.\""Some people think politicians vote on the merits of an issue,"" Taylor said. ""There might be one here or there who does that, but they're exceptions to the rule. For the most part, politicians are like businessmen, only they're in the business of earning votes. Virtually everything they do is with an eye on how many votes it will get them. And these sorts of surveys tell politicians that votes for cap-and-trade programs are extremely hazardous to their electoral health.""\Members of Congress who represent blue states and hold leadership positions in their parties will be safer than those who hail from swing states and enjoy less seniority, Taylor predicted.\Reid vowed Friday to continue his push for clean energy policies, saying that a sound and healthy environment is critical to any prosperous economy, and the Gallup numbers show most Americans continue to believe that the seriousness of global warming has been correctly portrayed or even understated.\""We have a duty to all of our children to make sure we don't let temporary difficulties get in the way of making good choices for their future,"" he said.\Summit at unlv to explore clean energy options\The National Clean Energy Summit 2.0 will feature a day's worth of discussions on how to build a clean energy economy.\In addition to former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, public officials including Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis will participate.\Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the forum will focus on creating jobs through investments in green power.\The event begins at 10 a.m. inside the Cox Pavilion on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Speakers are scheduled to conclude around 6 p.m. On Tuesday, leaders will take a private tour of green developments in Las Vegas, including a stop at CityCenter.\Tickets to the Monday event cost $150.

Before all the talk turned to the economic crisis, the energy crisis had our attention.
\
Remember rising electricity prices, global warming, stranded polar bears?
\
Here's a breakdown of the presidential contenders' energy policies, and how they might affect the environment and Nevadans' wallets.
\
Nuclear power
\
The main thrust of John McCain's energy policy is a call for 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030.
\
Although the plants produce no carbon emissions, making them an attractive power source in a carbon-constrained world, there are serious environmental and safety concerns with uranium mining and disposal of nuclear waste.
\
Barack Obama has said there must be solutions to the waste storage and safety problems before he would support new nuclear power plants.
\
Nevada is unlikely to see a nuclear plant built within its borders even if McCain is elected because the plants require large amounts of water. Still, local environmentalists are concerned that more nuclear plants mean more radioactive waste, which could wind up dumped at Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
\
McCain supports the Yucca project; Obama has said he would kill plans for a repository there.
\
There are also concerns about the cost of nuclear plants, which would receive billions in federal subsidies under McCain's plan.
\
""The real concern with nuclear power is it's so expensive,"" said Lydia Ball, a local representative of the Sierra Club.
\
Coal-fired power
\
Both candidates advocate researching how to capture the carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, because experts say coal will continue to provide a significant amount of the nation's electricity. Fifty percent of America's electric power comes from coal.
\
There are three coal-fired power plants in various stages of the approval process in Nevada, but environmentalists shouldn't expect the next president to step in to stop those plants, according to William Becker, executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project.
\
""They're going to wait and see. New coal plants have been on the decline in the last year or so -- not because of any federal action, but because of the price of coal, how (plants) will be affected by carbon pricing, by lawsuits, by states' refusal to issue permits,"" Becker said.
\
Still, it's the federal legislation putting a price tag on carbon emissions, which both candidates support, that would have the greatest effect on the price of energy from new coal plants and be most likely to stall plans for more.
\
Renewable energy
\
Both candidates say they support renewable energy, although environmentalists question McCain's dedication to the technology.
\
""McCain used to be one of the few Republican voices .. calling for action on global warming,"" said Anna Aurilio, director of Environment America's Washington office But she says McCain skipped out on many important environmental votes from June 2005 to February 2008, earning him a 27 percent grade to Obama's 86 percent from the environmental group.
\
And his choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate -- and possible point-person on energy -- hasn't helped him in environmentalists' eyes.
\
""McCain putting Palin in charge is not going to lead us to the kind of clean energy policies we need,"" Aurilio said.
\
Among McCain's promises are a $5,000 tax credit to consumers who buy zero-emissions cars (which are not now available in the market); a $300 million prize to the inventor of a better battery for plug-in hybrids or electric cars; and a tax rebate equal to 10 percent of what companies spend on wages for employees doing research and development.
\
What he hasn't called for, and what environmentalists and renewable energy industry insiders say will be the real driver of clean energy development, is a requirement that the nation get a percentage of its energy from renewable sources, such as wind or solar power plants. Obama has called for 10 percent of America's energy to come from renewable sources by 2012. Last year, less than 1 percent of the nation's power came from solar, geothermal and wind combined.
\
Nevada business leaders and politicians of both parties have said the state could benefit from a strong national standard for renewable energy, because it has rich solar and geothermal resources and could export clean energy to power-hungry Southern California.
\
Obama is also calling for $15 billion in federal funding for renewable research and development.
\
Carbon caps
\
Both candidates favor setting a national cap on the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, but they differ on how low that cap should be and how to trim emissions to reach it.
\
McCain wants to cut carbon emissions to their level in 1990, or by 40 percent from today's level, by 2020. By 2050 his plan would cut emissions by an additional 60 percent from 1990 levels.
\
Obama's caps are initially on par with McCain's, but over the longer term they are more aggressive. Obama would cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, but then by an additional 80 percent by 2050.
\
Climate scientists have agreed that emissions must be trimmed to the levels Obama is calling for to prevent the most severe effects of climate change, although some scientists now say even that might be too little.
\
'Trade' in cap and trade
\
A cap and trade system would set a carbon emissions limit that would grow more strict each year. The government would distribute pollution permits, and as the cap becomes more strict it would create a market for those permits. Power plants, factories and other businesses that emit carbon could either spend money installing pollution control devices to meet the cap, or buy pollution permits from other companies that have gone below it. Companies that cut their pollution to get it below the cap could sell their permits for the difference to other emitters.
\
The candidates differ, however, on how to regulate the market for these pollution permits.
\
McCain wants to give away at least a portion of the permits, called allowances. He would auction the rest.
\
Obama wants to auction 100 percent of the permits.
\
In either case, the system is likely to be incredibly complicated -- with the price of permits and the cost of all kinds of energy varying based on everything from whether the utility where you live is regulated (as in Nevada) to what kind of fuel the utility uses to generate its electricity.
\
Utilities such as NV Energy that get the majority of their power from fossil-fuel-burning coal and natural gas plants would pay more; utilities generating hydroelectric or nuclear
\
power would pay less.
\
Michael Yackira, president of NV Energy, said the rules that govern a cap and trade system will also matter more to utilities that serve growing populations such as that of Las Vegas, because their carbon emissions are growing, too.
\
NV Energy also buys a portion of the energy it sells to customers from the energy market. That electricity will certainly be more expensive under a cap and trade system.
\
Yackira said his company favors at least a partial giveaway of allocations, because an auction would push up energy prices in Nevada.
\
""An auction is the equivalent of a tax,"" Yackira said.
\
The candidates also disagree over what to do with the revenue from auctions.
\
McCain would spend the money from the auction portion of his plan on research and development of clean energy technology and energy assistance for the poor.
\
Estimates are that Obama's 100 percent auction program would bring in $100 billion to $200 billion, and he says he would spend $15 billion of that on research and development. The rest would go back to taxpayers and to fund energy assistance programs.

9,"
WASHINGTON -- As Congress begins to turn its attention to climate change legislation, the debate has shifted from a conversation about saving the planet to one about protecting your wallet.
\
Opponents have mounted a fierce campaign based on a startling factoid: Cap-and-trade legislation could cost the average U.S. household $3,100 a year.
\
Nevada Republican Sen. John Ensign used this argument during a speech this week on the Senate floor.
\
It's effective. No one wants to pay that much in higher utility bills and higher prices for ordinary items because of rising energy costs.
\
Ensign argues that if Congress imposes cap-and-trade legislation, President Barack Obama will effectively break his promise of no new taxes on families making $250,000 a year or less.
\
There's just one problem: It's not exactly true.
\
In fact, a growing body of literature is being developed around how climate change legislation would affect your pocketbook. Here is a snapshot of the findings:
\
Yes, electricity costs will rise if Congress passes climate change legislation. The nation will have to pay to shift the
\
economy from one based on fossil fuels to one based on green energy sources that are still emerging as industries.
\
Economists, though, say the costs per household would be far lower than Ensign claims. In fact, the costs would drop even further after factoring in expected government rebates or subsidies.
\
Those lower estimates do not account for the high price of doing nothing, which would include higher energy costs as well as the migration, security and other costs associated with a warming planet.
\
One Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist essentially scolded Republicans this week for misusing his report to arrive at the $3,100 figure.
\
John Reilly, associate director of research at the university's Joint Program on Global Change and a co-author of the study, said the actual cost per household would be about one-tenth, or $340 annually. He assumes revenue raised through a cap-and-trade system would be shared with consumers.
\
Here's how cap-and-trade works: The government would essentially set a limit on carbon emissions and require companies that pollute beyond that level to obtain an allowance. If the government decides to charge companies that receive those allowances, estimates are that the cap-and-trade system would generate as much as $640 billion annually in revenue. Obama and leading Democrats have indicated that some of that money should be used to help consumers pay their bills.
\
But even before any government rebate, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office testified last month that the annual cost for middle-income households would be $1,600 a year. The CBO was clear that its estimate did not count additional economic benefits consumers could see from climate change legislation.
\
Supporters of climate change legislation insist any consumer costs would be offset by government rebates or subsidies, especially for low-income households. The draft cap-and-trade bill introduced this week by House Democrats includes a section titled ""Consumer Assistance"" -- a placeholder for an offset plan to come.
\
""I know people are in an uproar: It's going to cost so much, it's going to cost so much,"" said Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley, who has long pushed for green energy and now sits on the Ways and Means Committee, which is writing climate change tax policy.
\
""We're working on that right now. They're going to experience an increase in the cost of energy. There will be subsidies available.""
\
Berkley becomes furious, though, when the debate turns to consumer costs. She points to the hidden costs of business as usual -- asthma-related air pollution, national security threats and a nuclear waste dump planned for Yucca Mountain.
\
""Just a few months ago we were paying $4 a gallon for gas,"" Berkley said. ""How long do we have to depend on oil and other fossil fuels? There has got to be a long-term and serious commitment to planning, to creating an energy policy for this nation's future.""
\
Climate change legislation is poised to become a signature issue of the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress.
\
Obama has pledged to reduce greenhouse gases and increase renewable energy production as part of a massive shift in national energy policy that has been debated since the Carter administration. President Ronald Reagan famously removed solar panels his predecessor installed at the White House.
\
Hopes are high that Congress will pass legislation in time for a December international conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, where participants are expected to draft what is billed as the next Kyoto accord -- a global commitment to reduce emissions causing climate change.
\
But revamping national energy policy will not come without a fight, especially from the traditional industries that have powered the nation for decades. Lawmakers from both major parties, especially those from states where coal, oil and gas companies are concentrated, have raised red flags.
\
Opponents have targeted pocketbook costs as a linchpin of their criticism.
\
A full-page advertisement by the oil and gas industry in Thursday's Washington Post was headlined ""New Energy Taxes."" It continued, ""With our economy in crisis, this is no time to burden Americans with massive new energy costs.""
\
Ensign, as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the Senate, convened a hearing Monday to investigate the ""National Energy Tax in Obama's Budget.""
\
Ensign cited the $3,100 figure -- what he calls ""the national sales tax on energy"" -- during a Senate floor speech Wednesday.
\
He reminded that Obama promised not to raise taxes on individuals making up to $200,000 and families making up to $250,000, and pledged to hold the president accountable.
\
""Families were promised no tax increases and they don't care whether those tax increases come directly or indirectly,"" Ensign said. ""I repeat, 'Not one single dime,'"" Ensign said, reiterating the president's pledge.
\
Yet even an economist invited to testify at Ensign's hearing said the $3,100 struck her as high.
\
Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, put the average annual household price closer to $600 (in 2003 dollars). Her figures are on par with past estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
\
Mathur was more skeptical, however, that consumers would be guaranteed some sort of offset to limit the hit to the pocketbook. Already, potential revenue raised from selling pollution permits in the proposed cap-and-trade system are being eyed for other uses -- namely to fund health care.
\
""Even if they refund the money, we don't know how much they will give back,"" she said. ""There's already a lot of demand on that money.""
\
Supporters of climate change legislation predict consumers will save money with a more efficient energy system that does not depend on coal or the vagaries of foreign oil prices, which drive up consumer gas bills and add transportation costs to the price of virtually all goods.
\
The Union of Concerned Scientists cites studies showing that gross domestic product would fall by less than 1 percent with climate change legislation, while the costs of climate change could account for more than 3 percent of GDP in years to come.
\
They see the cost issue being raised as a roadblock to legislation -- a way to thwart the president's agenda and protect the energy and manufacturing industries that have been home-state staples but would now face the enormous challenge of operating in a changed environment.
\
Liz Perera at Union of Concerned Scientists said energy prices will continue to rise in response to growing demand if nothing is done to find new energy sources.
\
""The reality is, there's no one to help consumers now,"" she said.

0,"To the editor:\On the news that Republican obstructionists under the influence of Big Oil and King Coal have put a temporary hold on a comprehensive energy and climate bill in the U.S. Senate, the key word is ""temporary."" This is not a victory by any stretch of the conservative imagination.\Nevadans have proved many times that they want this legislation and that we have a lot to gain from it. Unfortunately, we might have to be more patient. But proponents of this legislation are not going away, nor is Sen. Harry Reid's determination to improve his state's well-being by passing a strong bill that puts a price on pollution.\Make no mistake - consider this news about as temporary as obstructionists' existence in their current offices. \Pete Dronkers\Las Vegas\The writer is an environmental advocate with Environment Nevada, a statewide, citizen-based environmental advocacy organization.\Angle behind\To the editor:\Sharron Angle has been blasting Harry Reid for Nevada's 14 percent unemployment rate, but in the next breath stating it's not her job as a senator to create jobs. Now she is wondering why she is trailing by 7 points?\Matt Hafenbreadl\Henderson\Barely surviving\To the editor:\In Monday's letter to the editor, Bob Dubin was repeating the talking point that there are a lot of jobs but those on unemployment are just too lazy to take them because they're better off sitting at home collecting unemployment. Are these jobs that are being touted minimum wage jobs? If so, why would someone who was making a high five-figure salary take that job? Further, why would an employer hire and spend his resources training a person who is overqualified when he knows the new worker is going to quit the minute another job comes along?\The fact is, unemployment benefits are an immediate stimulus to the economy because the people on them are going to spend the money right away. Unemployment benefits are around $300 a week - I hardly think that is living a life of luxury. It's barely surviving.\Tim Rogan\Las Vegas\Work ethic\To the editor:\Regarding John L. Smith's commentary on the extension of unemployment benefits and Sharron Angle's position on the matter (Wednesday column), my grandfather a long time ago offered me this wisdom: If you pay someone for not working, they will not work. They will only continue to keep their hand out for more.\Today, this seems to be the norm rather than the exception. And isn't it odd that the Democrats extended the benefits until just after the mid-term elections?\Just wondering how Mr. Smith missed that.\George Pucine\Las Vegas\On the job\To the editor:\Bob Dubin (""Employers 0, employees just getting welfare,"" Monday letter) has fallen for Sharron Angle's theory of unemployment. I say ""theory"" because it's obvious neither has worked with people who are jobless.\If they visit a job center (government or nonprofit), they would meet many Las Vegans who have worked decades, been laid off, and are desperate to work - at any job - just to buy groceries.\Mr. Dubin and Ms. Angle complain the jobless are relaxing at home when there are many jobs available, if only people would accept minimum wage. I wonder if they're aware that some are so desperate they're accepting below minimum wage in this city to work 50-plus hours a week.\As a rehabilitation counselor, I challenge Ms. Angle and Mr. Dubin to produce evidence of all these jobs no one wants. I know dozens of Las Vegans who would gladly take them.\And yes, Mr. Dubin, they paid into unemployment insurance, just as employers do.\Kathleen Kenna\LAS VEGAS\Back pain\To the editor:\Watching young schoolchildren struggling to carry their overloaded schoolbook backpacks leads me to believe we have placed the health of these kids in jeopardy. Aren't there enough people with serious back problems? Do we need to have programs that force young people to lug heavy articles on their backs daily?\Has anyone studied how much damage this backpacking will do in later life?\I am not a doctor, but I do know back pain. Constant downward pressure on the shoulders can only compress and damage the spinal discs supporting the vertebra sooner than later. These young tots should not be asked to do the work of mules. Something must be done to help save the backs of the future generations. \Can this be a part of why many of our youth are not performing as they should? Picture yourself going and coming from work tired because you are carrying an extra load each day. Not too much fun, huh? Yet you allow the School Board to apply this punishment to your little ones?\I am a senior citizen without children, so I have no cross to bear, but watching some of the little people struggle blows my mind. Could a one-cent sales tax pay for a computer-type book storage reader to lighten the load? If so, bring it on.\Don Ellis\Henderson"
1,"By JENNIFER ROBISON\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\If you think Nevada's jobs market couldn't get worse, a Washington think tank begs to differ.\Just wait until federal legislation forces deep cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, says the American Council for Capital Formation, a group that promotes smaller government. If a bill pending before Congress passes, Nevada can expect to lose thousands more jobs, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in income, the council predicted in a Wednesday report.\But other research and advocacy groups call the study flawed, and say the bill would boost economic expansion and create jobs in the Silver State.\At issue is the American Power Act, which would use a carbon cap-and-trade mechanism to curb greenhouse-gas emissions from their 2005 levels. The bill calls for a 17 percent reduction in 2020, a 42 percent cut in 2030 and an 83 percent decrease in 2050.\To help policymakers understand how the bill would affect the economy, the council commissioned big research company Science Applications International Corp. to formulate several scenarios using modeling data the federal government has cited.\The findings? The bill would cost Nevada 600 to 900 jobs in 2020, and 10,100 to 13,200 jobs in 2030. Job losses would come from lower industrial production due to higher power prices; the cost of complying with mandated emissions cuts; and competition from overseas manufacturers with lower energy expenses.\What's more, as power companies looking to comply with the bill implement carbon capture-and-storage technology or swap out fossil fuel-powered generating plants with higher-cost renewable plants, residential electricity costs could jump as much as 47.2 percent in Nevada, the report said. Residential natural-gas expenses could spike as much as 56.1 percent, and gasoline costs could increase by up to 18.5 percent.\Higher energy prices, job losses and shrinking industrial output would cut Nevada's gross state product by as much as $324 million in 2020 and $3.8 billion in 2030, the council concluded.\Local businesses, trade associations and policymakers disagreed on whether the council's numbers look realistic.\Tom Brede, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said it's impossible to tell if the study's projections are valid because the authors didn't provide the assumptions they fed into their model.\""Rather than tearing down the American Power Act, the authors should spend their time working with us to design policies that would create jobs, reduce pollution, increase our security and make Nevada a clean-energy leader,"" Brede said.\And Daniel Weiss, senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, called the council's analysis ""a classic example of false predictions based on 'garbage in, garbage out.' ""\The council's report is fatally flawed because of unrealistically high assumptions about the bill's estimated cost of reducing global-warming pollution, Weiss said. Plus, independent analyses from federal agencies, universities and other sources contradict the study's findings. Nor can any existing analysis account for innovation that would result once a price is put on pollution, and that means today's studies overestimate costs and underestimate benefits.\Finally, Weiss pointed to nearly $2 million in funding the council received in the last 12 years from oil companies such as ExxonMobil and global-warming ""deniers"" including the Koch Family Foundations.\Weiss also noted that Science Applications International ""denies any responsibilities"" for the report's findings because ""the input assumptions, opinions and recommendations in this report are those of ACCF and SBE (the Small Business Entrepreneurship) and do not necessarily represent SAIC views.""\Also, the council's own numbers still show that national employment would grow by 6.8 million jobs, or 4 percent, from 2020 to 2030. Nevada would benefit from those job gains, Weiss said, while the bill would cost just 3 cents a day.\In fact, battling climate change will yield jobs for Nevada, local observers said. Nevada has the country's highest unemployment rate, as well as some of the nation's best potential for solar energy and other clean power, said Pete Dronkers, an advocate with Environment Nevada. Transitioning to clean energy might pose upfront costs, but substantial job formation will come from such a massive undertaking, Dronkers said.\""We have the ability to begin to change our energy infrastructure to one that is sustainable for the long run and will enjoy price stability instead of fossil-fuel price volatility,"" Dronkers said. ""A lot is on the line here, but most people writing these studies are doing so at the request of fossil-energy companies that have a lot of money for such expenditures.""\The council does get funding from groups in fossil fuel-related industries, Thorning said, but carbon-oriented businesses represent a small portion of the group's funding.\Plus, the council's results mirror July findings from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, Thorning noted. Similar scenarios in the administration's report yielded like results, with both the council and the administration predicting a 1.7 percent drop in the nation's gross domestic product in 2030 if the bill passes. The administration came up with 1.5 million jobs lost nationally, while the council predicted 1.9 million fewer jobs.\If anything, the council's numbers probably low-ball the bill's effects, said Ray Bacon, executive director of the Nevada Manufacturers Association. Heads of other state manufacturers' associations have told Bacon they expect power prices to rise roughly 60 percent under cap-and-trade, and he said he expects gasoline prices to jump to at least $4 a gallon - more than 25 percent beyond where they are now - and stay there. And no study can account for the unintended consequences of any cap-and-trade energy bill, Bacon said.\Representatives of local power utility NV Energy said they couldn't comment on the economic impacts of the bill until they know specifically what Congress wants to achieve. But they called the American Power Act a fair bill, and said they support climate legislation, particularly a law that would yield more clarity as to short- and long-term expectations and implementation timelines.\Republican Sharron Angle, the former state legislator who's running for Reid's seat, didn't respond to a request for comment.\For now, the American Power Act appears shelved because of congressional concerns about piling more costs onto businesses in a struggling economy, Thorning said. Still, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to begin regulating greenhouse-gas emissions on Jan. 1, and it's possible Congress could decide that a federal law would mean more efficient policing of carbon output. The bill might then re-emerge, she said.\The council offered a different option: an international approach that relies on technology-sharing and other forms of cooperation to curb emissions. Any policy that relies instead on mandates and leaves out major emitters such as China, India and Brazil will make the United States noncompetitive globally, Thorning said.\Brede said Reid hopes to find bipartisan support for his own clean-energy jobs and oil-accountability bill, which Brede said would create as many as 700,000 jobs. Reid's bill does not include carbon limits, Brede noted.\Contact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@review journal.com or 702-380-4512."
2,"By JENNIFER ROBISON\(c)2009 LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\For half of Nevadans, the debate over legislation designed to control the climate is just so much hot air.\A new Review-Journal poll found that 50 percent of the state's residents oppose federal cap-and-trade legislation that would allow the government to limit companies' abilities to emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that some say is warming the planet. Another 42 percent of Nevadans support the legislation, while 8 percent say they're undecided.\The poll revealed major variations in partisan support of cap-and-trade. Just 21 percent of Democrats oppose carbon caps, while 81 percent of Republicans are against such limits. Among independents, 57 percent call cap-and-trade bad policy.\An unscientific survey of locals tanking up Friday at a Terrible's gasoline station on Sahara Avenue found an even split between local supporters and detractors.\Steven Yague, a regional manager with a financial-services company, said he's for carbon cap-and-trade because limiting fuel emissions would benefit the health of both people and the environment.\Congress should consider ways to pay for the cap that wouldn't affect the price of energy or consumer goods, Yague said. The nation is spending billions of dollars a month on wars in the Middle East, for starters, so perhaps lawmakers could redirect some of that cash to buy down carbon emissions, Yague suggested.\But Lonnie Gandy isn't having any of it. The jewelry-industry retiree said he worries that cap-and-trade would have a ripple effect on the prices of virtually all consumer goods. What's more, he sees enough scientists arguing against global warming to make him question whether government efforts to control Earth's temperatures are worth it or would work. Worse still, capping U.S. emissions would be pointless when major global polluters such as China and India have no plans to curb carbon output.\""It'll just raise all my energy bills, and I'm not convinced yet that it would really do what they say it's going to do,"" Gandy said.\Local utility executives say the jury's still out on how cap-and-trade would affect consumers' power bills.\Chelsie Campbell, a spokeswoman for local power utility NV Energy, said it's too early to determine how cap-and-trade laws would affect the cost of energy because the Senate still has to write its own version.\But Campbell did say NV Energy supported the House proposal because it allowed utilities free carbon-emissions allowances for a period of years. The Senate version includes a price cap on carbon, and it's still unknown how that bill would call for issuing free allowances.\Keith Schwer, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said he wasn't sure why more voters oppose cap-and-trade than support it, but he did note that consumers in the midst of a recession typically have heightened concern about their economic well-being.\A springtime Gallup poll backed up Schwer's conjecture. The survey found that, for the first time in 25 years of polling, more Americans care about economic growth than the environment. Just 42 percent of people questioned said the environment should take precedence over growth, while 51 percent said economic expansion is more important.\Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, called the economy the ""overriding concern"" for voters, and he said he believes that's the major reason people are turning against cap-and-trade legislation.\""I don't think they (lawmakers) have made a compelling case that this bill is going to help the economy, and some could argue pretty strongly that it could hurt the economy,"" Coker said.\An Aug. 5 report from the federal Energy Information Administration backs up doubts about the bill's impact on the economy.\The administration's study found that the House's bill would increase the cost of energy, slash economic output, hurt purchasing power and cut $432 billion to $1.9 trillion from the nation's gross domestic product by 2030.\Coker said he thinks legislation fatigue could also be pushing voters away from cap-and-trade. From the$787 billion stimulus to the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to $1 trillion in health-care reforms, Americans are growing leery of big-ticket policy proposals.\""Cap-and-trade is like health care in that it's just another in this quick series of major policy changes. Nobody is quite sure what the details are, and people's heads are kind of spinning from all these proposed regulations,"" Coker said.\It's cost issues that give Nevadans like Ray Bacon pause.\Bacon, executive director of the Nevada Manufacturers Association in Carson City, said some of the state's - and country's - biggest and best-paying manufacturing sectors would suffer most from cap-and-trade. Cement plants, wallboard makers, manufacturers of wood products, plastics factories and chemical operations are all energy-intensive businesses that would see marked gains in expenses if cap-and-trade passes the Senate in the fall, Bacon said. Bacon said he recently toured a Northern Nevada cement factory whose operating costs would jump an estimated 30 percent to 40 percent.\Bacon also noted that Mexico's state-run cement maker is quietly opening distribution centers in California to ship cheaper, Mexican-made, cap-and-trade-free concrete products to the United States.\Bacon said consumers will pay substantially more for gasoline two to three years after the bill's passage. \Mason-Dixon Polling & Research of Washington, D.C. conducted the poll on Monday and Tuesday. The company surveyed 400 registered voters in the state and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL OPINION POLL\CAP AND TRADE\-- Do you support or oppose the cap and trade legislation approved by the House of Representatives to limit carbon dioxide emissions that some say causes global warning?\State Dem.

3,"Thomas Mitchell\commentary\You remember that old elementary school civics textbook illustration of how a bill becomes law - the rolled up bill with legs and eyes strolls from draft to committee to House and Senate votes, dodging presidential veto and finally gets signed by the president?\Well, forget it.\""Laws"" passed by Congress and signed by the president are not really hard-and-fast rules for behavior, bright lines over which one should not step. No, they are merely suggestions. The rules are written by the bureaucrats in the bowels of assorted government departments and agencies, and even those can be awfully flexible, depending on the whims and vicissitudes of politicians and functionaries.\Take, for example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - ObamaCare in the pejorative. One might presume that in more than 2,000 pages the drafters could've covered just about every conceivable circumstance, but no. The bill states 67 times that the ""secretary shall establish"" this or that procedure or guideline, leaving the gritty details and heavy lifting up to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and her minions.\When ObamaCare passed the House, it contained a Section 1233, which spelled out that Medicare would pay once every five years for a doctor to explain to a covered patient ""the continuum of end-of-life services and supports available, including palliative care and hospice, and benefits for such services and supports that are available under this title.""\When this was slapped with the ""death panel"" label, the section was excised from the final version signed into law by President Obama. \But the Obama administration has, oh so quietly, resurrected it as an annual program.\The final version of the bill did allow yearly physical examinations, but, according to a story first reported by The New York Times this past week, Health and Human Services has drafted rules to cover ""voluntary advance care planning,"" which includes discussion of end-of-life treatment. \The Times even hinted that such bureaucratic end-runs might become the norm.\""While the new law does not mention advance care planning, the Obama administration has been able to achieve its policy goal through the regulation-writing process,"" the newspaper says, ""a strategy that could become more prevalent in the next two years as the president deals with a strengthened Republican opposition in Congress.""\The Times, bemusingly, quoted an e-mail from a congressional supporter of the stealth rebirth.\An early November e-mail from the office of Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., warned, ""This regulation could be modified or reversed, especially if Republican leaders try to use this small provision to perpetuate the 'death panel' myth. ...\""We would ask that you not broadcast this accomplishment out to any of your lists, even if they are 'supporters' - e-mails can too easily be forwarded.""\This is not even the first circumvention of ObamaCare. When a mandate kicked in requiring companies to provide a minimum amount of health insurance coverage, instead of enforcing the written law, HHS instead issued more than 200 waivers to companies, insurers and unions, affecting 1.5 million people.\In addition, HHS has prepared a 136-page rule on how to determine if insurance rate hikes are ""unreasonable"" under ObamaCare. Though the rule says rate hikes should not exceed 10 percent this year, the agency retains the discretion to determine what is unreasonable, leaving insurers at the mercy of the flexible rationale of bureaucrats.\When Congress punted on an effort to pass a law that would impose ""neutrality"" on the Internet, the unelected appointees at the Federal Communications Commission stepped in, even though a federal court said it had no such power. New rules will allow some companies to charge extra for faster delivery of Internet content such as streaming video, but the FCC will require disclosure of such deals and reserve the power to reject them. The criteria are fuzzy, to say the least.\Because the Congress could not find enough votes to pass a carbon dioxide cap-and-trade law, the Environment Protection Agency took it upon itself to set standards for emissions of greenhouse gases, targeting power plants and refineries. That's still vague, too.\Though Congress passed a bill providing sanctions and trade embargoes on countries dealing with or sponsoring terrorists, according to another New York Times story, a division of the Treasury has been busily doling our licenses to companies to circumvent the embargoes for ""humanitarian"" reasons. These include companies that sell cigarettes, chewing gum, weight-loss remedies, sports equipment and Louisiana hot sauce.\How does selling weapons-grade Louisiana hot sauce qualify as ""humanitarian""?\And that, children, is how things really become ""law"" - or at least guidelines so vague no one really can tell when they are in violation until some bureaucrat tells them so.\Thomas Mitchell is senior opinion editor of the Review-Journal.

4,"As the Senate debates a global warming bill this week, will reality finally have a role in the debate?\Only if supporters of radically overhauling our energy policy will admit the actual costs of such an approach.\The Senate takes up legislation this week which is designed to reduce the nation's carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds within 40 years. Central to the 500-page proposal is a ""pollution allowance trading system,"" which essentially creates a system of rationing various sources of energy, and thus increasing prices.\What this will actually do to curtail ""global warming"" remains murky, especially since India and China won't be attending the parade - but that's just a minor detail to left-wing environmentalists, who see an opportunity to use this issue to cripple human advancement.\As debate on the measure approaches, at least a few brave souls - primarily on the Republican side, of course - have been highlighting the fact that this legislation will send energy prices through the roof.\Consumers are already struggling with gasoline approaching $5 a gallon and other utility costs that have been moving steadily higher for the past few years. New mandates placed on producers in the name of ""global warming"" will only make matters worse.\Even those who worship at the church of global warming agree that many Americans might not be eager to cap emissions if they realized the price.\""This debate is going to be mostly about costs,"" Daniel Lashoff, director of the Climate Center at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told The Associated Press. ""But we want to make sure in that debate we don't forget that the cost of inaction on global warming would be much higher than the cost of the emission reductions called for in this bill.""\In fact, Mr. Lashoff knows that this bill will do little - if anything - to actually impact any warming trend. In a paper for the Heritage Foundation, Ben Lieberman notes that ""a number of economists, including many who are far from global warming skeptics, warn of overly aggressive cap and trade measures imposing costs exceeding the benefits. In other words, the costs of implementing such measures would be higher than the value of the global warming damage that they would prevent.""\In reality, this legislation is a Trojan horse that will impose strict federal command-and-control regulations on the economy - for which consumers will pay billions over the coming decades.\""People are looking at this; they're seeing that it's going to do destructive things to energy prices and gasoline prices,"" Andrew Wheeler said, GOP staff director of the Environment and Public Works Committee, told The Washington Post.\Democrats don't appear to have the votes in the Senate to override a Republican filibuster. Let's hope the GOP acts accordingly."
5,"By BENJAMIN SPILLMAN\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\About 100 people turned out Monday morning to protest the National Clean Energy Summit 2.0.\They waved flags and carried homemade signs denouncing everything from carbon cap-and-trade proposals to reform for the nation's health care system to the presidency of Barack Obama in general.\By 10:30 a.m., the protesters were out in full force. Counter-demonstrators chanting in support of Obama and Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., had packed up mostly professionally made signs and headed out of the heat.\The Obama and Reid protesters remained in force on the corner of Swenson Street and Tropicana Avenue near the Thomas & Mack Center on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus, the site of the summit.\""How can you help the environment if you bankrupt the economy that has to do it?"" asked protester Greg Neff, 50, of Sandy Valley.\Neff hoisted a sign that said, ""Don't Tread on Me,"" and chatted with Bill Parson of Moapa, who was there to drum up support to campaign for Reid's U.S. Senate seat.\Because the event was an energy summit, many protesters focused on the proposed cap-and-trade program that would regulate carbon emissions. Reid, who is Senate majority leader, has great influence over the outcome of pending cap-and-trade legislation.\Carbon produced by burning fossil fuels is widely believed to contribute to a gradual rise in the Earth's temperature, which could eventually alter the climate to the point that it becomes less habitable for humans.\But protesters focused on the potential economic fallout of cap-and-trade programs, saying they would make it hard for the nation's economy to recover by making energy too costly.\""I'm a fan of green energy, but put it in place before you destroy what you have,"" Neff said. ""If you don't, you destroy a nation.""\While most of the protesters were friendly while speaking out on issues, some simply flung charges of socialism at Reid and Obama, and at least one small group had a sign that referred to Obama as an ""anti-American Arab.""\Protester Bettye Gilmore of Henderson said it would be unfair to lump all the protesters with fringe activists who attack Obama based on race or to suggest that criticism leveled at Obama is driven by corporate and high-level Republican sources who distribute talking points on the Internet.\Gilmore said her opposition to Obama was over the issues, not his status as the first black president of the United States.\""It is not a racial issue. I think Condoleezza Rice would have made a great president. She is a conservative,"" Gilmore said of the former secretary of state, who is black.\At the summit, speakers including former Vice President Al Gore and current Energy Secretary Steven Chu defended the position that shifting America's energy to non-carbon-producing sources is critical to the long-term health of the economy.\They also said a national-level effort - derided by protesters as socialism or a burdensome tax - is critical to preserving the planet.\""Just what the doctor ordered is a national program to repower America,"" Gore said. ""Sooner or later we are going to have to come to grips with the fact the climate crisis is threatening the future of our civilization.""\Organizers of the demonstrators who backed the energy agenda behind the conference said they counted about 275 supporters on hand. \The group included a woman who was laid off from her job as plumber and whose husband, an ironworker, also was out of work, the organizers said.\They targeted the summit as a demonstration site to show support for the creation of new jobs developing green energy.\""This is really a fantastic opportunity for environmental groups, for labor groups and people looking for jobs,"" said Robert Disney of the Sierra Club, who was with the supporters. ""For folks to be against it, it just doesn't make any sense.""\Contact reporter Benjamin Spillman at bspillman@reviewjournal.com or 702-477-3861."
6,"By JENNIFER ROBISON\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\Monday's National Clean Energy Summit 2.0 will bring a parade of celebrated public policy experts to Las Vegas to discuss greening the country's economy.\But as leaders including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger encourage investments in alternative energy, their policy prescriptions could face serious headwinds from changing public opinions.\Recent surveys show Americans cooling to global warming, and they're even less keen on environmental policies they believe might raise power bills or imperil jobs. Those sentiments could mean a tougher road ahead for elected officials looking to fund investments in renewable power or install a carbon cap-and-trade system.\""Right now, Americans are more concerned about the economy than the environment,"" said Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll. ""The politician who says, 'I'm going to cripple jobs and shut down factories' would be in trouble in this economy.""\what the numbers say\Here's what Gallup found: The number of Americans who say the media have exaggerated global warming jumped to a record 41 percent in 2009, up from 35 percent a year ago. The most marked increase came among political independents, whose ranks of doubters swelled from 33 percent to 44 percent. Republican doubters grew from 59 percent to 66 percent, while Democratic skeptics stayed at around 20 percent.\What's more, fewer Americans believe the effects of global warming have started to occur: 53 percent see signs of a hotter planet, down from 61 percent in 2008. Global warming placed last among eight environmental concerns Gallup asked respondents to rank, with water pollution landing the top spot.\Another recent Gallup study found that, for the first time in 25 years of polling, more Americans care about economic growth than the environment. Just 42 percent of people surveyed said the environment takes precedence over growth, while 51 percent asserted expansion carries more weight. That reverses results from 2008, when 49 percent of respondents said the environment was paramount and 42 percent said economic growth came first. In 1985, the poll's first year, 61 percent placed a bigger priority on the environment, while 28 percent ranked economic growth highest.\All those results indicate trends that pose big challenges for the environmental movement, Gallup's researchers concluded. More pointedly, the findings signal potential trouble for policies designed to curb global warming.\""It's a conundrum. You can't just say to those interested in global warming that they need to do a better job of PR because they have been trying so hard,"" Newport said. ""Al Gore won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. He made a widely seen movie, and his book sold many copies. Yet, with all that, it hasn't worked. You would have to say that, somehow, they're not getting the message across.""\Ask Daniel Weiss, a senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, why increasing numbers of Americans dispute global warming and place the economy ahead of the environment, and he'll say those findings are wrong.\""I don't accept their premise. I think the Gallup Poll is mistaken,"" said Weiss, whose organization will send its chief executive officer, former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, to Monday's clean energy confab. ""I would want to look at their questions to see how they got to this place.""\Weiss pointed to surveys that contradict Gallup's results. A Pew Environmental Group poll found that 77 percent of voters want law-makers to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and 55 percent said efforts to curb global warming will create jobs. Another poll from the National Wildlife Federation found that 55 percent of those polled strongly support a global warming plan that reduces pollution.\But it's not just Gallup that shows flagging concern about global warming. In a July Rasmussen poll, 56 percent said they didn't want to pay higher taxes or utility bills to generate clean energy and fight global warming. A January Pew poll placed global warming last among the top 20 priorities Americans have for 2009. Nos. 1 and 2? The economy and jobs. Even trade policy and lobbyists outranked global warming. And Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think-tank, pointed to a study from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association that showed 58 percent of respondents were unwilling to pay more than they currently pay for electricity to combat climate change.\'a huge amount of skepticism' \Most observers say the economy is behind changing attitudes. \When people face immediate concerns such as job security, more-distant problems fade into the background, Newport said.\Studies show a strong historical correlation between economic prospects and support for environmental causes. When the economy surges, public support for green initiatives rises, said Jerry Taylor, a senior fellow with the free-market advocate Cato Institute.\""We're in the midst of one of the deepest recessions since the Great Depression, and people suspect environmental policies have price tags that are not inconsequential,"" Taylor said.\The public's interest in climate change also rises with extreme weather events, and the nation hasn't seen widespread, catastrophic weather since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Taylor added.\Ebell said he doesn't believe the recession or the weather are eroding public concern about global warming. Rather, he said, publicity over the high cost of green policies in Europe and other regions, as well as indications that those policies haven't yielded results and a 12-year string of stable global temperatures, are changing Americans' minds.\European countries have imposed gasoline taxes of $3 to $4 per gallon to curb consumption, Ebell noted, and the TaxPayers' Alliance in Great Britain estimated that the average British family spends more than $1,200 a year on green charges and levies. Despite such investments, a December report from the United Nations showed that greenhouse gas emissions have grown by almost 10 percent worldwide since 1990, if you control for the emissions-curbing collapse of the Soviet Union and ensuing economic decline in Eastern Europe.\More importantly, said Ebell, the planet's average temperature hasn't risen since 1997, despite a 5 percent gain in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the same period. Twelve years doesn't make for a long-term trend, Ebell said, but every year that goes by with no increase in average temperatures makes it harder to assert the climate is sensitive to carbon dioxide.\""I think there's a huge amount of skepticism among the public. They've heard all these claims, and now they've been informed that there isn't any recent warming,"" Ebell said. ""The public, without having a lot of information about it, is pretty astute. I think the alarmists are having a hard time making the case for global warming simply because reality is against them and the public has figured it out."" (The Competitive Enterprise Institute has taken flak for accepting funding from oil giant ExxonMobil. Ebell said the financing ended several years ago, and the funding source didn't affect the group's policy positions, which were in place before the nonprofit sought the money and have remained intact since the agreement concluded.)\Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., responded that the science showing the greenhouse effect on Earth's climate is solid. He pointed to pictures from Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, which reveal the virtual disappearance of a glacier in the past 35 years.\Weiss added that ignoring the environment carries its own costs: The typical household energy bill has risen $1,100 in the past eight years, even without policies to fight global warming.\""Doing nothing has been very costly,"" he said.\Worse still, agreed Reid and Weiss, eschewing environmental policies hurts the economy. Prominent venture capitalists and executives from Fortune 500 companies such as General Electric say investing in green energy will boost the economy, creating millions of high-tech jobs. Even a policy as simple as retrofitting existing buildings and constructing new buildings according to green standards would bolster the construction sector, as well as reduce waste and pollution, Reid said.\""The country that makes the clean energy technologies of the future is going to be the one that dominates the world economy,"" Weiss said. ""Right now, China, Germany and other economic competitors are ahead of us because we've had eight years of doing nothing. Americans know we must change the way we generate and use energy. The question isn't whether we're going to buy clean energy technologies. The question is whether we're going to buy clean energy technologies made in the United States and marketed overseas, or whether we'll buy them from China and bring them here.""\still some selling to do\Bringing alternative power sources online and reining in greenhouse gases pose upfront costs, though, because the country's energy infra-structure was built around fossil fuels. Congress has appropriated more than $60 billion for clean energy initiatives in the past year, including $11 billion for a national ""smart"" electric grid, $5 billion for making homes more efficient and $2 billion to invest in advanced batteries.\Also, the federal Energy Information Administration released a report Wednesday that tallied up the costs of the American Clean Energy and Security Act, the carbon cap-and-trade bill that passed the House of Representatives in May and goes to the Senate for a vote in the fall. The agency's analysis found that the bill would increase the cost of energy, pare economic output, curb purchasing power and cut $432 billion to $1.9 trillion from the nation's gross domestic product by 2030.\And that's where all those polls showing that Americans aren't certain those costs are worth it might begin to matter. With so many surveys revealing that Americans have little appetite for environmental policies that they think could stall economic growth or pinch consumers' budgets, policymakers still have some selling to do, observers say.\Politicians might just need to work harder at educating the public on why they think green policies are important, Newport said.\Other elected officials could end up changing their stands on those policies because, after all, a politician's biggest goal is to keep his job.\""Some people think politicians vote on the merits of an issue,"" Taylor said. ""There might be one here or there who does that, but they're exceptions to the rule. For the most part, politicians are like businessmen, only they're in the business of earning votes. Virtually everything they do is with an eye on how many votes it will get them. And these sorts of surveys tell politicians that votes for cap-and-trade programs are extremely hazardous to their electoral health.""\Members of Congress who represent blue states and hold leadership positions in their parties will be safer than those who hail from swing states and enjoy less seniority, Taylor predicted.\Reid vowed Friday to continue his push for clean energy policies, saying that a sound and healthy environment is critical to any prosperous economy, and the Gallup numbers show most Americans continue to believe that the seriousness of global warming has been correctly portrayed or even understated.\""We have a duty to all of our children to make sure we don't let temporary difficulties get in the way of making good choices for their future,"" he said.\Summit at unlv to explore clean energy options\The National Clean Energy Summit 2.0 will feature a day's worth of discussions on how to build a clean energy economy.\In addition to former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, public officials including Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis will participate.\Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the forum will focus on creating jobs through investments in green power.\The event begins at 10 a.m. inside the Cox Pavilion on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

Before all the talk turned to the economic crisis, the energy crisis had our attention.
\
Remember rising electricity prices, global warming, stranded polar bears?
\
Here's a breakdown of the presidential contenders' energy policies, and how they might affect the environment and Nevadans' wallets.
\
Nuclear power
\
The main thrust of John McCain's energy policy is a call for 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030.
\
Although the plants produce no carbon emissions, making them an attractive power source in a carbon-constrained world, there are serious environmental and safety concerns with uranium mining and disposal of nuclear waste.
\
Barack Obama has said there must be solutions to the waste storage and safety problems before he would support new nuclear power plants.
\
Nevada is unlikely to see a nuclear plant built within its borders even if McCain is elected because the plants require large amounts of water. Still, local environmentalists are concerned that more nuclear plants mean more radioactive waste, which could wind up dumped at Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
\
McCain supports the Yucca project; Obama has said he would kill plans for a repository there.
\
There are also concerns about the cost of nuclear plants, which would receive billions in federal subsidies under McCain's plan.
\
""The real concern with nuclear power is it's so expensive,"" said Lydia Ball, a local representative of the Sierra Club.
\
Coal-fired power
\
Both candidates advocate researching how to capture the carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, because experts say coal will continue to provide a significant amount of the nation's electricity. Fifty percent of America's electric power comes from coal.
\
There are three coal-fired power plants in various stages of the approval process in Nevada, but environmentalists shouldn't expect the next president to step in to stop those plants, according to William Becker, executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project.
\
""They're going to wait and see. New coal plants have been on the decline in the last year or so -- not because of any federal action, but because of the price of coal, how (plants) will be affected by carbon pricing, by lawsuits, by states' refusal to issue permits,"" Becker said.
\
Still, it's the federal legislation putting a price tag on carbon emissions, which both candidates support, that would have the greatest effect on the price of energy from new coal plants and be most likely to stall plans for more.
\
Renewable energy
\
Both candidates say they support renewable energy, although environmentalists question McCain's dedication to the technology.
\
""McCain used to be one of the few Republican voices .. calling for action on global warming,"" said Anna Aurilio, director of Environment America's Washington office But she says McCain skipped out on many important environmental votes from June 2005 to February 2008, earning him a 27 percent grade to Obama's 86 percent from the environmental group.
\
And his choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate -- and possible point-person on energy -- hasn't helped him in environmentalists' eyes.
\
""McCain putting Palin in charge is not going to lead us to the kind of clean energy policies we need,"" Aurilio said.
\
Among McCain's promises are a $5,000 tax credit to consumers who buy zero-emissions cars (which are not now available in the market); a $300 million prize to the inventor of a better battery for plug-in hybrids or electric cars; and a tax rebate equal to 10 percent of what companies spend on wages for employees doing research and development.
\
What he hasn't called for, and what environmentalists and renewable energy industry insiders say will be the real driver of clean energy development, is a requirement that the nation get a percentage of its energy from renewable sources, such as wind or solar power plants. Obama has called for 10 percent of America's energy to come from renewable sources by 2012. Last year, less than 1 percent of the nation's power came from solar, geothermal and wind combined.
\
Nevada business leaders and politicians of both parties have said the state could benefit from a strong national standard for renewable energy, because it has rich solar and geothermal resources and could export clean energy to power-hungry Southern California.
\
Obama is also calling for $15 billion in federal funding for renewable research and development.
\
Carbon caps
\
Both candidates favor setting a national cap on the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, but they differ on how low that cap should be and how to trim emissions to reach it.
\
McCain wants to cut carbon emissions to their level in 1990, or by 40 percent from today's level, by 2020. By 2050 his plan would cut emissions by an additional 60 percent from 1990 levels.
\
Obama's caps are initially on par with McCain's, but over the longer term they are more aggressive. Obama would cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, but then by an additional 80 percent by 2050.
\
Climate scientists have agreed that emissions must be trimmed to the levels Obama is calling for to prevent the most severe effects of climate change, although some scientists now say even that might be too little.
\
'Trade' in cap and trade
\
A cap and trade system would set a carbon emissions limit that would grow more strict each year. The government would distribute pollution permits, and as the cap becomes more strict it would create a market for those permits. Power plants, factories and other businesses that emit carbon could either spend money installing pollution control devices to meet the cap, or buy pollution permits from other companies that have gone below it. Companies that cut their pollution to get it below the cap could sell their permits for the difference to other emitters.
\
The candidates differ, however, on how to regulate the market for these pollution permits.
\
McCain wants to give away at least a portion of the permits, called allowances. He would auction the rest.
\
Obama wants to auction 100 percent of the permits.
\
In either case, the system is likely to be incredibly complicated -- with the price of permits and the cost of all kinds of energy varying based on everything from whether the utility where you live is regulated (as in Nevada) to what kind of fuel the utility uses to generate its electricity.
\
Utilities such as NV Energy that get the majority of their power from fossil-fuel-burning coal and natural gas plants would pay more; utilities generating hydroelectric or nuclear
\
power would pay less.
\
Michael Yackira, president of NV Energy, said the rules that govern a cap and trade system will also matter more to utilities that serve growing populations such as that of Las Vegas, because their carbon emissions are growing, too.
\
NV Energy also buys a portion of the energy it sells to customers from the energy market. That electricity will certainly be more expensive under a cap and trade system.
\
Yackira said his company favors at least a partial giveaway of allocations, because an auction would push up energy prices in Nevada.
\
""An auction is the equivalent of a tax,"" Yackira said.
\
The candidates also disagree over what to do with the revenue from auctions.
\
McCain would spend the money from the auction portion of his plan on research and development of clean energy technology and energy assistance for the poor.
\
Estimates are that Obama's 100 percent auction program would bring in $100 billion to $200 billion, and he says he would spend $15 billion of that on research and development. The rest would go back to taxpayers and to fund energy assistance programs.

WASHINGTON -- As Congress begins to turn its attention to climate change legislation, the debate has shifted from a conversation about saving the planet to one about protecting your wallet.
\
Opponents have mounted a fierce campaign based on a startling factoid: Cap-and-trade legislation could cost the average U.S. household $3,100 a year.
\
Nevada Republican Sen. John Ensign used this argument during a speech this week on the Senate floor.
\
It's effective. No one wants to pay that much in higher utility bills and higher prices for ordinary items because of rising energy costs.
\
Ensign argues that if Congress imposes cap-and-trade legislation, President Barack Obama will effectively break his promise of no new taxes on families making $250,000 a year or less.
\
There's just one problem: It's not exactly true.
\
In fact, a growing body of literature is being developed around how climate change legislation would affect your pocketbook. Here is a snapshot of the findings:
\
Yes, electricity costs will rise if Congress passes climate change legislation. The nation will have to pay to shift the
\
economy from one based on fossil fuels to one based on green energy sources that are still emerging as industries.
\
Economists, though, say the costs per household would be far lower than Ensign claims. In fact, the costs would drop even further after factoring in expected government rebates or subsidies.
\
Those lower estimates do not account for the high price of doing nothing, which would include higher energy costs as well as the migration, security and other costs associated with a warming planet.
\
One Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist essentially scolded Republicans this week for misusing his report to arrive at the $3,100 figure.
\
John Reilly, associate director of research at the university's Joint Program on Global Change and a co-author of the study, said the actual cost per household would be about one-tenth, or $340 annually. He assumes revenue raised through a cap-and-trade system would be shared with consumers.
\
Here's how cap-and-trade works: The government would essentially set a limit on carbon emissions and require companies that pollute beyond that level to obtain an allowance. If the government decides to charge companies that receive those allowances, estimates are that the cap-and-trade system would generate as much as $640 billion annually in revenue. Obama and leading Democrats have indicated that some of that money should be used to help consumers pay their bills.
\
But even before any government rebate, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office testified last month that the annual cost for middle-income households would be $1,600 a year. The CBO was clear that its estimate did not count additional economic benefits consumers could see from climate change legislation.
\
Supporters of climate change legislation insist any consumer costs would be offset by government rebates or subsidies, especially for low-income households. The draft cap-and-trade bill introduced this week by House Democrats includes a section titled ""Consumer Assistance"" -- a placeholder for an offset plan to come.
\
""I know people are in an uproar: It's going to cost so much, it's going to cost so much,"" said Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley, who has long pushed for green energy and now sits on the Ways and Means Committee, which is writing climate change tax policy.
\
""We're working on that right now. They're going to experience an increase in the cost of energy. There will be subsidies available.""
\
Berkley becomes furious, though, when the debate turns to consumer costs. She points to the hidden costs of business as usual -- asthma-related air pollution, national security threats and a nuclear waste dump planned for Yucca Mountain.
\
""Just a few months ago we were paying $4 a gallon for gas,"" Berkley said. ""How long do we have to depend on oil and other fossil fuels? There has got to be a long-term and serious commitment to planning, to creating an energy policy for this nation's future.""
\
Climate change legislation is poised to become a signature issue of the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress.
\
Obama has pledged to reduce greenhouse gases and increase renewable energy production as part of a massive shift in national energy policy that has been debated since the Carter administration. President Ronald Reagan famously removed solar panels his predecessor installed at the White House.
\
Hopes are high that Congress will pass legislation in time for a December international conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, where participants are expected to draft what is billed as the next Kyoto accord -- a global commitment to reduce emissions causing climate change.
\
But revamping national energy policy will not come without a fight, especially from the traditional industries that have powered the nation for decades. Lawmakers from both major parties, especially those from states where coal, oil and gas companies are concentrated, have raised red flags.
\
Opponents have targeted pocketbook costs as a linchpin of their criticism.
\
A full-page advertisement by the oil and gas industry in Thursday's Washington Post was headlined ""New Energy Taxes."" It continued, ""With our economy in crisis, this is no time to burden Americans with massive new energy costs.""
\
Ensign, as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the Senate, convened a hearing Monday to investigate the ""National Energy Tax in Obama's Budget.""
\
Ensign cited the $3,100 figure -- what he calls ""the national sales tax on energy"" -- during a Senate floor speech Wednesday.
\
He reminded that Obama promised not to raise taxes on individuals making up to $200,000 and families making up to $250,000, and pledged to hold the president accountable.
\
""Families were promised no tax increases and they don't care whether those tax increases come directly or indirectly,"" Ensign said. ""I repeat, 'Not one single dime,'"" Ensign said, reiterating the president's pledge.
\
Yet even an economist invited to testify at Ensign's hearing said the $3,100 struck her as high.
\
Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, put the average annual household price closer to $600 (in 2003 dollars). Her figures are on par with past estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
\
Mathur was more skeptical, however, that consumers would be guaranteed some sort of offset to limit the hit to the pocketbook. Already, potential revenue raised from selling pollution permits in the proposed cap-and-trade system are being eyed for other uses -- namely to fund health care.
\
""Even if they refund the money, we don't know how much they will give back,"" she said. ""There's already a lot of demand on that money.""
\
Supporters of climate change legislation predict consumers will save money with a more efficient energy system that does not depend on coal or the vagaries of foreign oil prices, which drive up consumer gas bills and add transportation costs to the price of virtually all goods.
\
The Union of Concerned Scientists cites studies showing that gross domestic product would fall by less than 1 percent with climate change legislation, while the costs of climate change could account for more than 3 percent of GDP in years to come.
\
They see the cost issue being raised as a roadblock to legislation -- a way to thwart the president's agenda and protect the energy and manufacturing industries that have been home-state staples but would now face the enormous challenge of operating in a changed environment.
\
Liz Perera at Union of Concerned Scientists said energy prices will continue to rise in response to growing demand if nothing is done to find new energy sources.
\
""The reality is, there's no one to help consumers now,"" she said.

10,"By JENNIFER ROBISON\LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL\Political issues are a hot topic in this election year, and businesspeople responding to a recent Review-Journal poll have plenty to say about today's biggest issues.\From health-insurance reform to balancing the state budget - and on almost every issue in between - the nearly 100 professionals who responded to an online survey from November to January offered strong advice to the state's and nation's leaders.\Here are a few key areas they're watching closely:\reducing joblessness\Opinion is mixed on whether the Obama administration has done enough to boost job formation.\Just 32.5 percent of participants think Washington has taken the right measures on the jobs front. A plurality of respondents - 47 percent - disapproved of federal actions on employment, while the rest were uncertain about whether President Barack Obama's policies have cut joblessness.\Doug Ansell, chief executive officer of local incorporation-software company Inenvi, wrote that federal stimulus proposals have had ""no effect whatsoever unless you are a bank or a carmaker.""\He elaborated in an interview on what he said businesses really need: payroll tax relief. Obama's recent proposal to grant $5,000 tax credits to businesses that hire in 2010 isn't timely enough to make a difference, Ansell said.\""Small businesses don't need a credit on their next tax return. They need money now,"" he said. ""(Obama) didn't go to the banks and say, 'We'll give you a credit on your next return.' He infused cash into them.""\For others, Obama's jobs record is poor because he's taken too many cues from Republicans.\The Obama administration ""has not been nearly reactive enough,"" wrote Rex Harold. ""Highly disappointed that he used all of his drive to get elected and had nothing left to be creative and fight off the opposition. He's let the GOP members and soothsayers intimidate him into playing their game. So disappointing.""\Uwe Rockenfeller of Rocky Research, a Boulder City energy consulting firm, at least gave the Obama administration credit for good intentions.\But ""there is much less the government actually can do than people think,"" he wrote. ""This administration had their heart in the right place, but the execution, especially in the energy field, left much to be desired.""\Thanks to bureaucratic hurdles, federal stimulus efforts can take a year or more to translate into projects, Rockenfeller added.\health reform\The Review-Journal's survey showed widespread support for health care reform, with 68.7 percent calling for change. But if most respondents agreed that the system needs modifications, they differed widely on what fixes they'd like to see.\Marla Letizia, chief executive officer of local mobile-billboard company Letizia Big Traffic Media, wrote that ""a healthy country is good for all of us.""\""I do not know how the richest country in the world could have 20 percent of its population unable to attain health care,"" Letizia answered. ""A healthy country is good for all of us.""\Letizia was also among the 67.5 percent of participants who said they'd like to see a government-run insurance option for the uninsured.\""One thing I know as an employer is, the better the benefits, the better quality employees you get,"" she said in a follow-up interview. ""Health care is a very important issue for everybody. When I had young children, the No. 1 thing for me was, did we have the best insurance we could possibly have at our company? I want to see quality health care for everyone who crosses my path as an employer.""\Rockenfeller called a public option a necessary part of the free market when human needs such as health care, disaster relief and national defense are involved. But any such option must openly and fairly account for its costs, he added, and it can't be subsidized to give it the appearance of lower costs.\""Competition with the free market needs to be fair and equitable,"" he wrote.\Bob Forbuss, president of government-relations consulting firm Strategic Alliances and former chairman of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, called reform an economic necessity. Health care is ""profoundly broken and is financially breaking America,"" he wrote.\""Health care must become preventive care and focus on making people healthy,"" he added. ""Currently, the incentives do not promote positive outcomes, only incomes for drug companies, insurance companies, lawyers and of course doctors.""\Other respondents lamented existing reform plans for what the government intrusion and loss of personal liberties they believed the bills would yield. Still others pointed to existing federal programs as evidence that the government should be less involved in health care.\""The waste that can be observed in Medicare and Medicaid is inexcusable,"" wrote Tyler Jones, owner of homebuilder Blue Heron Living. ""Mandating that the federal government must directly provide health care for tens of millions of additional Americas will further drive up the cost of health care for everyone. (Reform) could be accomplished much more efficiently through incentivizing the private sector.""\And Mark Brown, founder and chief executive officer of Internet poker and live table game company Zen Gaming, said he was concerned mostly about the cost of current reform bills.\""It will swell beyond the numbers the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) is predicting,"" he wrote.\cap and trade\Survey participants were less enthusiastic about another major congressional initiative: cap-and-trade legislation. Such laws would allow the federal government to limit companies' abilities to emit the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.\Less than half of respondents - 41 percent - voiced full support for cap and trade. The remainder either opposed it or wanted to see how much such legislation would cost.\Michael Beardslee, a principal of IT Strategies International Corp., wrote that the taxes for and costs of cap and trade would be ""outrageous,"" especially considering the nation's existing debt.\Worse yet, the timing of cap-and-trade legislation couldn't be worse, Ansell added.\""A recession-borderline-depression is not the time to destimulate business even further with talk of cap and trade. It's just another way to impose a tax,"" he said.\Harold responded that cap and trade would make money available for disasters and serious health conditions that come from pollution, but it should only be a stopgap measure on the way to a mandated schedule for reducing carbon emissions.\""There should be expensive consequences to American oil companies destroying other countries' environment, namely those in the Amazon basin,"" he wrote.\the big races\If the Review-Journal's survey is any indication, two candidates named Reid will win their November elections.\Though several recent Review-Journal polls have shown Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., with low approval ratings, respondents to the paper's business survey gave him the overwhelming nod, with 62.7 percent of participants naming him as their preference for the office.\Rockenfeller expressed Reid supporters' prevailing sentiment, noting that having the senator as the majority leader is invaluable to Nevadans - even Republican and independent Nevadans.\And Reid's son, Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid, topped all other comers in the governor's race.\The poll was conducted before Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said he officially wouldn't run for governor. Goodman claimed 18.1 percent of the vote.\Incumbent Gov. Jim Gibbons proved least popular in the survey, with his 4.8 percent edging out only ""not sure"" (3.6 percent) as an option. Respondents alternately referred to Gibbons as a ""buffoon"" and an ""idiot,"" and that's just the stuff we can print in the newspaper.\Letizia wouldn't wade into the fray over Reid's senate seat, saying she hadn't made up her mind on the race yet. But she heartily endorsed Rory Reid for governor.\""He's done an outstanding job on the commission,"" she said. ""He's funny, he's sincere, he's extremely bright, and he's a lifelong Nevadan. What more could you want?""\Letizia, whose company has appeared in hearings before the county commission, said Reid has been ""more than fair and more than willing to listen.""\Ansell, at least, offered a shout-out to the beleaguered Gibbons. The governor is perhaps the only politician Ansell can remember who actually did what he said he'd do - in this case, propose a balanced budget and oppose tax increases.\Ansell said he's met Gibbons a few times, and he acknowledged that the governor ""never came across as a dynamic individual.""\""But I've never seen a politician get such a load of strife for keeping his campaign promise. Unreal,"" he said.\legislative priorities\Balancing the state budget ranked as the top issue poll respondents wanted to see the Legislature tackle. State lawmakers won't convene for their next regular session until early 2011, but legislators will meet beginning Feb. 23 for a special session to grapple with Nevada's $881 million budget shortfall.\Ansell chose balancing the budget as his key preference. He likened the state's finances to household economics, noting that families in debt have to gain control of their finances and ""stop the bleeding"" before they even think about additional expenditures.\""The idea of doing anything ahead of balancing the budget is insane,"" he said. ""We are out of money. We've finally hit the wall.""\Forbuss listed economic diversification as his top pick. Without the addition of quality jobs paying $20 or more per hour, Nevada will never return to its economic heyday, he wrote. Tourism will rebound, but only slowly, and with less spending from consumers. State leaders should head to California and troll for businesses ""that are being taxed to death,"" he said.\Education came in a distant third for priorities businesspeople want addressed.\A focus on education will help the state overcome its long-term economic challenges, said Letizia, who served on the board of the private Meadows School in Summerlin for 18 years.\""It is absolutely clear that education in this state is inferior to education in the rest of this country and certainly the rest of the world,"" she said. ""If we want to grow our state and keep good people in this state, we need to have an educational system. Education is the most important thing we can give our children, and this state has violated that responsibility.""\Contact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512."

\
Going green has never been more popular. Shop at a department store, get a reusable tote bag. Channel surf and see celebrities greening their mansions. Take a summer vacation, make it energy efficient.
\
But for politicians, greening their environmental record can be a trickier feat.
\
Case in point:
\
Republican Rep. Jon Porter wants to turn the nation's rental car fleet green. Trade in every tourist Taurus for a Prius on the Strip and suddenly you've halved the amount of greenhouse gases emitted each year.
\
In Las Vegas, with all the visitors, the effect could be significant.
\
Except that these days, Porter's idea may not get much airtime in the face of more dramatic efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
\
Congress is gearing up for its first major debate on global warming legislation this summer. On its plate: whether to require that industries cap their carbon emissions and pay for any pollution above those levels. This would please the environmental movement, for which putting a price tag on pollution is the holy grail.
\
Critics worry such a ""cap-and-trade"" system for carbon emissions would drive up the costs of fuel and electricity. At a time of record-shattering gas prices, politicians are loath to take such steps, even for a greener planet. Yet scientists and economists worldwide believe such restrictions are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in time to halt global warming.
\
Bills such as the one Porter is considering are helpful steps, environmentalists say, but their eye is on the prize.
\
Tim Greeff, deputy legislative director at the League of Conservation Voters, said dramatic legislation is needed. Greening the rental car fleet ""is helpful as long as it's in addition to, and not in lieu of, a cap-and-trade bill.""
\
After years of disputing or ignoring global warming, Republicans are slowly beginning to shift their attitudes to catch up with popular opinion.
\
President Bush uttered the words ""climate change"" in his State of the Union speech for the first time in 2007, and last month said he shares concerns about ""the effect of climate change on our environment.""
\
And the party's presumed presidential nominee, Republican Sen. John McCain, has vowed to address global warming as a pri
\
ority. He co-authored an earlier version of the cap-and-trade bill and told voters last year on the campaign trail, ""Climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution.""
\
Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley said shifting the debate toward legislation that would mandate limits on greenhouse gases ""is where the United States Congress should be moving.""
\
""The American people are light years ahead of their politicians,"" said Berkley, who supports a cap-and-trade bill. ""The Republican Congress and this president -- this oil and gas man president -- is fiddling like Nero when Rome burns.""
\
Porter's environmental record has been getting greener since Democrats took control of Congress, much as the rest of his legislative record shows a more moderate shift since he barely won reelection in 2006 in his suburban Henderson district.
\
Porter broke with his party last year to support a resolution saying Congress should begin to enact a system to halt global warming. And he backed a Democratic attempt to require utility companies to get power from wind, solar or other green sources. (It failed.)
\
He earned an environmental score of 30 (out of 100) last year from Greeff's group, up from zero just two years earlier, when he refused to back higher automotive fuel efficiency standards and supported the Republican plan to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
\
Porter is faced with balancing the pop cultural shift toward environmentally friendly policies with the conservative streak that runs through Nevada politics. Even Democrats in this state are not necessarily tree huggers. Republican Rep. Dean Heller took an informal poll last year in his mostly rural Northern Nevada district showing 82 percent oppose paying higher prices at the pump to combat global warming.
\
Porter faces a tough reelection again this fall in a district that was once more politically split, but now has 20,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. In 2006, he won by fewer than 4,000 votes. His race just intensified now that state Sen. Dina Titus announced her intention to challenge him. She won the district when she ran for governor in 2006.
\
Porter's spokesman said the congressman ""applauds Senator McCain's elevation of climate change on the campaign trail,"" saying the presidential contender has tapped into ""what many voters are talking about in Nevada.""
\
But whether Porter will support a cap-and-trade bill this summer remains uncertain.
\
Republicans point to the increased costs that could come from limiting greenhouse gases -- as much as $1,300 per family by 2015 according to reports compiled by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Other studies cite similar price spikes.
\
Heller has repeatedly said he is opposed to tax increases to go green.
\
Republican Sen. John Ensign said Congress should capitalize on the possibility that global warming exists to turn the nation toward greener energy sources.
\
But as to whether climate change is the dire problem environmentalists make it out to be, the former veterinarian said, ""One thing I learned about being trained in the sciences is, you question everything. When I was growing up the greenhouse gases were going to lead to an ice age. You continue always to question.""
\
Porter is weighing his views on a cap-and-trade bill. ""He's concerned about the costs and what sort of impact it would have on economic growth and domestic energy costs,"" his spokesman said. ""The congressman has always recognized that climate change is an issue, but at the same time he has supported a diversified domestic energy policy.""
\
In the meantime, he'll continue working on his legislation that would give tax breaks to rental car companies that add hybrids or other green cars to their fleets.
\
Brendan Bell at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington said the legislation Porter is forming is a positive step. ""It's something we would applaud.""
\
""But every vote comes in context of your overall record,"" Bell said. ""We're looking for leadership. We're looking for people to solve the fundamental problem, which is climate change.""

12,"
Proposals to build coal-fired power plants have brought the debate over global climate change home to Nevadans. Coal provides half the nation's electricity, and a fifth of Nevada's power, but many people think it's time to break our reliance on the shiny black rock and start using the sun, wind and heat of the Earth for a new generation of power plants.
\
Environmentalists say pollution from coal plants will make people sick, ruin the air and harm plants and animals.
\
Power plant developers say they're necessary to keep Las Vegas homes and casinos cool and bright, and that renewable energy can't meet growing power demand in the Southwest without sending power bills through the roof.
\
But opponents of the plants, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid among them, say utilities are gambling with ratepayers' money. The price of Sierra Pacific Resources' proposed plant near Ely has swelled to $5 billion over the past two years. With Congress poised to levy taxes on every ton of carbon dioxide emitted by power plants, this cheap fuel might not end up being so cheap after all.
\
Despite protests by Nevadans who live near the proposed plants, their developers are pushing forward with plans for two coal-fired plants outside Ely, in White Pine County. One would generate 1,500 megawatts and the other 1,590. A 750-megawatt plant is planned for the Mesquite area of northern Clark County. The three plants would power 2.8 million single-family homes, producing more than 30 million tons per year of greenhouse gases.
\
The Sun invited four experts to come to our
\
office and discuss these plans. Two favored the plants, two opposed them. None of the four had ever sat down together.
\
We asked a few questions but mostly let them talk among themselves. What followed was one of the Sun's most contentious Sunday Conversations, with a little shouting and a few mild insults. After the camera stopped rolling, they argued on for 20 minutes.
\
What role should coal play in Nevada's energy future, and how will that role affect consumers, human health and the environment?
\
Tim Hay: Nevada has a plethora of renewable resources. As the cost of fossil fuels increases, the cost of most of the renewable fuels -- primarily geothermal in the north, some wind in the north and solar in the south -- will decrease. Nevada doesn't need coal power the way other states do.
\
Roberto Denis: If we're talking about resources within the state, we do not have nuclear power, we do not have any hydro. Nevada is the poor cousin in the West with regards to the amount of coal power that it has. Utah, for example, gets more than 90 percent of its electricity from coal. We have about 20 percent coal. We have a bounty of renewables to tap, but even that is not sufficient. And since 2004 we will have added 3,800 megawatts of gas-fired power. (A megawatt is enough power for about 750 single-family homes.)
\
Lydia Ball: Nevada does not have coal supplies. So not only will we spend money on these increasingly expensive coal plants, but we are also going to be spending money on the shipment of coal to Nevada.
\
Denis: Nevada does not have gas either, but gets 70 percent of its electricity from that fuel.
\
Joe Lucas: Nevada is unique. Energy demand across the country is doubling about every 15 years. It's doubling every six or seven years in Nevada. It's the fastest growing state in the nation, and because of that Nevada is best served by keeping all the energy options on the table -- coal, wind, gas, geothermal -- because it is not going to be able to meet the growing demand for electricity even if Nevadans become more energy efficient. Coal must be part of the mix. If not, the demand for reliable electricity will not be met.
\
Ball: We have 1,500 megawatts of geothermal potential in Northern Nevada. Why aren't we actively looking at that and spending the $5 billion Sierra Pacific Resources plans to spend building a new power plant near Ely on cultivating geothermal? It meets your criteria for base power, for 24-hour power.
\
Denis: If we could spend the $5 billion today, and satisfy the needs of the state with renewable energy, that is exactly what we would do. It will take a decade or more to develop 1,500 megawatts of geothermal.
\
Ball: Your coal plant is not going to be operating now until about 2015.
\
Lucas: This is not about one energy resource or another. This is about having the right mix. Building a coal plant today doesn't mean we won't develop renewables.
\
Ball: We, too, are advocating balanced energy choices. Only we would like that balance to include more renewables. The state law requiring Sierra Pacific Resources to generate 20 percent of its power from renewables by 2015 should be a floor, not a ceiling. Every presentation I've seen from Sierra Pacific Resources only puts that at 20 percent. That's your goal. Why isn't it higher?
\
Denis: Our CEO has said that's a floor, not a ceiling. However, we have to be realistic about how long it takes to develop geothermal. Our blessing in this state is geothermal, not solar, not wind. Geothermal has steady output and a low cost relative to the other technologies. And, indeed, we should be tapping that. We have a 3,000-megawatt deficit between the current demand and the power generation we own. And the demand is growing by 250 megawatts a year.
\
Ball: We also have public health issues. There are 140,000 people in the state of Nevada who have asthma, 26,000 of them children. Coal plants exacerbate respiratory problems.
\
Lucas: Over the last 30 years the incidents of childhood asthma have skyrocketed, while emissions from coal-based power plants have dropped. Air quality is affected by a lot of different things. You're implying that people walk around with an air mask on that's connected to the top of a power plant.
\
Ball: According to the American Lung Association, there are 28,000 deaths per year from power plant pollution.
\
Lucas: The American Lung Association also says outdoor air quality is 100 times better than indoor air quality and today children spend much more time inside than they do outside.
\
Denis: If you objectively look at our plans, we are going to build the 1,500-megawatt Ely Energy Center and we're going to shut down 300 megawatts of facilities at Reid Gardner. Those three facilities, the 300 megawatts at Reid Gardner, are 20 percent the size and emit more regulated pollutants than Ely will. So aren't we cleaning up the air by doing that?
\
Ball: We can do more. There are other ways of meeting our energy demand.
\
Denis: Our strategy is to do as much energy efficiency and conservation as possible. The cleanest kilowatt is the kilowatt that's never produced. The second leg of the strategy is to either purchase or invest in renewables. Then the last is conventional fuels. We use a significant amount of gas already. It's not an issue of wanting to do renewables, it's an issue of reliability. Because renewables are all capital investment, on which we earn a profit, we stand to profit more from renewables. The issue is, can we do it fast enough to keep the lights on?
\
Ball: But if you start now ..
\
Denis:We have started now. Just because we build these gas plants now and we build this coal plant now, they don't displace renewables. By the time we build those plants a lot of the existing plants are going to be taken out of service. What's going to replace those? Renewables are going to be a big part of our future. It cannot be done within the time frame that we need the power to keep the lights and the economy in this state going.
\
Hay: And what's the time frame for the Ely Energy Center?
\
Denis: Currently we have filed with the Public Utilities Commission for 2015, 2016.
\
Hay: And what will coal cost when that plant comes on line?
\
Denis: We haven't finalized those plans. We won't file final numbers with the commission until early 2010.
\
Hay: Peabody and other coal companies anticipate coal prices will rise 70 to 100 percent over the next couple of years. Your own estimates for the cost of the plant have gone from $3 billion two years ago to $3.8 billion a year ago to now more than $5 billion if construction were to begin today.
\
Lucas: There's a study done by the Cambridge Energy Research Associates out of Boston. They looked at the cost of building all new generation and found that because steel, cement and other things have gone up in price, the cost of big capital expenditures like power plants (has) gone up. The cost of building new nuclear went up the most. Surprisingly, the cost of building new wind went up the second most, new gas third and coal was actually at the low end, so all boats have risen with the rising sea. Obviously there has been some uptick over the years in coal prices. But if you look at coal historically, the cost of coal has been infinitesimal compared to the cost of other fuels, principally natural gas and oil, and is much less volatile.
\
Ball: You shouldn't be comparing it to natural gas and oil, you should be comparing it to renewables, the fuel for which is free.
\
Denis: What we really should be concerned about is: What's going to happen to the consumer? Because we're saying: If the cost of coal goes up and if we have a tax on emissions, then renewables are going to be cheaper in comparison.
\
Hay: Geothermal is one of your cheapest resources, cheaper than coal. Geothermal plants are isolated from fuel price volatility. So whatever that capital cost is, that's going to set the ceiling for what the power is going to cost. Wind power has declined in cost 80 percent over the last 20 years. Solar-thermal plants, like 64-megawatt Nevada Solar One in Boulder City, are enjoying a resurgence here, and they provide power at peak usage times, which is very valuable to a company like Nevada Power.
\
Denis: Do you think that the first gold that was mined in Nevada was cheaper to mine than the gold that is being mined today? The first geothermal finds are easier to find than the last.
\
Hay: The price of coal is going to go up, and the cost of your proposed coal plant has gone up $1.5 billion in the last two years.
\
Ball: Joe, you have an advertising campaign about clean coal. You're spending millions of dollars educating Nevadans, but the plants you're promoting wouldn't really be clean coal plants. A clean coal plant, at least in my definition, would remove the carbon dioxide from emissions and store it underground.
\
Lucas: That's your definition of clean. That may not be everyone else's definition.
\
Ball: Then can you define clean? Because the three companies planning coal plants in Nevada have signed agreements with the state that they will install carbon capture and storage technology when it is commercially viable. When and if that happens, with the emphasis on the if, who's going to pay for it and how much is it going to cost?
\
Lucas: It's an evolutionary process. Do you agree that the use of coal for generating electricity today is cleaner than it was 30 years ago?
\
Ball: I don't necessarily agree. It depends on whether you're talking about carbon or regulated pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and mercury.
\
Lucas: We decreased regulated pollutants and made the fleet 70 percent cleaner on average.
\
Ball: We can thank the federal government and the Clean Air Act for that. I don't think the utility industry can claim they did that voluntarily, and it has constantly broken the Clean Air Act.
\
Lucas: The industry has invested $100 billion to reduce emissions. Clean coal is an industry term that means using advanced technologies to improve the environmental performance of coal-fired power plants. They are cleaner today than they were 30 years ago, and they will be cleaner 30 years from now than they are today, including the capture and storage of greenhouse gas emissions. We are at 90 percent removal of sulfur dioxide today.
\
Denis: We have proposed 98 percent removal of sulfur dioxide at Ely.
\
Lucas: Coal is a cleaner energy resource today and will be used in Nevada and in the United States and around the world for decades to come. We're investing in the technology to make it cleaner. But coal can't meet your standard of clean.
\
Denis: We have this tremendous need in this state. The Southwest U.S., the area from which we can buy power, will have a shortfall in power supply in 2011, three years from now. Do you support our using gas? I'm trying to get to the bottom line of the Sierra Club agenda.
\
Ball: I think that a natural gas plant can be a bridge to meet demand because it has lower emissions, but we shouldn't plan to meet our future energy demands with gas or coal.
\
Denis: I am trying to get at whether the Sierra Club just has an anti-growth agenda and not really a clean agenda or a clean air agenda.
\
Ball: We are very supportive of a growth agenda in a new, clean energy economy. We have a study that 3,000 jobs could be created in the state of Nevada today if we were meeting our 20 percent renewable standard. And these are good jobs, these are not just janitor jobs at a coal plant in Ely.
\
Denis: But what's the cost?
\
Ball: What's the cost of installing carbon capture and storage on new coal plants, as you have told the state you will?
\
Denis: We will install the technology if the commission determines that it is commercially viable and cost-effective.
\
Ball: But what is the cost of that? Recent studies have shown that we don't have anywhere to store that in Nevada. So they're going to have to pipe it out? How much is that going to cost?
\
Lucas: Do you know how to drive down the cost of all these new technologies? If we go back and do what we did in the early '80s, when we first introduced the term clean coal: invest in the public-private partnership between the federal government and industry to drive down the cost of developing these technologies. Do you support increasing funding for advanced clean coal technology projects through the federal government?
\
Ball: I support increased research, but I will not support building a coal plant in Nevada where there is so much potential for renewables.
\
Hay: Do you know the relative dollar amounts for solar, wind and geothermal compared to clean coal research?
\
Lucas: If we got 20 percent of our power from new energy resources and 80 percent from another, just to be simplistic, should we spend 80 percent of our research dollars on that fuel we're using 20 percent of the time, or should we spend 80 percent of our dollars on the fuel that we use 80 percent of the time? There needs to be a balanced portfolio and the portfolio needs to be based upon how we are going to be using those fuels. With renewables, you don't have the government and the industry partnering together as with coal research and development projects, where 50 percent of funding is from the government and at least 50 percent is from private industry. You don't have that with renewable projects. It is a 100 percent government subsidy.
\
Hay: But do you know the relative dollar amounts? Probably 100 to 1.
\
There are three coal plants proposed in Nevada right now. Do we need three coal plants?
\
Ball: We don't need even one of those coal plants. There are other ways to meet the energy demand.
\
Denis: We proposed the Ely Energy Center. We serve over 90 percent of the electrical load in this state. Two other coal plant proponents say their facilities are the ones that should be built. The Public Utilities Commission said Ely Energy Center, not those other facilities, is needed to satisfy Nevada consumers. We won't buy power from those other facilities. They will not satisfy the needs of this state. You have to ask the other developers where they will sell their power. We are concerned that the resources of this state be used for the benefits of this state and not for the benefit of others. Any energy production, be it geothermal, wind, solar or fossil fuels, uses environmental resources meant for the public good and we should be wise stewards of those resources.
\
Hay: Can you tell me how well you've done meeting the renewable requirement since it took effect in 1997?
\
Denis: We have not met the solar requirement. Around 2004 we had 17 renewable energy purchase contracts signed and 11 never performed. The non-solar standard we have met. Where we have not met the standard, it has been because of the failure of some of the independent developers to come through. When we saw two years ago that renewables developers weren't delivering on contracts, we decided as a company that we were going to build our own. And that's why we have a whole area in our company dedicated to building nothing but renewables. We're partnering up with Ormat on geothermal projects and on waste heat recovery plants. We will meet the standard this year.
\
Lucas: One of the problems of adding renewables to the mix is the lack of transmission lines. As we develop new coal plants we need to build transmission to share with renewables. The problem is you don't build transmission lines for renewables because you have to back it up with a solid, traditional power source.
\
One thing we haven't talked about is congressional action on carbon emissions, a potential carbon tax or cap and trade system.
\
Ball: We have three presidential candidates right now and all of them have taken some position on a carbon tax or a carbon cap. If this happens, who is going to be paying for this? We build the coal plant now, it doesn't capture the carbon because we don't have the technology yet. But we go ahead and build it because we want to build it cheap so we can help the little guy. But in five, 10, even 25 years, how much is it going to cost the little guy?
\
Who is going to pay, and can't we assume that the cost of renewables will be more competitive in a decade thanks to technology advancements?
\
Denis: The consumer is going to pay the difference. We get into these esoteric discussions of carbon and costs. We really need to be concerned about the impact on consumers five years from now.
\
Hay: There's no cost volatility with renewables.
\
Lucas: But they're not always available when needed.
\
Hay: Geothermal is. We're talking about Nevada, more renewables than any other state, more geothermal per capita than any other state.
\
Ball: There's also solar. And in the last 30 years we have made strides. We can assume that the price of renewables is just going to decrease because technology will continue to grow. Ausra is a solar energy company that recently located a manufacturing facility in Las Vegas and is able to store solar power for 16 hours now. Soon they'll be able to store for 24 hours, making solar a baseload fuel.
\
Denis: Six years ago it cost $900 to build a wind turbine. Today it's over $2,000. It's a worldwide commodity. GE can't keep up, there's a weak dollar and production is going overseas. Prices will increase.
\
Ball: We should be building up production facilities and jobs here at home. It makes us less dependent on other countries.
\
Lucas: What about the jobs related to extraction of coal, gas and other traditional fuels? This is not an either/or proposition.
\
Denis: Everyone has a bona fide interest in the environment. I think we differ on how to move forward and how to get there. At the end of the day the utility has the responsibility for keeping the lights on and providing clean, affordable, reliable power every time you flip the switch. We can't shirk that responsibility. All the people around this table don't have that responsibility. I do and I take it very seriously.

Ball: We have three presidential candidates right now and all of them have taken some position on a carbon tax or a carbon cap. If this happens, who is going to be paying for this? We build the coal plant now, it doesn't capture the carbon because we don't have the technology yet. But we go ahead and build it because we want to build it cheap so we can help the little guy. But in five, 10, even 25 years, how much is it going to cost the little guy?
\
Who is going to pay, and can't we assume that the cost of renewables will be more competitive in a decade thanks to technology advancements?
\
Denis: The consumer is going to pay the difference. We get into these esoteric discussions of carbon and costs. We really need to be concerned about the impact on consumers five years from now.
\
Hay: There's no cost volatility with renewables.
\
Lucas: But they're not always available when needed.
\
Hay: Geothermal is. We're talking about Nevada, more renewables than any other state, more geothermal per capita than any other state.
\
Ball: There's also solar. And in the last 30 years we have made strides. We can assume that the price of renewables is just going to decrease because technology will continue to grow. Ausra is a solar energy company that recently located a manufacturing facility in Las Vegas and is able to store solar power for 16 hours now. Soon they'll be able to store for 24 hours, making solar a baseload fuel.
\
Denis: Six years ago it cost $900 to build a wind turbine. Today it's over $2,000. It's a worldwide commodity. GE can't keep up, there's a weak dollar and production is going overseas. Prices will increase.
\
Ball: We should be building up production facilities and jobs here at home. It makes us less dependent on other countries.
\
Lucas: What about the jobs related to extraction of coal, gas and other traditional fuels? This is not an either/or proposition.
\
Denis: Everyone has a bona fide interest in the environment. I think we differ on how to move forward and how to get there. At the end of the day the utility has the responsibility for keeping the lights on and providing clean, affordable, reliable power every time you flip the switch. We can't shirk that responsibility. All the people around this table don't have that responsibility. I do and I take it very seriously.

13,"By STEVE TETREAULT\STEPHENS WASHINGTON BUREAU\WASHINGTON - Southern Nevada's top water official on Friday recommended to Congress that some money the government plans to raise in a campaign against global warming should be steered into research and financing to upgrade water plants and pipelines.\""Water managers are on the front line of climate change. For us it is happening now,"" said Pat Mulroy, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority. ""There is flooding in the Midwest, salt water encroachment into coastal aquifers, and drought in the Southeast.""\In the West, she said, the seven states that share the Colorado River have seen water flows drop a cumulative 11.8 trillion gallons below average this decade.\A federal report this week stated that Lake Mead this summer is expected to drop to its lowest level in 44 years, nearing a trigger point for water use restrictions.\""If this drought continues, in three years Hoover Dam will cease generating electricity,"" she said. ""My purpose today is not to induce alarm but rather to convey the magnitude of the situation.""\Mulroy testified before the House energy and the environment subcommittee as it completed three days of hearings on a major climate change bill. The bill aims to lower the amounts of carbon that companies emit into the atmosphere by requiring them to buy permits for the pollution they create.\The permits can be bought, sold and traded among companies. The Obama administration estimates the cap-and-trade system would raise an estimated $646 billion. About $535 billion would be returned to taxpayers as tax cuts while the rest would fund clean energy strategies.\The bill is extremely controversial. Critics say it will raise energy costs and that it amounts to a new tax on businesses that will be passed on to consumers. Democrats hope to write the bill and have it debated on the House floor after Memorial Day.\The House subcommittee heard from 54 witnesses over three days, including former Vice President Al Gore, Energy Secretary Steven Chu, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson, and dozens of industry officials and environmental advocates. Mulroy was one of the final speakers Friday.\While the climate change bill focuses mainly on energy, ""water and energy are inextricably linked and must be considered together,"" she said.\About 4 percent of the nation's energy is used to treat and deliver water, according to the Department of Energy.\Mulroy requested a small percentage of the cap-and-trade proceeds be spent on research to help water managers adapt to climate change. There are almost two dozen climate change models but none can predict warming impacts at the watershed level, she said.\She also recommended about 10 percent of the climate change funds be used to upgrade water infrastructure.\""These funds would be subject to repayment by municipal water agencies, which historically are among the country's most secure borrowers,"" she said.\Local agencies face ""staggering"" costs to keep water flowing, Mulroy said.\A new Lake Mead water intake being made necessary by the drought, for instance, will cost nearly $1 billion, Mulroy said, and that ""is only one project in one community."" \Contact Stephens Washington Bureau Chief Steve Tetreault at stetereault@stephensmedia.com or 202-783-1760."
14," By JOHN G. EDWARDS\ REVIEW-JOURNAL\ Proposed coal-fired power plants in Nevada and other Western states will damage the environment and become more costly because of anticipated carbon dioxide pollution regulations, environmental groups said Tuesday.\ ""The American Southwest is at a pivotal crossroads,"" said Vickie Patton, one of the authors of the study, ""Climate Alert: Cleaner Energy for the Southwest."" Western Resource Advocates and Environmental Defense, both of Boulder, Colo., published the report.\ ""We can either saddle our children with a staggering amount of global warming"" or work to reduce it, Patton said.\ The environmental groups identified the $3.8 billion, 1,500- megawatt Ely Energy Center as a key coal-fired power plant they oppose. The Ely center and the other 12 new and proposed pulverized- coal plants would spew out 69.9 million tons of carbon dioxide yearly, increasing global warming, the report says.\ The Ely center would throw off 12.6 million tons of carbon dioxide yearly, according to the report.\ ""If built as proposed, the Ely plant would be the largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions among the proposed new coal- fired plants in the Southwest,"" the report says.\ The Ely plant also would consume 2.6 billion gallons of water yearly, the report says.\ Desert Rock, a plant being developed by Sithe Global Power and the Navajo Nation enterprise Dine Power Authority, is another big proposal, with 1,500 megawatts of capacity. Sithe also has a proposal to build the 750-megawatt Toquop Energy Project near Mesquite. LS Power plans to build a 650-megawatt, coal-fired plant near Ely, but must have a long-term contract with Nevada Power, wholesalers or another entity before it can be built, the study said. Newmont Mining Corp., which operates gold mines in Nevada, has a 200-megawatt, coal-fired plant at Dunphy.\ The other plants are in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.\ The Public Utilities Commission last year authorized Nevada Power Co. and Sierra Pacific Power Co. to spend $300 million to start developing the coal-fired Ely plant.\ It's unclear whether Gov. Jim Gibbons supports the Ely coal plant. Brent Boynton, the governor's spokesman, referred questions about the Ely Energy Center to Hatice Gecol, Gibbons' energy and science adviser. She did not return calls.\ Roberto Denis, senior vice president of Sierra Pacific Resources, parent company of the two electric utilities, said the company's energy strategy and the Ely project are consistent with the environmental study.\ John Nielsen, energy project director for Western Resources, rejected Denis' conclusion, saying the environmental groups oppose construction of the Ely coal plant.\ ""The Ely Energy Center is exactly the kind of facility that is of concern in terms of global warming emissions,"" Nielsen said.\ Denis referred to a list of seven recommendations in the report and mentioned ways in which the Nevada utilities are following the recommendations. The report recommended greater reliance on energy conservation, use of more renewable energy, and building transmission lines that provide access to renewable resources. A transmission line being built to carry power from the Ely coal plant also could be used to tap 300 megawatts of wind power in the Ely area, Denis said.\ The report recommends that coal-fired plants use technology to capture carbon emissions. Denis said the Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power set aside space for installing carbon capturing equipment when the technology becomes feasible. Sierra Pacific Resources also is participating with other utility companies in a study of retrofitting existing pulverized-coal power plants with carbon-capturing technology, Denis said.\ Nielsen said it will not be feasible to retrofit pulverized-coal- fired power plants with equipment for capturing carbon.\ In addition, Nielsen also said that pulverized-coal plants like the Ely center are becoming more costly to build and operate.\ Congress is talking about a cap-and-trade system of regulating carbon dioxide pollution. The total amount of carbon dioxide would be capped, and existing companies with carbon dioxide emissions would be able to use their carbon credits or sell them to the highest bidder.\ Those regulations will add about 1 cent a kilowatt hour to the cost of power from coal-fired plants, Nielsen said. That would bring the cost of coal power to 6 or 7 cents a kilowatt hour, he said.\ ""It's a near certainty that we're going to see this regulation coming,"" Nielsen said.\ Denis declined to speculate about the possibility Congress will pass and President Bush will sign a cap-and-trade regulatory system.\ ""We would be concerned about anything that impacts the cost to consumers,"" Denis said.\ State consumer advocate Eric Witkoski said he was disappointed the utilities commission did not require the electric utilities to provide estimates of the cost of carbon regulation before approving $300 million in development expenses for the Ely project.\ The environmental report's authors advocated using renewable energy - such as solar, wind and geothermal power - as well as energy conservation to meet the electricity needs of the rapidly growing Southwestern population."
15,"By STEVE TETREAULT \Stephens Washington Bureau \WASHINGTON - As Congress winds up for a big debate this fall over taxes, Nevadans in a new poll are sending a strong message: Don't take away my tax cuts. \By a wide margin, Nevada residents say they want lawmakers to continue reduced income tax rates for individuals and other tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. They will expire at year's end unless they are extended . \Asked whether they wanted the tax cuts to expire or to continue, 61 percent said ""continue"" and 29 percent said ""expire,"" in the poll taken this week by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research for the Las Vegas Review-Journal and 8NewsNow. \Generally, people responded to the question with an eye on their wallets, which in Nevada these days are tending to be somewhat thin, said Brad Coker, managing director of the polling firm. \Danny Gonzales, professor of political science at Great Basin College in Elko, said he was surprised that close to 30 percent of Nevadans would want to give up lower rates they have enjoyed for almost a decade. \""I would think with the economic downturn you would expect there would be a larger portion of the citizenry that would like the tax cuts to continue,"" Gonzales said. \According to a poll breakdown, support for letting the tax cuts expire is coming from a combination of Democrats and independents presumably concerned that continuing them means less revenue for the federal treasury and a deepening of the nation's $1 trillion budget hole. \""That's their version of deficit reduction,"" Coker said. \In another issue before Congress , 38 percent of Nevadans favor a climate change bill that would include a ""cap and trade"" strategy to limit emissions of greenhouse gases from industrial plants. Forty-six percent said they oppose that legislation, passed by the House last year but shelved in the Senate . \Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has signaled that debate over extending the early-decade tax cuts will commence when senators return from summer recess in September. That could make it one of the issues freshest in the minds of voters going to the polls in November. \The ""average middle income"" family in Nevada would save $1,530 on their 2011 taxes if the tax cuts are extended, according to a study this month by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. \The bulk of the tax cuts were passed in 2001 by a Republican-controlled Congress encouraged by President George W. Bush, who promised they would spur economic growth. Critics charged they only accelerated the nation's descent into budget deficits. \The so-called ""Bush tax cuts"" lowered the tax rates on individual income about 3 percent across the board, reduced taxes on married couples filing jointly and increased the child tax credit. \The legislation also reduced the tax rate on qualifying capital gains, and began phasing out the estate tax. \In 2003, still controlled by Republicans, Congress passed a second Bush tax package that reduced the top rate on capital gains from 20 to 15 percent, and cut the top tax rate on dividends from 35 percent to 15 percent. \But it all goes away unless Congress acts this fall. The flip side is that extending the tax cuts across the board could cost $238 billion next year, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation in Congress, and around $1 trillion over the next 10 years. \Heading into September, debate has centered on who should continue to benefit from the tax cuts, and at what cost.\President Barack Obama has proposed that the tax cuts expire for the wealthy - individuals earning more than $200,000 and families with earned income of more than $250,000 - but should be made permanent for everyone else, which he puts at roughly 98 percent of households.\While many Democrats are expected to rally around Obama, there is dissent. Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., says Congress should not raise taxes on the wealthy in a soft economy. \Sens. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., and Evan Bayh, D-Ind., have made similar comments, along with a small group of House Democrats.\Republicans argue that job-generating small business owners would be hit with tax increases if the tax cuts are limited. \Nevada lawmakers are staking out positions. Reid and Rep. Shelley Berkley favor Obama's proposal. \Berkley ""is actively working on finding the best way to extend these key tax savings for Nevadans,"" aide David Cherry said. \""The question now remains how to extend existing tax cuts in a way that is also fiscally responsible and that means making some tough choices in Congress."" \Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., was said Friday she could consider raising the $250,000 threshold to continue tax cuts either across the board, or on certain individual taxes. \""For Nevadans who are fighting to get by - paying the mortgage or sending their child to college - extending tax cuts is critical,"" Titus said. ""I would be open to examining individual tax breaks, such as the mortgage interest deduction that helps Nevada homeowners, and proposals to raise the $250,000 threshold."" \Republicans Sen. John Ensign and Rep. Dean Heller want to continue all the tax cuts. \""Senator Ensign thinks raising taxes during a recession would be the wrong policy for our country, and if we do not act to extend the current tax rates then we are doing exactly that,"" said his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper. \Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle believes the tax cuts ""should be extended on all levels,"" spokesman Jerry Stacy said. ""The private sector currently struggles to sustain itself, and we will see a bad situation grow even worse if the tax cuts are allowed to expire and the government is allowed to extract even more money from the private sector.""\Republican Joe Heck, who is in a tight race with Titus, also wants them extended across the board. \""Congress must make the 2001 and 2003 middle class tax cuts permanent in order to create a stable economic environment for our small businesses and families,"" Heck said. ""With Nevada sitting at a shocking 14.2 percent unemployment rate, we need to enact and sustain any incentives that allow the private sector to flourish and get Nevadans back to work.""\Las Vegas Review-Journal\reviewjournal.com\8NEWS NOW.com\Congressinal Issues\Congress is considering a plan to address global warming that would strictly limit the amounts\of greenhouse gases companies could emit.

16,"By STEVE TETREAULT\and PETER URBAN\STEPHENS WASHINGTON BUREAU \WASHINGTON - While serving side by side in Congress, Dean Heller and Shelley Berkley compiled mirror opposite voting records on most of the big issues facing the nation.\They staked out differing positions on the economy, many social matters and the role government should play when it comes to health care and the environment.\As Nevadans prepare to vote for a U.S. senator, their track records provide a seemingly distinct choice between Heller, 52, the appointed Republican incumbent senator and former congressman, and Berkley, 61, the Democratic challenger and seven-term House member.\They do not always disagree. They have been on the same page on home-state issues such as burying nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain (against), on easing international travel to Las Vegas and Reno (for), on national monument status for Tule Springs fossil beds (for), on federal legalization of Internet poker (for), and on continued support for Israel (for).\When Nevada's economy was tanking, both voted to extend unemployment payments to beleaguered job seekers. Both have sponsored bills to mitigate the home foreclosure crisis in Southern Nevada.\Each has reached across the aisle with regularity to sponsor or co-sponsor bills with members of the opposite party, and even each other.\""You have two very different views of how America works and what's good for America and what's going to move America forward,"" said Eric Herzik, political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno.\For instance, Herzik said, ""They will both say they want to promote small business and give you totally different answers on how to do it. With Dean Heller and Shelley Berkley, they just view the world differently.""\On most broad issues they fall in line with their respective parties, though each shows sparks of independence.\Berkley in 2010 proposed reducing estate taxes by more than party leaders desired, and was one of 60 Democrats to cross the aisle to help Republicans kill a proposal to raise the tax rate.\""There are few things in this world that you can do to avoid paying taxes,"" Berkley said. ""I think dying should be one of those things.""\Two weeks after he took office, Heller in January 2007 parted ways with most GOP members to back more funding for embyronic stem cell research. \""It's not necessarily pro-choice or pro-stem cells,"" Heller told Congressional Quarterly at the time. ""It's just, get the government out of the way.""\Apart from occasional detours, Berkley, a 14-year House member, voted 90 percent or more with her party in all but her first four years in Congress, stronger support in each case than the Democratic average, according to statistics compiled by Congressional Quarterly.\Heller, who was elected to Congress in 1996, voted the GOP line at least 91 percent during his first four years, similarly more than the Republican average. In 2011, as an appointed senator preparing for a tough election, Heller's ""party unity"" votes dropped to 84 percent.\The duo cast roughly 3,800 votes while serving together in the House until Heller was appointed to the Senate on May 9, 2011. Here are significant votes that define their differences:\OCT. 3, 2008\HOUSE CREATES TARP \BERKLEY YES, HELLER NO\At the end of a dramatic week, the House passed a massive emergency rescue plan to stem a treacherous slide in U.S. financial markets.\The 263-171 vote came just days after rejection of an earlier version of the $700 billion rescue sent markets into near-panic. The Senate sweetened the bill with $150 billion in popular tax breaks and other riders to attract support, clearing the way for a House do-over.\Berkley initially voted against the bill, but in the intervening days ""got an earful"" from worried constituents. \""People were begging - not asking - for relief,"" she said at the time.\In the end, she framed her vote as favoring consumer tax breaks and renewable-energy incentives in the bill.\The rescue bill at its core established the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. It was to give the Treasury Department the ability to buy or insure failed assets that were clogging the markets, in order to free up capital.\Heller, who as a young man was a stockbroker and trader on the Pacific Stock Exchange, was from the outset skeptical at what came to be known as the Wall Street bailout. Billions of taxpayer dollars were put at risk, in his view, to reward bad decisions of wealthy financiers.\""That is Wall Street arrogance,"" Heller said at the time. ""They created their problems and they want someone else to bail them out."" \Heller maintained there were other choices short of taxpayer involvement, including a plan paid for by the financial institutions themselves.\APRIL 15, 2011\HOUSE PASSES RYAN BUDGET\HELLER YES, BERKLEY NO\Republicans reclaimed House control following the 2010 elections. The new-look Congress included 85 GOP freshmen elected on platforms to shake up Washington, some fairly vigorously.\The early signature bill of the GOP-controlled House was the $1.019 trillion fiscal 2012 budget resolution formed by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and passed 235-193 with zero Democratic votes.\The document sought to repeal key elements of President Barack Obama's health care reform and contained deep budget cuts in an attempt, Republicans said, to regain control of federal spending and the skyrocketing deficit.\The most controversial provisions called for restructuring Medicare as a ""premium support"" voucher-style system to go into effect when today's 55-year-olds retire. Ryan and his allies argued the changes were necessary to save Medicare from eventual ruin.\Berkley rejected the budget as ""extreme,"" and has made Heller's vote a centerpiece of her Senate campaign.\Heller said bold moves were necessary, and also voted for it in the Senate.\""The choices are clear. We can continue with the status quo, which leads to bigger government, higher taxes, less jobs, and rationed health care for our seniors, or we can decrease government spending, create jobs, and preserve Medicare for future generations while making no changes for current recipients,"" Heller said.\JAN. 9, 2009\HOUSE PASSES PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT\BERKLEY YES, HELLER NO\With Obama preparing to enter the White House and with majorities on both sides of Capitol Hill, the Democratic agenda early in 2009 included this bill, aimed at fighting wage discrimination.\While it passed the House 256-163, the Paycheck Fairness Act has failed to become law. Most recently, in June, a Senate version was blocked by Republicans and became fodder for election-year charges the GOP is waging a ""war on women.""\The bill, updating a 1963 equal pay law, would require an employer to pay men and women the same for the same job, or to justify why not.\""This is more than a woman's issue; this is a middle-income family issue,"" Berkley said in June. ""This is not the 1950s. We're not talking about women who have a little job that at the end of the week they fill their cookie jar with extra money for the kids. These are the mainstay breadwinners.""\The bill drew opposition from business interests that feared a flood of lawsuits.\Heller in June characterized the bill as a red herring.\""Let me be clear: Pay discrimination based upon gender is unacceptable,"" Heller said. ""The only winners under this legislation would be trial lawyers, giving them a windfall, exposing employers to unlimited punitive damages.\""This legislation opens the door to frivolous lawsuits which already cost our economy billions of dollars every year.""\JUNE 30, 2010\HOUSE OVERHAULS FINANCIAL RULES\BERKLEY YES, HELLER NO\The near-collapse of the nation's financial sector set Congress to work on legislation to overhaul regulation of the financial service industry. The result was a sweeping bill that set out to change the face of Wall Street but also deepened the chasm between the two parties in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.\The Dodd-Frank bill was described by the Wall Street Journal as touching ""every corner of finance, from ATM cards to Wall Street bankers,"" and created a new federal watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\""We are putting these common-sense rules in place to police Wall Street and the big banks and to prevent them from placing the savings of Nevada families at risk through predatory lending and reckless investment strategies,"" Berkley said after the 237-192 vote.\Republicans called it yet another ""big government"" strategy that would stifle business activity and private sector growth yet do little to reduce risk.\Heller, during a campaign debate this month, said: ""The purpose of Dodd-Frank was to give cover for those who voted for the (TARP) bailout.""\DEC. 10, 2008\HOUSE BACKS AUTO INDUSTRY RESCUE\BERKLEY YES, HELLER NO\Weeks after voting to rescue the financial services industry, the House voted to do the same with automakers. \The 237-170 tally for a $14 billion emergency loan package and industry restructuring was the final House vote of the 2008 lame-duck session.\The legislation failed in the Senate, but Presidents George W. Bush and Obama later extended TARP loans to General Motors and Chrysler.\""This was not a perfect package, but at the end of the day, I could not stand by and allow GM, Ford or Chrysler to go bankrupt or to close their factory doors forever,"" Berkley said at the time. ""Our nation is still facing financial turmoil. Add to that the loss of the Big Three and the jobs that come along with the automobile industry - including those in Nevada - and it becomes clear why we must act to pass this loan package.""\Heller, outspoken against the earlier financial services bill, looked no more kindly on this one.\""Another month, another bailout,"" he said. ""This is nothing more than a Band-Aid that does not fix the much larger economic problems we have in our country.""\FEB. 13, 2009\HOUSE FINALIZES ECONOMIC STIMULUS \BERKLEY YES, HELLER NO\The 246-183 vote finalized House action on the $787 billion package of federal grant spending, tax cuts and safety net payments aimed at jump-starting a reeling economy.\Democrats said it would create or save 3.5 million jobs. No Republican voted for it, protesting that borrowing and spending would cripple the nation with debt.\Heller and Berkley went head-to-head on the stimulus during a House debate on July 22, 2010.\Nevada's worst-in-the-nation jobless rate of 14.2 percent was proof, Heller said, that Obama's strategy failed to stem the recession while adding billions in debt.\""Who do we hold responsible?"" Heller said. ""The truth is the stimulus has failed the American people and the people of the great state of Nevada.""\Minutes later, Berkley countered that, ""For any Nevadan to condemn the stimulus bill is to ignore what's going on in the state of Nevada.""\The stimulus, with $2.9 billion for Nevada to date, had paid teachers and kept schools open, and injected $500 billion into the state's Medicaid program, Berkley argued. Stimulus money helped build bus depots in downtown Las Vegas and on Boulder Highway.\""We welcomed this money. We needed this money. It kept us afloat,"" she said.\Heller's response:\""We've lost 2 million jobs in this country since the stimulus bill was passed. Since the stimulus, almost 50,000 people have lost their jobs in Las Vegas. Tell me that the stimulus has worked in my district. I will debate anybody on this, and I'll wait for my phone to ring.""\JULY 31, 2009\HOUSE EXTENSION OF CASH FOR CLUNKERS\BERKLEY YES, HELLER NO\Reacting to a subsidized consumer rush into auto showrooms, this 316-109 vote added $2 billion to the ""cash for clunkers"" program that aimed to inject life into auto sales.\The program offered as much as $4,500 in cash to people who traded in cars, trucks and SUVs with poor fuel economy for newer models. The first $1 billion was gone in a week.\""It's good for our car and truck dealers, and it helps our goal of reducing emissions tied to global climate change,"" Berkley said after voting more money.\Critics, including Heller, said the government was ""picking winners and losers"" by goosing auto sales. \At a Rotary Club meeting in Carson City a few weeks later, he asked if anyone had taken advantage of ""cash for clunkers.""\According to the Nevada Appeal, Heller told a man who raised his hand, ""Congratulations. Everyone else in the room paid for your car.""\NOV. 7, 2009\HOUSE ON AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT\BERKLEY YES, HELLER NO\The landmark law known as ""Obama-care"" is the signature achievement of the president's term, altering the nation's health care landscape.\The 220-215 vote was the first measure of House support for the bill, which passed in final form in March 2010.\Democrats cheered its goal of making health coverage available to 32 million uninsured people, as well as consumer-friendly provisions on prescription drugs and coverage for people with medical conditions.\All but one Republican voted against what they considered a ""government takeover"" of health care including new taxes, mandates on business and a requirement that most Americans be insured by 2014.\The U.S. Supreme Court this summer upheld most of the law, yet it remains a defining issue in this year's presidential campaign and in Nevada's U.S. Senate race.\Heller, a critic, tried in the Ways and Means Committee to require the president and members of Congress to ""walk the walk"" and enroll in the program. He later complained Democrats would not let him offer further amendments.\""By choosing ideology over their constituency, Congress has empowered he federal government to take control of individual health care choices,"" he said.\Berkley called the bill ""good for Nevada. Over 400,000 uninsured Nevadans will be able to get health insurance because of this bill.""\JUNE 26, 2009\CAP AND TRADE CLIMATE BILL\BERKLEY YES, HELLER NO\Narrow 219-212 passage of this energy bill gave Obama a momentary victory, yet underscored the gulf between the parties on climate change.\The bill ""capped"" emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and sought to reduce them up to 83 percent by 2050. In the meantime, it would have established a system for industries to buy and sell emissions credits to pollute within the caps.\Berkley hailed the strategy to speed transition to renewable energy sources, which Nevada has in abundance.\""It addresses climate change, promotes the development of clean energy sources, and brings us closer to our goal of securing America's energy independence,"" she said in a House speech.\All but eight Republicans voted no.\Like most other critics, Heller charged the system would prove too expensive.\""What does this bill do? Every time you flip on your light switch, you are taxed. Every time you drive your kids to school, you are taxed,"" Heller said during debate. ""Every time you cook your family dinner, you are taxed. Air travel, food prices, electricity costs, gas prices, transportation cost, all will skyrocket under this bill."" \The cap and trade bill died in the Senate. \Contact Stephens Washington Bureau Chief Steve Tetreault at stetreault@stephensmedia.com or 202-783-1760.

And some experts doubt that will be the case; people will want to drive their new rides more than they would have their clunkers, offsetting any environmental benefit.\As for the amount of money spent on rebates aimed at reducing emissions from smog precursors or carbon dioxide, ""we would spend it in much better ways than the Cash for Clunkers,"" said Hassenzahl, who has spent 20 years working on air quality issues including risks associated with pollution and climate. \""This was a stimulus for car makers,"" he said.\A growing number of researchers who analyzed the program arrived at the same conclusion: It gave a financial boost to the automobile industry but does little for the environment at a high cost.\And its impact on reducing the carbon footprint that many scientists say causes global warming is debatable.\Even improvements to air quality by putting more cars on the road that are better equipped for reducing smog-forming emissions can't be measured. \As one local automotive recycler noted, the program left some of the biggest polluters on the road, and most of the cars and trucks that were sent to the scrap yard, though older, already were equipped with pollution controls.\""In my opinion, I thought this was a total economic stimulus program,"" said Steve Burke, general manager of Nevada Pic A Part, an automobile recycling business.\""Most of the people who drive the cars that pollute the most can't afford a car payment. So they limp along with the cars they got, which pollute a lot,"" he said.\It would have been better, according to The National Center for Policy Analysis, if those drivers could have received a rebate to apply toward the purchase of ""any vehicle with better fuel economy,"" including used cars.\Many poor people are unable to afford a new car even with a rebate, said the center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy research organization. A voucher would have encouraged people with low incomes to trade a 20-year-old used car for 5- to 7-year-old cars with better fuel economy and improved emissions technologies.\Christopher Knittel, in a paper this month for the University of California Energy Institute's Center for the Study of Energy Markets, reported that a number of variables need to be taken into account when assessing the program.\Among those noted by Knittel are that some people were turning in cars and trucks that weren't being used. And motorists would tend to drive more miles per year in more fuel efficient cars, since doing so is more affordable.\Based on average annual vehicle miles of 12,000 - if clunkers and new cars are driven the same and the clunker's fuel economy is 16 miles per gallon and new cars get 25 miles per gallon - then Cash for Clunkers saves 270 gallons for every year the clunker would have been on the road.\Burning a gallon of gasoline creates about 20 pounds of carbon dioxide - or 2.7 tons of carbon dioxide for each year the clunker would have survived. \If the clunker would have stayed on the road another four years, sending it to the junk yard now saves 10.8 tons of carbon dioxide. That translates to more than $400 per ton, if the deal for a new car involved a $4,500 taxpayer-financed rebate.\Under so-called industrial ""cap-and-trade"" programs in Europe and proposed in the United States - where carbon becomes a commodity that can be traded if a cap is set on the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions - then the price of a credit for reducing a ton of carbon or preventing that much emission is $20 and $28, respectively. \Even if Cash for Clunkers took vehicles off the road that could have been driven for 10 additional years, the carbon price is still more than $200 per ton, Knittel noted.\The National Center for Policy Analysis found that the rebate program cost the government $3 billion and failed to accomplish the program goals except for possibly improving urban air quality.\""There is evidence that removing older cars from the road will cut air pollution, but the numbers indicate that any reduction in carbon dioxide emissions or oil consumption will be minimal - and expensive,"" according to the group.\Cash for Clunkers, formally known as the Car Allowance Rebate System, offered consumers rebates of between $3,500 and $4,500 for trading in vehicles that got less than 18 miles per gallon for new cars that get more than 22 miles per gallon, or new trucks that get at least 18 miles per gallon. This resulted in roughly 750,000 trade-ins nationwide.\One advocate for curbing climate change, Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, asserts that the difference in gasoline consumption doesn't necessarily translate to reducing the carbon footprint. \All it does is replace old clunkers with new clunkers, said Becker, noting that new cars sold gets only a few miles per gallon more than ones that were scrapped.\Cash for Clunkers ""wasn't an environmental program,"" said Becker, a lawyer and climate expert whose work for 25 years has focused on global warming. Instead, the program was promoted by automakers to get cars off lots. \""We didn't have a subsidy before the program and the average consumer was buying a car that got 25 miles per gallon,"" Becker said. ""We're not getting benefits to the environment. Instead, we're getting the same kinds of vehicles with the subsidy. And that's not great for the taxpayers.""\Regardless of whether the vehicle is a Hummer or a hybrid, the carbon footprint for burning a gallon of gasoline is about 28 pounds of carbon dioxide, taking into account more than 7 pounds that result from extracting, transporting and refining fuel.\Hassenzahl said what matters ""is how far you're driving"" and what the motorist is getting out of the effort to burn a gallon of fuel.\In the end, if the motorist trades in a clunker and drives more because it is less expensive, then the clunker's carbon footprint isn't offset, he said.\Contact reporter Keith Rogers at krogers@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0308."
18,"As discussed in the May 17 article in the RGJ, the ""normal"" fire season has dramatically expanded due to the warming of our climate. Almost every scientist in the field has verified that global warming is occurring and that humans are responsible. So why are so many Americans denying this? Some politicians are telling people what they want to hear (no problem, no lifestyle change required) instead of the truth (after all, there is an election in progress.)\Also, people fear that preventing more global warming will require more government, more bureaucracy, and more regulation. That has been the approach so far, producing a dizzying array of complex, controversial, inefficient, and changing regulations mandating: 1) mileage and emission standards for vehicles and power plants, 2) confusing cap-and-trade arrangements, and 3) incentives for various renewable sources of energy. And of course, lobbyists utilize their influence (via campaign contributions and ""gifts"") with all of these regulations to preserve their benefactors' interests - no matter the cost to the environment or the public. So - is there a better way?\Yes. We can utilize the tremendous power and efficiency of the American market forces. If something costs more, businesses and people will find ways to use it less. No complex government rules and regulations are required. Placing a fee on carbon will raise the price of energy and the goods produced by this energy. It will also make non-carbon emitting sources of energy more competitive and hence more likely to be adopted. This fee can be easily implemented by charging the less than 2,000 US companies that operate mines, refine oil, and process natural gas. With appropriate, simple tariffs and reimbursements at the border, American businesses will incur no loss of competitiveness and other countries will be encouraged to implement their own carbon fee.\But let's not give the money to the government. Let's give it back to the people. Returning the money in equal amounts to each person will eliminate the financial burden that the carbon fee will cause. Big energy users (the one percent?) will pay more but not get any more back than the average person. Ninety-eight percent of economists agree that this is the most efficient and effective approach. See citizensclimatelobby.org for more information regarding a carbon fee and dividend program.\Dr. Ferrenberg is a retired aerospace engineer (rocket engine research), business owner, and UNR instructor.\One view\Allan Ferrenberg"

Sen. John Edwards picked a sizzling spot Wednesday to outline his plan to reverse global warming.
\
Sweating through a dress shirt under a Las Vegas sun - and its brutal reflection from solar panels designed to harness it - the Democratic candidate for president offered a plan long on themes but short on details for ways to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign sources of oil and to create a new, green - power economy.
\
Critics and supporters alike say the plan is short on specifics, but is more complete than any offered by his rivals. Nevada environmentalists have rallied behind Edwards because he advocates aggressive goals to cap pollution that causes global warming, support renewable energy and crack down on auto and power-industry emissions.
\
Experts say some of his goals aren't realistic, but that doesn't matter much to the state's environmentalists.
\
""The important thing about Edwards is that he gets it, that this is something that needs to be dealt with,"" said Charles Benjamin, director of the Nevada office of Western Energy Resources.
\
Edwards' plan calls for a cap on greenhouse gas emissions domestically at levels scientists have determined will help avoid the worst effects of global warming and raising $30 billion to $40 billion for renewable energy, fuel efficiency and conservation programs by auctioning off the right to emit global-warming-causing pollution.
\
He also proposes a global climate change treaty that, unlike the controversial Kyoto Protocol, would include developing nations in efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
\
Edwards says the $30 billion to $40 billion New Energy Economy Fund would pay for everything from direct investment in renewable energy generation and research and development of cleaner fossil fuel technology to massive conservation efforts and development of more fuel efficient cars.
\
""It's aggressive, I agree with that,"" Edwards said Wednesday after a tour of a UNLV solar research site. ""These are the minimal steps that need to be taken.""
\
The plan is shy on details - such as whether renewable energy-rich states such as Nevada will bear the burden of helping the nation produce 25 percent of its energy from renewable resources by 2025 - in part because of the very nature of election year politics.
\
""He can't talk about the details because people are already lost and when you start talking about the issues they get even more lost,"" said Frank Maisano, a utility industry attorney. ""It's easier to say, 'Hurricane Katrina is caused by global warming, and we've got to do something,' than to say how you're going to pay for a conservation program or implement a cap and trade system.""
\
Edwards says the president's greatest role is to guide the discussion, to use the bully pulpit.
\
And although climate change and energy independence are looming issues facing the United States and the next president, they aren't necessarily as high on voters' priority list as the long and often debated issues of health care or the Iraq war .
\
""Energy and the environment and climate change and global warming, even in this heightened atmosphere, remain low on the totem pole of issues that really move votes,"" Maisano said.
\
But that's where a successful presidential candidate could take a lead. ""Most Americans understand global warming is real,"" Edwards said. ""The thing that's missing at this moment ... is urgency. And that's where the president and presidential leadership (come in). Make people understand how urgent it is and lay our a doable, practical solution.""

20,"By JENNIFER ROBISON\REVIEW-JOURNAL\A new report says the Silver State could gain 15,000 jobs through investment in renewable energy.\But that job formation will carry a cost for existing businesses, according to recommendations in the study.\The report, which the Center for American Progress and the Nevada Conservation League released Tuesday, analyzed the job growth that would come from a two-year, $100 billion investment in a nationwide ""clean energy"" strategy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ""create a low-carbon economy.""\The study's verdict: America would see 2 million new jobs, and Nevada would pick up 15,000 new jobs. Many of those jobs would pay at least $16 an hour, the report said.\The study also noted that investment in green projects would especially boost jobs in construction and manufacturing, two areas hard-hit in today's economic slowdown. Building a wind farm, for example, would require sheet-metal workers, machinists and truck drivers. Retrofitting buildings with clean energy systems would demand roofers, insulators and building inspectors.\Nevada's share of the $100 billion would amount to $865 million, with spending on energy-efficient building retrofits, mass transit, ""smart"" power grids and alternative fuels such as wind and solar power.\Local environmentalists, business executives and union officials held a press conference Tuesday at Las Vegas Springs Preserve to discuss the report's findings.\Lydia Ball, Southern Nevada director of the Sierra Club, said the report ends a longtime debate pitching job growth against green concerns.\""I'm always asked, 'Should it be the economy or the environment?' Well, it's both,"" Ball said.\Chris Brooks, director of the renewable energy division at Bombard Electric, testified to the ""significant opportunities to diversify the economy in this state with good, high-paying jobs.""\And Danny Thompson, executive secretary-treasurer of the Nevada AFL-CIO, said the $100 billion investment would generate ""huge opportunities"" for Nevada's workers.\""We're very excited about it,"" Thompson said.\But Thompson's zeal won't necessarily spread to other businesses, local business advocates said.\That's because the $100 billion cited in the report would come from a federal mechanism charging companies for greenhouse gas emissions. The study's authors advocate paying for the investment through auctioning carbon emissions permits based on an economywide cap-and-trade program that would limit companies' greenhouse gas outflows.\Half of the $100 billion would subsidize tax credits for private businesses and homeowners to fund building retrofits and purchases of renewable energy systems. Another $46 billion would go to direct government spending in areas such as public building retrofits, the expansion of mass transit and new spending on renewable energy. The remaining $4 billion would back federal loan guarantees to underwrite private financing of building upgrades.\Andy Matthews, a spokesman for free-market think tank Nevada Policy Research Institute, said the proposal sounds like a ""classic redistributionist scheme"" that would shift private-sector dollars from businesses to government programs. And a complete picture of the plan's job growth would require weighing the number of positions lost among companies that lay off workers or cancel hiring plans because of pricey new carbon taxes, he added.\""The government isn't generating this money,"" Matthews said. ""You have to ask where this money is coming from, and for every effect on one side, you have to look at the effect on the other side. There are real consequences when you take money from the private sector and put it toward the government. There will be bureaucrats who need to be paid, and you'll need government oversight committees. You have a much less efficient use of that money than you'd have in the private sector.""\But Thompson urged the plan's detractors to consider how the investments could improve Nevada's fiscal health.\If Nevada builds a massive solar and wind power industry, the Silver State could become an exporter of power to California and other states. And it could charge a mill tax on that power ""payable to the citizens of Nevada,"" he added.\Thompson acknowledged some jobs would vanish in the transition to a greener economy, but he likened the transformation to the disappearance of telephone operators. His organization represented 2,000 phone operators in 1992; today, it represents none. Technology replaced their jobs, and those operators found work elsewhere.\""This will create more jobs in the long range,"" Thompson said. ""Once we meet our energy needs, we have resources others don't.""\Matthews said many businesses won't be convinced.\""If a proposal really had significant demand or potential, then it would be able to sustain itself without government subsidies,"" he said. ""If they've got a winner, or something with real potential, the market will find a way to channel resources to it. Markets don't lie.""\Contact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512."
21,"Love it or hate it, the Green New Deal certainly has generated plenty of excitement.\Except, that is, among Nevada's congressional delegation, which has kept mostly mum on the ambitious, green energy-fueled public works plan.\The proposal — spearheaded by insurgent progressive U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York — seeks to combat both growing income inequality and the worst effects of climate change with a massive, potentially multitrillion-dollar job creation program.\It's modeled after former President Franklin Roosevelt's famed New Deal, another sprawling, government-funded effort that put millions of people back to work building roads, bridges, buildings and dams during the Great Depression.\Ocasio-Cortez's measure seeks to achieve a similar aim by hiring workers to build expansive green energy projects, such as smart power grids, high-speed railroads and underground carbon storage centers.\A 14-page resolution outlining the plan reads more like a manifesto than finished legislation. Still, it picked up 68 sponsors in the House early this month. A Senate version of the measure has already won support from six of 10 announced Democratic presidential candidates.\But Republicans, and no shortage of Democrats, have also been quick to pan the proposal as a ""radical"" and ""impractical"" effort that could spike inflation and bring the economy to a grinding halt. They prefer more market-driven efforts, such as carbon taxes or a cap-and-trade system that would require polluters to obtain permits for their emissions.\You might expect Democrats in Nevada, touted as the ""Saudi Arabia of solar energy,"" to rally around a government effort that promises to plow piles of new cash into the state's burgeoning renewable energy sector.\Yet the Silver State's representatives on Capitol Hill have been nothing if not cautious. None of Nevada's six congressional delegates have signed on to the plan. Only three responded to the Reno Gazette Journal's questions about the measure.\The first was recently elected U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who said she wanted to see a more detailed proposal before making up her mind.\""I still think they're trying to figure out all the exact details,"" Rosen told the Reno Gazette Journal after a Monday stop in Reno, ""but what we have to do is think about our planet, think about our environment and what's going to move us forward in each one of our communities.""\Rosen didn't directly answer a question about what she didn't like about the proposal, instead reiterating that the plan was still in its early stages.\""Everyone's having a lot of discussions right now,"" she said.\""When it takes a little bit more form, then I'm glad to comment on it.""\U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., struck an even quieter note.\""The senator is currently reviewing the resolution and looks forward to hearing from Nevadans on this important legislation,"" Masto said in a statement from a spokesman. ""I'll let you know when we have more updates.""\U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei, Northern Nevada's lone congressman and the only Republican in the state's congressional delegation, sounded equally wary of the resolution.\""With the Senate majority leader planning to bring this legislation up for a vote, we'll see if it gains any traction,"" he said in a statement from a spokeswoman.\""If it ends up being something the House might actually consider, I'd plan on taking a deeper dive into the bill to determine how these policy reforms would affect Nevadans and others across the country.""\The measure's cool reception among Nevada lawmakers largely echoes the response it won from moderate Democrats around the country.\House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stopped well short of endorsing the effort after it was first introduced, but said in a press conference that she welcomed the ""enthusiasm"" surrounding the proposal.\U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, last week told CNN the proposal was more like ""a dream"" than an actual deal.\Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was quick to pounce on the apparent Democratic discord, announcing plans to bring the Green New Deal up for a floor vote expected to accomplish little beyond inflaming existing ideological tensions in the Senate's minority caucus.\Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has slammed the promised vote as a ""cynical stunt.""\U.S. Sen.

WASHINGTON - Global warming activists were thrilled to hear Gov. Jim Gibbons was launching a climate change task force in Nevada - until they learned that the starting point for discussion would not assume that global warming exists.
\
With mounting scientific evidence that temperatures have been on the rise since the Industrial Revolution started spewing more carbon emissions into air, even the skeptical Bush administration and leading industrial giants have begun recognizing the problem.
\
The governor's office says the task force's major objective will be to study how global warming affects Nevada. But the neutral starting point worries those who fear time and money will be spent discussing science instead of solutions.
\
Several Western states that formed similar task forces over the years say they entered discussions with the belief that global warming was a given, and moved on from there.
\
On Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano's climate change advisory group ""there was very little discussion"" about whether global warming exists, said Lori Faeth, the governor's senior policy adviser for the environment. Rather, the group focused on what the state could do to curtail warming.
\
""That's not to say everyone in Arizona believes greenhouse gases is an issue,"" Faeth said. ""But the science is sound.""
\
A month after the Arizona group produced 49 recommendations last fall, including one to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by 2020, Napolitano signed an executive order to speed up the process. She moved the target date to 2012.
\
Five Western states, including Arizona, joined forces in February to announce plans for a new market-based system to limit carbon emissions. A month earlier 10 corporate giants asked Congress for a similar cap-and-trade system, and Northeastern states are doing the same. The Western states want Nevada and other neighbors to join.
\
Sarah Cottrell, energy and environmental policy adviser to New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, said that when the governor asked an advisory group of oil industry, farming and environmental representatives in 2005 to recommend ways to reduce even more his target for greenhouse gas emissions, they didn't debate the reality of global warming.
\
""I don't think that a body like that can really add much to the discussion on the science,"" Cottrell said.
\
Nationwide, more than one-fourth of the states have convened such task forces to address global warming. Nevada now joins the list and expects to produce recommendations within a year.
\
Gibbons' task force will consider global warming and greenhouse gas emissions and ""how they are affecting Nevada,"" his energy and science adviser, Hatice Gecol, said last month.
\
Gecol, a UNR scientist on leave to the governor's office, was not available for further comment. But in announcing the task force last month, she said its job would be to consider ""what is our contribution to global warming, what are the possibilities, the suggestions.""
\
Yet when asked if the committee's starting point was the belief that global warming exists, she said the committee would be neutral. ""I would like to encourage them to read the scientific publications in both senses,"" she said.
\
When pressed about that rationale, especially after this year's landmark United Nations report signed onto by 113 countries and more than 1,000 scientists essentially confirming global warming, Gecol said:
\
""They need to look at both possibilities . They need to evaluate all the scientific data.""
\
She said, ""It is the task force's duty to rule out or rule in. They need to gather and they need to decide about it.""
\
Judi Greenwald, a policy analyst at the Pew Center for Global Climate Change, sees value in launching the debate from a neutral point.
\
""I'm OK with that,"" she said. ""We're convinced that the science is serious. But we also believe people need to be educated. If it's used to get everyone on the same page, and then move on to solutions, then that's fine.""
\
But Greenwald added: ""I think it's getting harder though, day by day, unless you're living in a hole, not starting from, 'This is a problem, let's move on, how do we solve it?' ""
\
States say they are increasingly interested in global warming because of the economic effects, such as ski resorts suffering from light snowfall or water supplies drying up.
\
Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels founded the U.S. Mayor's Climate Change Agreement to reduce global warming pollution. It has been signed by more than 400 cities, including Las Vegas, Henderson, Reno and Sparks. Nickels said he knew it was time to act when he couldn't see snowfall on the mountains.
\
""It was something of an epiphany for him,"" said John Healy, spokesman for the city's sustainability office. ""We are a city that depends on snowpack to generate hydroelectric energy and drinking water.""
\
Healy said debating whether global warming is real is a ""little like spending a lot of time arguing if the Earth is flat.""
\
Still, he welcomed Nevada's task force as a ""positive development.""
\
""I would hope they would move quickly to the solutions, and not spend too much time belaboring science that has effectively ended the debate.""

24,"djacobs@rgj.com\Addressing the country for the first time about the federal response to the oil that's been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico for nearly two months, President Barack Obama on Tuesday evening assured the nation that ""we will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long it takes.""\""Already, this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced,"" Obama said in his first Oval Office address to the nation. ""And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane, it's not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days.""\Obama likened the spill to ""more like an epidemic, one that we will be fighting for months and even years.\""But make no mistake: We will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long it takes. We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused. And we will do whatever's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy.""\Focus on\alternative energy\Though the speech was touted in advance as emphasizing the federal government's efforts in protecting the Gulf Coast, its economy and reassuring residents there, Obama devoted substantial time to future alternative energy.\""From a complete perspective, I found it to be disappointing,"" said Fred Lokken, a political science professor at Truckee Meadows Community College, who hours earlier Tuesday had changed his political registration from Republican to nonpartisan.\""He gave far more time and attention to that (alternative energy) than explaining how BP is somehow going to reduce the flow from this to just 10 percent in the next week or so,"" Lokken said of Obama. ""That is a pretty broad statement, but it was only one sentence.""\Lokken considered the speech politically oriented, a point seconded by David Damore, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who's been following the president's actions on the disaster.\""You look at the polls, and this is obviously the response to that,"" said Damore, who changed his registration from Democrat to nonpartisan about 18 months ago. ""It's an issue of competence. Can the government even manage this problem?""\Obama also has been criticized, including by fellow Democrats, for not leading a tough enough response.\""Then of course, like any good politician in a disaster, you try to make the most, so he tries to use this to sell his energy policy, which is largely stalled in Congress,"" Damore said of the speech's timing.\A similar point was made by U.S. Rep. Dean Heller, R-Carson City.\""While the nation is looking for leadership and solutions to the Gulf oil spill, the president makes a renewed pitch to increase energy taxes through cap and trade,"" Heller said in a statement after Obama's speech.\""This environmental disaster should be an opportunity for both Democrats and Republicans to come together to find solutions to our nations long term energy needs, not as a tool to promote divisive partisan policies that cater to East Coast environmental interests."" he said.\The oil has seen spewing since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20, but Tuesday's speech was Obama's first national address on the disaster.\""It was not exclusively focused on the Gulf; that's what it needed to be,"" Lokken of TMCC said of Obama's address. ""It was not specific in detailing what the government was going to be doing in the short term.""\""I think they made some mistakes,"" Lokken said. ""They needed to stay on topic, and they didn't.

25,"djacobs@rgj.com\Addressing the country for the first time about the federal response to the oil that's been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico for nearly two months, President Barack Obama on Tuesday evening assured the nation that ""we will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long it takes.""\""Already, this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced,"" Obama said in his first Oval Office address to the nation. ""And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane, it's not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days.""\Obama likened the spill to ""more like an epidemic, one that we will be fighting for months and even years.\""But make no mistake: We will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long it takes. We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused. And we will do whatever's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy.""\Focus on alternative energy\Though the speech was touted in advance as emphasizing the federal government's efforts in protecting the Gulf Coast, its economy and reassuring residents there, Obama devoted substantial time to future alternative energy.\""From a complete perspective, I found it to be disappointing,"" said Fred Lokken, a political science professor at Truckee Meadows Community College, who hours earlier Tuesday had changed his political registration from Republican to non-partisan.\""He gave far more time and attention to that (alternative energy) than explaining how BP is somehow going to reduce the flow from this to just 10 percent in the next week or so,"" Lokken said of Obama. ""That is a pretty broad statement, but it was only one sentence.""\Lokken considered the speech politically oriented, a point seconded by David Damore, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who's been following the president's actions since the disaster.\""You look at the polls, and this is obviously the response to that,"" said Damore, who changed his registration from Democrat to non-partisan about 18 months ago. ""It's an issue of competence. Can the government even manage this problem?\Obama also has been criticized for not leading a tough enough response, including by fellow Democrats.\""Then of course, like any good politician in a disaster, you try to make the most, so he's tries to use this to sell his energy policy which is largely stalled in Congress,"" Damore said of the speech's timing.\A similar point was made by U.S. Rep. Dean Heller, R-Carson City.\""While the nation is looking for leadership and solutions to the gulf oil spill, the president makes a renewed pitch to increase energy taxes through cap and trade,"" Heller said in a statement after Obama's speech.\""This environmental disaster should be an opportunity for both Democrats and Republicans to come together to find solutions to our nations long term energy needs, not as a tool to promote divisive partisan policies that cater to East Coast environmental interests."" he said.\The oil has seen spewing since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20, but Tuesday's speech was Obama's first national address on the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history.\""It was not exclusively focused on the gulf, that's what it needed to be,"" Lokken of TMCC said of Obama's address. ""It was not specific in detailing what the government was going to be doing in the short term.""\""I think they made some mistakes,"" Lokken said. ""They needed to stay on topic, and they didn't. They included too many things.\""Although I am a huge supporter of alternative energies, this was not the speech to discuss that. That is the longer term that has policy implications that will probably play out rather heavily in the November elections.""\Damore wondered how many people watched the 5 p.m. PDT speech.\""That is what I would be interested in,"" said Damore, who was teaching at the time.

26,"To the editor:\Today, some good news about Nevada higher education.\The American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which promotes high standards and real education reform (not politically correct fads or mindlessly throwing money at schools), assigns Nevada's state college and universities a B grade in a national ranking.\ACTA surveyed 718 public and private institutions - almost all U.S. colleges and universities except technical schools like MIT - and graded them on the rigor of their core curricula. ACTA addressed a fundamental question: If you graduate from an institution, does its core curriculum assure you'll get a solid education in important areas to prepare you for work, citizenship and life?\ACTA considered whether a core includes these areas: composition (effective writing); literature; a foreign language; U.S. government or history; economics; mathematics; and natural or physical science.\Beyond asking whether a subject is required, ACTA investigated whether the standard actually requires students to pass substantive courses in the subject, not tangential fluff, nor one among many non-basic electives. For example, Princeton's literature and arts requirement can be satisfied by ""American Horror Fiction and Cinema,"" so ACTA gives no credit. Wisconsin allows more than 550 courses, including ""Introduction to Television,"" for a similar requirement. No credit.\Only 17 schools (2 percent), notably including Air Force, Army and some Texas schools, got an A, meaning their core curricula require at least six of the seven areas. Besides Nevada's institutions, 249 others got a B because they require four or five of the seven areas.\Nevada schools and almost all others fell short in economics, a sad irony in times in which understanding economic fundamentals is so important in work and citizenship. We also don't require foreign languages, a sad fact even though this is probably the least essential among the categories. UNLV requires literature, but the University of Nevada, Reno and Nevada State College do not. All our schools require history/government, the second-most neglected area nationally, plus mathematics, science and composition.\Consider some of our ""B"" company: Arizona State, Chicago, Columbia, Duke, Navy, North Carolina, Notre Dame, Purdue, Utah and Utah State. If you can get accepted at highly selective universities like Chicago and afford their whopping tuition, maybe you should go there. Otherwise, Nevada's very low costs (especially if you start at one of our community colleges) and high standards argue for staying here.\Among C recipients: Brigham Young, Idaho, Idaho State, Princeton, Stanford, UCLA and USC. Notable D's: Arizona, Harvard, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, Oregon State, Pacific, Reed and Wisconsin. Salient F's: Boise State, Brown, Northwestern, Oberlin, Rice, Smith, California-Berkeley, California-Davis, Washington and Yale.\Of course, you can get a good, well-rounded education at most of these schools if you choose your courses well and work hard. You can also slide through at many of them, learn very little and emerge unprepared for work, citizenship and life.\In Nevada, we're trying to close off the slide-through option and assure that our graduates are well-educated and get their money's worth.\RON KNECHT\CARSON CITY\The writer is a member of the Nevada System of Higher Education Board of Regents.\They actually read it?\To the editor:\President Obama and the lame duck Congress pushed the START treaty through, and we've not been told how many in Congress read the accord.\Now the treaty has won initial approval in Russia's Duma (the counterpart of our Congress), but its members pointedly say that final approval won't occur until Jan. 11 at the very earliest, because they intend to study it.\Given the tendency of Congress to pass bills lawmakers haven't read, I find the Russian Duma's attitude refreshing.\Owen Nelson\Las Vegas\The great swindle\To the editor:\The Environmental Protection Agency has undertaken to save the planet from the man-caused global warming catastrophe.\That far-left conspiracy started some 40 years ago with the global cooling scam. We should have disarmed our bombers and sent them flying over the poles to cover the ice with soot to prevent huge new glaciers from crushing New York skyscrapers into dust. It continued into the 1990s with the global warming hoax. We should stop breathing, kill all the cows, nationalize oil and gas companies, coal mines, electric utilities, transportation companies and automakers.\After 12 years of substantial cooling, the 2000s brought the ""climate change"" flimflam, with the same program of massive communization. This name-changing sounded fishy, so the government-paid drones invented the cap-and-trade power grab, with the same program of massive nationalizations and impoverishment. The ultimate aim of this farce in four acts is the U.N.-sponsored world socialist government.\The Obama administration's program of communizing America has already progressed through massive nationalizations of our automobile companies, mortgage and insurance companies, banks, hospitals and medical services (to arrive shortly) and the student loan industry, to be followed in the near future by the nationalization of our energy industries, led by the EPA.\And in the meantime, the ethanol boondoggle continues to destroy the environment while increasing the cost of energy and food. The tax incentives and outright tax money giveaways to the wind and solar energy projects are as well a huge waste of our resources in exchange for ultra-expensive, unreliable, inefficient and environmentally destructive swindles. \Marc Jeric \Las Vegas\THE FINAL WORD\""We have now been awakened to the realization that war can be prevented and peace assured only when such provocations are met with a strong response.

27,"Clark County School District officials have a list of $3.5 billion in building and repair projects they say are needed to reduce crowding and fix older schools. However, because of tight budgets, they'll be able to afford less than a tenth of the work over the next few years, and that won't help student achievement.\Money from a school construction bond is running out, and voters have shown no appetite to extend it. In the meantime, school enrollment continues to grow. Last fall, the district set a record with more than 313,000 students, and elementary schools were 14 percent over capacity.\As the school year starts this month, officials are trying to make do with what they have, and the school board recently approved a capital budget that covers just a fraction of what's needed. ...\The district will try to relieve crowding with portable classrooms, but they are not a good option, much less a panacea. ...\Pushing off building programs is pushing our children and our future in the wrong direction. Elected officials and voters should make this an issue this election. If Nevada is to move forward, it needs an educated population. But that won't happen in substandard schools.\It's beyond time to fund schools. It's not just the moral, decent thing to do, it is absolutely essential for Nevada's future.\-- Las Vegas Sun, Aug. 10\State must do more to attract good teachers\The Clark County School District's growing enrollment and pursuit of smaller class sizes has led to a familiar problem -- a shortage of licensed educators.\When the new school year starts in two weeks, the district expects to fill about 400 teacher vacancies with substitutes. As reported by the Review-Journal's Trevon Milliard, the number would be slightly worse than last year, when classes started with 350 long-term substitutes on the job, but better than each of the previous five years, which began with between 406 and 692 vacancies. And hiring was an annual crisis for the country's fifth-largest school system before the onset of the Great Recession.\The district's hiring challenges aren't as bad as they could be because the system has taken many steps over the past few years to minimize vacancies and put well-qualified teachers in every classroom. But the system and the state must do more to attract more teaching applicants, because Clark County's instructional needs will grow even faster in years ahead. ...\Teachers must have a minimum level of training and education (not to mention a background free of criminal behavior). But education colleges and protectionist credentials have never been the answer to teacher shortages. Schools should want instructors from a variety of educational and professional backgrounds. That's especially important in low-income schools, which often have the hardest time filling vacancies.\Incentives will certainly help. That's why the 2015 Legislature should consider restoring an expired policy that helped alleviate previous teacher shortages: a $2,000 hiring bonus for all new educators.\-- Las Vegas Review-Journal, Aug. 10\Tax will hit our region harder than others\Perhaps if you're just driving your Prius over to the mall for a new sweater, or popping into the bakery for a fresh croissant, you won't notice the increase in the gas tax that's coming our way.\But if your job's in the Bay Area, or you have to visit far-flung customers once a week, or you're hauling tomatoes from fields to processing plants, that increase is going to hurt.\That's why we believe Assemblyman Henry Perea of Fresno is justified in asking for a three-year delay on the cap-and-trade rule that would require energy companies to purchase greenhouse-gas emission credits for transportation fuels beginning Jan. 1. The costs of those credits will likely cause the price of gasoline and diesel to go up 12 to 17 cents a gallon -- and potentially more, depending on demand for credits in state auctions.\Perea says he's trying to protect the parts of California struggling with double-digit unemployment, low wages and limited public transportation options. That's us. ...\In early July, 16 Democrats sent a letter urging the Air Resources Board to delay the credit requirements.\That was countered by 32 Democrats asking Gov. Jerry Brown to make certain the deadline stays put. Maybe there's room for compromise.\The governor could send part of that money back to low-income drivers in gas rebates. Or maybe the state can buy us all Priuses.\-- Merced (Calif.) Sun-Star, Aug. 10\Party fizzles at Chico State -- and that's welcome news\There are occasions when losing is better than winning, and that upside-down concept is evident with the recent announcement of the top party school in the nation. It wasn't Chico State University.\The reason to celebrate the omission may puzzle some in our area, but readers with history here know why. It's taken a lot of work to erase that image.\Back in the 1980s, Chico was listed by Playboy magazine as the top party school in the nation.\That ranking was unfortunate because it brought all kinds of notoriety to Chico.\Many of us held our breath as we checked Princeton Review's rankings last week, but it was good to see Syracuse University in New York at the top. We wish Syracuse the best, because we have some sense of what's ahead.\It wasn't long after Chico State's name appeared on the party schools list that bad things started happening here. It may only be coincidence, but we think not. It started small and ramped up. ...\That reputation had such a damaging effect in other local arenas that it was surprising. Business and city leaders did their best to counter it, pointing out the town's strengths and accomplishments. The university also had to work extra hard to convince parents that Chico State provided a safe environment for their children.\Little by little, Chico's rowdy reputation has dissipated, but it's taken an extraordinary community and university effort to make that happen.\We have a pretty good idea what Syracuse and any other university on that list faces.\Some of us still hear about that old image of Chico and are grateful it's dying.\We wonder if those who flippantly place rankings on communities know the damage they cause.\-- Chico (Calif.)

28,"To the editor:\A brief article in Tuesday's Review-Journal headlined ""Report: One in four children born in 2008 in Nevada to noncitizen moms,"" really deserved more attention than what was provided by an obscure spot on Page 4B.\It appears that children born to ""noncitizen"" (i.e., foreign national or alien) moms tend not to learn English very well before starting school, requiring a whole array of bilinguals embedded into the educational system. Furthermore, ""Health care representatives said noncitizen patients often lack health insurance, which puts a strain on providers."" My gosh, what a surprise. Who could have possibly known these surprising facts? I sure wish somebody had brought this up during the past few elections.\But fear not, fellow citizens. A spokesman for the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada proposes a solution: just make the noncitizens into citizens. Then apparently these new citizens will magically know English and no longer be a burden on the medical system - or any other system for that matter. Who knew? What a brilliant solution.\But why stop there? Let's take this just a little bit further and make everybody in the whole world a U.S. citizen. Then every person in the world will instantly speak a common language and will be a productive, contributing non-burden. All we need to do is pass some legislation and enjoy the resulting utopia.\James Moldenhauer\North Las Vegas\On target\To the editor:\Rarely do I agree with a Review-Journal editorial, particularly on education. Sunday's editorial on ending social promotion, however, was on target.\If I applied to medical school, I shouldn't be accepted, because I do not have the necessary skills. I would be lost, and I would fail.\Social promotion puts kids in a position where many are basically drowning, while teachers may be discouraged from allowing their grades to reflect this. That, in turn, misleads parents into believing their kids are proficient or higher.\It is a maddening situation. Too many students lack prerequisite skills. More and more hours are required of teachers yearly, it seems, in an attempt to meet the literally impossible demand of bringing these students to proficiency level. Many, including our governor-elect, Brian Sandoval, call for our pay to be tied to student achievement. The problems with that should be obvious.\But Mr. Sandoval has also spoken about supporting retention for younger students who have poor reading comprehension, we'll soon have a new superintendent, and the Review-Journal and I are actually on the same page on this, so maybe there's hope after all. Of course, any solution requires intelligent implementation, and that may be another story.\Betty Buehler\Las Vegas\It's the record\To the editor:\Reading the Tuesday article ""Titus vows to keep fighting,"" I was struck by how deeply out of touch some Democrats are about the recent election.\Defeated Rep. Dina Titus says, ""It was a tough year for Democrats. My legislative record didn't seem to matter."" No, Ms. Titus, it was exactly your record that mattered. You voted for Obamacare, cap and trade, and the failed stimulus, despite the objections of constituents - and you knew you couldn't run on that record. So instead, you ran a dirty smear campaign against your opponent, Joe Heck, packed with lies and half-truths.\Why would anyone support a health care bill that raises costs while devastating Medicare? Why would we support a bill that would make energy prices skyrocket while doing nothing for the environment? Who would support a stimulus (aka porkulus) bill that sends billions of dollars overseas even as our unemployment rate continues to rise?\That legislative record is what defeated you.\Ellen Shaw\Henderson\Saddam's game\To the editor:\I read Jane Ann Morrison's Monday column regarding her interview with FBI Special Agent George Piro with great interest. Mr. Piro related his experiences as the sole person responsible for the debriefing of Saddam Hussein. After many months of developing a relationship, Hussein related to Mr. Piro the actions he took to convince the world that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\He did a superior job of it, as evidenced by the fact that all western intelligence agencies and world leaders believed it to be true.

This is when the slander about President Bush lying to the people about WMDs in Iraq started.\Despite this information from Mr. Piro, we continue to get the misinformed letters to the editor about President Bush lying to the American people and the mainstream media letting this slander continue with no rebuttal.

29,"The overall outlook for Northern Nevada is better as three forecasts for the region last week took a more optimistic turn for 2013.\Several interesting observations were made at the Builders Association of Northern Nevada forecast, Colliers International commercial real estate event and Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada luncheon.\Several speakers noted the region has taken steps to recover.\Here are 10 of the most interesting tidbits that the Reno Gazette-Journal learned at these events and why they matter.\1: More dollar-type stores moved in\Four out of seven leases of more than 10,000 square feet were by Family Dollar and 99 Cents Only Stores.\Why it matters: The area is seeing mid-range retailers squeezed out of the market. The weakness in the middle-class consumer base is driving the rise of value stores.\2: California businesses look for new digs\The Golden State has passed several laws, such as Proposition 30, which increases income taxes, and a cap-and-trade program, which might alienate businesses there. Real estate agents are fielding calls from California owners who are looking to move businesses away from those regulations.\Why it matters: Nevada always has been known for its business-friendly environment. Emigrating businesses bring new jobs, which Nevada needs to recover, and are a priority for leaders.\3: Homebuyers are using more cash to finance deals\In 2012, 28 percent of existing homes bought were cash-only deals, up from 6 percent from the peak of 2005.\Why it matters: Most of these cash-only deals are by investors who are looking to flip a home for profit or use it as a rental property. First-time homebuyers, who need to get conventional financing such as bank loans, are finding it hard to compete.\4: Short sales make up half of resales\In 2011, sales were about equally divided between bank-owned, short sales and no condition purchases. In 2012, short sales rose to 47 percent of sales, while foreclosures made up 11 percent of the total.\Why it matters: The market has worked through the distressed home inventory, but with stricter documentation regulations it's not being replaced quickly enough. Banks and home owners are turning to short sales to unload properties quicker.\5: Shadow inventory: 12,000 homes\Steve Schiller, president of Ticor Title of Nevada Inc., estimates that there's a potential of 12,000 homes in the shadow inventory, which are properties that are distressed or involved in the foreclosure process.\Why it matters: The shadow inventory could make up about 6.5 percent of the homes in Washoe County. One worry is how fast the banks will release the distressed properties and another is how much the Reno-Sparks market can absorb without causing another steep drop in prices. With the National Mortgage Settlement and Assembly Bill 284, the area probably won't see increases in foreclosure properties until late in the year.\6: Washoe County's population recovers\According to the latest state demographic figures, Washoe County's population now is 427,704. It has surpassed 2008's figure of 423,833.\Why it matters: The biggest growth will come from the baby boomers. As the demographics move toward an older-age growth, infrastructure changes will be necessary to adapt to their needs. Population growth also signals job growth.\7: Job generators shift\A five-county analysis of Carson City, Douglas, Lyon, Storey and Washoe counties shows that the health care industry was the only sector to see significant growth since 2002.\Why it matters: Once prominent industries are suffering from recession and many jobs have been lost. In 2002, the top five employers were casino hotels, retail, manufacturing, health care and construction. In 2011, the top five were retail, health care, manufacturing, casino hotels and government. Construction dropped to 10th.\8: Data centers now are the area's second hottest prospect\The sector currently accounts for 12 percent of all projects in EDAWN's pipeline. This is second only to manufacturing, which accounts for 44 percent of those prospects.\Why it matters: The emergence of data centers as a viable industry for Northern Nevada provides another area of opportunity for a region eager to diversify its economy. The area already is considered an ideal location for data centers, thanks to its low risk for natural disasters, as well as access to a strong fiber grid. In addition to being in the highly prized tech industry, data centers also are a potential high-growth sector as consumers start using more cloud and online services. Economic activity from support services could also help make up for data centers' traditionally lower job count.\9: The push for developing a community venture fund\Why it matters: Most new job growth is driven by startups. A lack of available capital within the area, however, is forcing promising entrepreneurs to seek funding out of state -- sometimes even moving their entire operation outside Nevada. Competition among states for new startups also is fierce and will only get stronger as the nation moves to a more tech-based economy. To prevent brain drain and help incubate more startups locally, EDAWN announced that it will work with its partners to increase capital available to entrepreneurs, setting its goal at $10 million.\10: Site visits by companies increase\In 2011, the greater Reno-Sparks metro area averaged 4.2 site visits per month. In 2012, visits by companies looking to potentially expand or relocate to the area averaged 7.8 per month, an increase of 85 percent.\Why it matters: An increase in visits by companies to the area is a good sign for a number of reasons. For one, it's a sign that the economy is improving overall. Second, it also shows that despite Reno's image problems, it's still an attractive area to many companies, thanks to an ideal location and friendlier business climate in comparison to its high-profile neighbor California. Add an 80 percent closure rate in the last year by EDAWN, and the visitation trend bodes well for a region still suffering from a high jobless rate.\Coming Sunday\Reporter Yun Long will take an in-depth look into the retail trends coming to Reno, including new restaurants.\ID_Code: J7-301230060"

John McCain unveiled a comprehensive energy plan in a speech at UNLV on Wednesday that he said would allow the country to achieve ""strategic energy independence"" in the next 17 years.
\
Dubbed the ""Lexington Project,"" for the Revolutionary War site, the plan includes a number of far-reaching measures, including offshore oil drilling and tax credits for owners of low-emission vehicles.
\
Perhaps most relevant to Nevadans is his proposal to expand nuclear power. If elected, McCain said he would push for building 45 nuclear reactors by 2030 -- and a total of 100 new plants overall beyond that.
\
""It is safe, it is proven and it is essential to America's energy future,"" McCain said, citing the efforts of France and other countries that draw much of their energy from nuclear plants.
\
Troubling for Nevada, though, are the implications of such a plan. The state is home to Yucca Mountain, the country's lone proposed dump site for used but still highly radioactive fuel rods. Nevada officials have fought the project for 20 years and say the federal government has used questionable science to justify an unsafe project.
\
To be sure, President Bush carried Nevada twice, despite his support for Yucca Mountain.
\
McCain acknowledged the challenges to reviving the nearly moribund nuclear industry and storing the waste safely but provided few specifics on how they would be accomplished. ""We will need to recover all the knowledge and skills that have been lost over three stagnant decades in
\
a highly technical field,"" he said in his remarks to more than 200 supporters. ""As Nevadans are well-aware, we will need to solve complex problems of moving and storing materials that will always need safeguarding.""
\
The Arizona senator, who also collected $3 million at two private fundraisers and opened a campaign headquarters in Henderson, was considerably less strident in Las Vegas than he was at a campaign stop in Santa Barbara, Calif., on Tuesday, when he took an apparent dig at Nevada.
\
""It's not a technological breakthrough that needs to be taken; it's a NIMBY problem,"" he said, using the acronym for ""not in my back yard."" ""We've got to have the guts and courage to do what other countries are doing, and they are reducing the pollution to our environment rather dramatically without any huge pain to anybody.""
\
McCain's visit to Las Vegas drew sharp criticism from local surrogates of presidential rival Barack Obama, who outlined his energy plan here Tuesday during a visit to the Las Vegas Springs Preserve.
\
In a conference call set up by the Democratic National Committee, Clark County Commission Chairman Rory Reid said McCain ""believes Nevada is a wasteland.""
\
Reid, the son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, added: ""While Sen. McCain wants to bury the most toxic substance known to man in our state, Sen. Obama wants to spend billions of dollars to invest in new technologies that will create 5 million new jobs across the country.""
\
Environmentalists also pounced. The Sierra Club promoted video of an interview posted on YouTube in which McCain says he is uncomfortable with the idea of nuclear waste traveling through his state on its way to Yucca Mountain.
\
In his visit Tuesday, Obama reiterated his belief that nuclear power should not be ruled out but insisted it is not a viable alternative until concerns about storing the waste safely are resolved. He opposes the Yucca Mountain project but supports research on waste storage and recycling.
\
McCain and Obama have starkly different views on energy but agree on some general principles. Both candidates support a cap-and-trade system to curb carbon emissions, new regulations to prevent speculators from driving up the price of oil on international energy markets and government investment in renewable energy research. Both also support ""clean coal"" as a potential energy alternative. McCain said Tuesday that his administration would commit $2 billion a year until 2024 to ""refine the techniques and equipment"" to burn coal ""cleanly.""
\
Environmentalists are divided over when and even whether ""clean coal"" -- which for them means coal plants that completely capture and safely store greenhouse gas emissions -- will be commercially available. The utility industry admits the technology is likely at least a decade off, perhaps two.
\
Both candidates also make the case that energy independence is intractably linked to national security.
\
The biggest dust-up has come over the issue of offshore drilling. McCain recently dropped his opposition to the idea and made it the first plank in his energy platform Wednesday.
\
Though he did not mention his Democratic opponent by name, McCain took a veiled shot at Obama, decrying opponents of his energy proposals as clinging to a ""timid litany of limitations.""
\
On Wednesday, McCain issued a ""clean car challenge"" to automakers, proposing a consumer tax credit of up to $5,000 for cars with low to zero carbon emissions. McCain has offered a $300 million prize to anyone who can develop a car battery that would surpass existing hybrid or electric power as well.
\
He also called for a federal standard to ""level the playing field for all alcohol fuels (to) break the monopoly of gasoline."" And on that count, McCain draws another contrast to Obama, who supports government subsidies for corn ethanol. McCain opposes them.
\
In addition to eliminating ethanol subsidies, McCain would kill the tariff the United States now imposes on ethanol imports made from sugar cane, which packs a bigger energy punch than the corn-based fuel and is cheaper to produce. Obama, on the other hand, supports the tariff.

31,"To the editor:\Our schools need new revenue sources, and most parents want their kids to succeed in school. So I suggest that we add a new category of taxes in the spirit of sin taxes. These would focus on the many impediments to learning that kids face today.\We could start by taxing text messages.\Parents buying cell phones and unlimited text plans for their children would pay a one-time fee that would go straight to an education fund.\We could follow up with mechanical pencils. The lead breaks about every 10 seconds, and the kids constantly run out of lead. Many students throw the empty pencils on the classroom floor, often after breaking them to pieces. They do not seem to mind having their parents pay for more of them, so why not gather some tax revenue from their stupidity?\Video game systems, game rentals, comic books, iPods, and social networking sites would be more controversial targets.\If the children and their parents respond, the revenue would dry up fast - but the measures would have a beneficial effect on learning.\WILLIAM R. FOUTS\LAS VEGAS\A little gas\To the editor:\I recently took an informal poll regarding how much of the Earth's atmosphere is made up of CO2. None of the handful of people I asked knew the answer, and several guessed more than 50 percent.\The truth is that less than 0.04 percent of the atmosphere is made up of CO2. Do you really think we should risk bankrupting our economy over a gas that not only makes up a miniscule portion of our atmosphere, but is vitally important to plant life and our environment?\Neither do I. \Chris Miller\Las Vegas\With alarm\To the editor:\In response to your Sept. 26 editorial, what if man is responsible for global warming and the alarmists are right that we will soon render the planet uninhabitable? By their own accounts, we must drastically reduce our greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide).\But what if the culprit isn't carbon dioxide? What if methane or some other trace gas in the atmosphere causes global warming? What if water molecules in the atmosphere (clouds) cause climate change? After all, there is no scientific evidence supporting any of these theories, only guesses and computer models.\So the alarmists tell us we must pass legislation that most economists believe will likely weaken our economy, even though they can't possibly know if the legislation will work. The House Democrats recently passed a cap-and-trade bill that they say will somewhat reduce man-made carbon dioxide. They are willing to raise utility and other costs in order to implement a process that alarmists believe won't reduce greenhouse gasses nearly enough. (The Democrats believe the conversion to alternative clean energy will be the answer, but there is no way that the worldwide economy can be converted soon enough to achieve the goals of the alarmists.)\No wonder they can't explain themselves. And these same Democrats want us to believe they have the knowledge to run our health care system. Scary, isn't it?\Bob Anderson\Las Vegas\Real remorse\To the editor:\Rob a bank of $50,000 and get 20 years in prison. Steal $97 million from 134 people and get 10 years in a prison of your choice - you'll probably serve less than five years (""Southwest Exchange kingpin gets 10-year prison sentence,"" Sept. 16). Who wouldn't give up five years for $97 million?\Donald McGhan of Southwest Exchange Co. said ""My pain may never go away."" Boy, that sounds like real remorse. Think of the 134 people who have lost their retirement, life savings, homes, marriages and possibly worse. Their pain will never go away.\Oh, I forgot to mention that McGhan was also sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $97 million in restitution. I bet the check is in the mail.\McGhan's lawyer stated that his client is kind and caring. I would hate to think what he would have done had he been mean and thoughtless. His lawyer also stated that McGhan did not violate the trust of Southwest Exchange clients, only that of Southwest Exchange. Give me a break; he knew exactly who he was hurting.\McGhan says he prays for forgiveness every day. I bet for the more than two years he was stealing and enjoying the high life with other people's money he was praying he would not be caught. It is a shame, but white-collar crime does pay.\If this sounds cynical, it is meant to be.\JERRY BENDORF\LAS VEGAS\Dominate our lives\To the editor:\My thanks and appreciation to Thomas Alton for his letter (""Real grass roots,"" Sept. 26), and for his very astute observations in determining the difference between disenchanted citizens exercising their constitutional rights and paid political organizers with a much different agenda. It is indeed shameful that many in our Congress, especially the leadership, do not have the insight of Mr. Alton.\A quote from a patriot of many years ago might be appropriate here. ""The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people. It is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and our interests."" That was Patrick Henry, 1736-1799.\AL CIRCILLO\LAS VEGAS\Mad as hell\To the editor:\What's with the Democrats in Congress? We threw Tea Parties like crazy and they turned a deaf ear. Even laughed at us. And now, every poll for the past month shows a majority of Americans do not want Obamacare.\If Harry Reid and his cohorts invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"" and ram the Baucus bill through the Senate, then they are no longer Democrats, but despots, and they sow the seeds of revolution.\King George turned a deaf ear also. Watch out, 2010. Here come the voters, and they're mad as hell.\GLEN B. DUNNING\LAS VEGAS\But Barack ...\To the editor:\In response to a recent letter to the editor, I think the reason most new-age liberals and gullible youngsters did not respect President George W. Bush (and Vice President Dick Cheney) was because he wasn't an agnostic socialist with Marxist-Leninist leanings and messianic delusions.\Now, as for President Barack Obama ...\KENT RISCHLING\LAS VEGAS\Out of town fan\To the editor:\Regarding Thomas Mitchell's Sept. 27 column, in which he discussed a subscriber who had written in, complaining that reading the Review-Journal is like ""watching Fox News"":\As someone who lived in Las Vegas for 13 years, and recently relocated to D.C., I can without hesitation explain to that reader that the Review-Journal is a breath of fresh air when compared to The Washington Post. The Post examines every political issue under a microscope, with a liberal bent, until one is almost numbingly incoherent.\We really miss the down-to-earth articles in the Review-Journal.

32,"Re: ""Biden must focus on reliable electricity,"" Jan. 20:\Who could argue with this statement? It is the conclusion I find flabbergasting.\Transitioning to carbon-free electricity will create millions of good-paying jobs. And, when we stop burning fossil fuels, especially coal, we also reduce air pollution. That saves lives and reduces the cost of health care.\Matthew Kandrach's column looks at historical prices but completely neglects the current market price of electricity generation. The cost of solar photovoltaic energy is competitive with natural gas and less than coal. The price of solar has dropped 87%, and the price of wind dropped 83%. American ingenuity being what it is, those prices will continue to go down.\So why did Texas utility prices spike during the heat wave of 2019? It had nothing to do with wind conditions. The heat wave created record demand for power, forcing the Griddy Energy company to run every available plant at full capacity. Except some couldn't for operational reasons: A coal-fired unit in Houston, a combined-cycle gas-fired unit in South Texas and a steam generation unit in North Texas all failed to run as expected, straining the grid even more, according to the Dallas Morning News. When demand spikes, prices go up.\We can expect more severe heat waves with global warming. And cities like Reno have a rapidly growing population that wants A/C in the summer.\The easiest way to transition to carbon-free electricity is to put a price on carbon. We know burning fossil fuels causes damage that will be paid in the future.\Let's build the cost of that damage into the current price of fossil fuels. Then let the market decide on the best way to have safe, reliable, and affordable electricity.\Michelle Hamilton, Reno\Biden's actions on environment\will make things worse\In his first days in office President Biden has enacted several new executive orders that reflect limited thoughtfulness and mostly pander to left-leaning supporters and poorly informed environmentalists.\I refer specifically to cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline and a ban on new drilling on federal lands. The desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning away from fossil fuels is laudable, but stopping new, state-of-the-art infrastructure projects such as the Keystone Pipeline will do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and only elevates the risk of environmental damage as much of that same crude will now be transported by trains and trucks and barges on our roads and waterways. And Canada will simply find alternative export routes for the remainder.\In the meantime, the U.S. will continue to rely on a less reliable, aging pipeline infrastructure.\The impact of these types of decisions easily can be seen in California, which now has rolling blackouts, planned blackouts and fires induced from an aging infrastructure while that state spends money needed for maintenance and safety on more politically appealing renewables.\Banning drilling on federal lands is equally shortsighted. Decreasing the homegrown supply of oil and gas does not make much sense if those same volumes now need to be imported, with associated costs and risks of transporting such product, from other countries.\I am sure some people believe these moves will foster a faster transition away from fossil fuels, but what we are really doing is placing the United States at a competitive disadvantage when market forces and technology advances will ultimately achieve the same result.\And with all due respect, the idea that we will completely transition away from oil and gas is ludicrous. Petroleum products make up a significant portion of items used to improve the value of our daily lives.\It is hard to imagine a world where we return to using cane fishing poles, hickory shafted golf clubs and wooden bowls and utensils.\President Biden should appreciate this also since he owns and used to drive a classic 1963 Corvette Stingray.\John Naphan, Reno"
33,"
Proposals to build coal-fired power plants have brought the debate over global climate change home to Nevadans. Coal provides half the nation's electricity, and a fifth of Nevada's power, but many people think it's time to break our reliance on the shiny black rock and start using the sun, wind and heat of the Earth for a new generation of power plants.
\
Environmentalists say pollution from coal plants will make people sick, ruin the air and harm plants and animals.
\
Power plant developers say they're necessary to keep Las Vegas homes and casinos cool and bright, and that renewable energy can't meet growing power demand in the Southwest without sending power bills through the roof.
\
But opponents of the plants, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid among them, say utilities are gambling with ratepayers' money. The price of Sierra Pacific Resources' proposed plant near Ely has swelled to $5 billion over the past two years. With Congress poised to levy taxes on every ton of carbon dioxide emitted by power plants, this cheap fuel might not end up being so cheap after all.
\
Despite protests by Nevadans who live near the proposed plants, their developers are pushing forward with plans for two coal-fired plants outside Ely, in White Pine County. One would generate 1,500 megawatts and the other 1,590. A 750-megawatt plant is planned for the Mesquite area of northern Clark County. The three plants would power 2.8 million single-family homes, producing more than 30 million tons per year of greenhouse gases.
\
The Sun invited four experts to come to our
\
office and discuss these plans. Two favored the plants, two opposed them. None of the four had ever sat down together.
\
We asked a few questions but mostly let them talk among themselves. What followed was one of the Sun's most contentious Sunday Conversations, with a little shouting and a few mild insults. After the camera stopped rolling, they argued on for 20 minutes.
\
What role should coal play in Nevada's energy future, and how will that role affect consumers, human health and the environment?
\
Tim Hay: Nevada has a plethora of renewable resources. As the cost of fossil fuels increases, the cost of most of the renewable fuels -- primarily geothermal in the north, some wind in the north and solar in the south -- will decrease. Nevada doesn't need coal power the way other states do.
\
Roberto Denis: If we're talking about resources within the state, we do not have nuclear power, we do not have any hydro. Nevada is the poor cousin in the West with regards to the amount of coal power that it has. Utah, for example, gets more than 90 percent of its electricity from coal. We have about 20 percent coal. We have a bounty of renewables to tap, but even that is not sufficient. And since 2004 we will have added 3,800 megawatts of gas-fired power. (A megawatt is enough power for about 750 single-family homes.)
\
Lydia Ball: Nevada does not have coal supplies. So not only will we spend money on these increasingly expensive coal plants, but we are also going to be spending money on the shipment of coal to Nevada.
\
Denis: Nevada does not have gas either, but gets 70 percent of its electricity from that fuel.
\
Joe Lucas: Nevada is unique. Energy demand across the country is doubling about every 15 years. It's doubling every six or seven years in Nevada. It's the fastest growing state in the nation, and because of that Nevada is best served by keeping all the energy options on the table -- coal, wind, gas, geothermal -- because it is not going to be able to meet the growing demand for electricity even if Nevadans become more energy efficient. Coal must be part of the mix. If not, the demand for reliable electricity will not be met.
\
Ball: We have 1,500 megawatts of geothermal potential in Northern Nevada. Why aren't we actively looking at that and spending the $5 billion Sierra Pacific Resources plans to spend building a new power plant near Ely on cultivating geothermal? It meets your criteria for base power, for 24-hour power.
\
Denis: If we could spend the $5 billion today, and satisfy the needs of the state with renewable energy, that is exactly what we would do. It will take a decade or more to develop 1,500 megawatts of geothermal.
\
Ball: Your coal plant is not going to be operating now until about 2015.
\
Lucas: This is not about one energy resource or another. This is about having the right mix. Building a coal plant today doesn't mean we won't develop renewables.
\
Ball: We, too, are advocating balanced energy choices. Only we would like that balance to include more renewables. The state law requiring Sierra Pacific Resources to generate 20 percent of its power from renewables by 2015 should be a floor, not a ceiling. Every presentation I've seen from Sierra Pacific Resources only puts that at 20 percent. That's your goal. Why isn't it higher?
\
Denis: Our CEO has said that's a floor, not a ceiling. However, we have to be realistic about how long it takes to develop geothermal. Our blessing in this state is geothermal, not solar, not wind. Geothermal has steady output and a low cost relative to the other technologies. And, indeed, we should be tapping that. We have a 3,000-megawatt deficit between the current demand and the power generation we own. And the demand is growing by 250 megawatts a year.
\
Ball: We also have public health issues. There are 140,000 people in the state of Nevada who have asthma, 26,000 of them children. Coal plants exacerbate respiratory problems.
\
Lucas: Over the last 30 years the incidents of childhood asthma have skyrocketed, while emissions from coal-based power plants have dropped. Air quality is affected by a lot of different things. You're implying that people walk around with an air mask on that's connected to the top of a power plant.
\
Ball: According to the American Lung Association, there are 28,000 deaths per year from power plant pollution.
\
Lucas: The American Lung Association also says outdoor air quality is 100 times better than indoor air quality and today children spend much more time inside than they do outside.
\
Denis: If you objectively look at our plans, we are going to build the 1,500-megawatt Ely Energy Center and we're going to shut down 300 megawatts of facilities at Reid Gardner. Those three facilities, the 300 megawatts at Reid Gardner, are 20 percent the size and emit more regulated pollutants than Ely will. So aren't we cleaning up the air by doing that?
\
Ball: We can do more. There are other ways of meeting our energy demand.
\
Denis: Our strategy is to do as much energy efficiency and conservation as possible. The cleanest kilowatt is the kilowatt that's never produced. The second leg of the strategy is to either purchase or invest in renewables. Then the last is conventional fuels. We use a significant amount of gas already. It's not an issue of wanting to do renewables, it's an issue of reliability. Because renewables are all capital investment, on which we earn a profit, we stand to profit more from renewables. The issue is, can we do it fast enough to keep the lights on?
\
Ball: But if you start now ..
\
Denis:We have started now. Just because we build these gas plants now and we build this coal plant now, they don't displace renewables. By the time we build those plants a lot of the existing plants are going to be taken out of service. What's going to replace those? Renewables are going to be a big part of our future. It cannot be done within the time frame that we need the power to keep the lights and the economy in this state going.
\
Hay: And what's the time frame for the Ely Energy Center?
\
Denis: Currently we have filed with the Public Utilities Commission for 2015, 2016.
\
Hay: And what will coal cost when that plant comes on line?
\
Denis: We haven't finalized those plans. We won't file final numbers with the commission until early 2010.
\
Hay: Peabody and other coal companies anticipate coal prices will rise 70 to 100 percent over the next couple of years. Your own estimates for the cost of the plant have gone from $3 billion two years ago to $3.8 billion a year ago to now more than $5 billion if construction were to begin today.
\
Lucas: There's a study done by the Cambridge Energy Research Associates out of Boston. They looked at the cost of building all new generation and found that because steel, cement and other things have gone up in price, the cost of big capital expenditures like power plants (has) gone up. The cost of building new nuclear went up the most. Surprisingly, the cost of building new wind went up the second most, new gas third and coal was actually at the low end, so all boats have risen with the rising sea. Obviously there has been some uptick over the years in coal prices. But if you look at coal historically, the cost of coal has been infinitesimal compared to the cost of other fuels, principally natural gas and oil, and is much less volatile.
\
Ball: You shouldn't be comparing it to natural gas and oil, you should be comparing it to renewables, the fuel for which is free.
\
Denis: What we really should be concerned about is: What's going to happen to the consumer? Because we're saying: If the cost of coal goes up and if we have a tax on emissions, then renewables are going to be cheaper in comparison.
\
Hay: Geothermal is one of your cheapest resources, cheaper than coal. Geothermal plants are isolated from fuel price volatility. So whatever that capital cost is, that's going to set the ceiling for what the power is going to cost. Wind power has declined in cost 80 percent over the last 20 years. Solar-thermal plants, like 64-megawatt Nevada Solar One in Boulder City, are enjoying a resurgence here, and they provide power at peak usage times, which is very valuable to a company like Nevada Power.
\
Denis: Do you think that the first gold that was mined in Nevada was cheaper to mine than the gold that is being mined today? The first geothermal finds are easier to find than the last.
\
Hay: The price of coal is going to go up, and the cost of your proposed coal plant has gone up $1.5 billion in the last two years.
\
Ball: Joe, you have an advertising campaign about clean coal. You're spending millions of dollars educating Nevadans, but the plants you're promoting wouldn't really be clean coal plants. A clean coal plant, at least in my definition, would remove the carbon dioxide from emissions and store it underground.
\
Lucas: That's your definition of clean. That may not be everyone else's definition.
\
Ball: Then can you define clean? Because the three companies planning coal plants in Nevada have signed agreements with the state that they will install carbon capture and storage technology when it is commercially viable. When and if that happens, with the emphasis on the if, who's going to pay for it and how much is it going to cost?
\
Lucas: It's an evolutionary process. Do you agree that the use of coal for generating electricity today is cleaner than it was 30 years ago?
\
Ball: I don't necessarily agree. It depends on whether you're talking about carbon or regulated pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and mercury.
\
Lucas: We decreased regulated pollutants and made the fleet 70 percent cleaner on average.
\
Ball: We can thank the federal government and the Clean Air Act for that. I don't think the utility industry can claim they did that voluntarily, and it has constantly broken the Clean Air Act.
\
Lucas: The industry has invested $100 billion to reduce emissions. Clean coal is an industry term that means using advanced technologies to improve the environmental performance of coal-fired power plants. They are cleaner today than they were 30 years ago, and they will be cleaner 30 years from now than they are today, including the capture and storage of greenhouse gas emissions. We are at 90 percent removal of sulfur dioxide today.
\
Denis: We have proposed 98 percent removal of sulfur dioxide at Ely.
\
Lucas: Coal is a cleaner energy resource today and will be used in Nevada and in the United States and around the world for decades to come. We're investing in the technology to make it cleaner. But coal can't meet your standard of clean.
\
Denis: We have this tremendous need in this state. The Southwest U.S., the area from which we can buy power, will have a shortfall in power supply in 2011, three years from now. Do you support our using gas? I'm trying to get to the bottom line of the Sierra Club agenda.
\
Ball: I think that a natural gas plant can be a bridge to meet demand because it has lower emissions, but we shouldn't plan to meet our future energy demands with gas or coal.
\
Denis: I am trying to get at whether the Sierra Club just has an anti-growth agenda and not really a clean agenda or a clean air agenda.
\
Ball: We are very supportive of a growth agenda in a new, clean energy economy. We have a study that 3,000 jobs could be created in the state of Nevada today if we were meeting our 20 percent renewable standard. And these are good jobs, these are not just janitor jobs at a coal plant in Ely.
\
Denis: But what's the cost?
\
Ball: What's the cost of installing carbon capture and storage on new coal plants, as you have told the state you will?
\
Denis: We will install the technology if the commission determines that it is commercially viable and cost-effective.
\
Ball: But what is the cost of that? Recent studies have shown that we don't have anywhere to store that in Nevada. So they're going to have to pipe it out? How much is that going to cost?
\
Lucas: Do you know how to drive down the cost of all these new technologies? If we go back and do what we did in the early '80s, when we first introduced the term clean coal: invest in the public-private partnership between the federal government and industry to drive down the cost of developing these technologies. Do you support increasing funding for advanced clean coal technology projects through the federal government?
\
Ball: I support increased research, but I will not support building a coal plant in Nevada where there is so much potential for renewables.
\
Hay: Do you know the relative dollar amounts for solar, wind and geothermal compared to clean coal research?
\
Lucas: If we got 20 percent of our power from new energy resources and 80 percent from another, just to be simplistic, should we spend 80 percent of our research dollars on that fuel we're using 20 percent of the time, or should we spend 80 percent of our dollars on the fuel that we use 80 percent of the time? There needs to be a balanced portfolio and the portfolio needs to be based upon how we are going to be using those fuels. With renewables, you don't have the government and the industry partnering together as with coal research and development projects, where 50 percent of funding is from the government and at least 50 percent is from private industry. You don't have that with renewable projects. It is a 100 percent government subsidy.
\
Hay: But do you know the relative dollar amounts? Probably 100 to 1.
\
There are three coal plants proposed in Nevada right now. Do we need three coal plants?
\
Ball: We don't need even one of those coal plants. There are other ways to meet the energy demand.
\
Denis: We proposed the Ely Energy Center. We serve over 90 percent of the electrical load in this state. Two other coal plant proponents say their facilities are the ones that should be built. The Public Utilities Commission said Ely Energy Center, not those other facilities, is needed to satisfy Nevada consumers. We won't buy power from those other facilities. They will not satisfy the needs of this state. You have to ask the other developers where they will sell their power. We are concerned that the resources of this state be used for the benefits of this state and not for the benefit of others. Any energy production, be it geothermal, wind, solar or fossil fuels, uses environmental resources meant for the public good and we should be wise stewards of those resources.
\
Hay: Can you tell me how well you've done meeting the renewable requirement since it took effect in 1997?
\
Denis: We have not met the solar requirement. Around 2004 we had 17 renewable energy purchase contracts signed and 11 never performed. The non-solar standard we have met. Where we have not met the standard, it has been because of the failure of some of the independent developers to come through. When we saw two years ago that renewables developers weren't delivering on contracts, we decided as a company that we were going to build our own. And that's why we have a whole area in our company dedicated to building nothing but renewables. We're partnering up with Ormat on geothermal projects and on waste heat recovery plants. We will meet the standard this year.
\
Lucas: One of the problems of adding renewables to the mix is the lack of transmission lines. As we develop new coal plants we need to build transmission to share with renewables. The problem is you don't build transmission lines for renewables because you have to back it up with a solid, traditional power source.
\
One thing we haven't talked about is congressional action on carbon emissions, a potential carbon tax or cap and trade system.
\
Ball: We have three presidential candidates right now and all of them have taken some position on a carbon tax or a carbon cap. If this happens, who is going to be paying for this? We build the coal plant now, it doesn't capture the carbon because we don't have the technology yet. But we go ahead and build it because we want to build it cheap so we can help the little guy. But in five, 10, even 25 years, how much is it going to cost the little guy?
\
Who is going to pay, and can't we assume that the cost of renewables will be more competitive in a decade thanks to technology advancements?
\
Denis: The consumer is going to pay the difference. We get into these esoteric discussions of carbon and costs. We really need to be concerned about the impact on consumers five years from now.
\
Hay: There's no cost volatility with renewables.
\
Lucas: But they're not always available when needed.
\
Hay: Geothermal is. We're talking about Nevada, more renewables than any other state, more geothermal per capita than any other state.
\
Ball: There's also solar. And in the last 30 years we have made strides. We can assume that the price of renewables is just going to decrease because technology will continue to grow. Ausra is a solar energy company that recently located a manufacturing facility in Las Vegas and is able to store solar power for 16 hours now. Soon they'll be able to store for 24 hours, making solar a baseload fuel.
\
Denis: Six years ago it cost $900 to build a wind turbine. Today it's over $2,000. It's a worldwide commodity. GE can't keep up, there's a weak dollar and production is going overseas. Prices will increase.
\
Ball: We should be building up production facilities and jobs here at home. It makes us less dependent on other countries.
\
Lucas: What about the jobs related to extraction of coal, gas and other traditional fuels? This is not an either/or proposition.
\
Denis: Everyone has a bona fide interest in the environment. I think we differ on how to move forward and how to get there. At the end of the day the utility has the responsibility for keeping the lights on and providing clean, affordable, reliable power every time you flip the switch. We can't shirk that responsibility. All the people around this table don't have that responsibility. I do and I take it very seriously.

Denis: What we really should be concerned about is: What's going to happen to the consumer? Because we're saying: If the cost of coal goes up and if we have a tax on emissions, then renewables are going to be cheaper in comparison.
\
Hay: Geothermal is one of your cheapest resources, cheaper than coal. Geothermal plants are isolated from fuel price volatility. So whatever that capital cost is, that's going to set the ceiling for what the power is going to cost. Wind power has declined in cost 80 percent over the last 20 years. Solar-thermal plants, like 64-megawatt Nevada Solar One in Boulder City, are enjoying a resurgence here, and they provide power at peak usage times, which is very valuable to a company like Nevada Power.
\
Denis: Do you think that the first gold that was mined in Nevada was cheaper to mine than the gold that is being mined today? The first geothermal finds are easier to find than the last.
\
Hay: The price of coal is going to go up, and the cost of your proposed coal plant has gone up $1.5 billion in the last two years.
\
Ball: Joe, you have an advertising campaign about clean coal. You're spending millions of dollars educating Nevadans, but the plants you're promoting wouldn't really be clean coal plants. A clean coal plant, at least in my definition, would remove the carbon dioxide from emissions and store it underground.
\
Lucas: That's your definition of clean. That may not be everyone else's definition.
\
Ball: Then can you define clean? Because the three companies planning coal plants in Nevada have signed agreements with the state that they will install carbon capture and storage technology when it is commercially viable. When and if that happens, with the emphasis on the if, who's going to pay for it and how much is it going to cost?
\
Lucas: It's an evolutionary process. Do you agree that the use of coal for generating electricity today is cleaner than it was 30 years ago?
\
Ball: I don't necessarily agree. It depends on whether you're talking about carbon or regulated pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and mercury.
\
Lucas: We decreased regulated pollutants and made the fleet 70 percent cleaner on average.
\
Ball: We can thank the federal government and the Clean Air Act for that. I don't think the utility industry can claim they did that voluntarily, and it has constantly broken the Clean Air Act.
\
Lucas: The industry has invested $100 billion to reduce emissions. Clean coal is an industry term that means using advanced technologies to improve the environmental performance of coal-fired power plants. They are cleaner today than they were 30 years ago, and they will be cleaner 30 years from now than they are today, including the capture and storage of greenhouse gas emissions. We are at 90 percent removal of sulfur dioxide today.
\
Denis: We have proposed 98 percent removal of sulfur dioxide at Ely.
\
Lucas: Coal is a cleaner energy resource today and will be used in Nevada and in the United States and around the world for decades to come. We're investing in the technology to make it cleaner. But coal can't meet your standard of clean.
\
Denis: We have this tremendous need in this state. The Southwest U.S., the area from which we can buy power, will have a shortfall in power supply in 2011, three years from now. Do you support our using gas? I'm trying to get to the bottom line of the Sierra Club agenda.
\
Ball: I think that a natural gas plant can be a bridge to meet demand because it has lower emissions, but we shouldn't plan to meet our future energy demands with gas or coal.
\
Denis: I am trying to get at whether the Sierra Club just has an anti-growth agenda and not really a clean agenda or a clean air agenda.
\
Ball: We are very supportive of a growth agenda in a new, clean energy economy. We have a study that 3,000 jobs could be created in the state of Nevada today if we were meeting our 20 percent renewable standard. And these are good jobs, these are not just janitor jobs at a coal plant in Ely.
\
Denis: But what's the cost?
\
Ball: What's the cost of installing carbon capture and storage on new coal plants, as you have told the state you will?
\
Denis: We will install the technology if the commission determines that it is commercially viable and cost-effective.
\
Ball: But what is the cost of that? Recent studies have shown that we don't have anywhere to store that in Nevada. So they're going to have to pipe it out? How much is that going to cost?
\
Lucas: Do you know how to drive down the cost of all these new technologies? If we go back and do what we did in the early '80s, when we first introduced the term clean coal: invest in the public-private partnership between the federal government and industry to drive down the cost of developing these technologies. Do you support increasing funding for advanced clean coal technology projects through the federal government?
\
Ball: I support increased research, but I will not support building a coal plant in Nevada where there is so much potential for renewables.
\
Hay: Do you know the relative dollar amounts for solar, wind and geothermal compared to clean coal research?
\
Lucas: If we got 20 percent of our power from new energy resources and 80 percent from another, just to be simplistic, should we spend 80 percent of our research dollars on that fuel we're using 20 percent of the time, or should we spend 80 percent of our dollars on the fuel that we use 80 percent of the time? There needs to be a balanced portfolio and the portfolio needs to be based upon how we are going to be using those fuels. With renewables, you don't have the government and the industry partnering together as with coal research and development projects, where 50 percent of funding is from the government and at least 50 percent is from private industry. You don't have that with renewable projects. It is a 100 percent government subsidy.
\
Hay: But do you know the relative dollar amounts? Probably 100 to 1.
\
There are three coal plants proposed in Nevada right now. Do we need three coal plants?
\
Ball: We don't need even one of those coal plants. There are other ways to meet the energy demand.
\
Denis: We proposed the Ely Energy Center. We serve over 90 percent of the electrical load in this state. Two other coal plant proponents say their facilities are the ones that should be built. The Public Utilities Commission said Ely Energy Center, not those other facilities, is needed to satisfy Nevada consumers. We won't buy power from those other facilities. They will not satisfy the needs of this state. You have to ask the other developers where they will sell their power. We are concerned that the resources of this state be used for the benefits of this state and not for the benefit of others. Any energy production, be it geothermal, wind, solar or fossil fuels, uses environmental resources meant for the public good and we should be wise stewards of those resources.
\
Hay: Can you tell me how well you've done meeting the renewable requirement since it took effect in 1997?
\
Denis: We have not met the solar requirement. Around 2004 we had 17 renewable energy purchase contracts signed and 11 never performed. The non-solar standard we have met. Where we have not met the standard, it has been because of the failure of some of the independent developers to come through. When we saw two years ago that renewables developers weren't delivering on contracts, we decided as a company that we were going to build our own. And that's why we have a whole area in our company dedicated to building nothing but renewables. We're partnering up with Ormat on geothermal projects and on waste heat recovery plants. We will meet the standard this year.
\
Lucas: One of the problems of adding renewables to the mix is the lack of transmission lines. As we develop new coal plants we need to build transmission to share with renewables. The problem is you don't build transmission lines for renewables because you have to back it up with a solid, traditional power source.
\
One thing we haven't talked about is congressional action on carbon emissions, a potential carbon tax or cap and trade system.
\
Ball: We have three presidential candidates right now and all of them have taken some position on a carbon tax or a carbon cap. If this happens, who is going to be paying for this? We build the coal plant now, it doesn't capture the carbon because we don't have the technology yet. But we go ahead and build it because we want to build it cheap so we can help the little guy. But in five, 10, even 25 years, how much is it going to cost the little guy?
\
Who is going to pay, and can't we assume that the cost of renewables will be more competitive in a decade thanks to technology advancements?
\
Denis: The consumer is going to pay the difference. We get into these esoteric discussions of carbon and costs. We really need to be concerned about the impact on consumers five years from now.
\
Hay: There's no cost volatility with renewables.
\
Lucas: But they're not always available when needed.
\
Hay: Geothermal is. We're talking about Nevada, more renewables than any other state, more geothermal per capita than any other state.
\
Ball: There's also solar. And in the last 30 years we have made strides. We can assume that the price of renewables is just going to decrease because technology will continue to grow. Ausra is a solar energy company that recently located a manufacturing facility in Las Vegas and is able to store solar power for 16 hours now. Soon they'll be able to store for 24 hours, making solar a baseload fuel.
\
Denis: Six years ago it cost $900 to build a wind turbine. Today it's over $2,000. It's a worldwide commodity. GE can't keep up, there's a weak dollar and production is going overseas. Prices will increase.
\
Ball: We should be building up production facilities and jobs here at home. It makes us less dependent on other countries.
\
Lucas: What about the jobs related to extraction of coal, gas and other traditional fuels? This is not an either/or proposition.
\
Denis: Everyone has a bona fide interest in the environment. I think we differ on how to move forward and how to get there. At the end of the day the utility has the responsibility for keeping the lights on and providing clean, affordable, reliable power every time you flip the switch. We can't shirk that responsibility. All the people around this table don't have that responsibility. I do and I take it very seriously.

34,"Most Americans consider themselves friends of the environment. They don't litter; they try to conserve. Given the chance, they'll sort their trash in an effort to contribute to recycling.\Told that Earth is in a warming trend and the results could be bad, they show an admirable participatory spirit. They want to do something.\But just as the advocates of big government are past masters at harnessing Americans' charitable instincts, so does a new generation of bureaucrats and politicians now aim to use Americans' warm feelings about ""environmentalism"" to consolidate even more power in Washington.\""Something must be done!"" shriek those who insist that the warming of the Earth at the rate of 1 or 2 degrees per century is responsible for every current bad outcome, from droughts to hurricanes to forest fires - and that it's somehow in our power to reverse this trend.\But what? What is it they want done?\""All of the leading Democratic contenders for the presidency are committed to a set of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that would change the way Americans light their homes, fuel their automobiles and do their jobs, costing billions of dollars in the short term,"" The Washington Post reported this week.\And all this will ""require a wholesale transformation of the nation's economy and society.""\What will this look like? What will it cost, and who will pay? \According to energy expert Tracy Terry's analysis of a recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, under the scenario of an 80 percent reduction in emissions from 1990 levels, by 2015 Americans could be paying 30 percent more for natural gas in their homes, and even more for electricity, The Post reports. ""At the same time, the cost of coal could quadruple and crude oil prices could rise by an additional $24 a barrel.""\That means gasoline at well over $4 per gallon, and a likely doubling of your electric bill. And these are the low-ball estimates of those who favor these heavy-handed, job-slashing industrial cutbacks.\Democrats ""have promised to ease the pain by taking the money that would come from putting a price on carbon, whether through a tax or auctioning off pollution credits, and investing it in technological research, job training, tax credits for consumers who buy cleaner vehicles and subsidies for those hit hardest by rising electric bills,"" the Post reports.\Just how much ""pain"" - how hard a ""hit"" - are we talking about?\Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the one Democrat so far to come out in public for a direct carbon tax, ""has vowed to use the $50 billion that would be generated each year to fast-track research, development and deployment of renewable and energy-efficient technologies,"" The Post reports\Now, if someone wanted to raise $50 billion to build more coal-fired power plants or emission-free nuclear power plants to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, that would be one thing. If someone wanted to see $50 billion invested in exploring for and developing new oil fields in Alaska or in the Gulf of Mexico to decrease our dependence on imported oil, that would be another.\But Democrats are not proposing to ""invest"" all these additional funds to give us faster growth with cheaper energy. No. Their long-term goal is to make us survive on less energy, and pay a lot more for what little our ration cards will still allow us to use.\""Democrats' boldness ... could carry a political price,"" the Post warns. ""The eventual GOP presidential nominee is almost certain to attack Democrats over the huge costs associated with limiting emissions.""\Claiming to be green and donating a few thousand dollars to pay some outfit to plant trees to ""compensate"" for the amounts of kerosene their campaign planes burn as they fly around the country is all very nice.\But as the brownouts become more frequent, as our electric bills climb along with highway death tolls in the little tin-foil cars Detroit has to build - as our economic well-being continues to decline in contrast to the booming economies of India and China, which continue to burn all the dirty coal they please - is ""Turn out the lights, we're the Democrats!"" really likely to prove a winning campaign slogan in the early 21st century?"
35," WASHINGTON _ Just by mentioning the possibility of raising energy taxes, the Clinton administration has:\ _Ticked off middle class voters who thought they had a promise from the president to lower _ not raise _ their taxes.\ _Sent the energy industry into a free-for-all internal fight over which types of taxes would help or hurt which types of energy.\ _Pitted environmentalists against industry over the question of how high energy taxes can be raised to help the environment without damaging the economy.\ The struggle began shortly after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" Jan. 24, ""a broad-based energy tax is certainly one of those things that is on the table as an option to be considered because it raises revenue and helps lead to some environmental objectives.""\ Energy taxes hit the middle class and poor more sharply than the rich because people with lower income use a greater percentage of their money to buy gasoline and to pay for heating and air conditioning.\ Clinton began his presidential campaign by promising a middle-class tax cut, and one of the first questions to hit him during his Town Hall meeting in Detroit on Wednesday was whether he would keep that promise.\ The president replied that he had made no read-my-lips pledge, and that the federal deficit is $50 billion worse than he had expected. That answer paves the way for a series of tax proposals the president probably will make in his address to Congress next Wednesday.\ The easiest energy tax to collect would be on gasoline. The federal government already charges 14.1 cents per gallon, and it could simply add a few more cents at the gas pump. A 1 cent increase in gasoline taxes raises between $800 million and $1 billion annually.\ Environmentalists and some economists were calling for a gasoline tax as high as $1 a gallon that would not only raise a lot of revenue but also induce people to drive cars with greater fuel efficiency.\ But gasoline taxes hit the middle class and rural residents hardest because they are often the ones who have to drive the farthest to get to work.\ ""In the president's own home state of Arkansas, people use twice as much fuel per capita than do residents of Washington, D.C.,"" said Tom Donahue, of the American Trucking Association, a leading opponent of gasoline tax increases. ""Rural Americans will shoulder a 62 percent greater burden per capita than urban residents for a fuel tax for deficit reduction.""\ For that reason, Bentsen advocated a broad-base energy tax that would raise revenue from a variety of fuels. But how that tax is structured will make a difference in who supports it.\ Environmentalists favor a carbon tax, which taxes a fuel according to how much carbon dioxide it releases. Environmentalists consider carbon dioxide a leading contributor to global warming."
36," Flying down to Rio in June might sound like a ""fun"" summer interlude to George Bush, who must be eager to get away from it all during this uncertain presidential campaign. But President Bush is not Fred Astaire, and he won't dance to a happy ending if he lets himself be lured into attending the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development on June 1-12 in Rio de Janeiro.\ The propaganda fingers of the media, the ""greens"" and even the children's cartoons are reaching out to try to entrap him. Bush will do himself and our nation a favor if he stays home and addresses the American voters instead of pandering to special-interest agitators who will never support him.\ The UNCED conference, billed as the ""Earth Summit,"" is expected to attract the largest gathering of world leaders ever staged. The purpose of the Summit, they say, is to produce a global response to the so-called ""greenhouse warming"" theory by negotiating and signing international environmental treaties that will affect the entire world into the 21st century.\ The real result will be, of course, to set up yet another permanent international bureaucracy financed by bleeding the American taxpayers and transferring the fruits of our labor to ungrateful, unproductive, Third World dictators and the political-military cliques that keep them in power. This is just another expensive sideshow of the New World Order.\ Science does not support radical proposals to address global warming. Science does not even agree on whether warming is good or bad, and many believe that, by lengthening the growing seasons, it would enhance agricultural yields and increase the world food supply.\ The Earth Summiteers say that one of their goals is to promote global energy conservation. But experience of the last half-century proves that private property and a capitalist economy produce more energy sources and a better environment than central planning.\ The United States is already a world leader in conservation and energy efficiency, whereas the countries managed by socialist bureaucracies and central planners are ecological disaster areas.\ The real purpose of the Earth Summiteers is to limit growth by restricting energy sources, and then to distribute American wealth to the rest of the world. The Earth Summiteers envision themselves as a new international elite, spending the money American workers earn and apportioning the scarcity around the world.\ UNCED proposals, if adopted, would require the U.S. taxpayers to transfer payments to the governments of developing nations. At the same time, UNCED proposals would severely restrict our own economic growth.\ UNCED promoters want a ""carbon tax"" that would cost $95 billion annually. This also would disadvantage us in comparison with our competitors such as France, which relies on fossil fuels for only 9 percent of its electricity, using nuclear power for 78 percent.\ Turner Broadcasting System is at the forefront of the media onslaught to ensnare American policymakers into the Rio extravaganza. TBS's ""Save the Earth"" campaign includes a video called ""One Child _ One Voice"" for adults and a weekly cartoon called ""Captain Planet and the Planeteers"" for children.\ ""One Child _ One Voice"" has already aired once, is scheduled for re-airing in June and is being widely distributed by video. It carries the message that the Earth will end soon if people don't stop polluting, and that America and other developed nations are guilty of committing environmental sins that threaten the rest of the world.\ Captain Planet is an environmental ""Superman,"" and the Planeteers are five children recruited by Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, when she awakes from a 100-year nap to discover the devastating effects 20th century people have had on the environment.\ These ""white hats"" go on adventures to eliminate the bad guys: Hoggish Greedly, a piglike human who lives to devour the Earth's resources; Looten Plunder, a capitalist who clear-cuts rain forests and extinguishes whole species; Sly Sludge, the ultimate con man who dumps garbage and toxic waste into oceans, parks and back yards; and Duke Nukem, a deformed villain who spreads radioactivity with the glee of a mad scientist.\ In addition to the television programs, TBS' Save the Earth campaign has ""action packs"" that include environmental pledges, direct-action postcards addressed to Bush and an interactive computer network via the ""Network Earth"" Forum on CompuServe.\ These action packs will be distributed through a multilevel collaboration between TBS and local cable operators, environmental civic groups, by mail and even door-to-door.\ Bush should recognize that the Earth Summit in Rio is just one more episode in the fantasy world of television. He should not try to play the role of Captain Planet, but should stay home and make plans to reduce taxes, regulations and bureaucracies in order to keep us a free people with an ever-growing economy.\Phyllis Schlafly is a lawyer and conservative political analyst."
37,"Environment is not faring well with Bush \This is a new president. You try to give him leeway, wait for policies to develop and flesh out. Yet try as one might, it is impossible to be anything but depressed and even alarmed about the emerging Bush policy on the environment. \The solution for rising oil prices is not to drill in such pristine places as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, as proposed by Bush. It is to seek alternative fuels and stress conservation. \The solution for the energy-production crisis in California is not to let new power plants burn coal without filters for carbon dioxide, as proposed by Bush. It is to provide assistance until scheduled power plants come on line in two to three years. \As for global warming, the solution is not to ignore it but to address it vigorously. Yet not only will the Bush administration pour more carbon dioxide into the air, it has abandoned the Kyoto agreement under which the world's nations agreed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. The administration has promised to offer an alternate plan to reduce greenhouse emissions, but it has not yet offered one suggestion yet. \To be fair, Congress has not been a fan of the Kyoto Protocol either. It rejected President Clinton's effort to impose a carbon tax that would have forced reductions, and it later went on record 95-0 opposing the Kyoto solutions. \Still, the fact remains that the United States produces the great majority of the Earth's greenhouse gases and is the major threat toward world climate stability. And this country was not asked to do the impossible. The 1997 treaty asked only that the U.S. reduce greenhouse gases7 percent below the 1990 level by 2012. But we are making little progress. Permitting increased carbon dioxide emissions will make things even worse. \One of the major arguments for U.S. indifference is that global warming is unverified and may, in fact, be a myth. But the group of responsible, informed people who hold this view is rapidly growing smaller. The great majority of scientists and even many international corporations recognize the danger. And an immense danger it is. The world faces enormous economic losses due to rising ocean levels that will eliminate many low-lying regions, including a considerable portion of Florida. Climate change is expected to make the American Midwest drier, severely damaging agriculture in what is the nation's breadbasket. Nevada will also get drier. Tornadoes and hurricanes will become ever more fierce and destructive. If we do not make some intelligent sacrifices now, future generations could well look upon this generation as the one that betrayed an entire planet. \Oil drilling in the Arctic is not nearly as serious, but it would still be a significant attack on an environment that to date has been protected for its richness of undisturbed wildlife - one of the last such places in the world. Equally bad, this transgression would come for a very small gain. A 1998 study by the U.S. Geological Survey estimated there is barely more than enough to account for this nation's needs for one year. Beyond that, there is no guarantee that the United States would get this oil, because it would fall under the power of multinational corporations. \An indication of corporate indifference to our needs came in January when the Portland Oregonian newspaper forced open Federal Trade Commission files and discovered that British Petroleum-Amoco had manipulated West Coast prices from 1996 to 2000 by shipping extra oil to Asia. Although these exports amounted to only 7 percent, they were enough to permit BP to leverage prices in Washington, Oregon and California (and in Nevada, too, since we are caught in the California price spiral). \On top of all this, the Bush administration has sliced in half the money promised to help preserve Lake Tahoe's blue waters, while other important environmental programs received little or no funding. Like global warming, Tahoe cannot wait. \Altogether, this selfishness and shortsightedness threaten much environmental harm, some of it possibly irreversible. It is a very dark road down which this administration seems ready to walk. \AIDS clinics should receive the extra money they need \In a shrinking revenues-shrinking budget situation like the one Nevada apparently faces, it becomes increasingly difficult to defend expenditures for one or another causes. \Even so, there should be no hesitation by the Legislature in approving a one-time $$@$!2 million appropriation to expand HIV/AIDS clinic work in Clark and Washoe counties. The issue here is shrinking lives. \Existing clinics cannot reach or serve all of the people who need their help, due to problems of transportation and other issues. This is a human tragedy because the latest generation of drugs can do much to alleviate suffering and prolong lives. But the drugs must get to the people who need them. This $$@$!2 million allocation would help assure that they do. \Tribe deserves Tahoe land \Congratulations to Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign, for introducing a bill to return some 24 acres at Lake Tahoe to the Washoe Tribe. The tribe would use this land just north of Skunk Harbor for the cultural practices that they practiced there for some 2,000 years, until European settlers took the land away. \The tribe will treat the land with the respect that it deserves. Commercial, residential and recreational development will not occur there, only natural uses. But more than that, this transaction will help the Washoes preserve and enhance their culture - something that is vitally important to them. Congress should approve this bill with dispatch. Nevada West\OPINION; Pg. 8C"
38,"What's spurring regulatory action? Studies such as a July report claiming Nevada could suffer serious economic losses from global warming, for one.\The University of Maryland study, called ""Climate Change and the Economy,"" asserts that a 3- to 4-degree jump in spring and fall temperatures and a 5- to 6-degree gain in winter and summer temperatures in Nevada by 2100 would yield a drier climate in the Silver State. Dwindling water supplies could affect tourism, development and public health, and could cost the state ""billions,"" the report states.\For example, a water shortage might curb residential and commercial construction. Building and development rank as the state's second-biggest job sector, and an industry contraction of 65 percent compared with current building activities would mean $3.6 billion in lost revenue for state and local governments, the study said. An accompanying drop in consumption and labor availability would pile on $4.7 billion more in losses annually.\The Maryland report's authors said they couldn't pinpoint the ""full effects of climate change"" on Nevada's tourism economy, but they did note that outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, wildlife-watching, hiking, water sports and golfing would bear the biggest brunt of temperature increases. Take golfing: With less water available for irrigation, course operators could replace vast swaths of green with desert landscaping, a move that might turn off consumers. If the state's golf sector dropped 25 percent of its business as a result, the Southern Nevada economy alone would lose $194.1 million in economic output, 1,120 jobs and $28.6 million in personal income.\Plus, dropping water levels at Lake Mead could curb boating, fishing and water skiing, and greater wildfire threats could limit visitor volume to Nevada's state parks.\""There are lots of excellent economic studies that assess the cost of cutting down on greenhouse gases,"" said Matthias Ruth, director of the Center for Integrative Environmental Research at the University of Maryland and one of the report's authors. ""We've summed up those studies collectively as a society and said, 'Whoa, that's a staggering amount.' We've thrown up our hands. But what we've forgotten is that there are costs of inaction as well.""\Another recent study cited the job growth that could come from focusing on renewable energy projects.\The Center for American Progress and the Nevada Conservation League released a report Tuesday that predicted the creation of 15,000 jobs in Nevada based on an $865 million investment in building retrofits, mass transit and other green initiatives. The money for the projects would come from a carbon tax on businesses.\Some experts disagree with the Maryland study's bleak outlook.\Robert Mendelsohn, a Yale University professor of economics and management, said global warming could actually spur economic gains for the nation, though less so for Nevada in particular.\The country's agriculture sector will benefit from longer growing seasons, and that improved output will largely offset any losses from climate change over the next century, Mendelsohn said.\But Nevada's agricultural sector is small, and farms here already endure relatively warm weather, so ""increased temperatures will not be your friend,"" Mendelsohn said.\Still, Mendelsohn said, summer recreation seasons here may last longer, and that could help the local economy.\""My guess is, Nevada is probably going to see both wins and losses,"" Mendelsohn said. ""It'll be a hard call to make as to where you'll end up. In a scenario with just a 2- or 3-degree increase, it'll be pretty much a wash. As you move into hotter scenarios, I'm guessing you'd move into the more harmful range.""\And Andy Matthews, vice president of communications for the Nevada Policy Research Institute, said no scientific consensus exists on whether global warming results from human activities, or whether humans can halt climate change through policymaking.\""(The Maryland study) itself even stipulated that its conclusions were all based on certain projections that may or may not turn out to be accurate,"" Matthews noted.\Experts who either disagree with climate change forecasts or who assert humans can do little to thwart natural global warming include John Coleman, meteorologist and Weather Channel founder; Bill Gray, a pre-eminent national hurricane forecaster and emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University; and Fred Singer, professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia.\Regardless of where observers stand on the science of climate change, all sides agree that entrepreneurs will find a bumper crop of business opportunities amid concern for the environment.\""There is a lot of money to be made in furthering the claim that global warming is a significant problem, and a man-made problem,"" Matthews said.\Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons created his Climate Change Advisory Committee in 2007, and that group in late July released a 28-point plan to help stem greenhouse-gas emissions in the Silver State. Their priorities could provide a road map for companies seeking to launch ecofriendly ventures.\The recommendations call, among other measures, for tighter management of residential and commercial energy demands; more energy-efficient building standards; additional support for brownfield development; ""clean-fueled"" public transportation; incentives for ethanol-blended fuels and biofuels; a high-speed train between Los Angeles and Las Vegas; efforts to convert dairy-farm manure to energy; enhanced solid-waste recycling efforts; and initiatives to capture and sequester carbon dioxide from power plants.\Few limits exist on business prospects related to climate change, said Somer Hollingsworth, president and chief executive officer of the Nevada Development Authority.\""We're very excited about it,"" Hollingsworth said. ""We think Nevada has a chance to really be in the middle of that whole universe.""\Hollingsworth noted that major investment banks have set aside tens of billions of dollars for solar plants and other sustainable businesses.\Businesses related to renewable energy contain Nevada's best economic prospects for capitalizing on climate concerns, Mendelsohn said. In wind energy and solar power, the Silver State has rich resources to tap, he said.\In 1997, Nevada became one of the first states in the country to adopt a renewable portfolio standard requiring a certain share of its utilities' energy to come from environmentally friendly sources. Thanks to those standards, Nevada leads the country in geothermal and solar power per capita. Two of the world's largest solar projects operate in Southern Nevada: the 64-megawatt Nevada Solar One power plant near Boulder City, and the 14-megawatt Solar Star photovoltaic center at Nellis Air Force Base.\The state also houses three new geothermal plants, with an additional 26 projects under contract. Sierra Pacific Resources, the utility that owns Nevada Power Co., plans to double its renewable energy portfolio by 2012 to nearly 500 megawatts.\Manufacturers have jumped in as well. California-based Ausra in June opened a 130,000-square-foot factory in Las Vegas, where it assembles solar thermal mirrors, tubes and turbines for solar power plants.\Nevada would also do well to attract companies specializing in technologies that reduce or capture greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, Mendelsohn said.\Maryland's Ruth noted that Nevada's economy could benefit from climate change prevention in indirect ways, too. ""Smart"" land-use planning - designing communities efficiently to reduce the need for driving - could cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and reduce fuel costs for citizens as well. Those savings in turn could bolster other sectors of the economy, as consumers would enjoy more discretionary dollars.\And some policies could both reel in greenhouse gas emissions and fatten state coffers, Ruth said. Maryland officials recently joined other East Coast policymakers to develop a mechanism that would auction permits allowing power companies to release greenhouse gases. Utilities uninterested in buying permits must invest instead in improving fuel mixes and reducing emissions. The permit auctions could generate $100 million a year in revenue for Maryland alone, Ruth said.\Regulators should avoid policies that would hurt commerce, though, other observers say. Over-regulation could do more harm to the economy than global warming will cause in the near term, Mendelsohn said.\""As far as we can tell, the best strategy is to be moderate,"" he said. ""Begin to regulate, but regulate moderately. Don't make it very expensive at first. The damages right now are actually pretty low, and we don't have good technologies that cut greenhouse gases. You don't want to spend $1,000 to solve a $10 problem. But if you can spend a few dollars to solve a $10 problem, that's great. As we accumulate more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we can get stricter in the future.""\Matthews agreed that costly rules and regulations would only hurt consumers and businesses. Consumers will pick up some of that $100 million permit tab in Maryland, for example, while utilities might restrain research and development funds to cover the rest of the cost.\""Global warming as a cause is easy to get swept up in,"" Matthews said. ""But we need to resist calls to put into place policies that will do little for the environment and only transfer more power into the hands of government. Those kinds of policies will rob the private sector of the tools and resources it needs to really drive technology forward, and those new technologies might have included many that would help the environment.""\WARMER PLANET, COLDER ECONOMY\Climate change could hurt Nevada's economy through 2100, according to University of Maryland researchers. A 3- to 4-degree increase in spring and fall temperatures, combined with a 5- to 6-degree change in temperatures during the summer and winter, could have the following effects:\* A warmer climate would mean less water for Nevadans, and a resulting drop in construction and development. A reduction in building activity of 65 percent compared with current levels would translate into a loss of $18.6 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue. Lost revenue at the local and state levels would total $3.6 billion over 14 years. The resulting decrease in consumption and labor availability would cause an estimated loss of $4.7 billion in wages annually.\* Thirty percent of local tourists use the Las Vegas Valley's golf courses, and Southern Nevada's golf industry produces an economic impact of $891 million annually. As global warming leaves the region with less water, golf courses might have to scale back on irrigation and replace grass with desert-tolerant landscaping. Brown courses don't appeal to consumers, so the Maryland study assumes a 25 percent falloff in golf-course use in Southern Nevada. That will cost the local economy $194.1 million in economic output, 1,120 jobs and $28.6 million in personal income.\* Lake Mead generates $1 billion a year from tourism and recreation, including boating, fishing and water skiing. As drought pushes down Lake Mead's water levels, economic revenue from water recreation also dips. Calville Bay, for example, is losing $2 million a year thanks to its receding shoreline, the Maryland study said. The National Park Service has already relocated a marina and a ferry service to another harbor to keep them operating. Each 20 feet the water level drops costs the National Park Service $6 million.\* As Lake Mead's water levels decline, the concentration of pollutants in Las Vegas' primary drinking-water source increases. Ammonium perchlorate, a component in rocket fuel, appears in noticeable concentrations in Lake Mead and along the Colorado River. Expect those concentrations to grow as water levels drop. That could boost public health costs, the study said. \* Nevada state parks receive anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 visitors a year, but increasing wildfire threats could limit the number of tourists during peak fire seasons.\* Nevada's agricultural output totaled $231.8 million in 2006, and included mostly alfalfa, wheat, barley, onions, garlic and potatoes. The value of the state's livestock runs $233.9 million annually, and Nevada's dairy farms produced 558 million pounds of milk in 2006. That agricultural production could suffer with increasingly unpredictable seasons and competition for water resources.\SOURCE: University of Maryland Center for Integrative Environmental Research\CHANGING CLIMATE, BUSINESS CHANCES\Concerns about climate change mean business opportunities for savvy entrepreneurs. Here are a few examples of how and where Nevada feels the demand for eco-friendly measures:\* Nevada houses two of the world's largest solar power plants. The 64-megawatt Nevada Solar One plant near Boulder City ranks as the world's second-largest solar plant. The 14-megawatt Solar Star photovoltaic plant at Nellis Air Force Base is also one of the planet's biggest solar centers.\* Nevada leads the United States in geothermal and solar power per capita.\* The Reno City Council voted in March to accept bids for two solar energy systems, one at the city of Reno Corporation Yard and the other at a fire station.\* Municipalities statewide have implemented energy-saving steps such as light sensors in public buildings and solar-powered crosswalk signals.\* Las Vegas has committed to constructing all new public buildings to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards.\* The Clark County School District owns the world's largest biodiesel-run school bus fleet. At the beginning of the 2002-2003 school year, the district's 1,300 school buses began using a fuel blend that contained a 20 percent share of biodiesel.\* In Washoe and Clark counties, 90 percent of all new government vehicle acquisitions must use alternative fuels.\* Clark County's Regional Transportation Commission operates more than 100 solar-powered public transportation shelters.\* The city of Las Vegas' Sustainability Plan calls for city agencies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 150,336 pounds in the 2007-2008 fiscal year. The savings were to come from electricity conservation, reduction in use of paper, vehicle conversions and fewer miles driven.\SOURCE: Final report, Nevada Climate Change Advisory Committee\This story first appeared in the Business Press.

39,"djacobs@rgj.com\Going green is taking on a whole new meaning for the city of Sparks.\This time it doesn't involve the community's historic Irish heritage. Energy is the issue.\Sparks is preparing a proposal that could bring hundreds of thousands of dollars to the city as it tries to promote efficiency through reduced energy costs from the electricity the municipal government uses to the fuel it consumes.\""Our primary objective in this is to increase and promote energy efficiency, energy conservation and renewable energy generation within the city of Sparks,"" City Engineer Pete Etchart said.\The initial focus will be on the governmental-public sector.\""With the amount of money we are receiving, it's not adequate right now to go into the private sector, but hopefully down the road we will,"" Etchart said.\To get the green efforts going, Sparks is looking to the federal government. Led by President Barack Obama, federal leaders are rolling out multiple initiatives to make the country more energy-efficient and less dependent on foreign supplies while promoting a cleaner environment.\""We are expecting to receive a direct allocation to the city of Sparks for $840,000,"" Etchart said. ""There's also $400 million available in national competitive grant applications.""\Etchart laid out these details in a recent presentation to Sparks City Council. Council members eventually would be asked to sign off on the various green-energy efforts on what could be a multi-year effort and also involve separate state grants.\Energy costs\As Etchart describes it, some ""very good reasons"" exist to start focusing on the government-public sector in Sparks.\Officials have gone back the past several years and gathered usage involving gallons of gasoline, diesel fuel and natural gas, along with studying the city's electrical bill.\Some findings:\From 2004 to 2008, electrical use by city government was up about 7 percent with electrical costs increasing about 15 percent.\""Our total electric bill is up 23 to 24 percent these past four years,"" Etchart said. ""That's actually with a decrease this past year. We're actually up in three years, from 2004 to 2007, 32 percent.""\Sparks' total electrical bill in 2008 was nearly\$4.7 million.\Gas is a similar story but a little higher, Etchart said. The city's total gas bill was up 40.7 percent the last four years with the city paying more than $260,000 in\2008 alone.\The data will serve as a baseline for quantifying Sparks' energy reductions and also ideally be used for emission reductions to promote a cleaner environment.\""Each of those -- gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity -- has a greenhouse gas conversion factor,"" Etchart said.\Fueling projects\In the years ahead, a number of regional efforts could begin to take shape, including new LED streetlights with energy savings 50 percent to 60 percent, along with regional recycling and community outreach opportunities.\""This is a short list,"" Etchart said. ""It's actually growing all of the time.""\In 2010-11, another possibility is a revolving energy fund. If adopted, this would keep green energy projects flowing without using money that finances day-to-day city services such as police and fire and road repairs.\""The basic premise of a revolving energy fund is that you utilize the savings from energy projects to provide additional energy projects and savings,"" Etchart said. ""You can call it almost like an endowment fund of energy projects. You are using those savings to generate more savings.""\He calls Sparks' effort a ""major undertaking"" that would yield several long-term benefits.\""It makes government operations more resilient to the rising energy costs. Energy costs are going up. Right now, we're in a little dip, but overall they're going up pretty drastically.\""And if the federal government does some of the ideas that they have proposed, such as a carbon tax or other things, those costs could go up drastically,"" Etchart said.\""... It also stimulates the development of jobs in the local energy services industry, and lastly, it allows the city to achieve emission reductions in line with"" Sparks' participation in the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement.\Sparks also is interested in working as a region to create a ""Northern Nevada Energy Plan."" Potential partners could include Reno, Washoe County, Carson City, Truckee and other agencies.\""It may become the Eastern Sierra Energy Plan,"" Etchart said.\But to get started, the city plans to carry out an energy-efficiency and renewable energy opportunity audit of Sparks city facilities this year.\""Once we've completed that, I think we'll be able to get a better handle on some realistic short-term and long-term goals for energy reductions and emission reductions,"" Etchart said.\Measuring savings\The city plans to complete its strategy plan by June 25.\The bottom line shouldn't be hard to see once Sparks' efforts get set into motion.\""We have the meter readings for our facilities, for streetlights, for traffic signals,"" Etchart said. ""We have the meter readings before; we use the meter readings after. We actually see what the real savings are, not projected savings but actual savings. Then we suggest and propose that we use those savings to do more projects.""\The city would solicit projects in its different city departments. The list would be prioritized and presented to City Council for its consideration.\Councilwoman Julia Ratti, a promoter of green energy efforts, likes what she sees in Etchart's plan.\""I think it is all very exiting,"" she said. ""I think there's some very creative thinking going on at the staff level and at the local level to implement some of these projects. I commend you and say press forward.""\GREEN ENERGY\Through clean energy strategies, local governments can reduce emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, lower energy costs and improve the reliability and security of their energy system.\Clean energy also can spur local economic development, improve public health and quality of life and help communities meet sustainability and green building goals.\Source: U.S. government\STREETLIGHT fast factS\Cities across the USA are making their streetlights brighter and greener by switching to LEDs.\Light-emitting diodes produce light when exposed to an electrical charge.

40,"Global warming deniers like to suggest that they are like the free thinkers who used science to challenge the teachings of the Catholic Church, which held that Earth was the center of the universe.\But the chorus of disbelievers is more akin to the old church adherents, because the preponderance of empirical scientific data prove climate change is rapidly occurring.\Even before the devastating fires erupted in Southern California last week, ""60 Minutes"" ran a segment by reporter Scott Pelley about how a warming planet is already turning typical Western fires into megafires.\They are becoming 10 times as large as typical fires, and nobody in fire services denies that global warming is, in fact, helping to spawn such monsters. They might technically be caused by lightning or arson or careless campers, but they don't consume 475,000 acres without a little help from the increased winds, bone-dry brush and longer fire seasons.\Pelley asked Tom Boatner, chief of fire operations for the federal government about people who don't believe climate change is occurring.\""You won't find them on the fire line in the American West anymore,"" he said. "" 'Cause we've had climate change beat into us over the last 10 or 15 years. We know what we're seeing, and we're dealing with a period of climate, in terms of temperature and humidity and drought, that's different than anything people have seen in our lifetime.""\But when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada dared to call a spade a spade last week, he was immediately ridiculed by the right.\When asked about the devastation in California last week, Reid said: ""One reason why we have the fires in California is global warming.""\He didn't say global warming started the fires. He said it was a factor.\And there are few people next door who would disagree. Not the thousands who lost their homes, not the thousands who battled the blazes and certainly not the governor, who has sued the federal government for failing to protect the environment.\Any defense of Reid is good for a few dozen phone calls and barely literate e-mail diatribes in response. But this is one situation where Reid deserves some credit.\He's currently pushing for passage of an energy bill that could actually start to address our dependency on foreign oil and fossil fuels. Reid has also stated unequivocally that three planned coal power plants by Nevada Power's parent company won't be built.\The states have to go around the federal government on climate change because the Bush administration has only now started to admit it might be real.\Last week, Dr. Julie Gerberding, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prepared a 14-page report on global warming's potential impact on human health. The Bush administration let her share six pages with Congress.\Gone were any mention of risks to humans from pollution, violent weather and waterborne and food-borne diseases. The only thing more frightening than Dr. Gerberding's full testimony and a similar report by the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Panel on Climate Change is that the Bush administration still doesn't want you to hear about it.\You may not believe that enough glacier melt could put many Eastern U.S. cities under water. You may not think Al Gore's models are anything other than devices to whip the left into a feel-good, tree-hugging frenzy.\But you can't deny that the polar ice caps are melting or that the Northwest Passage is now a fully navigable waterway.\Shortly after Reid made his global warming remark, KXNT-AM 840 morning host Alan Stock said the senator had put both feet in his mouth. I was a guest on the station's ""R-J Headliners"" segment and was asked about what Reid's statement will mean to him politically in Nevada.\This was shortly after being asked about why Sen. Barack Obama didn't wear a flag pin or put his hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance once.\There's a reason right-wing radio and the chorus of naysayers want the average American to think climate change is somehow in dispute. It's the same reason why conservatives focus on things like lapel pins as a test of character for a presidential candidate.\If you don't talk about real issues, you don't have to confront them. It's easier to complain about a symbol than to talk about Obama's plan for Iraq.\It's easier to discount the overwhelming scientific evidence than to enact a carbon tax, say, that might actually prompt the private sector to come up with some eco-friendly solutions.\Nevada's fire season isn't getting any shorter. There's less snow in the mountains, less precipitation and drier brush. Last year was the worst fire season in the state since records of such activity have been kept.\Maybe in a year or so, after a few more brutal Western fire seasons, elected leaders won't just be out front discussing the impact from climate change. By then we can only hope they'll be enacting real solutions.\Contact Erin Neff at (702) 387-2906, or by e-mail at eneff@reviewjournal.com."
41,"adamon@rgj.com\Making his first campaign visit to Reno on Friday, U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., called for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq, promised to work toward universal health care and touted his long record of labor-friendly legislation before a group of hotel and casino workers.\When asked about his position on the federal government's plan to store the nation's nuclear waste outside Las Vegas, he said his views are open to change.\Dodd was the latest candidate to pursue Nevada's labor constituency in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president.\""As president of the United States, I want to create that climate where people have the right to organize, the right to be part of a union, the right to be able to negotiate not only their wages and benefits but health care and job security as well,"" he told the members of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226.\The largely Hispanic crowd cheered when he addressed them in Spanish, which he learned while a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic.\Dodd spent about an hour with the group before they met to discuss their contract negotiation strategy. The union is in talks with casinos throughout the state, including the Circus Circus and the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno.\With 60,000 members, the Culinary Union is expected to play a major role in Nevada's Jan. 19 caucus. Every major Democratic candidate has devoted significant attention to winning it over. Union leadership has said it will wait until later this year to make an endorsement.\So far the candidates have spent their time courting the workers in Las Vegas. Dodd is the first to speak to workers in Reno, which has a membership of about 2,000.\""I understand the differences here between Las Vegas and Reno,"" he said. ""The unique situation you face with Indian gaming in Northern California putting additional pressure on the casinos here.""\Several of the workers in the audience said they are keeping an open mind until they've heard all of the candidates speak. No one interviewed said they were leaning toward one candidate or another.\""I think they all have good things to say, and I want to hear what they have to say,"" said Jay Eyer, a bartender at the Grand Sierra Resort.\Sandra Martinez, a cocktail waitress at the Grand Sierra Resort, said she appreciated Dodd's work authoring the Family Medical Leave Act, which has allowed her to take time off to care for her son who is fighting cancer.\""I don't know what I'd do without that,"" she said.\But she also hasn't made a decision on who to support.\""I think they are all very uplifting,"" she said. ""We are fighting very hard for what we have, and it's very important.""\Dodd also told the crowd that American troops should be withdrawn immediately from Iraq and that Iraqis must ""decide whether they want to be a country again.""\""Because we can't buy that for them, and I'm not going to get it for them militarily.""\Dodd said he now opposes the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump but that could change. Connecticut depends on nuclear power to generate nearly half of its electricity, making him an important part of the decades-long debate over nuclear waste.\He has supported the project in the past but said he is concerned about the ""geological issues and transportation questions.""\""It's an organic question in my sense,"" he said. ""I have drawn the conclusion that this is really not the right place today.""\ooo ooo ooo\Dodd feels leadership is missing in America\RGJ reporter Anjeanette Damon interviewed Democratic presidential candidate Chris Dodd of Connecticut on Friday.\Q: Why do you want to be president?\A: To come to Reno. Well, listen, you know, I would be hard-pressed to think of another time, in my adulthood anyway, where the stakes would be higher, both at home and abroad. It is hard to believe what could happen to a country in six years. There are tremendous pressures here, obviously people feel it. I just spoke to a woman on the plane, she said something that worries me. She said, ""Our best days are behind us."" When I hear people, working people, say that, I think just the opposite can be the case. I think our difficulties are significant, but I think our abilities and our assets far exceed our problems. What is missing is some leadership.\Q: Why are you the right person to move the country in the opposite direction?\A: I have proven leadership, proven ability to bring people together. Every major piece of legislation I've drafted or written, I've done (it) with a Republican. Not because I wanted to but because I viewed it as a practicality.\Q: When is the Senate going to get something done on Iraq?\A: I would hope sooner rather than later. The public is so far beyond where the leadership is on this issue that they are really ready for us to begin redeployment immediately. And they'd like it done reasonably and fairly and responsibly, which I think can be done over the next seven or eight months.\Q: Your recent energy plan calls for a carbon tax and includes a nuclear power component. How do you see nuclear power energy fitting into your overall strategy on energy and the environment?\A: There are two major issues when dealing with energy independence and global warming and that is transportation and, the grid. The transportation issue I've taken the stand of setting the goal of reducing (carbon dioxide) emissions by the year 2050 by 80 percent. ... If you adopt a 50 mpg standard by 2017, that will have a major step in reducing the consumption of petroleum products.\The other step is we use about 53 percent of coal to operate the grid. If you are going to really talk about global warming and emissions, you've got to come up with an answer to that. You're not going to operate the grid with solar and wind power, geothermal, ocean wave power. What is the other alternative? That's why I don't take nuclear off the table. Obviously, I'm very aware of waste and transportation issues. I've expressed my opposition to Yucca Mountain because of the geological questions and transportation issues here, but frankly the dry casks are much safer than they were 15 years ago.\Q: You've been a supporter of Yucca Mountain in the past, can you talk about what changed?\A: I've accepted the notion early on that at some point we're going to have to have a storage facility. Very few people disagree with that. End of question. And then, where has been the best place for that to be? So, at various points, it looked like it's (Yucca Mountain) is going to be the right place, or it's not going to be the right place ... It is an organic question in my sense.\Obviously, people who have been here from the very beginning, you know, obviously have a stand. People have been opposed to it. But for those of us who have had to make some decisions on it, I have drawn the conclusion that this is really not the right place today. And the alternatives for dealing with waste is far better than it was.\Q: Would you promise Nevada voters that Yucca Mountain wouldn't happen on your watch?\A: Yeah, I've said that here. Again, I don't think it's anything official.\Captions:\PHOTOS BY AMY BECK/RENO GAZETTE-JOURNAL\Left, Democratic presidential candidate Chris Dodd and Culinary Workers Union Local 226 organizer Lala Zarate close out the town meeting with the union hand clap.

42,"By now most Nevada TV watchers have figured out the Harry Reid jump-cut campaign ad strategy. It would be amusing if it weren't turning a nationally watched campaign that should feature a legitimate debate on the best long-term cure for the American economy into a game of video-clip ""Gotcha.""\The 70-year-old, four-term senator can't very well talk about his own popularity (38 percent, nearing ""kitten abuse"" territory), nor his and his Democratic allies' ""accomplishments"" in destroying the American economy.\But let Republican challenger Sharron Angle, a pleasant and principled opponent of higher taxes who served several terms in the Nevada Assembly without being revealed as some kind of lunatic baby-killer, speak in public anywhere, saying, ""When I get to Washington, I'm going to kill Harry Reid's entire job-destroying agenda. I'm going to stand by my principles; I don't care if they come at me with an assault weapon."" (Cheers.)\The next week, in grainy black-and-white and with ominous introductory music more suitable for coverage of a mass murderer, voters will be treated to a version of that speech as edited by Harry Reid's campaign team, with Nevadans bizarrely cheering Sharron Angle after she apparently says, ""When I get to Washington, I'm going to kill Harry Reid ... with an assault weapon.""\The Reid campaign misrepresentation that seems to have gotten the most mileage, as the senator unleashed a $10 million TV-and-Internet ad campaign at the defenseless challenger while she was out trying to raise her first $2 million last month, was that Sharron Angle wouldn't have picked up the phone to extort unwise bank financing to help complete the new CityCenter hotel-casino project, as Sen. Reid did a couple years back, and that this proves Ms. Angle doesn't care about ""creating thousands of jobs in Nevada.""\Ms. Angle stopped by the Review-Journal offices for an hour on July 23, and responded to the charge by asking, if the opening of CityCenter ""brought 8,000 new jobs"" to Southern Nevada (more if you add in short-term construction jobs), why didn't its grand opening in December 2009 cause the region's unemployment rate to drop?\The answer is because Las Vegas now operates with excess hotel capacity. At least for the foreseeable future, we're overbuilt. The guests who checked into CityCenter are guests who otherwise might have checked into vacant rooms at some other resort on the Las Vegas Strip - maybe the Riviera, say, whose parent company filed for bankruptcy July 12.\The guests shifted their reservations to CityCenter, which therefore needed the workers, who came from other Strip properties, which were happy to let them go because their own occupancy rates are down. As Ms. Angle said, ""It just shifted the employment from one property to another, to a property that the senator made that call for,"" away from the scores of other properties - ""little guys"" who received no such powerful intervention to help them with their financial problems.\Are we to believe Harry Reid called those bankers to make them aware of new figures indicating CityCenter was going to cost less than anticipated to complete, or that tourism, occupancy and cash flow were going to be better here in 2010 and 2011 than the anxious banks anticipated?\Give me a break.\Bankers under thumb\""But isn't that the job of a U.S. senator, to make that call for a constituent?"" the columnists and reporters bray.\Sharron Angle says no. And fortunately, there's a rule book we can use to resolve the dispute. It's called the U.S. Constitution, and nowhere in the powers of Congress - 144 words in Article I - do we find anything remotely resembling, ""The senators shall, upon the request of constituents who have favored them with whopping campaign contributions, call on federally regulated banking institutions and twist their arms to extend credit to said home-state constituents, despite the fact the bankers in their best judgment shall have determined any further such lending to be reckless and unwise.""\The squawkers will insist such ""theoretical"" arguments don't reflect the real political world as it now exists.\So let's talk about ""the real political world as it now exists."" Banks today are regulated to an extent the founders could never have imagined. So heavily regulated are they that the current economic recession - quickly approaching a second Great Depression - was caused precisely by the Congress using its regulatory powers to threaten severe consequences for banks that refused to make large numbers of loans to minority home-buyers in neighborhoods believed to have been ""red-lined,"" even though said loans failed to meet the banks' own common-sense standards for predicting which would-be home buyers would likely be able to keep up their payments, especially in the face of an economic slowdown.\They made the loans. Millions of those loans went ""upside down"" and defaulted. Meantime, it turned out those ""mortgage securities"" had been bundled and sliced up like sausage, becoming part of the asset portfolios of all kinds of outfits whose investors had no idea they were in the mortgage business. Toxic assets. Meltdown. Bailouts. Hyperinflation still to come. You know the story.\The SEC blew it. As a reward, Congress last week exempted the SEC from the Freedom of Information Act, so in future we'll know even less about what these cretins are up to.\Virtually every Friday afternoon, in this country today, a handful of local bank presidents look out the window to see the banking regulators arriving to shut them down. Non-performing loans poison the balance sheet, which is thus deemed to hold inadequate assets to keep the operation running.\Boards of directors do not make these decisions. Faceless, unelected regulators answerable to Harry Reid make these decisions.\Under those circumstances, arranging for a bank president to get a call from the most powerful member of the U.S. Senate is not exactly like having your Uncle Ned call to give you a good character reference. Bankers receiving that phone call have to go, ""Uh-oh. Do you know what this guy could do to us if we piss him off?""\So Jim Murren of MGM Mirage, a big campaign donor to Harry Reid, presumably picks up the phone and asks the senator to call the bankers, who are threatening to cut off the credit needed to finish the over-budget CityCenter. The Godfather makes the call; the financing is extended; the project is completed.\Bailouts forever\Now let us presume that, having looked at the returns from their first six or nine months of operation, CityCenter management, just hypothetically, decides they can make a go of things only if they can shed their debt. Let us suppose they file to reorganize under bankruptcy - perhaps a few weeks after the November elections.\Might it turn out, at that point, that the bankers who extended those lines of credit to the over-budget project acted in a way not in the best interest of their own stockholders and depositors - sort of like all those banks that made unsafe home loans to satisfy the feel-good requirement of the oh-so-politically-correct Community Reinvestment Act? Could an (entirely hypothetical) CityCenter bankruptcy filing endanger those banks, with their tens of thousands of employees?\If that happens, do you think those bankers will hesitate to pick up the phone and say, ""So, senator, we extended those loans just like you asked, and now CityCenter's not paying. You are going to intervene with the banking regulators to make sure we're not punished, right? You are going to send us $8.5 billion in tax moneys to get us bailed out on this one, right?""\And so the endless stream of bailouts of outfits ""too big to fail"" would continue - just as Sharron Angle warns.\The campaign of 2010 is a campaign for the soul of a free-market, capitalist America. The Tea Party candidates - for all their imperfections and inconsistencies, perfectly predictable when the voters are trying to send a bunch of Grandma Smiths to Washington to replace a bunch of pinstriped oligarchs - have the mainstream media shocked, shocked at their refusal to back down from their insistence that what our economy really needs is a much smaller government with significantly lower taxes and less meddling in the economy.\""You really said you wouldn't have bailed out GM; you would have let them go through a regular bankruptcy and shed their union contracts? You really said you'd close down the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the EPA, leave all those functions to the states, just like we did from 1787 to 1969? Ahhhhh!"" the reporters shriek, holding out their microphones like crucifixes. ""Unclean! Unclean!""\Will Democrat and RINO incumbents, backed with tens of millions of dollars from the eco-extremists, the government unions and the rest of America's Marxist elite, be able to sow enough fear, suspicion and distrust to win re-election against such an imperfect, ill-organized, populist revolt?\If the Tea Parties are defeated, what do we get? Forced unionization via ""card check."" Carbon tax. Cap 'n' trade. The biggest hike in income and death taxes in the history of the world. Rationed national health care with death panels. An 18 percent national sales tax.\All directed by Harry Reid.\Who represents Nevada?\And who is Harry Reid? Twelve years ago, Harry Reid was merely a vindictive man, wreaking his political vengeance on anyone who stood in his way, ginning up ""milker"" bills to threaten those who refused to endorse him.\Today, Harry Reid is 70. Re-elect him, and he'll be in the Senate till he's 77, though what kind of shape he'll be in at that point is worth contemplating.\Harry Reid had a stroke five years ago. Since then, he has repeatedly claimed that taxation is voluntary. (Irwin Schiff agrees. They put him in prison for saying so.) On March 5, Sen. Reid said on the Senate floor, ""Only 36,000 people lost their jobs today, which is really good."" On July 13, Sen. Reid said there were no illegals working construction in Las Vegas. On July 24, he said Ford would have gone out of business if Republicans had their way and the firm had not been bailed out by Washington. But Ford was not bailed out by Washington.\Ten days ago he said he was going to have to pull his cherished national energy tax off the floor because he didn't have enough votes. ""It's easy to count to 60. I could do it by the time I was in eighth grade,"" the senator said.\The mainstream press barely acknowledges these little ""slips of the tongue,"" while savaging conservatives like Sarah Palin not only for their own statements, but for those made by their impersonators on ""Saturday Night Live.""\So perhaps it's fair to ask whether the mainstream press has now decided not to tell us that Sen. Reid is ... failing.\Sharron Angle, speaking carefully in an environment where Reid operatives are now ready to pounce on the slightest misstatement or manipulable sound bite, did seem to relax at one point during her July 23 visit at the Review-Journal - to say something from the heart.\""These days,"" she said, ""when you talk to your kids on the phone, you ask 'How are you?' And what you mean is, 'Do you still have a job? Are you making your mortgage payments?' ""\It's not a statement that's likely to go down in the annals of political oratory. But Sharron Angle lives here, and she was only saying what all of us who live here know to be true. That's where Nevada's at, thanks to the greedy vultures now in charge in Washington.\Harry Reid would be unlikely to ever say such a thing. He doesn't live here, and his kids are all members of the ruling class, anyway - either elected officials in their own right, or lobbyists making millions by using the Reid name to attract supplicants in need of a guide through the maze of Washington power, atop which their dad sits like the Master Gargoyle.\When Sen. Reid talks to his kids, he doesn't have to ask them whether they still have a job and they're able to make their mortgage payments. Sen. Reid expects to spend more than $20 million buying this election - $20 million in ""donations"" from fat cats who expect him to use his influence to get them their share of all that money that used to be ours, to make sure their projects get financed ... while ours don't.\Vin Suprynowicz is assistant editorial page editor of the Review-Journal, and author of ""Send in the Waco Killers"" and the novel ""The Black Arrow.""

43," By MATTHEW CROWLEY\ REVIEW-JOURNAL\ When Nevada Power Co. offered Las Vegan Stewart Stewart a chance to use Internet technology to save energy and help the environment, he was eager to try it.\ Stewart, who has a degree in environmental science, is in the energy business, having just started New Energy Partners, a company aiming to gain siting and permitting for solar power plants and wind turbines. When he heard of GoodWatts, a new program designed to reduce peak summer electricity demand, he joined immediately.\ ""Energy is both a personal and professional interest of mine,"" he said. ""So when I heard about GoodWatts, I thought I ought to get involved both for the personal and environmental benefits but also for my career.""\ Nevada Power, Invensys Homes Control Systems and Cox Communications announced GoodWatts, a pilot plan to roll out in three phases over three summers, recently at the annual Edison Electric Institute convention in Honolulu.\ Bob Balzar, Nevada Power's program director for energy efficiency and conservation, said this summer's phase will involve 40 homes and run through June, July, August and September.\ GoodWatts, which Invensys also launched in Philadelphia with PECO Energy and cable provider Comcast Corp., involves four main devices: a special cable modem through which users connect to a secure Internet protocol network (provided by Cox in Southern Nevada), and three Invensys inventions: a special communicating load-control meter, switches connected to high-load devices such as air conditioners, and a thermostat.\ The meter includes a radio frequency-network communications capability, similar to the one in cordless telephones. The capability lets the utility collect data from high-load devices, said Geoff Williamson, the vice president of business development for Invensys Home Controls, and relay it to the cable modem. Then, the data travels through a secure Internet protocol network, residing on an Invensys server.\ Both the utility and the user can log onto the secure network. By logging onto the IP network and sending signals from the modem to the meter to the device-linked switches or thermostat, either party can adjust power use up or down.\ ""We're the technology enabler,"" Williamson said. ""We've developed the widgetry.""\ From the data it collects, GoodWatts determines a home's specific energy-load requirements, Balzar said. Using this information, the utility can adjust use in both individual homes, and in the aggregated network (all the homes together), shifting large energy loads from peak to off-peak times.\ ""In the summer, a user will typically have (his) thermostat set for 76 to 78 degrees,"" he said. ""If we let that drift up to 82 to 84 degrees for a few hours during peak periods, that helps reduce the load of electric consumption. If we can do that through thousands homes in the valley, we can manage energy better.""\ The first phase of the Southern Nevada GoodWatts will involve mostly air-conditioning systems, but Balzar said the Invensys machinery can also cover other appliances such as hot-water heaters and swimming-pool pumps.\ The system helps Nevada Power save in two ways, Balzar said. First, it eases the amount on power the utility must generate or buy during peak periods, when generation or purchase usually are more expensive, shifting the duties to times when power generation and purchase are usually cheaper.\ Second, he added, because generators as less taxed during peak times, they labor less, use less nonrenewable fuel, and pollute less. Transformers get less wear and tear and last longer. The environment benefits.\ GoodWatts participants will receive a fixed, $15 monthly payment from the utility for each month of the program, Balzar said. System overrides by users may reduce their payments, he added.\ The utility hopes to include 200 homes in the program next summer and grow the number to 1,000 by summer 2005 Balzar said. Data collected this summer will help it improve GoodWatts in subsequent summers, he added.\ ""Once we get over 1,000 homes in the program, we'll have some momentum,"" Balzar said. ""But when we start programs, we like to roll them out small because we have to crawl before we can walk before we can run.""\ Tim Hay, the state consumer advocate, said demand-side management programs, such as GoodWatts, are good.\ ""We have long advocated that demand-side management be part of both the resource-planning process as well as a way for individual consumers to moderate or manage their individual utility bills,"" he said.\ Stewart said he likes that GoodWatts can control power independent of electrical outlets, and therefore interferes neither with power delivery or quality.\ ""I work from a home office, so having sustained power to my office is critical to my getting anything done,"" he said. ""Also the idea of being able to monitor and control power usage at home using the Internet seemed fascinating to me. I wanted to see how well it worked.""\ As a student of energy use and systems, Stewart said managing consumer demand will be a critical elements of all future systems. Voluntary demand control is one of the least costly, most effective ways methods to yield additional energy and capacity, he said. The alternative, building building infrastructure, is expensive and sometimes politically difficult to accomplish.\ ""Nobody wants more high-power tension lines in their backyard,"" Stewart said. ""If you ask users in a friendly way to help manage demand, it lets them share in the economic benefit. It's better for everyone."""

46,"The state could pick upan extra $11 million if an amended transportation bill in the Senate is OK'd.\ WASHINGTON _ Nevada stands to receive an additional $11 million in federal highway aid under an amendment the Senate added to its transportation bill on Tuesday.\ Voting 89-9, senators approved an amendment by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., that would distribute an additional $8.2 billion in transportation aid to states over the next five years.\ It then turned to a series of other amendments, voting down, 41-57, an attempt by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., an attempt to change the basic formula by which federal highway aid has been allocated among the states.\ The Senate was expected to give its final approval to the overall bill and send it to the House today.\ The amendment could mean as much as $11 million for Nevada, according to Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\ The $11 million would be added to the $98.5 million Nevada already stands to receive under the Senate bill.\ The Senate passed the amendment as a compromise to mollify states that complained they would not receive sufficient federal aid under the legislation.\ The trust fund money would be equally divided into two $4.1 billion packages, one to compensate so-called ""donor"" states which in the past have been shortchanged on federal highway aid, the other to reward states that are spending more than the national average to improve their own roads. Nevada's spending is based on its 18-cent per gallon gasoline tax, while the national average gas tax is 17 cents.\ The result was to boost the price tag of the overall transportation authorization to $123 billion, when all programs are included.\ The surplus money built up in the highway fund through the accumulation of the federal excise tax on gasoline.\ The fair allocation of federal highway dollars has become an issue in a war among the 50 states on the formula used to distribute the money.\ Some 20 states contend they have received far less from the fund than they have paid into it in gasoline taxes.\ Byrd's amendment would use $4.1 billion to compensate these states over the next five years, creating a situation in which no state would receive less than 98 cents on the dollar, with most states doing better than that.\ The second section of the amendment would pay out a $4.1 billion highway bonus to states which have imposed higher-than-average gasoline taxes to support transportation projects and which, at the same time, have lower-than-average per capita incomes.\ Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., whose state did not benefit from the Byrd amendment, said he would later try to change the measure of a state's effort to improve its transportation system.\States eligible for extra highway funds.(Graphic includes map)\The Senate highway bill offers $8.2 billion Byrd-Bentsen amendment bonus to 42 states in addition to regular allowances in Federal Highway Trust fund.\The states, bonus in millions \ Wis. 222 Source: U.S. Senate\Knight/Ridder Tribune News/Judy Treible"
47,"Residents to vote on 5-cent levy for roads: Funds also will be sought for saving farmland. \By Jeff DeLong \RENO GAZETTE-JOURNAL \With the election nearly a year away, supporters are preparing strategies to convince traditionally tax-wary Douglas County residents to reach into their wallets yet again. Everyone knows it won't be easy. \Citing a worsening state of county roads, Douglas County commissioners decided in August to place a measure on the ballot that, if approved, would increase gasoline tax collected in the county by 5 cents per gallon. The money would pay for paving and other road maintenance. \Other taxing options are on the table to finance efforts to preserve the Carson Valley's farmland. No specific proposal has been selected, but possible choices range from a hike in sales tax, a property tax increase or an increase in real estate transfer fees. \If history is any indication, both could be tough sells. In 1998, Douglas County voters agreed to a quarter-cent sales tax hike needed to pay for key public services such as parks and recreation, libraries and senior support. The vote came after an aggressive public campaign by a grass-roots group of county residents who managed to convince voters the new tax was truly needed. \But the vote was something of an anomaly. Time and time again, Douglas County voters have rejected ballot measures that would raise their taxes. In 1996, a quarter-cent tax increase that would pay for open space preservation and recreation programs was soundly rejected. \Two years earlier, citizens waged a successful referendum drive to do away with a 5-cent gasoline tax to pay for road projects. That tax is the very one county officials are asking voters to resurrect in the next election. \Since the Sept. 10 vote by the County Commission to place the gas tax before voters this year, little debate has surfaced. \Community Development Director Bob Nunes has made presentations to a couple of civic organizations pushing one simple message: The county's roads are in poor shape, and there isn't the money to fix them. \""A lot of our roads have really, literally gone to pot. We're in dire need,"" Nunes said. ""I would ask everyone the basic question, 'Are you happy with the maintenance levels of our roads?' "" \The 5-cent gas tax, Nunes said, would raise about @$!5 million worth of new construction projects. The county services 135 miles of paved roads and 70 miles of dirt roads. \""It obviously would be a significant shot in the arm as far as what we can do,"" Nunes said. \Nunes and others acknowledge that an aggressive sales job will be needed to convince voters new taxes are necessary, whether they pay for fixing roads or saving farms. \They'll have a tough job with people such as 86-year-old Louis Potter, a Carson Valley resident since 1980. \Seniors on fixed incomes can't bear many new taxes, Potter said. And they've seen some taxes passed without the promised results. \""They should find another way. We've got so many taxes on us now,"" Potter said. ""Taxes are going up all the time, and everything is sky high."" \Roy Terrell, a ew resident of the north Carson Valley, doesn't like the idea of paying more for gasoline. \But he's not entirely adverse to the idea of tax increases if he can be convinced they're really necessary. \""It depends on what good it does,"" Terrell said. ""I'm for them sometimes and against them sometimes."" \Commissioner Bernie Curtis isn't sure how many tax measures will be on the ballot this year but agreed passage of any of them won't be an easy task. \""Tax issues are a hard sell in Douglas County, and that's just the way it is,"" Curtis said. ""People are really leery of them, and I don't have a problem with that."" \WHAT IT MEANS \Taxes to pay for road maintenance and to save precious farmland will likely be considered by Douglas County voters in the next election. Passage could be a problem in a place where tax measures are often rejected. Environment; Land Use; Government; County Government; County Board Bob Nunes Nevada West\CARSON DOUGLAS; Pg. 1H"
48," By Tony Batt\ Donrey Washington Bureau\ WASHINGTON - Signaling a reluctance to roll back the federal gasoline tax, the Senate declared in a 65-35 vote last week that the 2001 budget should not assume there will be fuel tax cut.\ The vote was a blow to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R- Miss., who has said a gas tax rollback of at least 4.3 cents a gallon may be necessary to hold down soaring fuel prices for motorists.\ Opponents expressed skepticism about tampering with federal highway funds, which are a vital revenue source for states to build and maintain roads and bridges.\ Sens. Richard Bryan and Harry Reid, both D-Nev., voted against the tax cut.\ The vote came during a weeklong debate over a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October. The budget resolution sets general guidelines that Congress would cement in more detail through separate legislation later this summer.\ Abortion procedure ban\ passes House\ Renewing an annual debate, the House voted by a veto-proof margin of 287-141 to ban the controversial medical procedure known as partial-birth abortion.\ The legislation would outlaw the rare procedure in which a doctor punctures the head of a fetus and removes the brain so the skull will collapse and pass through the cervix, the narrowest part of the birth canal.\ Opponents of the ban accused its advocates of trying to weaken abortion rights. Because there are not enough votes to override a veto in the Senate, they charged proponents of the ban were playing election-year politics.\ President Clinton has said he will veto the legislation because it doesn't sufficiently protect a woman's health.\ Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., voted to ban the procedure. Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., voted against the ban.\ Organ donation\ rules rejected\ The House voted 275-147 to overturn new federal rules aimed at making sure the sickest patients get the first shot at donated organs.\ The bill would strip the Department of Health and Human Services of its authority to decide how organs should be distributed across the country. Instead, the distribution would be determined by a private network that has been running the transplant system under a contract with the federal government.\ Sponsors of the legislation said the government has failed to develop an efficient national system for sharing organs. They insisted it would be better to keep the current system, which gives priority to patients who live near a donor even if somebody farther away has a greater need.\ Opponents argued that a private entity should not have the power to distribute vital medical resources without federal oversight. The result may be that thousands die needlessly, they said.\ Berkley and Gibbons voted to maintain the current organ donation system.\ Oil exploration passed\ During the budget debate, the Senate voted 51-49 to keep a provision that assumes the government will allow oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\ Supporters of the drilling said it would help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil without damaging the environment of the refuge. Critics argued there would be an environmental toll without a significant decrease in gas pump prices.\ The close vote does not bode well for the measure's chances. The Clinton administration has signaled the president would veto any legislation opening the refuge to energy exploration.\ Bryan and Reid voted against oil drilling in the Arctic refuge.\ Gun control passed\ The Senate voted 53-47 to move a gun control measure proposed in the wake of last year's shootings of students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.\ The legislation would require safety locks for handguns, background checks on all firearms at gun shows and ban importation of large clips for automatic weapons.\ The Senate passed the measure last year, but it has been stalled in a conference committee. This week's action would send the measure to the House floor for a vote.\ Backers of the bill cited polls showing 90 percent of the American public support background checks at gun shows. Critics argued new gun control measures would not be necessary if the Clinton administration would enforce current gun laws.\ Bryan and Reid voted for the gun control measure."
49,"photo budget medicare gingrich\|Associated Press\Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole, flanked by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., center, and Virginia Gov. George Allen, right, appears at a Falls Church, Va., gasoline station Saturday.\GOPs public image tops Clinton on Doles list of foes\Strategists are surprised how deep dissatisfaction with Republicans runs in recent public opinion polls.\By John King\Associated Press\WASHINGTON - As Bob Dole deals with complaints from fellow Republicans that he is doing a poor job framing a campaign against President Clinton, he must endeavor to repair what many aides consider a bigger immediate problem: the tattered image of his own party.\While the Republican Party's woes have been clearly detailed in public opinion research dating back to last year's budget fights, many top Dole and GOP strategists were stunned at the depth of the dissatisfaction discovered at more than a dozen recent focus groups commissioned by the Republican National Committee.\Anxious to help Dole - and congressional Republicans - develop an aggressive election-year agenda, the party research included sessions with an array of critical constituencies, from Ross Perot voters, Roman Catholics and suburban women to Democrats who said their support for Clinton was weak and Republicans who defected to support Clinton against George Bush four years ago.\The findings suggested that, despite his 20-point lead in national polls, there is considerable discomfort with Clinton among swing voters who question the Democratic incumbent's honesty, commitment to principle and leadership skills. But the findings also detailed the toll last year's congressional debate took on the Republican Party's image, on issues from protecting Medicare and the environment, and the price Dole, the Senate majority leader, is paying for the GOP's poor standing.\""There is a huge anti-Washington feeling across all groups and geographical lines,"" said a senior Dole adviser who reviewed the focus group reports late last week. ""And a huge feeling that Newt Gingrich is the king of Washington. Dole personally rates better but is wearing the label of Republican Congress extremism around his neck right now.""\Dole himself has been careful not to blame Gingrich and his conservative House Republican caucus for his own plight in the polls. But many allies are less reluctant to hide their dismay, particularly at the House GOP insistence on shutting down the government last year as part of the budget standoff.\""It is the fruit of the excesses of the revolution,"" said Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain.\""There is no question the image of the party needs some repairing, especially with swing voters,"" said GOP pollster Ed Goeas. ""We do have to question our strategy of labeling this a Republican revolution. It put our opponents in a position to label us as radicals.""\Indeed, at one of the Republican Party focus groups in Knoxville, Tenn., one man made clear he was no fan of Clinton. But when talk turned to the Republicans, he summed up his feelings this way: ""Gingrich ought to be shot.""\In group after group, words like ""extreme,"" ""radical"" and ""gone too far"" were used to describe the GOP Congress.\Gingrich, concerned that he has become a political problem for Dole and the entire Republican Party, is focusing more on fund-raising these days and more carefully picking times to appear as a Republican spokesman. Just Sunday, he appeared on a live news show for the first time in months.\The troubling data from the focus groups also has had other ramifications.\The Republican National Committee plans a major television advertising effort at mid-month, and had planned to assail Clinton as a liberal hiding behind conservative rhetoric on such issues as taxes, welfare reform and crime.\But, after reviewing the data, top GOP strategists decided the urgent task was boosting the Republican Party's standing. So new ads were ordered, focusing less on Clinton and more on promoting GOP values.\The data also are being used as fresh evidence by those in the party, and within the Dole campaign, who believe it is essential for Dole to surrender day-to-day management of the Senate so that he can spend more time focusing on Clinton - and broader themes to help the GOP improve its image.\Several Senate colleagues have made this case to Dole in recent days, as have some top campaign aides and GOP Chairman Haley Barbour, according to Senate Republican sources. Gingrich said Sunday that Dole should turn over more authority to the GOP whip, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi.\Dole has at times indicated he will step back, but at other times has resisted doing so. In the next week, he will take the lead on two issues Republicans believe offer him a chance to use his Senate perch to his advantage: an effort to repeal the 1993 gas tax increase and to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget."
50,"amtrak desert wind salt lake transportation stopping ending\Disgraceful: Vegas to lose Amtrak service\By Daniel B. Lovegren\Special to the Review-Journal\Do the citizens of Las Vegas know that the last Amtrak train to their city, the Los Angeles-Las Vegas-Salt Lake City-Denver-Chicago ""Desert Wind,"" will cease to exist on May 10? Transportation-conscious Southern Nevadans gave the development of their airport, and the planning and construction of various street and highway projects, including a beltway, big play at a recent Senate hearing, but Amtrak was barely mentioned.\U.S.. Sen. Harry Reid, as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, held a field hearing at the Clark County Government Center on March 28. Among the many luminaries invited to testify were Mayor Jan Jones and Gov. Bob Miller. Most of those who testified discussed Nevada transportation issues, such as making U.S. Highway 95 an interstate highway, and building a new bridge across the Colorado River near Hoover Dam.\But no one mentioned the cessation of Amtrak service to America's favorite playground. The ""Desert Wind"" consistently outperformed many other Amtrak routes in terms of ridership. Las Vegas, in particular, is a popular destination for Amtrak passengers.\Nevada taxpayers are just as deserving of good Amtrak service as the rest of the country. It is absurd to support Amtrak service elsewhere without enjoying the benefits it can bring to Southern Nevada.\Las Vegas is a world-class city that attracts visitors from all over the world, especially Asia and Europe. These international tourists are used to good train service in their own countries and should be able to expect similarly well-developed service when they come to the United States.\There's a proposal in Washington, D.C., to solve many of Amtrak's future uncertainties by devoting one-half cent of the deficit reduction portion of the federal gas tax to pay for a modernization of Amtrak's physical plant. The outlook is uncertain, but I hope that this proposal will pass.\If the half-cent measure passes, it would be ridiculous for Amtrak management to fail to connect Las Vegas to the rest of the country, but that is its intention. As chairman of his Subcommittee, Sen. Reid should protect Southern Nevada's interests in this matter.\In the meantime, however, the train will soon be leaving the station at the back of Jackie Gaughan's Plaza for what could be the last time. Amtrak management has said that for service to continue, the state or other local government agencies must pay the bill. After May 10, Florida will be getting better train service without being required to contribute directly to the extra service's added cost. So will Reno. But not Las Vegas.\This is not about some uncertain thrill ride over the Mojave Desert to Anaheim. This is about solid. dependable, everyday passenger train service, the kind that has the potential to provide a worthwhile alternative to the long highway drive or the stressful airport run-around. The kind of transportation that serves as a jumping-off point for higher-speed, greater frequency, European-style service. Once it's gone, it's gone. It may come back someday, but don't hold your breath.\Efforts to save threatened trains in other parts of the country are meeting with various levels of success, but no attempt has been made to keep Amtrak trains running through Southern Nevada. For Las Vegas, as the prime tourist destination in the United States, such a loss can only be characterized as appalling.\Daniel B. Lovegren is director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers' Region XII."
51,"Along planned freeway: City to decide on what to offer state. \By Jody Rice \RENO GAZETTE-JOURNAL \Carson City supervisors will decide Thursday what to offer to pay the state for a proposed multiuse trail to be built along the foot of the future capital freeway. \""I don't want to pay for any of it if we don't have to,"" said Carson City Supervisor Pete Livermore of a trail estimated at up to $$@$!3.3 million. \Supervisor Jon Plank said one option is to offer more aid in cutting costs by working with property owners to decrease the retaining walls needed. \On May 9, the state Transportation Board will hear a proposal to add a multiuse trail at the bottom of the northern half of the elevated freeway. The decision is expected to be precedent-setting, because the epartment has used money only for roads. \The freeway corridor would provide the only connecting north-south pathway through the capital. The $$@$!250 million project is to be built in sections. \The first portion will extend from Arrowhead Drive to Highway 50 East and would eventually continue on to the Spooner Summit turnoff. \Plank and Supervisor Kay Bennett made their positions clear April 5 in unanimous votes of the Regional Transportation and Parks and Recreation commissions, which rejected offering any money toward the multiuse trail. They said it is time the Nevada Department of Transportation pays for more than just roadways. \The proposal the commissions rejected involved city staff suggesting $$@$!1.7 million be offered toward the trail. The portion of the money would come from the Quality of Life Initiative and Regional Transportation revenues for 17 years. \Another suggestion, offered only if the state won't pay, is to have the nickel-a-gallon gas tax extended one year. The gas tax was levied in 1997 to pay $$@$!20 million toward the freeway. \Livermore said he is hopeful the state may pay after hearing the Federal Highway Administration supports bike paths being built with new projects. The federal agency is paying 95 percent of the total project cost. \NDOT Assistant Director Susan Martinovich said any money used toward a pathway would mean another road project not having enough funding. \TO ATTEND \Thursday's Board of Supervisors meeting will begin at 8:30 a.m. at the Carson City Community Center, 851 E.

52,"No doubt, hybrid and electric cars are friendlier to the environment and owners of these vehicles save more money each time gasoline prices increase. \But these green vehicles are not as good for government agencies such as the Nevada Department of Transportation. To departments charged with building and maintaining roads, they require fewer trips to the gas station, which means less fuel-tax revenue, which translates into less green, as in money, to expand or improve the road system. \The transportation division is joining several other states in studying a Vehicle Miles Traveled program that would attach a fee for each mile driven. Such a system eventually could replace fuel taxes nationwide, but that undoubtedly is many, many years down the road. \""We are looking for future funds,"" said Susan Martinovich, director of our state's Department of Transportation. ""That's our job.""\Plenty of questions still swirl around the idea, even though some states have conducted pilot programs to gauge public interest and test different types of technology that might be used to count mileage. This study is in its infancy stages so many of the questions remain unanswered.\Martinovich said the purpose of such a program is to create equality among drivers. \She pointed out that it doesn't matter if there are 100 hybrid vehicles on the road or 100 gas guzzlers. They are still causing wear and tear on the roads; they are still contributing to the congestion on our freeways. The difference is, the gas guzzlers' contribution to revenues is far greater because of the amount of gasoline purchased.\""We have to find a way to capture the cost of those (hybrid and electric) vehicles,"" said Scott Rawlins, deputy director of the department. ""With gas tax and more efficient vehicles, we're getting less dollars everyday for transportation. Right now, we do not get enough money in transportation dollars to maintain and add capacity to address the needs out there today.""\Fuel taxes have not increased since 1993. That combined with an increasing number of fuel-efficient vehicles and higher costs to build roads and bridges weakens the purchase power of gas tax revenues.\If motorists pay fees for miles traveled, fuel taxes, which amount to 52 cents per gallon, would go away. Nevada officials haven't determined what the fee would be, and it could vary depending on the vehicle class or weight. Although hybrids and electric cars would be charged, they might get a break because they are more environmentally friendly. \Fees might also vary depending on the time of day you drive and the route taken. Fees might be higher during rush hour on Interstate 15 than they would be on a rural road midmorning. That might deter motorists from taking discretionary trips or at least rethink their timing.\With that said, even with one flat fee across the board, at least the transportation department wouldn't be losing ground on funding, Rawlins said.\The department is still trying to figure out how to track miles and dispense fee revenues for motorists headed on a cross-country road trip or even a weekend trip to Southern California for that matter. They also haven't determined what device will be used to track the miles, but whatever it is it will be installed in each vehicle. \Billing is also up in the air. Motorists could report their annual mileage when they register their vehicles and pay their fee in one lump sum or the department could read mileage monthly and bill the vehicle owner. \One element of the program that will be a huge priority is public outreach, Rawlins said.\""It has to be customer friendly; easy to use and understand. The customer service focus of the study is really important.""\The department is embarking on that priority now - well, Thursday. Transportation officials will be available from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday in the cafeteria of the Clark County Government Center, 500 S. Grand Central Parkway, to answer questions about the study.\Road Work Ahead\*\u2002Twain Avenue between Eastern and Emerson avenues will be closed through Friday to excavate a sewer line in the center of the street. Work hours are between 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. daily. Those traveling north or south are advised to use Pecos-McLeod Drive and Eastern Avenue; Viking Road is suggested for east-west traffic.

53,"By Erin Middlewood\Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service\Ten years have passed since the Exxon Valdez ran aground and leaked 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's pristine Prince William Sound.\Since that disaster on March 24, 1989, we haven't done enough to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\Sure, requiring double-hulled tankers is great, and establishing a $1 billion oil spill trust fund, which came out of Exxon's settlement with the federal government, is a help. But these actions don't address the underlying source of oil-spill risk: our dependence on automobiles, and their dependence on gasoline.\After all, when something went wrong, the Valdez was retrieving oil from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline so we could all have tigers in our tanks, as the old Exxon marketing slogan went.\When the tanker ran aground, it bled at least 10.8 million gallons of crude into the sound, spoiling 1,500 miles of coastline.\According to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, the spill's death toll included 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles and as many as 22 killer whales.\That's dramatic. The slow environmental degradation caused by vehicle emissions isn't.\At the International Oil Spill Conference in Seattle earlier this month, scientists argued about how thoroughly and quickly ecosystems recover from the Exxon Valdez and other massive oil spills. There's no debating, however, that Prince William Sound looks a whole lot better now than it did that spring day 10 years ago.\But what if we could see the pounds of carbon dioxide that spew from our tail pipes? Even as Prince William Sound has been cleaned up, we've continued to pollute our environment with fossil-fuel- guzzling motor vehicles, which are getting bigger and greedier than ever.\No wonder the Sierra Club awarded the new Ford sport utility vehicle the ""Exxon Valdez Environmental Achievement Award."" The Excursion, with its 44-gallon gas tank, weighs more than four tons and gets as little as 10 miles per gallon.\Such sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups account for half of new-vehicle sales. Environmental groups attribute the 10 percent rise in transportation carbon dioxide emissions between 1990 and 1997 to increased driving and these vehicles, which take America's love affair with the car to new heights.\At current rates, the United States won't meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012, as agreed upon at the Kyoto conference on global warming in 1997. And car companies probably won't stop making hungry behemoths any time soon.\We can't see the effects of carbon dioxide as easily as the oil slick in Prince William Sound, so we just chug along.\Only a dreamer would say we could all do without cars. That doesn't mean, though, that there's nothing to be done. Better public transportation and city planning would make getting around easier. The federal government should boost research into alternative fuels and energy efficiency. Companies that encourage telecommuting should be rewarded. A hike in the gas tax to fund public transportation, fuel research and reduce demand is warranted.\If we don't wean ourselves from gas-guzzling cars, we will continue to befoul the environment, and we invite another Exxon Valdez disaster.\Erin Middlewood of Longview, Wash., is former editor of the Progressive Media Project."

A new analysis of air travel in the Intermountain West suggests Las Vegas would be an ideal hub for a high-speed rail network and because of the heavy load of travelers between McCarran International Airport and Southern California is primed for a high-speed rail link connecting the two regions.
\
The report, prepared by the centrist Brookings Institution, points out that McCarran is one of the busiest short-haul airports in the country, shuttling millions of travelers to and from Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City and other Western cities. About 3.7 million passengers shuttled between Las Vegas and Los Angeles in the year ending March 2009.
\
The data would seem to provide fresh evidence for advocates of high-speed rail. Transportation experts say high-speed rail makes the most sense for two large, tightly linked metropolitan areas 200 to 500 miles apart.
\
Your region has come late to the high-speed rail scrimmage, but this evidence suggests that theres a legitimate claim to be made, said Mark Muro, a co-author of the report and a senior fellow at Brookings, which recently formed a partnership with UNLV.
\
The high-speed rail debate has kicked up since the election of President Barack Obama, whose administration budgeted $8 billion in seed money for a series of rail links across the country, including one from here to Southern California, which provides as much as one-third of Vegas tourist traffic on a given weekend.
\
The Las Vegas-L.A. rail idea has been mocked by some Republicans, who called it the Disney Train or the Gambling Train, though the volume
\
of air and car traffic from here to Southern California would seem to suggest that if high-speed rail should be built anywhere, its here, Muro said.
\
Our point here is that the criteria in corridor decisions are unfolding in a highly political, quite rhetorical, facts-come-last environment, and that the evidence ought to be considered, Muro added.
\
Stephen Van Beek, president of the Eno Transportation Foundation, a transportation think tank, agreed: Vegas is the right type of market for high-speed rail.
\
For now, however, a rail link to Southern California, which has been discussed for decades, faces significant obstacles.
\
There are two competing visions for high-speed rail here. This summer Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced his support for DesertXpress, the proposed 150-mph, privately operated train to be financed in part with government loans that would travel to Victorville, the high-desert community 80 miles from Los Angeles.
\
Supporters of a competing magnetic levitation train havent surrendered their hopes for the $12 billion, publicly financed 300-mph line that would carry passengers between Las Vegas and Orange County.
\
The Brookings report raises other important issues for national and regional transportation officials, chiefly on the issue of air traffic congestion.
\
Policymakers have some breathing room to confront the issue of congestion because the recession has decreased air traffic. Especially hit is McCarran, where the passenger count has dropped from a peak of nearly 48 million passengers in 2007 to an expected 40 million this year.
\
An expansion will bring McCarrans capacity to 53 million passengers in 2012.
\
But transportation officials say congestion and long delays that result will return. The Brookings report suggests congestion pricing higher taxes for flights during peak times and lower taxes for off-peak; more money for the busiest airports, which currently receive a lower proportional share because Congress must distribute money to small airports to get needed political support; as well as quicker implementation of new air traffic control technologies.
\
Randall Walker, director of Clark Countys Aviation Department, noted that with a national, interconnected aviation system, there are no easy solutions.
\
He said the airport has never viewed itself as a servant of the airlines, and said he supports the idea of high-speed rail as a transportation option between here and Southern California.
\
The idea isnt universally supported, however.
\
Gabriel Roth, a research fellow at the Independent Institute, said the billions proposed for high-speed rail would amount to a massive taxpayer subsidy for the trains middle- and upper-income passengers, whereas road and air passengers pay their own way with user taxes, such as the gas tax.
\
Im skeptical of anything for which customers are not prepared to pay. Thats my critique, he said.
\
Mass transit advocates reply that drivers and airline passengers receive all kinds of subsidies of their own.
\
Roth advocates a dedicated, high-speed bus lane as more efficient and cost effective.
\
Rail advocates point to advantages of a high-speed rail link other than just less congestion. Pete Dronkers of Environment Nevada notes that high-speed rail would create one-fourth the pollution of comparable air travel and one-third that of auto traffic.
\
Van Beek said that after decades of failing to develop a comprehensive transportation plan that coordinates all modes, now is the time: What policymakers need to do at a national level and the regional level is look at all alternatives and determine costs and benefits.

But the rural road generated a bidding frenzy last November that was far beyond its humble stature.\After posting a project to repair Rainbow Canyon Road, the Nevada Department of Transportation received 16 bids, an unusually high number for a project of its size, NDOT spokesperson Scott Magruder said. In addition to construction firms based in Las Vegas and nearby Utah, the bidders also included Road & Highway Builders, which is based in Sparks.\With an office in Las Vegas, Road & Highway Builders is no stranger to working on projects outside Northern Nevada.\But the company also posted the winning $32.8 million bid last year on a highway project that wasn't just outside of the state, it was outside of the U.S. mainland -- in Hawaii.\Road & Highway Builders isn't the only company expanding its construction horizons.

Reno-based West Coast Contractors of Nevada, Inc., won a bid for a federal construction project in Los Banos, Calif., more than 250 miles away, about a month ago. The company also recently ""chased jobs"" in places as far as Bend, Ore., and Farmington, N.M.\""We used to be able to make our numbers right here in town and the surrounding areas,"" said Paul Sorensen, senior estimator for West Coast Contractors.

The project was awarded in April 6 to Las Vegas-based Meadow Valley Contractors, which submitted the lowest bid at $21.8 million.\The awarding of the Meadowood Way project to a Las Vegas company stung for local firms such as Q&D, which submitted the second-lowest bid at $22.2 million.\The project originally was slated to incorporate money from Washoe County's Regional Transportation Commission-5 or RTC-5 construction initiative, which local contractors played a key role in passing.\RTC-5 passed in late 2008 and is estimated to fund between $80 million to $90 million in new construction projects annually for its first three years, according to the RTC.\""Now, that we've got a little bit of work here from projects coming out of RTC-5, everybody and their little brother is trying to get a piece of the action,"" said Norm Dianda, president and owner of Q&D. ""It's a little bit concerning because we were the ones who went out and helped support getting the gas tax revenue passed for RTC-5.

With the AGC estimating more than 50 percent unemployment for Northern Nevada's construction work force, area contractors need all the work they can get.\""Many of the local contractors have worked very hard to get additional funding for (these jobs),"" Harris said. ""So, their time and efforts to put local people back to work are somewhat wasted when out-of-area contractors bring in their own crews and those payroll dollars leave the area.""\Plans for the Meadowood Way Interchange project were revised recently and will no longer include RTC-5 money, said Felicia Archer, RTC public information officer. Instead, the project will be financed primarily through stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\Archer pointed to a surprising ""bidding climate"" as the reason for the change. Even SNC's high bid of $26.8 million was below NDOT's initial estimates for the project, which ranged from $28.5 million to $34 million.\""Until a few days ago, RTC-5 money was going to be used for the project,"" Archer said.

""Not knowing the local subcontractor market, for example can be a concern. Personnel matters can also be difficult when you're far away from home.\""We have gone to other places, but we're not pursuing work beyond where we think we can perform properly.""\But those in the industry agree these are desperate times for construction companies. Q&D, for example, has gone from a work force of 1,150 just a few years ago to 288, Dianda said.\United Construction has seen its share of layoffs as well, ""just like everybody else,"" Wilcutt said.\With the industry looking at sobering jobless numbers across the board, going outside a contractor's normal comfort zone starts to look appealing for many.\""Contractors will go where they can find work,"" ACG's Harris said.

The project was awarded in April 6 to Las Vegas-based Meadow Valley Contractors, which submitted the lowest bid at $21.8 million.\The awarding of the Meadowood Way project to a Las Vegas company stung for local firms such as Q&D, which submitted the second-lowest bid at $22.2 million.\The project originally was slated to incorporate money from Washoe County's Regional Transportation Commission-5 or RTC-5 construction initiative, which local contractors played a key role in passing.\RTC-5 passed in late 2008 and is estimated to fund between $80 million to $90 million in new construction projects annually for its first three years, according to the RTC.\""Now, that we've got a little bit of work here from projects coming out of RTC-5, everybody and their little brother is trying to get a piece of the action,"" said Norm Dianda, president and owner of Q&D. ""It's a little bit concerning because we were the ones who went out and helped support getting the gas tax revenue passed for RTC-5. There's a bunch of us who have been in business here for a long time, and we're the ones who have been supporting the community all this time.""\The frustration is understandable, said Buzz Harris, assistant executive director of the Nevada chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America. With the AGC estimating more than 50 percent unemployment for Northern Nevada's construction work force, area contractors need all the work they can get.\""Many of the local contractors have worked very hard to get additional funding for (these jobs),"" Harris said. ""So, their time and efforts to put local people back to work are somewhat wasted when out-of-area contractors bring in their own crews and those payroll dollars leave the area.""\Plans for the Meadowood Way Interchange project were revised recently and will no longer include RTC-5 money, said Felicia Archer, RTC public information officer. Instead, the project will be financed primarily through stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\Archer pointed to a surprising ""bidding climate"" as the reason for the change. Even SNC's high bid of $26.8 million was below NDOT's initial estimates for the project, which ranged from $28.5 million to $34 million.\""Until a few days ago, RTC-5 money was going to be used for the project,"" Archer said. ""But this was changed because the bid came in a lot less than what was originally predicted.""\Driven by need\The increase in the number of companies that bid for out-of-area jobs underscores the tough times faced by the construction sector, industry insiders said.\Although it isn't out of the ordinary for companies with a national footprint such as Granite Construction to take projects in different areas, local companies typically don't like to stray from their comfort zone. Reno-based United Construction tries to focus on its traditional markets, which are Northern Nevada and Las Vegas.\""Logistics become a problem (when you operate outside your area),"" said Craig Wilcutt, president and CEO of United Construction. ""Not knowing the local subcontractor market, for example can be a concern. Personnel matters can also be difficult when you're far away from home.\""We have gone to other places, but we're not pursuing work beyond where we think we can perform properly.""\But those in the industry agree these are desperate times for construction companies. Q&D, for example, has gone from a work force of 1,150 just a few years ago to 288, Dianda said.\United Construction has seen its share of layoffs as well, ""just like everybody else,"" Wilcutt said.\With the industry looking at sobering jobless numbers across the board, going outside a contractor's normal comfort zone starts to look appealing for many.\""Contractors will go where they can find work,"" ACG's Harris said. ""Until there's a change in the financial situation of banks lending to private owners or you have more public works dollars available, contractors will do what they can to survive. That includes bidding out of state for area contractors, as well as contractors from outside the area coming here.""\'Fire sale'\With the limited number of projects available, some companies are willing to post bids where they break even so they can get jobs for their crews. Some contractors actually are willing to lose money on a project and essentially buy jobs just to keep crews working, Harris said.\The ""fire sale"" environment raises the potential for some winning bids that are so low, there's a risk that a project's quality might be compromised. Even NDOT, which describes the low costs in today's construction environment as a positive for taxpayers, is leery about questionably low bids.\For the Rainbow Canyon Road project, Las Vegas-based Southwest Iron Works' winning bid of $9.3 million was significantly below initial NDOT projections of $13.5 million to $16.5 million. Magruder was assured that Southwest Iron Works has met the requirements for the job and will be subject to regular inspections, just like any winning bidder.\Even with peak construction season at hand, contractors expect the trend of low bids and more out-of-area work to continue. Bidding is expected to be competitive for road and public works projects as residential and commercial real estate construction remain stagnant."
58,"rhagar@rgj.com\The four Republicans running in state Senate District 4 agree on one thing, that lawmakers should not renew the nearly $1 billion in tax increases approved by the 2009 Legislature.\Renewing the taxes will be one of the first battles of the 2011 session. Each candidate has other ideas on how to help the state's struggling economy.\Although the state faces a deficit projected at more than $3 billion, Todd ""Taxpayer"" Bailey wants the state's Modified Business Tax eliminated.\""No. 1, eliminate the payroll tax,"" Bailey, 45, said. ""The payroll tax is inherently unfair because some of the highest-paid employees in the state of Nevada do not pay the payroll tax. The payroll tax is not paid by any public employees and some of the highest-paid employees are public employees.\""If we want to talk about broadening the tax base, we need to broaden the payroll tax or get rid of it. It is not fair. It creates a skewed employment market place that is absolutely unfair and ineffective.""\Bailey also wants Nevada to build an energy park, push for more manufacturing industries and move toward unlimited net-metered bill for electricity.\""Taxes are a big thing but one of the barriers to a big manufacturing facility in Nevada is the cost of electricity and to getting the power out to where ever the location is,"" Bailey said.\Frank Wright of Incline Village wants to return state government to the level of 2000. Many Republicans have contended that state government grew too large in the last decade.\""We need to streamline government and take out the fluff we have been adding for the past 10 years,"" Wright, 61, said. ""It was much more efficient 10 years ago and I think we need to take a look at that.""\Wright, an author and former teacher, wants parents to take more responsibility to help improve the education system.\""Parents should not be allowed to let their kids drop out of school without being taxed or penalized, to encourage them to keep their kids in school,"" Wright said. ""Schools should allow nothing but graduation. Also maybe we should have a state law that says you can't leave school until you are 18 under any condition and that would stop the dropout rate right away.""\Cobb is the only Senate candidate with legislative experience, serving two terms in the Assembly. In that time, Cobb said he has been fighting for many of the issues that are dear to Republicans, including immigration reform.\""I've sponsored many bills that have become GOP talking points, including putting Yucca Mountain to use, reforming the PERS (Public Employee Retirement Fund), reforming the educational system,"" Cobb said.\""When I voted against the largest tax increase in Nevada history last session, I predicted that we would have higher unemployment because of it and sure enough, the unemployment rate has gone up several points since then. So for us to think we can raise taxes and somehow turn the economy around, is foolish.""\If elected, Cobb see a clear path: ""First of all, do no harm to the economy. If we continue to raise taxes, we will continue to lose jobs.""\Kieckhefer, 33, would work to push growth for businesses, which would include keeping Nevada a tax-friendly state for businesses.\""One thing we need to do to spur job growth and bring new businesses into Nevada is think outside of just California. We need to reach internationally and focus on some of those companies that are creating a lot of the components for renewable energy that we are trying to lure into this state, the wind turbines, the solar cells,"" Kieckhefer said.\""Especially in Northern Nevada, along the I-80 corridor, we have geothermal resources available to us,"" he said.\""And coupled with the key transportation corridors of I-80 and the railroad right there, we have the ability to market Northern Nevada as a prime place to manufacture those components that will be used throughout the western United States and the United States as a whole.""\FIVE QUESTIONS\Todd ""Taxpayer"" Bailey\1. Nearly $700 million in increased sales, payroll and business license taxes will expire in 2011. Would you vote to extend those increases?\""No. Taxpayers in Senate District 4 have lost their jobs and businesses and have had to tap into their savings and their children's future. They cannot afford that tax increase. They could not afford it in 2009 and can't afford it in 2011. The answer to this problem is the expediential creation of jobs and that should be the No. 1 job of the Nevada Legislature in 2011, creating an environment to create many, many new jobs.\2. The state is expected to face a nearly $3 billion revenue shortfall in 2011. How would you propose addressing this problem? What would you cut and/or how would you raise revenue?\""Depending on the economy, the shortfall could be $4 billion. Very tough decisions need to be made. We need to eliminate the payroll tax so that everybody in the United States and in the world who is thinking of moving to Nevada will know Nevada is serious about creating an environment that creates many, many new jobs. That is how we solve this problem. If the solution can't be found there, we'll have the continued discussions about fewer and fewer resources. Now that is a discussion I am prepared to have but that is not the discussion I want to have. But I am prepared for it. I am prepared to make the tough decisions.""\3. Does the state need to reform its basic revenue structure? What ideas do you have to do that?\""Reforming the revenue structure often means higher taxes when it comes out of the mouth of a politician. The area that needs the most attention is reform of the current taxes that we have, property tax being No. 1. That will require a vote of the people to change the constitution and I will work to give the people of Nevada that opportunity. if there is going to be a solution that requires new revenue, the people of Nevada should have their voices heard, not just the voices in the Nevada Legislature. I trust the people of Nevada to make the decisions that are best for the people of Nevada. I will work to give them that opportunity.""\4. Nevada has consistently ranked poorly in education indicators. How would you improve the quality of the state's education system?\""There are many, many things that can be done to change polices at the Legislature that will improve education in Nevada and make it more effective that are revenue neutral. The way we measure how successful our education system in Nevada is broken. You have to look at it a lot more specifically, you have to look at the individual groups in the school system to make a determination of who is being successful. The education system in Nevada should not be the one-stop shop to cure every social problem in our community. However, that is the responsibility we have placed on it and that needs to change.""\5. Nevada's economy has suffered more than most states in the current recession. What would you do to spur job creation, address the housing crisis and otherwise stabilize our troubled economy?\""No. 1, eliminate the payroll tax. The payroll tax is inherently unfair because some of the highest-paid employees in the state of Nevada do not pay the payroll tax. The payroll tax is not paid by any public employees and some of the highest-paid employees are public employees. If we want to talk about broadening the tax base, we need to broaden the payroll tax or get rid of it. It is not fair. It creates a skewed employment market place that is absolutely unfair and ineffective.""\""No. 2, build a Nevada energy park and everything that goes with it. Nuclear reprocessing, big time research in that area, big time research in renewable energy, that is what gets the universities focused on a growth sector. The third part is really go after manufacturing. Manufacturing is where Nevada is weak, in terms of a broad economy. We need manufacturing.\""No. 4 is unlimited-net metering for electricity. I want to turn every property owner into a power generator. Right now we don't have unlimited-net metered billing for electricity. There are some technical difficulties with that but we can overcome them. That will provide some incentive for every commercial property owned and every home owner to use something, be it wind or solar, to get that power meter to work in the other direction. Nevada could start exporting energy instead of importing energy. We can bring down the cost of energy. Taxes are a big thing but one of the barriers to a big manufacturing facility in Nevada is the cost of electricity and to get the power out to where ever their location is. If we have unlimited-net metred billing, that will really help that problem.""\TY COBB\1. Nearly $700 million in increased sales, payroll and business license taxes will expire in 2011. Would you vote to extend those increases?\""I voted against that tax hike in the last legislative session. That is one of the things that differentiates me from my opponents. I have held the line on taxes and will continue to do so to get this economy turned around. I have said that those tax increases would be job killers and believe I was right, because the unemployment rate has gone up several points since. It is foolish to think that we can tax ourselves into prosperity in the future.""\2. The state is expected to face a nearly $3 billion revenue shortfall in 2011. How would you propose addressing this problem? What would you cut and/or how would you raise revenue?\""We need to do what every private-sector business and family are doing and that is to cut back and live within their means. In my private sector job, I am part of a management team that has seen a decrease of about 30 percent in revenue and we are still breaking even as a company. If the private sector can do it, the government can do it. It is a matter of the desire to do so, not the ability.\""In terms of specifics, we need to implement some of the institutional reforms that have been ignored by the Democrat leadership, including the PERS reform, the reform of our education system to allow for greater competition and we need to prohibit state benefits for illegal immigrants. We also need to have serious consideration of the future of Yucca Mountain as a new revenue source for the state, as opposed to our blind opposition of the past. I was one of the people who encouraged Gov. Gibbons to establish the SAGE Commission back in 2007. The SAGE Commission responded with some very solid ideas and almost none of them were installed last session. They amount to multi-million dollar savings over the years and those proposals need to considered and implemented.""\3. Does the state need to reform its basic revenue structure? What ideas do you have to do that?\""Any state in this current economy is facing a budget shortfall, so it is kind of a red herring to suggest that our structure is somehow unique in the deficit we have been running. The worst thing we can do now is increase taxes and expect to tax ourselves back into prosperity. We need to cut back like every private sector individual is doing and prioritize our spending as best as possible to prevent job-killing tax increases.""\4. Nevada has consistently ranked poorly in education indicators. How would you improve the quality of the state's education system?\""In the special session, we heard testimony from superintendents and school board members and they said we have had education reform, including pay for performance (for teachers) and things like that. And in our discussion I said that is fine if you want to consider pay-for-performance but it is not true reform. True reform not only has the carrot on one end of the stick but it also the stick on the other end. Right now, we keep dumping money into pay increases, in to benefit increases and bonuses without any type of accountability on the other end. What is lacking in the Nevada education system is any kind of accountability. I would require that, as part of an overall education reform package, that would also include the greater flexibility for charter schools and vouchers for underprivileged kids.""\5. Nevada's economy has suffered more than most states in the current recession. What would you do to spur job creation, address the housing crisis and otherwise stabilize our troubled economy?\""First of all, do no harm to the economy. If we continue to raise taxes, we will continue to lose jobs. When I voted against the largest tax increase in Nevada history last session, I predicted that we would have higher unemployment because of it and sure enough, the unemployment rate has gone up several points since then. So for us to think we can raise taxes and somehow turn the economy around, is foolish. What we need to do is focus on institutional reforms that will save us money in the short term and the long term as well as short-term budget cuts so we can make sure that the money is in the private sector, creating jobs. When I go knock on doors and talk to people, rarely do I hear people say hey, take more of my money into the government sector. Instead they say that I have been out of work for a year or my child has been out of work for months and they just want a job. And if you put more money into the private sector, you are going to turn this economy around and everyone is going to benefit from it.""\BEN KIECKHEFER\1. Nearly $700 million in increased sales, payroll and business license taxes will expire in 2011. Would you vote to extend those increases?\I don't support extending those tax increases as we go into the next legislative session. We need to be stimulating business growth and not hindering it and I believe that payroll has a significant impact on a company's ability to hire people out of this recession.""\2. The state is expected to face a nearly $3 billion revenue shortfall in 2011. How would you propose addressing this problem? What would you cut and/or how would you raise revenue?\""First and foremost, we need to prioritize what we do as a government. The executive branch is currently undertaking an effort to look at that and I support that effort to really review all of our services that are provided by the state and evaluate which ones we deem the most important and fund those first.\""Secondly, one of the things I would like to focus on is the programs we are subsidizing out of the general fund that should not be funded by those general fund dollars. One of the examples is the Millennium Scholarship Program. That was a program that was set up to be funded by the tobacco settlement. When those funds started coming in short as to what is needed to maintain the scholarship program we ended up dumping millions of dollars form the state's general fund into the Millennium Scholarship Fund. Those dollar are being taken away from K-12 education, those are dollars that are being taken away from public safety and services that could be used more for the core functions of government.\""It (Millennium Scholarship Program) served a purpose. And with the shortcomings of the program overall, I would prefer a much broader overhaul of the program. We should really convert it into a revolving loan fund instead of a grant program. That way, it will become self-sustaining and it will extend the life of the program so we can help more people over the long haul.""\3. Does the state need to reform its basic revenue structure? What ideas do you have to do that?\""Like most states in the country, we are in a recession right now. So to suggest the shortfalls of our current revenue are based on our tax structure, ignores the broader picture of what is happening nationally and globally.""\4. Nevada has consistently ranked poorly in education indicators. How would you improve the quality of the state's education system?\""First and foremost, the state needs to create more accountability within the system. I support the empowerment model, including giving greater decision making authority over funding to the individual schools. Secondly, we need to take back some of the power that has been turned over to the teachers union. We need to keep in mind what the purpose of the teachers union is. And that is to protect the salaries and the benefits of its members, the teachers and not the school children. So when we are taking our advice on how to educate from teachers, from the union, the union is there to protect the teachers and not the kids. That is not to disparage teachers. My mom was a teacher and I have a great amount of respect for what they do. But we need to keep our eye on where we are getting our advice all of the time.\""We also need to prepare people so they are ready for the work place. I am a strong supporter for career and technical education.""\5. Nevada's economy has suffered more than most states in the current recession. What would you do to spur job creation, address the housing crisis and otherwise stabilize our troubled economy?\""One thing we need to do to spur job growth and bring new businesses into Nevada is think outside of just California. We need to reach internationally and focus on some of those companies that are creating a lot of the components for renewable energy that we are trying to lure into this state, the wind turbines, the solar cells. Especially in Northern Nevada, along the I-80 corridor, we have geothermal resources available to us. And coupled with the key transportation corridors of I-80 and the railroad right there, we have the ability to market Northern Nevada as a prime place to manufacture those components that will be used throughout the western United States and the United States as a whole. We can spearhead that through the lieutenant governor's office and the Commission on Economic Development.""\FRANK WRIGHT\1. Nearly $700 million in increased sales, payroll and business license taxes will expire in 2011. Would you vote to extend those increases?\""No. I think there are other ways to fill the budgets gaps without taxing people who are working more than they are already being taxed. Taking money away from hard-working people is immoral and that needs to sunset.""\2. The state is expected to face a nearly $3 billion revenue shortfall in 2011. How would you propose addressing this problem? What would you cut and/or how would you raise revenue?\""I would immediately want across-the-board budget administrative cuts in the government and I would find ways to cut salaries but not fire people. Taking a salary cut, like the Washoe County teachers have done, is important. I would rather see 1,000 teachers take a 5 percent cut than to fire 50 teachers. I would rather see small cuts in government workers' pay, and pensions, if possible, to keep everybody working and keep the system operating the best it can. We need to streamline government and take out the fluff we have been adding for the past 10 years. It was much more efficient 10 years ago and I think we need to take a look at that. As far as bringing business in, we need to have outside recruitment of businesses. We have to have incentives to bring them here and we have to have an education base that is strong and makes people want to bring their families here. And if we have an educational system that is broken, that is going to be very difficult to do.""\3. Does the state need to reform its basic revenue structure? What ideas do you have to do that?\""Go ahead and have a sales tax on cigarettes, a bigger sales tax on liquor, a bigger sales tax for bigger vehicles that consume extra gas, and if possible, have a gas tax that would make people go to smaller vehicles. Your smog licenses fees, you may be able to increase those by a percentage. There are all kinds of ways of raising revenues that we don't do right now so we won't have to tax the heck out of everybody.""\4. Nevada has consistently ranked poorly in education indicators. How would you improve the quality of the state's education system?\""What they are doing right now is not working. We have a problem. We have hard working families that really can't go to the classroom and follow their kid's academic achievement and they (students) get lost in the shuffle. So we need to go back and have the community part of the school system. We need the parents to become more actively engaged in the class room and by going into the classroom, the parents will be able to witness what their kids are experiencing. The parents need to take control about what is going on with their kids. Parents should not be allowed to let their kid drop out of school without being taxed or penalized, to encourage them to keep their kids in school. Schools should allow nothing but graduation. Also maybe we should have a state law that says you can't leave school until you are 18 under any condition and that would stop the dropout rate right away.""\5. Nevada's economy has suffered more than most states in the current recession. What would you do to spur job creation, address the housing crisis and otherwise stabilize our troubled economy?\""I would suggest some legislative action to try and slow down the foreclosure rates and find ways to restructure loans from the state level. Also, we can't rely any longer on the gaming industry. We have to encourage other industries and other companies to come in. I think we need to create other import-export businesses that produce goods here. We have everything here. We need to fill these empty buildings with industry and technology. We need to sit down with campaigns or committees or delegations to go out and recruit companies to come in here. We should travel to other places to find out what is working. We have to look at ways to change what we are doing and not just sit around and talk about it.""\Biographies\TODD ""TAXPAYER"" BAILEY\Age: 45\Home: Reno\Family: Engaged; two children\Occupation: Businessman involved in iPhone application development, real estate and strategic planning.\Education: High school graduate, has taken classes at Truckee Meadows Community College and the University of Nevada, Reno and has focused on speech communication and digital media.\Political experience: Board member of Sierra Nevada Community Access Television 1996-99.\TY COBB\Age: 34\Home: Reno\Occupation: Lawyer for Jensen Precast\Education: Law degree from McGeorge School of Law\Family: Divorced; one daughter\Political experience: Two-term assemblyman from Reno\BEN KIECKHEFER\Age: 33\Home: Reno\Occupation: Public information officer for the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services\Family: Married, wife April; two sets of twins, ages 4 and 1\Political experience: First campaign\Education: Master's degree in public-affairs report from the University of Illinois-Springfleid, 2001\FRANK WRIGHT\Age: 61\Home: Incline Village\Family: Married to Lisa; five children\Occupation: Retired teacher and author\Eduction: Two masters degree, history/government and administration\Political experience: Former candidate for Incline Village board of trustees"
59,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."

61,"By Jody Rice \RENO GAZETTE-JOURNAL \Two Carson City advisory boards say it's time for the state transportation department to pay for more than just roadways. \A proposed $$@$!3.5 million multiuse pathway at the foot of the future Carson City freeway is just the place to start, they said. \""There's no better place for the precedent to be set thanin the state capital,"" said Jon Plank, Regional Transportation commissioner. \The proposed pathway would be located along the route of the $$@$!130 million, 3.8-mile northern half of the future freeway, located east of town. Part of the freeway will be elevated as high as 40 feet. Construction of bridges is under way, and roadway construction should begin in early 2001. ""If not now in Carson City, then when?"" asked Kay Bennett, another commissioner. ""The Federal Highway Administration mandate (for construction of bike paths) is a year old."" \On Wednesday, the Regional Transportation and Parks and Recreation commissions unanimously agreed to support the pathway being built and to reject spending the city's money to pay for half the cost. \The staff proposal was for Carson City to offer to pay $$@$!1.7 million of the cost through a portion of Quality of Life Initiative and Regional Transportation revenues for 17 years. \Many commissioners felt Carson City has already done enough by increasing the gas tax to put $$@$!20 million toward the freeway. \""I believe we've given our pound of flesh,"" said Parks and Recreation Commissioner Glen Martel. \A majority of the 11 audience members who spoke out expressed support for the pathway. Retiree Jackie Stroud, who moved to Carson City from Sacramento, said she rode her bike to work for 22 years.

62,"No funding from NDOT: Agency will seek plan amendment. \By Jody Rice \RENO GAZETTE-JOURNAL \If Carson City wants a landscaped bike or pedestrian pathway along the future freeway, the capital city is likely on its own to figure out how to do it. \Nevada Department of Transportation announced it will not pay for the construction of the pathway along the freeway, being built to lessen traffic congestion on U.S. 395 through downtown Carson City. \Instead of building the bike path, NDOT will seek an amendment to the State's Transportation Plan to eliminate the bike path designation that has been in both the city and state transportation plan for years. \The plan has to be amended or the Federal Highway Administration will not release the millions in federal money for the project unless the path is built or eliminated. \Public meetings have not yet been scheduled. \""The concern the department has is the cost of the facilities, which are estimated to be between @$!8 million,"" wrote NDOT Assistant Director Susan Martinovich to City Manager John Berkich in a Jan. 24 memo.

She said a private engineer estimated the cost closer to $$@$!2 million. \""Doesn't NDOT pay attention to its own plans in setting budgets for transportation projects?"" she queried. \The first phase of the freeway, including bridges, drainage improvements and 3.8-mile roadway from Lakeview Hill to U.S. 50 East, is expected to cost about $$@$!95 million. Construction is expected to begin on the roadway in 2001 and be completed by 2003 or 2004. \Supervisor Robin Williamson said many people have said the cost of the pathway seems like a drop in the bucket compared to the roadway's overall expense. \City and state officials met Jan. 11. At that time, it was agreed the state would seek elimination of the bike path in the state's plan and Carson City would keep it in its own plan. \""While the paths can be built within the right-of-way, it will need to be done as a separate project,"" Martinovich wrote. ""Accordingly, we discussed that the city will need to pursue alternate funding sources for the path. \""The city and state will enter into an agreement that the freeway right-of-way of Phase 1 can be utilized in the future for a bike facility."" \NDOT spokesman Scott Magruder said there could be some compromises in the future where NDOT could help out. \""It's dead but it's not dead,"" he said. \On Wednesday, city and state officials met with select residents who have expressed interest in the pathway. \NDOT's decision has also angered some residents who argue it should be built, especially in light of the residents paying a nickel-a-gallon gas tax to go toward the freeway cost. \Others argue the pathway should not hold up the freeway that is expected to help drainage, business and traffic congestion. \Local cyclists and landscaping groups are planning a letter writing campaign asking the governor and various state transportation officials to direct NDOT to build the pathway as part of the project. Petitions can be found in Carson City bike and sports shops. \Supervisor Jon Plank will introduce a resolution during Thursday's board meeting calling for support of the pathway. \WHAT'S NEXT \For more information about the petitions and letter-writing campaign contract Muscle Powered President Anne Macquarie at (775) 882-4849 or musclepow@aol.com \Lisa J.

63,"Pretty soon credit card numbers won't be the only digits Nevada drivers will have to hand over to the Department of Motor Vehicles.\Beginning in October, the state will collect odometer readings from the vast majority of vehicles.\It's part of a plan gather data on how many miles Nevadans drive and could help lawmakers make future infrastructure decisions.\It's also, according to some, unnecessary and an infringement on driving freedom in a state with an abundance of wide-open, road-trip-friendly, desert highways.\""It is important to the future of how we fund the roads in this state,"" said Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno, D-Las Vegas. ""We cannot get to that without this Legislation.""\Monroe-Moreno, chair of the Assembly Committee on Growth and Infrastructure, made her remarks in March during a hearing on Assembly Bill 483, which called for the data collection effort. She and bill sponsor Assemblyman Howard Watts, D-Las Vegas, both said knowing how many miles people drive on Nevada roads would be useful for rethinking infrastructure funding which is currently heavily dependent on fuel taxes.\""This is the start of the process, not the end,"" Watts said in March.\In 2018, Nevada collected $1.2 billion in highway fund revenue with $210.6 million from state gas tax and $95.2 million from special fuel tax, which includes diesel fuel.\Another major component in the revenue fund was more than $230 million in funds derived from federal fuel taxes.\The fuel tax model is seen as increasingly dated as vehicles become more efficient or transition to electric power. That's because while those changes result in lower taxes, they don't necessarily reduce wear-and-tear on existing roads or demand for new roads.\The federal fuel tax rate has been stagnant since 1993 and state and federal fuel taxes as a percentage of GDP are falling. With electric car sales expected to surpass internal combustion engine vehicles in coming decades, infrastructure funding discrepancies could increase further.\Assembly Bill 483 backers say future lawmakers might want to update the state's infrastructure funding model with a vehicle-miles-driven tax and need information about how much people drive to make smart choices.\""We believe this legislation is a key first step to solving Nevada's long-term infrastructure funding needs,"" Alysia Peters, a lobbyist for electric car maker Tesla, told the Legislature.\The bill passed the Assembly 33-8 and the Senate 17-4 despite opposition arguments that the data collection plan was unnecessary and an infringement on people's freedom to drive.\""I don't think the government should know how many miles you drive in a year,"" said Senate Minority Leader James Settelmeyer, R-Minden. ""That is your own personal business.""\Settelmeyer, who said he owns an all-electric Fiat 500E, said there are ways to update the road revenue model without collecting miles traveled data.\He suggested adding a 10 percent tax to electric car charging station costs or DMV fees on electric cars to ensure electric car drivers pay their fair share of taxes without collecting odometer data.\Settelmeyer said government questions about mileage traveled runs counter to the freedom a personal vehicle represents.\""There are other ways to do this rather than asking people how many miles they drive,"" he said. ""A vehicle is freedom.""\Although the new rules call for drivers to provide additional information, most drivers should be able to do so with little to no effort.\In Clark and Washoe counties, the odometer information will be automatically added to smog check data the DMV already collects during the registration process.\In the remaining places, which cover the vast majority of territory in the state but just 18 percent of vehicle registrations, drivers can enter the information when they register online or in person.\Motorcycle and scooter owners won't be asked for mileage information.\Information from commercial vehicles such as semi-trucks is already compiled through other means, officials said.\There is no penalty for incorrect information and the data won't be linked to individual drivers, DMV spokesman Kevin Malone said.\""It is only going to be used to compile reports for the Legislature,"" Malone said.

64," The presidential nominating races have settled into a classic confrontation between the resistible force and the movable object. It's a lot like watching a street brawl between two gangs of Quakers. The nearly-important South Dakota primary this week offered a perfect illustration:\ You know you're in deep doo-doo when your opponent gets 31 percent of the vote, and you're running unopposed. This is what happened to President Bush, the equivalent of being in the hospital and getting a card from your co-workers wishing you a speedy recovery, by a 5-4 vote. The people who keep saying that you can't beat somebody with nobody have never met a somebody like George Bush.\ He has run the early part of this race as though he's been taking charisma lessons from Mike Dukakis. He was reduced last week to fighting off reports that his mentor Ronald Reagan had soured on him.\ A Washington Post reporter close to the Reagan camp reported that Dutch had been heard saying of Bush: ""He doesn't seem to stand for anything.""\ Asked about it, Mr. Bush snapped back: ""I don't believe that.""\ Message: ""I'm scared.""\ Later, during a trip to California, President Bush invited himself over to the Reagan house for a little boost but the Gipper refused to be seen in public with him. At Reagan's insistence, the meeting was held behind locked gates wrapped in plain brown paper, like a pornographic movie set. Later, a White House photo of the historic meeting between the two men and their wives was leaked to the press. The best you could say for it was that Reagan was not wearing a bag on his head.\ It was to political endorsements what a cold shower is to sex.\ A statement of support for President Bush was later issued in Mr. Reagan's name, but only the Tinker Bell fan club believed it.\ Things are getting so bad, rumor has it, that the White House is considering a political ad that features a clip of the President throwing up on the Prime Minister of Japan. They figure it's the most popular thing he's done in six months.\ Meanwhile, Republican strongman Pat Buchanan has a new campaign slogan: ""Today New Hampshire! Tomorrow, the world!"" It's playing well in Georgia.\ The Democrats, with their characteristic instinct for partisan advantage, are milling around, sticking thumbs in each other's eyes. First, Tom Harkin became the front-runner by winning the Iowa caucuses, but with the lowest turnout since that time they had to kill the sled dogs to keep warm. Then Paul Tsongas proved that as New Hampshire goes, so goes Maine, by winning in both those states and becoming the front-runner. But Bill Clinton also did well in New Hampshire, proving that he too is a front-runner. And Jerry Brown did surprisingly well in Maine, proving that as Maine goes, so goes Mars.\ Cut to South Dakota, where Bob Kerrey resuscitated a flagging campaign and became the front-runner with a solid win, despite the disadvantage of being known there. Everyone else ran third.\ At this point, Tsongas is the badly wounded front-runner, Bill Clinton is the front-runner who never wins, Kerrey is the front-runner without a hope, Harkin is the front-runner without a prayer and Jerry Brown is the dark horse. Now it's on to Maryland, Georgia and points west. It's not a political campaign, it's roller derby with speeches.\ Speaking of which, the rhetoric thus far has been a mixture of bilge, balderdash and outright hokum. Even Tsongas, the only one of the group to so much as genuflect toward reality, has been less than forthcoming about what sacrifices in particular he will ask of the American people.\ The candidates have promised to rebuild our bridges and roads without raising the gas tax, give us national health insurance without charging us for it, cut the military budget without cutting jobs, reduce taxes without increasing the budget deficit, put up trade barriers without hurting our export markets, save the environment without slowing industrial development and restore people to high-paying jobs without damaging our international competitiveness.\ And it's only February. By spring they'll be promising us an America that makes the Big Rock Candy Mountain look like a Third World slum.\ Isn't democracy wonderful?\Donald Kaul is a syndicated columnist writing from Washington, D.C."
65,"When Gov. Jim Gibbons delivered a less-than-detailed State of the State address last Monday, I wanted to ask him personally about some of his key policy ideas.\Changing education with ""one, bold stroke"" is something I would love to support. And, from the sound of it, empowering teachers, principals and parents appears wonderful.\But Gibbons decided not to speak to any Southern Nevada press until four days later. He said he came to the Review-Journal's editorial board on Friday to further vet those ideas. ""That's why we're here,"" he said toward the end of the 45-minute session when a question arose about reporters having a lack of access to him.\Review-Journal political reporter Molly Ball wrote Saturday about some of Gibbons' statements regarding transportation, education, employee benefit reform and environmental policy.\But what became readily apparent to me, as I watched Gibbons elaborate about his ideas, is that he should stay in hiding. From education to the environment and transportation, Gibbons appears to be offering new ideas merely for the sake of having something new.\His ""bold leadership"" on a projected $3.8 billion transportation project shortfall went something like this: ""We put together, are putting together, a commission, a group of people, that are going to look at ideas on funding,"" Gibbons said. ""The one mandatory thing I told them is that I will not accept a gas tax increase. So, I want them to come up with some creative ideas.""\Surely the blue-ribbon panel that spent last year examining the issue looked at some creative ways to fund the problem, didn't it?\A panel can't do anything other than recommend solutions. And because Gibbons won't go for the gasoline tax increase, he's summarily rejecting the work done to help set the stage for legislative action on the issue.\Gibbons wants a new study, which presumably will take weeks, if not months. The Legislature will undoubtedly proceed even as this new commission is formed and schedules meetings.\Gibbons doesn't like any of the blue ribbon panel's suggestions because they require raising taxes and fees, and he made a campaign promise to oppose any tax or fee increases.\What if the Legislature approves those?\""If they can pass it and can pass my veto, they can pass it,"" he said. Pass your veto?\""Override my veto,"" he clarified.\The more insidious parallel track Gibbons is trying to establish is his $60 million empowerment ""pilot"" for schools, even as he earmarks a lower percentage of state funds for education.\Asked to elaborate on the plan, Gibbons told the editorial board: ""I wish you had been able to sit through much of what we talked about empowerment over the last few years,"" he said, glancing at a one-page summary Subbotin handed him.\Years?\Empowerment is just a way to screw Democrats out of a proven educational tool used by two-thirds of states: all-day kindergarten for all 5-year-olds.\""I'm hoping what we do is get a parallel track of these pilot programs going and be able to assess which one delivers a better product at the end of the day,"" he said. ""Isn't that fair?""\How will he pick his 100 schools to compare with the 100 Nevada schools already taking part in all-day kindergarten?\""You don't want to just choose a single criteria, you don't want to just go in and take poor schools. You want to take wealthy schools, poor schools, rural settings, urban settings.""\But all-day kindergarten is authorized only for at-risk schools.\""I didn't choose the at-risk schools. That was something done by the Legislature,"" he said. ""If they want to change this year and take some of the all-day kindergarten and put it into non at-risk schools, that's the Legislature's choice.""\Gibbons also struggled mightily to remember the answers he gave the editorial board before the election about his desire to reform state employee retirement benefits from a defined-benefit system to a defined-contribution plan.\He wants a ""pay as you go, self-funded trust system"" to replace retirement health care subsidies, but he wasn't too clear about how it would work.\""If you initially self-fund a trust, or, you don't fund it, it becomes self-funded. In other words, it pays its own obligations once it gets established and its investments pay as you go,"" he said.\Asked whether it was fundamentally fair for taxpayers to pay the health care expenses of retired public employees, given concerns about the viability of Medicare and Social Security, Gibbons didn't understand the question.\""I suggest if you are envious of working for the state, that you quit this job and come to work for the state,"" Gibbons answered.\In this administration?

We now know how they were able to get involved in the marijuana business in the first place [""Drafting pot distribution,"" News, July 13]. It reminds me of the story of Robin Hood. We have King John - the liquor distributors - and the Sheriff of Nottingham - their lobbyist - trying to get their sixpence by being the sole distributor of marijuana. Luckily King Richard - Governor Sandoval - stepped in and tried to right the wrong.\When it came to Friar Tuck's beermaking, the craft brewers - the distributors - again used the Sheriff of Nottingham's lobbying efforts to try to control and squeeze more money out. Luckily, through exposure and public comment, Robin Hood - the RGJ and the public - got the anti-business laws reduced.\Lest we forget, be vigilant as King John and the sheriff will be back next legislative session.\Greg French,\Reno\Is RTC really earning its gas tax funding?\The letter ""Gas is expensive in Washoe County because taxes fix roads"" [July 16] doesn't tell the whole story about our high gas prices. Gasoline taxes in Washoe County are: federal 18.4 cents, state 18.455 cents, Washoe County 10.96 cents and the RTC 32.89 cents, or 80.7 cents per gallon. Portions of federal, state and county taxes are designated for road maintenance, while the RTC tax - by statute - is to be used for road construction and improvements.\Yes, the same voters who approved the questionable county sales tax increase last November approved the RTC tax, indexed to inflation, in 2008.\The question should be: Is the RTC tax justified and being put to the best use? Whenever I see a county agency with a budget expenditure of $240 million (FY2017), I can't help but think of waste and possible misuse. I would challenge the RGJ to do an in-depth investigation into the use of our RTC tax dollars.\Michael Mayland, Sparks\Plan would slaughter symbol of Nevada\Remember those state quarters that were issued about a decade ago?

67," Don't believe it\ To the editor:\ In response to Robert W. Poole's June 25 Focus cover essay on the Strip monorail:\ Mr. Poole states, ""Who would stand to lose if they (critics) are right? Not the taxpayers of Clark County."" Don't you believe that for one minute. You know what will happen if and when this project tanks. Backers (casinos, contractors, politicians) will scream that this deserves taxpayer financial support because it is a community project. Who would believe that Las Vegas, the Paris-Athens-Rome of the American West, would abandon such a vital cog in our transportation network? How could we stand for such a black mark on our sterling record?\ The power structure would turn on heat like you've never seen. County commissioners would be pressured to ""throw in a few dollars"" in return for an equity stake in the monorail or for valueless subordinated bonds. In time, we might even consider a further gasoline tax increase to keep the monorail afloat. After all, tourists pay 20 percent of the gas tax anyway.\ Mr. Poole feels the private sector will pay 100 percent of the cost. Wait until the bonds come to market and see what the interest rate will be on this much-maligned junk bond issue. No, this isn't a win-win proposition. If the casinos are so hot for this unborn white elephant, let them raise their own funds to finance the project and forget about public financing.\ T.J. SHIVELY\ Las Vegas\ Extreme selfishness\ To the editor:\ As a responsible parent who wants to give her children the best possible odds for good health, I have had my children receive the required vaccines. Parents like Diane Perry (""Some parents take stand against vaccinations for kids,"" June 22) infuriate me. The main reason her son may escape the horrible illnesses that vaccinations prevent is that most other children have received them, and the illnesses have become less common.\ Does she think most parents relish having their children poked and risking complications from shots? We do it because we live in a society full of children who, like those in her son's public school, come into contact with each other every day - and we must protect them all.\ Some children cannot receive the protective vaccines due to a compromised immune system. By not vaccinating her healthy child, Ms. Perry is risking not only her child's health, but other children's health as well. That is an act of extreme selfishness.\ CARON PARRISH\ Henderson\ Not the dregs\ To the editor:\ In response to the June 21 column by Thomas Sowell about teachers:\ I always find it interesting when writers use statistics to support their particular point of view. Mr. Sowell reports that teachers are often ""at or near the bottom among people in a wide range of fields"" in testing and academic standing. The immediate response by many would be to assume teachers are not very intelligent. But let's look at typical college graduates and compare them to the general population in the United States.\ According to numbers provided by the U.S. Department of Education for 1998, approximately 18 percent of people between the ages of 25 to 59 - which would include most teachers - have a bachelor's degree. At the same time 45 percent of all teachers have a master's degree, while in the general public slightly less than 6 percent hold a master's degree. So compared to the general public, it would seem that teachers are among the ""better educated."" So if teachers are the ""dregs of our colleges,"" as Mr. Sowell suggests, what does that make the majority of our population who have not attended or finished college? I was in the top 10 percent of my college graduating class. Could I still be a qualified to teach or would only the top 5 percent satisfy Mr. Sowell and the Review-Journal?\ I will be the first to admit that teacher training can be made better and it does have its problems. Yet intelligence alone is not the answer. I think the general public would like to know that before entering the classroom teachers have had some training in child development and ways of presenting materials - just as I would like for my physician to have gone through an internship before he was certified to practice medicine. While ""jumping through hoops"" does not necessarily make a good teacher, all of us who have attended college can rank among our worst teachers some of those professors with their doctorates who did not have to jump through those same hoops.\ As pointed out, some teachers (both certified and uncertified) are attracted to private schools and their lower pay. Why would a teacher prefer this situation? Many reasons can be given, but one major reason is they do not have to deal with discipline problems like those in the public schools. In a private school it is much easier to remove a disruptive student; in a public school it is almost impossible. So you put up with lower pay, but enjoy a better work environment.\ Public education does have it problems, but to solve these problems we need to work together with mutual respect for each other. Calling teachers the ""dregs of our colleges"" only serves to alienate a group that not only needs to recognize the problems, but must also be a part of the solution.\ CARL A. JARVINEN\ Henderson\ Lost and found\ To the editor:\ Over the past two decades, as a segment of my job as an engineering manager for various defense spacecraft systems, I have interfaced with various personnel in Albuquerque. Among those were the Air Force Weapons Lab (at Kirtland Air Force Base), Sandra Corp., and the Los Alamos Scientific Lab (called Los Alamos National Lab now).\ I noticed in Sunday's Review-Journal that there were two floppy disks discovered missing. They were probably the old 5 inch disks which held, at most, 1.2MB and which require an obsolete disk handler with which few computers are equipped. In my many visits to Los Alamos, I never noticed what must be a very large classified area, the Lost and Found Department.\ By the way, anyone can get on the Los Alamos facility by telling the guards at the gate that you want to visit the Atomic Museum (which is worth the visit).\ LOU GARNER\ Las Vegas"
68,"Clark County School District officials have a list of $3.5 billion in building and repair projects they say are needed to reduce crowding and fix older schools. However, because of tight budgets, they'll be able to afford less than a tenth of the work over the next few years, and that won't help student achievement.\Money from a school construction bond is running out, and voters have shown no appetite to extend it. In the meantime, school enrollment continues to grow. Last fall, the district set a record with more than 313,000 students, and elementary schools were 14 percent over capacity.\As the school year starts this month, officials are trying to make do with what they have, and the school board recently approved a capital budget that covers just a fraction of what's needed. ...\The district will try to relieve crowding with portable classrooms, but they are not a good option, much less a panacea. ...\Pushing off building programs is pushing our children and our future in the wrong direction. Elected officials and voters should make this an issue this election. If Nevada is to move forward, it needs an educated population. But that won't happen in substandard schools.\It's beyond time to fund schools. It's not just the moral, decent thing to do, it is absolutely essential for Nevada's future.\-- Las Vegas Sun, Aug. 10\State must do more to attract good teachers\The Clark County School District's growing enrollment and pursuit of smaller class sizes has led to a familiar problem -- a shortage of licensed educators.\When the new school year starts in two weeks, the district expects to fill about 400 teacher vacancies with substitutes. As reported by the Review-Journal's Trevon Milliard, the number would be slightly worse than last year, when classes started with 350 long-term substitutes on the job, but better than each of the previous five years, which began with between 406 and 692 vacancies. And hiring was an annual crisis for the country's fifth-largest school system before the onset of the Great Recession.\The district's hiring challenges aren't as bad as they could be because the system has taken many steps over the past few years to minimize vacancies and put well-qualified teachers in every classroom. But the system and the state must do more to attract more teaching applicants, because Clark County's instructional needs will grow even faster in years ahead. ...\Teachers must have a minimum level of training and education (not to mention a background free of criminal behavior). But education colleges and protectionist credentials have never been the answer to teacher shortages. Schools should want instructors from a variety of educational and professional backgrounds. That's especially important in low-income schools, which often have the hardest time filling vacancies.\Incentives will certainly help. That's why the 2015 Legislature should consider restoring an expired policy that helped alleviate previous teacher shortages: a $2,000 hiring bonus for all new educators.\-- Las Vegas Review-Journal, Aug. 10\Tax will hit our region harder than others\Perhaps if you're just driving your Prius over to the mall for a new sweater, or popping into the bakery for a fresh croissant, you won't notice the increase in the gas tax that's coming our way.\But if your job's in the Bay Area, or you have to visit far-flung customers once a week, or you're hauling tomatoes from fields to processing plants, that increase is going to hurt.\That's why we believe Assemblyman Henry Perea of Fresno is justified in asking for a three-year delay on the cap-and-trade rule that would require energy companies to purchase greenhouse-gas emission credits for transportation fuels beginning Jan. 1. The costs of those credits will likely cause the price of gasoline and diesel to go up 12 to 17 cents a gallon -- and potentially more, depending on demand for credits in state auctions.\Perea says he's trying to protect the parts of California struggling with double-digit unemployment, low wages and limited public transportation options. That's us. ...\In early July, 16 Democrats sent a letter urging the Air Resources Board to delay the credit requirements.\That was countered by 32 Democrats asking Gov. Jerry Brown to make certain the deadline stays put. Maybe there's room for compromise.\The governor could send part of that money back to low-income drivers in gas rebates. Or maybe the state can buy us all Priuses.\-- Merced (Calif.) Sun-Star, Aug. 10\Party fizzles at Chico State -- and that's welcome news\There are occasions when losing is better than winning, and that upside-down concept is evident with the recent announcement of the top party school in the nation. It wasn't Chico State University.\The reason to celebrate the omission may puzzle some in our area, but readers with history here know why. It's taken a lot of work to erase that image.\Back in the 1980s, Chico was listed by Playboy magazine as the top party school in the nation.\That ranking was unfortunate because it brought all kinds of notoriety to Chico.\Many of us held our breath as we checked Princeton Review's rankings last week, but it was good to see Syracuse University in New York at the top. We wish Syracuse the best, because we have some sense of what's ahead.\It wasn't long after Chico State's name appeared on the party schools list that bad things started happening here. It may only be coincidence, but we think not. It started small and ramped up. ...\That reputation had such a damaging effect in other local arenas that it was surprising. Business and city leaders did their best to counter it, pointing out the town's strengths and accomplishments. The university also had to work extra hard to convince parents that Chico State provided a safe environment for their children.\Little by little, Chico's rowdy reputation has dissipated, but it's taken an extraordinary community and university effort to make that happen.\We have a pretty good idea what Syracuse and any other university on that list faces.\Some of us still hear about that old image of Chico and are grateful it's dying.\We wonder if those who flippantly place rankings on communities know the damage they cause.\-- Chico (Calif.)

Boone Pickens, for example, suggested tax credits for renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, would cost taxpayers $15 billion, but he called that insignificant compared with the $700 billion that the nation spends on imported oil every year.\""I'm opposed to one thing, foreign oil,"" Pickens said.\Government financial assistance is also necessary to help jump start the renewable energy industry, other participants said.\Dan Reicher, director for climate change and energy initiatives at Google.org, told the gathering that renewable energy options will remain ""boutique"" industries unless their costs are cut to make them competitive with coal and other widely used power sources.\""There's a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy,"" Reicher said after announcing a new plan for Google to invest more than $10 million to develop ""enhanced geothermal systems"" technology to generate energy from rocks deep below the earth's surface.\""These are all high capital costs projects,"" Reicher said.\Another area government can help is by funding research, Steven Chu, director of California's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said later in the day.\As examples, he said, government research funds could help reduce the cost of photovoltaic cells and help create synthetic yeast to make diesel and jet fuel replacements from biomass. \General Electric chief executive Jeff Immelt said in a video that the government and the business community need to move forward with renewable energy projects.\""The technology exists, the time is now,"" he said. ""We need a call to action - not a call to go to another conference.""\Pickens said he was calling for bipartisan support for energy policies and urged Republican presidential candidate John McCain and Democratic candidate Barack Obama to take action in the first 100 days of their administration when observers say a newly elected president typically gets the broadest support from Congress.\At the end of the conference, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg criticized the presidential candidates for not having a real debate about energy.\""They're treating us to a political silly season,"" Bloomberg said, not mentioning either candidate by name but citing ideas such as tapping the nation's strategic oil reserve or giving Americans a gas tax holiday.\""The best that can be said about these ideas is that they're pandering,"" Bloomberg said. ""Far worse, they're distractions from the deadly serious business of creating a new national energy policy.""\Pickens agrees that the lack of a new national energy policy is a problem. In fact, he compared the country to a boater approaching Niagara Falls without a motor or an oar.\""We are getting very close to a disaster,"" he said. \As proof, he noted that the country has gone from importing 24 percent of the oil it consumes in 1970 to 70 percent today, Pickens said.\""There is no question we have a (national) security problem importing 70 percent of our oil,"" Pickens said.\Pickens, who has invested billions in natural gas companies and a project to develop wind farms and transmission lines capable of supplying 20 percent of the nation's energy needs, called for tapping the strong wind resources found between Texas and Canada and the solar power concentrated in the desert Southwest.\As a bridge from oil dependence to clean energy sources, the oilman suggested the nation's trucking industry switch from diesel and gasoline, which are refined from oil, to less costly compressed natural gas, which he said is abundant domestically.\Trucking companies could replace conventional engines with motors that burn natural gas as they replace their fleets every 30 months.\That would reduce our oil import bill by $250 billion yearly within five years, Pickens said.\Jim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute attending the conference, said it would take a long time for the country to build up the number of natural gas refueling stations to make natural gas-powered truck fleets practical. Owen, however, said his group supports calls for tax credits ""to jump start"" the renewable energy industry.\Reid unsuccessfully tried to win Senate approval of renewable credits eight times, but Owen said he hears that congressional Democrats hope to win passage for green power credits when Congress returns after Labor Day.\The Senate leader said it will take 20 years for the country to increase oil production enough to add ""a drop in the global barrel.""\Michael Yackira, CEO of Sierra Pacific Resources, outlined several of his company's renewable energy projects but said little about controversial plans to build a $5 billion coal-fired power plant in Ely. Burning coal emits large quantities of carbon dioxide that scientists say leads to global warming.\Owen said the electric power industry believes that energy conservation and renewable energy must be coupled with coal-fired, nuclear and natural gas powered plants in order to satisfy an expected 30 percent increase in power demand nationally by 2030.\Edward Mazria, a founder of Architecture 2030 which promotes energy conservation for buildings to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power production, took a different perspective.\The supply-side solution, he said, is ""no more coal. It's a simple as that. It's the silver bullet."" \The crowd applauded.\Other participants at the conference discussed what they are doing to conserve energy and resources and how it is impacting their businesses and states.\Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, for instance, said that the Arizona Department of Correction is preparing prison inmates for jobs by training them to install solar panels and then using them to install the panels in prisons.\In the afternoon session, the governors of Utah and Colorado explained converting to more efficient energy use in state buildings and vehicle fleets.\""We must move this whole debate from the abstract to the concrete,"" Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said in his keynote address.\Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter said his state's ""new energy economy,"" with the help of tax credits, has created thousands of new jobs in the wind turbine business.\Colorado has also put in place a state climate action plan.\""In this country we have to stop debating the fact of climate change and start debating the rate of climate change,"" Ritter said.\Jon Wellinghoff, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Nevada's first public utilities consumer advocate, stressed the importance of a ""backbone system grid"" for renewable energy to tap vast amounts of power from wind energy in the Rocky Mountain states.\Wilderness advocates from Nevada who attended the summit said they want to work closely with energy companies to ensure that development of renewable energy sources doesn't harm wildlife, cultural sites and habitat vital to threatened and endangered species.\""America and Nevada have a unique opportunity to develop our renewable energy industry and associated transmission lines in a way that is smart from the start,"" said John Tull of the Nevada Wilderness Project.\Contact reporter John G.

70,"Trust us To the editor:\ Cher Lowe, in a June 30 letter to the Review-Journal, asks: ""If this project were as safe as the experts say, why then is this waste not being stored in the states that have produced it, and how many of these experts are willing to live in Las Vegas once the repository is finished and the waste begins flooding our state?""\ The waste that would fill a potential repository at Yucca Mountain is now stored in the states that produced it. It is safe there for the near future, in pools of water or in dry storage casks. However, for permanent disposal, keeping the waste in many locations above ground is less safe than placing it in a single deep geologic repository.\ Thick and durable rock formations can isolate the waste from the environment. They can do so without the need for the kind of controls that no human government can provide over thousands of years. Such controls would be required for any above-ground storage system for spent fuel.\ The current best estimates of the performance of such a repository suggest it will not require the sacrifice of our children and grandchildren, as Ms. Lowe implies. If the repository program cannot demonstrate its safety by compliance with very strict regulations, it cannot get a license to even build a repository. And DOE must get a further license to begin receiving waste, and to close a repository.\ That probably means more permanent jobs than Ms. Lowe thinks over the 100 years or so before the repository will close. Not all will be at the site. In Las Vegas there are likely to be many technical jobs for a long time.\ I'm not ""selling"" Yucca Mountain as either positively safe, or the answer to Nevada's problems. I would urge Ms. Lowe to verify claims on both sides of this issue, as not all the ""used car salesmen"" are clearly on one side. The problem of nuclear waste must be solved. But it won't be solved by painting the issues in the pure black and white most politicians rely on.\ As the DOE scientist directing the assessment of the performance of the Yucca Mountain site, I am confident that if the site is truly unsafe, it will not be licensed. I have no intention of letting any evidence be hidden. And even if I did, there are just too many people looking over our shoulders for any credible evidence to be swept under the rug. Nor do I plan on moving away from Las Vegas if the repository is built.\ I certainly encourage Ms. Lowe to come visit our information office, and tour Yucca Mountain at our next public open house. I will gladly show her why I and many other scientists think Yucca Mountain is not a lemon and why we aren't worried about this waste ""flooding our state."" JEREMY M. BOAK Las Vegas\Bryan's vote To the editor:\ My response to the June 27 Review-Journal editorial, ""Building Mount Taxmore,"": Could it be Sen. Richard Bryan is looking ahead to election '94, and thus his ""no"" vote (bailout) for President Clinton's deficit reduction package? At least our other senator sought to support our president in trying to get this horrendous deficit down. In short, I think we need to do our part and support Mr. Clinton when he is doing the right thing. RUTH MARQUEZ Las Vegas\The merry-go-round To the editor:\ I see the Public Service Commission has granted Nevada Power the largest increase in history. Many people throughout the United States are in an uproar over the proposal to increase the federal gas tax by 4 1/2 cents a gallon. That is only $1 or $2 per month and the whole country is complaining, even the Review-Journal.\ How can the Public Service Commission say the rate increase for Nevada Power will be granted? Was there no one to complain, not even the Review-Journal? Don't they use electricity? Electricity is a necessity in this area and no one can turn to a competing company. Every facet of this city _ homes, businesses and casinos _ must use electricity. When interest rates dropped to 2 percent, I had to tighten my belt and do without. When the costs of food or clothing increase, I must also do without.\ Why can't a monopoly like Nevada Power start to economize? I am sure there are many places it can cut back on expenses, like other companies do. I guess now employees can now claim they need an increase in salary so the merry-go-round will continue, up and up and up.\ When can the public be looked after and receive a fair treatment? ALBERT SHAFER Las Vegas\The naked truth To the editor:\ As the 1993 legislative session wrapped up last week, it's good to know that Nevada's lawmakers did not abandon the important issues just so that they could go home and save the taxpayers money. Last week, the Senate Commerce and Labor committee proposed Senate Bill 566, to prohibit topless barbers and hairdressers.\ What a relief. A bright light is finally being directed toward this important product quality issue. Unsuspecting consumers might fall prey to unscrupulous coiffeurs who attempt to pass off a substandard topless haircut as being equal to that of a haircut given by a barber or hairdresser with a shirt on.\ But, has the Legislature gone far enough? What about bottomless cutters, or totally nude barbers and hairdressers? Lawmakers must protect the citizenry from these seamy stylists.\ Maybe the 1995 Legislature will be inspired to outlaw other similar ""problem"" businesses: topless banks, topless cabs, topless supermarkets ... DOUGLAS E. FRENCH Reno\Rein in ATF To the editor:\ I really appreciated the editorial cartoon of the ""Waco Cover-up"" in your June 28 issue. Whatever did happen to Janet Reno's in-depth investigation of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fiasco? There hasn't been a peep from the Justice Department about this.\ It really doesn't matter though, because an investigation by the Justice Department of one of its own bureaus would be like you or I doing our own tax audit. You just know that everything would come up roses. I mean, really, if there were discrepancies would you report them to the IRS?\ I recommend that the Review-Journal do an in-depth study of the ATF to show, its ineptitude, its unprofessionalism and especially its dangerous Gestapo tactics. It would be considered a public service if you did a series on these people, an expose. The information is readily available. I know because I've studied it.\ We should demand that Congress initiate an investigation of its own into the actions taken by the ATF in Waco, Texas. Also, to look into its past record, especially cases that ended in blood-baths or were highly abusive in nature. Believe me there are many of these incidents.\ In my opinion this group should be disbanded, or kept under the scrutiny of a congressional investigative committee. The ATF's unprofessional bully-boy tactics extend back into the past, to the time of alcohol prohibition. But at least then, its attacks focused primarily on the criminal element. Not so today; today it focuses mainly on ordinary citizens who have fallen into its trap of confusing regulations and misleading information provided by the ATF itself, to cause the citizen to become a ""paperwork"" criminal.\ This is not Nazi Germany. Or is it? I strongly suggest that you (the people) contact your congressmen and demand an investigation, because these people are totally out of control, and right now they answer to no one. ISAAC PIAR North Las Vegas\Nice effort To the editor:\ If the media would have spent half the time bashing Ronald Reagan and George Bush as they do Bill Clinton, perhaps he wouldn't have inherited this incredible mess we are facing.\ Although it may not be the popular thing to do, we finally have a president who is willing to make some long overdue changes, and to get Americans thinking again about their future.\ Change is never easy, and mistakes are made along the way _ but so are improvements. I commend President Clinton for his efforts. JOHN BECCIA Las Vegas\In the mattress? To the editor:\ In an interview aired June 25 on a local radio station, Sen. Harry Reid stated that those affected by the proposed increase from 50 to 80 percent in the taxable portion of Social Security under the current ""deficit reduction"" bill should not complain, since to be so affected would indicate a net worth of a million dollars. This comment is basically incorrect and misleading.\ The current ""strike point"" for taxation of 50 percent of Social Security income is $32,000 (joint return) or $25,000 (single or head of household). These figures are gross income from all sources, including Social Security, prior to any deductions. Net worth does not enter into the calculation, and has no bearing on it.\ One cannot help but wonder what triggered such an egregious statement. This does not sound like the same Harry Reid who has led the campaign against source taxation.\ I hesitate to try and inject an element of humor into a subject as serious as this, but if the senator is correct, nearly all of my net worth is hidden somewhere, and I can't find it!

71,"shuster warner reid bryan gasoline tax localized highlights tom stephens\By David Hess\Knight Ridder Newspapers\WASHINGTON - Spreading money throughout America, the Senate approved a $214 billion transportation bill Thursday that will finance everything from subways and superhighways to ferry boats and covered bridges.\The bill, which passed 96-4, now goes to the House. Highway proponents and balanced-budget hawks remain deadlocked there over a proposal by Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., to spend even more than the Senate for transportation projects.\""This is the most significant piece of legislation we will pass this year,"" crowed Sen. John Warner, R-Va. Warner said the Senate achieved equity in revising the way that money is apportioned among the states for highways.\Warner helped forge a compromise that broke a filibuster over the bill and assured that every state will receive more money for road construction over the next six years than in the existing law.\Sens. Harry Reid and Richard Bryan, both D-Nev., voted with the majority in approving the bill.\Still unresolved in both houses of Congress is how to pay for the extra spending that is authorized in the two versions of the legislation. Because of spending caps imposed on all domestic spending by the 1997 budget deal between President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress, higher spending for one program must be offset by cuts in other programs.\Transportation projects are paid out of the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by an 18.3-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax. But the trust fund is considered part of the federal budget, and any excess revenue is used to reduce the deficit. Thus, the more money spent on transportation, the more the budget falls out of balance.\Shuster wants to separate the highway trust fund from the federal budget so future spending for road-building does not have to be made up elsewhere. But House and Senate budget writers oppose that for fear that highway spending will spiral out of control.\""The success we celebrate today is the first real bipartisan victory of this Senate,"" said a beaming Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ""This bill guarantees that the gasoline tax is spent for the purpose of building roads. It also guarantees that no state will get less than 91 cents for every $1 its citizens contribute to the Highway Trust Fund.""\In fact, it was the 91-cent solution that paved the way for final passage of the Senate's bill. Nearly 30 states over the years have donated more money to the trust fund than they have gotten back in the form of project money. Some states get back as little as 71 cents a gallon for every $1 paid.\Under a compromise crafted by Gramm and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate simply enlarged the amount of highway money in the bill so every state would be assured of getting more money than it would have under the existing distribution formula.\The Senate bill calls for $173 billion in highway spending and $41 billion for mass transit systems over the next six years. The highway spending alone is almost $26 billion more than what was in the 1997 balanced-budget agreement.\In the House, Shuster and his allies are pushing for a $218 billion bill. Of that sum, $181 billion would be for highways - $8 billion more than the Senate version - and the rest for mass transit.\As the Senate prepared to vote Thursday, Shuster walked across the Capitol to the Senate floor to confer with Warner and other sponsors. He then emerged and proclaimed that the differences between the House and Senate versions were so small that Congress was virtually certain to enact a finished package in time for states to start awarding contracts for the spring building season.\At the same time, he acknowledged there would be ""a bloody fight"" in a House-Senate conference committee over the state-by-state formula for distributing the money from the highway trust fund. ""The House is population-driven, so the biggest states (by population) always have gotten more money (than sparsely populated ones),"" he said.\""Senators are more concerned about getting as much as they can for their states. But we've always worked this out, and we'll do it again.""\The Senate also served notice that it might look doubtfully at some $9 billion worth of demonstration projects that Shuster has earmarked in the House bill for particular states. Critics long have regarded such projects as pork-barrel politics that fail to meet strict tests of need.\Senators adopted, 78-22, an amendment by Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., that would require the value of any demonstration project to count against a state's funding allocation from the trust fund distributions.\Until now, the projects have been awarded on top of the allocations, skewing the amount of federal aid to the states and favoring those states whose senators or representatives have the most influence on the transportation committees.\But Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said the House's inclination for the additional spending could spoil the Senate's hopes. The new distribution formula, he said, ""may obviate the need for (demonstration projects) but it won't obviate the lust for them.""\In addition to providing for money for highways and mass transit, the bill:\-Requires states to adopt tougher new drunk-driving laws or risk losing part of their trust fund allotments.\-Reaffirms the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to set tougher, new clean-air standards for emissions of ozone and microscopic smoke particles.\-Sets aside $50 million over five years to protect and restore some 800 historic bridges, many of them wooden covered spans, throughout the country.\Transportation bill highlights\Associated Press\Major elements in the highway and mass transit spending bill passed by the Senate Thursday:\-It provides $171 billion for surface transportation, $1.8 billion for transportation safety programs and $41.3 billion for mass transport programs over a six-year period, a 38 percent increase over the 1991-97 plan.\-It authorizes $1.3 billion a year for an environmental program known as the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program, up $370 million.\-It provides an average of $632 million a year for transportation enhancement activities such as bicycle paths and historic preservation.\-It guarantees that states will get back at least 91 cents for every dollar they pay in gas taxes into the federal Highway Trust Fund.\Other elements in the bill:\-4.3 cents of the federal gas tax that had been set aside for reducing the budget deficit would go exclusively to transportation programs in the future.\-States that do not enact 0.08 percent blood-alcohol-content levels for drunken driving could lose 5 percent of their highway money in fiscal 2002, and 10 percent after that.\-States that do not ban open alcoholic containers in operating vehicles could lose the same amount of highway money.\-By a 58-37 vote, the Senate decided to preserve a Transportation Department program that tries to direct construction contracts to women- and minority-owned businesses.\-The Senate defeated, 71-26, an attempt to end the ethanol fuel subsidy program, which goes mainly to corn growers and is aimed at producing a cleaner, more efficient fuel.\-Employees could avoid taxes on employer-paid mass transit benefits.\-$50 million would be designated over five years to protect and restore 800 covered bridges.\-$100 million a year would be set aside for a reverse-commuting program to help inner-city people commute to jobs in the suburbs.\-Incentive grants would be provided to states that increase seat belt usage.\Nevada a big winner in highway funding\Donrey Washington Bureau\WASHINGTON - Nevada stands to receive at least $184 million each year in federal highway funds under the transportation bill passed Thursday in the Senate.\A formula negotiated by Senate leaders last week to distribute money from the Highway Trust Fund survived a week of debate and was approved 96-4.\Sens. Harry Reid and Richard Bryan, both D-Nev., voted for the bill.\The legislation ensures that Nevada will receive $1.01 back for every dollar its motorists contribute into the trust fund through their gasoline taxes.\Additionally, it gives Nevada a larger apportionment of the trust fund, 0.73 percent. It had been 0.60 percent.\""So far, so good,"" Nevada transportation director Tom Stephens said after the vote.\""This is a lot better than what we had in the beginning. They kept the $184 million (per year for Nevada) in there as far as I know, and that's a big increase over the average of $128 million that we've had.""\But Stephens noted the House has yet to act on its bill, and it is considerably different in substance, if not the amount. The House bill includes money for specific road projects in various states while the Senate bill does not.\""Those differences are going to have to be resolved in conference (between House and Senate negotiators),"" Stephens said.\The special projects in the House bill have not been disclosed, and Stephens said he does not know if any Nevada highways are included.\""But I think Nevada will fare well in the House bill because of the growth we've had since 1991,"" when the most recent transportation bill was enacted, he said.\""There may be no other bill in Congress which will do more to improve quality of life in Las Vegas than this bill,"" Bryan said. ""Nevada scored big in terms of increased highway and transit dollars.""\""I am happy to report this highway bill will keep Nevada moving well into the next century,"" Reid said."
72,"rhagar@rgj.com\Jobs, jobs, jobs.\It's been all the talk during the first month of the Nevada Legislature, as lawmakers devise plans to make life better for the estimated 180,000 unemployed workers in Nevada.\Democrats, with a majority in both houses, have focused on boosting Nevada's sagging construction-trades industry by funding and fostering public works programs. They see a sense of urgency, since Nevada leads the nation in unemployment -- 14.6 percent.\Some Republicans say that the legislation is moving too fast and that could lead to unintended consequences. That does not sway the Democrats, however, as they continue to press on.\""People in my district want jobs,"" said Assemblyman Tick Segerblom, D-Las Vegas. ""And that is the most frustrating thing about this process. We all talk about all the issues and people just want to work.""\Some in unions are watching closely.\""I have a lot of hope for them,"" said Jessica Crosthwaite, a unemployed flagger and a single mother with two children. ""That's all we have is hope.\""I hope they do get pushed through,"" said Crosthwaite, a member of the Reno-based Laborers' Union Local 169. ""I'm not the only person out there raising kids by themselves and we need work.""\Republicans have different ideas on how to cut into the state's unemployment statistics. State Sen. James Settelmeyer, R-Gardnerville, for example, has proposed that employers should not have to pay the Modified Business Tax for new employees as an incentive to add to payrolls.\Gov. Brian Sandoval is in the game, pleading with federal officials to speed up the mining permitting process, a move that could lead to 1,000 new high-paying jobs for that industry in rural Nevada.\""I think a lot of people in this building (Legislature) see it backwards,"" said Tray Abney of the Reno Sparks Chamber of Commerce. ""They somehow want to improve the public sector in hopes the private sector follows along. That seems exactly backwards.""\Despite a promised veto from Sandoval on some of the job plans, Democrats press on. They say that Nevada's schools, roads and levees are crumbling. Now is the time to repair, refurbish and re-employ.\""I always remind people that this is work that needs to be done,"" said Debbie Smith, D-Sparks, and the chair of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. ""It is not like we are creating work for the fun of it. These are jobs that need to be done because our infrastructure is crumbling. And right now (construction) costs are down about 60 percent from what they were a few years ago, so this is the perfect time for us to rebuild our infrastructure.""\Rebuilding Washoe schools\The key bill for Washoe County could be Smith's Assembly Bill 183, which would reduce the amount of money school districts need to hold in reserve for bonding debt and use it for major renovation projects for schools.\Sandoval is opposed to the idea, since he wants to employ a similar tactic, but use the extra money for school operating expenses. Smith's bill could blow a big hole in Sandoval's budget -- anywhere from $325 million to $425 million, aides said.\If the money is used for school construction projects, it would jump the district's bonding capacity for construction from about $70 million to $135 million, said Mark Stanton, the district's bond program administrator.\That would mean an additional 760 construction jobs and another 200 in related trades based on a federal formula of one worker per $92,000 of project, Stanton said.\If the bill becomes law, it would take at least three months before the first worker is hired, Stanton said.\With the extra bonding capacity, Stanton said the district could employ up to 1,600 workers altogether in construction trades to use the $135 million in bonding capacity.\""It is not all going to be spent in the next six months,"" Stanton said. ""There is design work that has to occur. We see that total amount of money as being a two-to-three year construction program. So it is an ongoing stimulus to the construction industry.""\The board of trustees could consider replacing any of four elementary schools with the extra money, including Sun Valley, Sierra Vista, Robert Mitchell and Greenbrae.\A new elementary school would cost about $26 million and would need workers with a wide array of skill sets.\""A new school would hire virtually every trade,"" Stanton said.\School reconstruction and refurbishing has been ongoing problem for Washoe County. Washoe schools will need about $650 million in upgrades in the next 10 years. More than half of the district's 93 schools are more than 30 years old. And 26 are more than 50 years old.\The money could also be used to employ carpenters, locksmiths and fencing companies with a $16 million security project that would allow teachers to lock classroom doors from the inside, install security fencing and build single-entry points in schools.\It could all be a pipe dream.Sandoval has the veto stamp ready.\Smith said Democrats will continue with their job plan and still have a few job bills to introduce, despite rumblings from the governor's office.\""We have to do our job in the legislative environment,"" Smith said. ""We will send it to him and take it from there. We have the ability to override that (with a two-thirds majority) and we will take that up when it comes.""\Not up to advertising\Another bill, AB 144, or the Nevada Jobs First bill, might not have the impact Democrats advertised, some said.\The bill would require at least 50 percent of workers hired on a state or local public works project to be from Nevada. At least 25 percent of materials must also come from Nevada.\The State of Nevada Public Works Board does not currently keep track of contractor or subcontractor employees driver's license to verify their residence, said Gus Nunez, the public works board manager. He said ""90 to 95 percent"" of subcontractors hired on state public works projects are local subcontractors.\""The local subs that are doing business here locally, predominantly hire folks that live in this area,"" Nunez said. ""That (50 percent threshold for local workers) is probably happening already, but I can't confirm that because we don't keep track of driver's licenses.""\Others see the threshold of at least 50 percent Nevada workers as something positive.\""I have interviewed for school work at two schools and one of them went to a firm in Irving, Calif., that does architecture, mechanical engineering, structural engineering and landscaping design,"" said Pat Pusich, an architect and senior associate at Reno's Tate Snyder Kimsey firm. ""So not one of those jobs ended up going to a Nevadan. I don't want to name names, it's a small town out there. But we lost some master-planning work for a school district in Nevada to a firm out of Virginia.""\If new jobs are created with public works, it would probably have to come from local projects because capital-project funding at the state level is down dramatically.\In the previous biennium, about $900 million was budgeted for state public works projects, Nunez said. That is down to about $250 million for the current biennium and less than $50 million in Sandoval's budget for the upcoming biennium.\One of the major public works projects planned for the next biennium is a $1.2 million renovation for the Nevada Department of Wildlife building on Valley Road in Reno with electrical and fire sprinkler upgrades.\Most of the public works projects for the next two years are deferred maintenance projects and would give work to roofing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning businesses, Nunez said.\It will be difficult to boost the amount of workers on Nevada Department of Transportation projects since NDOT is losing a one-time shot of $201 million in federal stimulus money.\Because NDOT is not funded by the general fund (funding comes for state highway fund, fee and gas tax), it is not facing the same economic crisis of other state agencies. NDOT spent $594 million on road construction projects in 2009 and is expected to spend about $500 million in each year of the upcoming biennium, said NDOT spokesman Scott Magruder.\The high point for NDOT construction came in 2007, when $665 million was spent, according to records.\Biggest jobs bill\Perhaps the biggest jobs bill in the Legislature so far is sponsored by state Senate Majority Leader Steven Horsford, D-North Las Vegas.\Senate Bill 192, or the Nevada Jobs Initiative, would put as many as 4,000 to 5,000 workers back on the job in regional transportation projects in Washoe and Clark counties.\The bill passed the state Senate on Monday with a straight party-line vote of 11 to 10. It helped Horsford keep his promise of passing jobs legislation within the first 30 days of the session.\The bill would give regional transportation commissions in Clark and Washoe new bonding capacity of about $270 million over the next biennium for road improvements. The revenue to support the plan would come from the existing 2-cent portion of the local 4-cent operating property tax rate that was diverted to the general fund in 2009.\Horsford could not say when people would get back to work if the Nevada Jobs Initiative bill is passed.\""I can't answer that, but as soon as possible,"" Horsford said. ""As soon as we can get the bills processed and on the governor's desk and he approves them. Many of them are effective at passage and approval. We are trying to get our economy moving as quickly as possible.""\Horsford's 5,000 new jobs bill also faced stiff opposition from Sandoval because it would take at least $27 million in funding away from the university system, said Dale Erquiaga, Sandoval's deputy chief of staff and senior adviser.\""It is not about the merits of the bill,"" Eriquiaga said. ""But he will watch the bill from that perspective but because it contains that funding mechanism, he (Sandoval) is opposed to it."""

""And TASC is what will halt our march toward California liberalism.""\If the petition is successful -- it first must qualify for the ballot and voters would have to pass it twice -- it would take three years before it takes effect.\Beers argues the spending cap would be immediate if he is elected.\TASC, campaign go hand in hand\Beers, 46, denies his gubernatorial bid was engineered around the campaign for the TASC initiative or that the TASC campaign was engineered to boost his chances in the governor's race.\""I think they both get to the same end point, which is preservation of the things that make Nevada unique and great,"" he said. ""Other than that, this is really just coincidence.""\Beers, an accountant by training and a former small business owner, started his political career in 1998 with a run for state Assembly. He is midway through his freshman term in the state Senate.\His legislative career has established him as among the staunchest anti-tax legislators in the state, even though his opponents criticize his vote for a record spending increase in 2005.\In 2003, he was a key player in a cadre of 15 GOP Assembly members who temporarily blocked the largest tax increase in state history.\Beers' philosophy: Cut government to a fighting weight so it can do its essential roles -- namely education and public safety -- well.\The first place Beers looks to for cuts is the state's Medicaid program, which provides health care for the poor. He would propose shaving Nevada's program down to the bare minimum of coverage required by the federal government.\""We have all these problems with our education system,"" Beers said. ""The answer to poverty is the opportunity to get an education. You can't force it on someone, but that is the answer.""\Enjoys one-on-one\Beers is among the quickest to engage voters in one-on-one debates, whether by e-mail, on the phone or in person.\He lamented his campaign's requirement that he take his cell phone number off his business card and said if he is elected he hopes Nevadans will be able to pick up the phone and call him.\Asked to describe his leadership style, Beers said ""collaborative and creative.""\For example, he said he worked in 2001 with Democratic Assemblyman David Goldwater on a bill to provide teachers with a cost- of-living increase. The bill died, but Beers said his effort resulted in enough pressure that money was found elsewhere to provide a raise.\In his free time, Beers said he likes to play computer games, play guitar, compose and record songs and ""try to get to the gym.""\He's currently reading ""Goldfield: The Last Gold Rush on the Western Frontier"" and his favorite movie is ""The Patriot.""\oooooooooo\Melody Damayo: 'I have politics in my heart,' says candidate\By ANJEANETTE DAMON\adamon@rgj.com\Melody Damayo, a retired porn star who runs an adults-only Web site, insists her run for governor is not a publicity stunt.\But one look at the promotion material for her campaign leaves no mistake that Damayo is a sex star.\""I made the decision to quit that in 2003,"" she said of the adult film industry. ""My last movie was ""Happy Ending"" and I don't receive any more royalties. So me getting into politics is not what everybody thinks -- that it's for publicity.""\The novelty of a porn star running for governor has attracted media interviews from across the globe. Damayo has been featured on ""The Situation with Tucker Carlson"" and was on the front page of the Standard, a Chinese newspaper.\Damayo, whose screen name is Mimi Miyagi, campaigns with the slogan: ""The bare and honest truth.""\Instead of posting the typical grip-and-grin campaign event photographs on her Web site, Damayo's showcases herself in various scantily clad poses.\That doesn't mean, however, that Damayo, a 33-year-old single mother living in Henderson, is without political positions as well.\She supports the Education First Initiative, which was co-authored by an opponent, U.S. Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Reno. She supports legalizing marijuana and dedicating the tax revenue to senior citizen programs. And she would ""lift the puritanical ban"" on taxing brothels, using that revenue to improve education.\'Ambition' drives campaign\So if it isn't for publicity, why is Damayo running for governor?\""I have a lot of ambition. I have politics in my heart and I have a lot of heart,"" she said. ""I'm not the average career politician. I'm the average single mother who cares about people. And I'm extremely patriotic.""\Damayo's family immigrated from the Philippines when she was 6.\She said she started working in the adult film industry because as a college student with no money she was ""sleeping on everyone's couches and taking buses everywhere. I got tired of it.""\She answered a newspaper ad looking for a partially nude model and met the people who got her started in the porn industry.\Since then, Damayo has been an adult magazine publisher, a movie director and continues to run a sex-themed Web site.\""I've basically been the CEO of several successful companies,"" she said. ""I'm familiar with overseeing and maintaining a leadership position.""\Damayo was married and divorced in her early 20s. Now she's searching for someone to be the state's first man. Applications can be submitted on her Web site.\""I have three that are potentials,"" she said. ""I want somebody who is a father figure, who's stable, has a responsible job.""\oooooooo\Jim Gibbons: Education, lower taxes are his priorities\By ANJEANETTE DAMON\adamon@rgj.com\U.S. Rep. Jim Gibbons wants to do two things if he is elected governor: provide Nevada children a ""first class education"" and lower state taxes.\He insists he can do both.\""My vision is to make sure that in order for Nevada to continue to enjoy the successes at our fingertips today we ensure we are giving a first-class education and make sure our economy stays vibrant by keeping our taxes low,"" Gibbons said.\Gibbons, 61, has been the frontrunner in the Republican primary since before he was an official candidate. The latest independent polls show him pulling in at least 50 percent of the vote over his opponents: state Sen. Bob Beers, R-Las Vegas; Lt. Gov. Lorraine Hunt; former porn star Melody Damayo; and Fallon retiree Stanleigh Harold Lusak.\Gibbons has raised substantially more money than his opponents and enjoys the highest name recognition of any candidate in the governor's race thanks to his 10 years running for the U.S. House.\As for improving education, Gibbons wants to implement a merit pay system for teachers who perform well. He would redirect at least three percent of the money currently going to administrative costs back to the classroom.\And he would increase education funding by directing more funds from federal land sales in the state to school coffers -- something that would require a change in federal law.\Gibbons says the state is operating in a ""for-profit mode"" because of the budget surpluses generated over the last three years.\But he isn't showing his hand about how he would lower taxes, saying simply that he would ""work with the Legislature"" on that.\Early lead, early stumbles\Because of his polling lead, and the fact his job in Congress keeps him in Washington, D.C., most of the week, Gibbons has declined to debate his opponents until well after early voting began July 29.\That has given his opponents a convenient ground for attack. But Gibbons said there's no outcry from the public for him to debate.\""Debates aren't the end all be all of educating the voters,"" Gibbons said. ""I have to work in Washington, D.C. The taxpayers pay my salary and they expect me to be at my job.""\Gibbons also endured several stumbles early in the race. Last year in Elko he delivered a fiery condemnation of ""liberals"" who oppose the Iraq War, suggesting they be given plane tickets to serve as human shields in Iraq.\Democrats denounced him for the partisan rancor. And before the attention faded, the Elko Daily Free Press revealed that he had plagiarized the speech from an Alabama politician.\Gibbons, born and raised in Sparks, says he knows Nevada better than any other candidate. He was educated in Nevada, receiving a bachelor's in geology and a master's in mining from the University of Nevada, Reno. He also has a law degree from Southwestern University.\His career has been spent mainly as a commercial airline pilot but includes stints working for Union Carbide, Homestake Mining Co. and in his own law practice. ""I have just a tremendous number of years knowing, living and learning about Nevada,"" Gibbons said.\His political career includes three terms in the state Assembly and nearly a decade in Congress.\Gibbons is a former combat pilot who fought in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. After four years in the U.S. Air Force, Gibbons spent 22 years in the Nevada Air National Guard, retiring as a colonel, and two years in the Air Force Reserve.\Gibbons' experience as a geologist and mining lawyer has made him a fierce advocate for the mining industry, the mainstay of Nevada's rural economies.\He often is criticized by environmental groups, who see his mining support as coming at the expense of clean air and water in Nevada and neighboring states.\Earlier this year, Gibbons helped author a report that sought to minimize the danger of eating mercury in fish.\But Gibbons said it is a ""false choice"" to say the state can't foster a healthy climate for the mining industry while protecting the environment.\ooooooooooo\Lorraine Hunt: 'I helped write the blueprint' for Nevada's current prosperity\By ANJEANETTE DAMON\adamon@rgj.com\For Lt. Gov. Lorraine Hunt, being a ""heartbeat away from the governorship"" is too far.\In her bid to replace Gov. Kenny Guinn, Hunt has linked herself to most of Guinn's recent initiatives and has taken credit for propelling the state's economy into a budget-surplus-generating machine.\""I want to continue down the path of prosperity that I helped create,"" she said. ""We've brought Nevada from a budget deficit to a budget surplus. I'm the person who can continue the path of prosperity. I helped write the blueprint.""\Hunt said her experience sets her apart from the other candidates.\""They're all going to say they're going to improve education and keep taxes low, but can they do it? Are they a success at doing it?"" Hunt said. ""Look at the skill level of the person you are talking to. Look at the person's track record. Look at the past performance of Lorraine Hunt.""\Asked how she would improve education and keep taxes low, Hunt doesn't make any specific proposals for what she would do as governor. Instead, she reiterates her resume, saying it proves she has the skill to do it.\""I've got the talent. I've got the skills,"" she said. ""I've been making money for my family for years. Now I want to go make money for the people of Nevada.""\Entertainer, entrepreneur\Hunt, 67, parlayed a career as a lounge singer on the Las Vegas Strip into a business booking backup singers for some of the top names in Vegas entertainment.\In the 1970s, she opened the Bootlegger Bistro, which continues today as a bustling Las Vegas restaurant. In the 1980s, she helped found a bank.\She entered politics in 1994, with a successful run for the Clark County Commission.\Although a series of polls show her trailing Gibbons distantly, Hunt said she has never lost a race, including campaigns that appeared more difficult than this one. To help this race along, Hunt has vowed to spend $800,000 of her own money.\As lieutenant governor, she said, it was her work heading up economic development and tourism promotion that helped the state generate a budget surplus from the brisk economy.\If elected, Hunt said she would focus on finding public-private partnerships, enticing private philanthropists to donate money for construction projects, university programs or public safety.\""There are plenty of wealthy people out there who would like to see their name on a building,"" she said.\As far as the state's transportation needs, Hunt said the other candidates are focusing too much on roads.\""They keep talking about how the streets have a few potholes and the fact they have gridlock, but if we are growing, our airports are essential,"" she said.\If the $600 million projected surplus materializes next year, Hunt said she would divert a portion to a $3.8 billion shortfall in the budget for road projects.\But first she would raise the amount in the state's Rainy Day Fund. Hunt said she would consider a rebate, but not if there are unmet needs.\""If you give people a $75 rebate, but then we put in toll roads or a higher gas tax, then what have we done for people?"" she said. ""We need to give them the whole picture and tell them the whole truth.""\Hunt said her free time revolves around family. She was married in March to entertainer Dennis Bono and has two grandchildren.\""We're just a big Italian family,"" she said.\Her favorite movie and book is ""Gone with the Wind.""\""I love stories about people who have great adversity and strength of character, where all the odds are against them and they prevail,"" she said.

74,"Folks living on Montello Street are subsidizing those in Montreux.\I hear time and again that Republicans bail out billionaires. They support legislation that subsidizes the 1 percent at the sake of the 99 percent. While I don't totally disagree, I think the fairer statement is politicians from both sides of the aisle enact policies to help corporations.\Take the action at the past legislative past session that re-established subsidies to people who put solar panels on their roofs. It's technically called ""net metering,"" which is a billing mechanism that credits solar energy system owners for the electricity they add to the grid. But the reality is all of us ratepayers are paying higher bills so that a few rather wealthy people can put solar panels on their roof. The legislation was backed primarily Democrats, under the guise that net metering is good for the environment and will create jobs.\I read a few articles to try and understand what net metering is, as it isn't easy to comprehend. One article from Reuters authored by Bob Stump seemed to explain it best. ""Net metering means that a customer's meter spins backwards and transmits excess energy to the utility, and which regressively shifts costs to poor and lower-income customers to the benefit of rooftop solar leasing companies. As solar penetration increases, utilities' fixed costs are spread across fewer customers, leading to higher rates that cause particular harm to poorer and lower-middle-class consumers, who typically spend a larger share of their income on energy.""\Or in other words, folks living on Montello Street are subsidizing those in Montreux.\Rooftop solar ranks among the least cost-effective forms of renewable energy. Yet the solar lobby holds powerful sway over Democrats (and some Republicans) who make the claim that they are creating jobs and helping the environment. Yet without the generous tax credits, subsidies and local incentives granted by politicians and regulators, leased rooftop solar would make zero financial sense for consumers.\These roof top systems are hyped by salesmen promising reduced power bills. Customers sign long-term contracts to lease rooftop solar systems with little or no upfront costs. According to the Reuter's article, solar leasing escalators of 2.9 percent -- which is outpacing the rate of inflation -- force some leased rooftop solar customers to pay more, not less, than what they would have otherwise paid for electricity. No wonder so many people are cancelling their contracts.\In fact, in May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into whether SolarCity and Sunrun are adequately disclosing how many customers have cancelled solar contracts. After the California Attorney General Xavier Becerra received hundreds of complaints from customers cancelling contracts after signing up for a home solar system with local installers, the federal regulators are taking matters into their own hands.\Even the left-wing research tank Public Citizen deemed solar leasing products ""significant financial risks for families."" Corporations -- not customers -- pocket the government subsidies that make the leasing model viable, including a 30 percent federal tax credit.\I'm all for using the sun for power and reducing our carbon foot print. But I'm not sold that subsidizing solar panels is a good deal for ratepayers, or that helpful to the environment.\Randi Thompson is a political and public relations consultant.

75," By JOHN G. EDWARDS\ REVIEW-JOURNAL\ For $15,000, the Robert Nielsen family has joined a small but growing number of Southern Nevada homeowners. They use solar power systems to generate some of their power needs at their homes.\ His family is among 34 customers that generate electricity from photovoltaic systems and feed excess power back to Nevada Power Co. through so-called net metering.\ Photovoltaic systems turn sunlight directly into electricity soundlessly. The net metering system gives participants credits that can be used to buy power when the sun isn't shining and when they need more power than the solar system produces.\ While the Nevada Legislature this session passed three renewable energy bills that deal with renewable energy systems, such as solar power, the bills make little difference to green power fans such as the Nielsens.\ Existing law and regulations, along with an incentive program from Nevada Power, gives them all the reasons they need for harnessing the power of the sun.\ Nielsen, a mortgage broker, is getting a $3,000 rebate from Nevada Power, to offset some of the cost of installing a solar photovoltaic power system for his new house in Henderson. It's part of a program that Nevada Power started in January for up to 50 residential customers. So far 19 customers have applied to participate but another 15 residential customers of Nevada Power already had photovoltaic systems and net metering systems.\ ""Economically, I think the break-even is a number of years out. My break-even was the first minute I walked out there and saw it was generating electricity from sunlight,"" Nielsen said. ""Every time, I look outside and it's sunny, it makes me feel good.""\ Solar power systems produce no pollution and reduce the need for natural gas-fired and coal-fired power plants. Photovoltaic systems also enable Nevada Power to minimize investments in added power line capacity because most of the power the Nielsens generate will be used at their home.\ Residents installing photovoltaic systems generally get their payback from a feeling of helping the environment or from a desire to be an early adopter of new technology, said Bob Balzar, program director for energy efficiency and conservation at Nevada Power.\ Balzar confirmed Nielsen's suspicions that he will be waiting a long time to recover the expense of the system. The utility manager estimates that photovoltaic system save customers about $200 a year for each kilowatt of generation capacity.\ Nevada Power also offers a rebate of $3 a watt up to a maximum of $3,000 for 1,000 watts (kilowatts) or more.\ The Nielsens have a four-bedroom, four bath 3,300-square-foot house. They installed a 3-kilowatt system from Las Vegas Solar Electric. But many customers typically find 1 kilowatt to 2.5 kilowatt systems are adequate for their homes, Balzar said.\ Interested home owners should first obtain a packet of information about photovoltaic and net metering systems, Balzar said. Las Vegas Solar Electric sold and installed the photovoltaic system for the Nielsens last week, but Balzar said there are several electrical contractors in the area who are qualified to do the job."
76,"Passing bills in any legislative body can be akin to making sausage.\The Nevada Legislature is no exception.\As the 2017 session hits the home stretch, bills can turn into bargaining chips for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who want to get tougher legislation passed -- like Gov. Brian Sandoval's push for a controversial Education Savings Account, for example. It's the essence of legislative compromise.\The Legislature also serves as the battleground for business-related initiatives, including measures that not only impact community members but also pit rival business interests against each other. These include longstanding, fiercely contested issues in the state such as renewables and ridesharing as well as less known topics that are just coming to the fore.\Here's a look at some key business-related bills to pay attention to prior to the session's deadline.\Minimum wage hike\Any bill that raises the minimum wage will be a hot-button issue on both ends of the political spectrum.\In Nevada, the minimum wage is $7.25 for jobs with health insurance and $8.25 for positions that do not come with health benefits.\Senate Bill 106 aims to raise the minimum wage by 75 cents annually for the next five years until it reaches at least $11 or more for positions with health insurance and $12 or more for jobs without health benefits.\The bill passed in the Senate on May 17 and awaits a vote in the Assembly. Even if the bill is passed, there's no guarantee that Sandoval will sign it barring an agreement involving other legislation. As a result, supporters of SB 106 have also filed a Senate Joint Resolution 6, which calls for a constitutional amendment to raise the minimum wage and put the issue to a public vote. Such amendments must be approved twice -- meaning this session and the next legislative session after two years -- before it could go to a public vote in the 2020 elections.\More energy from renewables\Assembly Bill 206 aims to raise the percentage of energy that Nevada gets from renewable sources.\Nevada Revised Statute currently mandates an increase every two years in the amount of energy the state gets from renewable sources until it hits 25 percent by 2025.\AB 206 aims to increase the share of renewables to a significantly higher 80 percent by 2040. For comparison, neighboring California -- which has one of the highest RPS targets in the country -- has a goal of 50 percent by 2030.\Supporters see an abundance of renewable energy sources as not only a win for the environment and reducing dependence on foreign oil, but also a great recruiting tool for attracting companies that have placed a premium on green energy such as Apple and Google. Critics, meanwhile, question the practicality, reliability and added costs from switching to renewable energy from conventional energy sources.\Net metering\Assembly Bill 270 resurrects a highly charged issue that fueled great debate across the state in recent years: net metering.\After Nevada reached a compromise that allowed existing customers to be grandfathered into more favorable net metering rates for the extra energy they produce and sent to the grid, AB 270 aimed to make net metering available to more rooftop solar customers.\As the cost of solar foes down and technology such as Tesla's storage batteries become more viable, the dream of a ""net zero"" household continues to be appealing to many homeowners. Given the acrimony seen in the last net metering debate, which included some frustration in the 2015 Legislature, any addition to current net metering beneficiaries will be a challenge to say the least.\In the meantime, AB 270 has been merged with AB 405 -- which passed overwhelmingly in the Assembly on May 23 -- to create a more comprehensive rooftop solar bill.\Self-driving cars\After becoming the first state to pass driverless car legislation, Nevada finds itself playing catch up as other states aggressively jump into the driverless car fray.\Assembly Bill 69 is an attempt to bring Nevada up to speed by allowing activities now seen in other states such as Florida and Michigan. At the top of the list is the ability for companies to conduct driverless car testing without a person present inside the vehicle.\Supporters say the changes will allow for greater development of the sector in the state, including the creation of self-driving vehicle fleets.\Critics, however, question whether the technology is moving too fast at the risk of endangering public safety. The bill was granted a waiver in April 12 to buy it more time and had its latest meeting in the Assembly Transportation Committee on May 11.\Ridesharing\After a high-octane legal tussle between Uber and Nevada's taxi lobby that navigated its way to the Legislature, ridesharing officially became legal in Nevada in late 2015.\This was not the end of this debate, however, with Senate Bill 226 serving as proof of the ongoing tug of war between ridesharing supporters and critics.\A key change brought about by the bill is requiring drivers for services such as Uber and Lyft to carry at least $300,000 in insurance while using their ridesharing apps and at least $1.5 million when providing transportation services to a passenger. The bill also requires ridesharing companies to maintain records of trips, inspection records, complaints and accidents for three years and make them available to the Nevada Transportation Authority for investigations.\Supporters say the bill provides added protections for consumers. Critics say it puts undue burdens on the sector and hamper ridesharing services.\Fracking\Fracking has proved to be the great equalizer for North American oil and gas operations, opening up a swath of resources that used to be difficult to extract. At the same time, the activity also has raised concerns ranging from pollution to increased earthquake risk from wastewater disposal.\Assembly Bill 159 leans toward the anti-fracking side and will ban hydraulic fracturing in the state if passed.\This issue is proving to be a classic environmental debate that pits business against conservationists.\Supporters of fracking say that allowing for hydraulic fracturing will generate revenue for the state while also helping ranch owners earn additional income through oil and gas leases.\Opponents of fracking contend that the activity pollutes the air and can have an adverse impact on groundwater.\The bill passed the Assembly on May 26 and is awaiting votes in the Senate."
77,"Utility company NV Energy announced Monday that it will propose allowing existing customers to be grandfathered under the previous net metering rules.\The proposal will be submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada and request that customers who signed up for solar prior to the PUC's new rates for rooftop installations be grandfathered in under the old net metering reimbursement rates for up to 20 years.\""This grandfathering proposal is being offered in recognition of NV Energy's desire to treat all customers, including those who had previously made a decision to install rooftop solar, fairly,"" said Paul Caudill, NV Energy president and CEO in a statement. ""We recognize the difficult job that ... all parties in this proceeding have had in trying to reach decisions on this complex issue.""\The announcement comes along the heels of the PUC's decision earlier this month to keep the new rate hikes for all rooftop solar customers. The decision was made during a hearing that saw hundreds of protesters gather in Carson City and Las Vegas, with the majority of public testimony coming from solar supporters.\""These are laid off solar workers and frustrated customers who came out for an opportunity to look the commission in the eye and ask them to reverse their decision (in December for new rates),"" Lauren Randall, a spokeswoman for solar company Sunrun, told the Reno Gazette-Journal at the time.\A key point of contention at the hearing was how the PUC's decision on new rates in December also was applied to existing customers. The net metering issue has been fueling debate in the state in the last year, including a heated session at the last Nevada Legislature.\NV Energy made the announcement for its new request as it prepares for ongoing proceedings with the PUC concerning net metering. The company did not take a position on grandfathering older customers at previous hearings. NV Energy says it will submit its new proposal on Feb. 1. The proposal will apply to customers with existing solar installations as well as those who submitted applications prior to the December PUC decision.\""We also understand the history of net metering in Nevada and that a fair, stable and predictable cost environment is important to all of our customers,"" Caudill said. ""Our proposal seeks a balance for those who selected solar prior to the implementation of the new rules ordered by the PUCN and those without solar."""
78,"rhagar@rgj.com\A first-term assemblyman from Reno is teaming with Senate Minority Leader Dina Titus, D-Las Vegas, to provide incentives for Nevadans who use wind-generated energy.\Titus and Democratic Assemblyman David Bobzien said Monday they are sponsoring similar bills to create a rebate system for consumers who use wind energy to help power homes and businesses -- similar to a current state program, SolarGenerations, that provides incentives for solar power.\Titus' bill also would make Nevada's SolarGenerations program, which was created by the 2003 Legislature, an ongoing program by killing the project's sunset provision.\Bobzien's bill, Assembly Bill 178, also would raise the net metering cap for retail power credits to include large scale-renewable energy projects by large business, hospitals and school districts.\""The more (we) can do to add incentives for renewable energy, the better,"" Titus said. ""It's a win, win, win. It is good for the economic development in rural Nevada, good for the environment and good for us internationally because it would make us less dependent on foreign sources.""\Bobzien's bill was presented Monday to the Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee for a first hearing. Titus said her bill still is being drafted.\""We're moving a bit slower on the Senate side,"" Titus joked.\Rebates are needed for people who use solar and wind energy because the cost of the systems to produce the energy is expensive, Bobzien said.\""When you are dealing with a project that is $20,000 or $30,000 for home installation, any help that you can provide to further this technology is a good one,"" Bobzien said. ""The thing to keep in mind: The benefit of these incentives is that, over the long term, the cost of this technology could really come down.""\Titus said she sees the rebates for wind power as a major factor for rural Nevada.\""The wind project could be most beneficial for agriculture, where can you use the small wind projects to help pump irrigation water,"" Titus said.\When told wind power is already being used in Nevada agriculture, Titus shot back, ""Yes, but now, they'll be getting paid for it.""\Bobzien sees wind power in urban areas, despite ordinances in various Nevada communities that oversee its use.\""I've been in contact with officials from the city of Reno to talk about some of these issues, and certainly down the road, we have to think of those,"" Bobzien said. ""But, I'm not thinking of big, big windmills. The technology for micro-wind projects has become a lot less intrusive.\""This is not about your father's wind turbine, 40 or 50 feet in the air,"" Bobzien said. ""They can be on tops of roofs, out of the view. They can be a lot less intrusive.""\The second part of Bobzien's bill would raise the net metering cap for renewable energy incentives from 30 kilowatts to five megawatts, so large businesses and public entities, such as school districts and hospitals, could be encouraged to undertake alternative energy projects.\""It is my belief that further incentives for this technology will also have the effect of lowering these costs for everybody,"" Bobzien said.\""The hope is that this would become more than a niche industry, he said. Once we have large solar instillations and larger wind instillations, we'll end up lowering the cost for all consumers.""\Titus said she wants to add residential home builders to the list of people who can receive rebates under the SolarGenerations project.\Currently, the project is limited to residences, small businesses, public buildings and schools, a spokesperson for Sierra Pacific Power Company said.\""If the developers can put these systems in first and it becomes part of the mortgage, I think we'll find people more inclined to pay for it instead of the add-ons, which become more expensive,"" Titus said.\ooo\DETAILS\Here is what Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons proposed about alternative energy during his State of the State speech in January:\* Applauded the Legislature for the action it took last session to ramp up the incentives for greater production of solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energy.\* Stressed that Nevada needs to increase the diversity and supply of all fuels and not allow itself to become too reliant on one fuel source.\* Encouraged the creation of a coal-to-liquids fuels plant in Nevada that would use existing rail to transport coal to the plant and convert that coal to diesel and jet fuel for use at airports. It also could create natural gas to be injected into a natural gas pipeline for domestic use.\* Recommended continuing to provide incentives to utilities companies to improve the environment, reduce greenhouse gases, stimulate job growth, hedge against fossil fuel volatility and help guarantee availability.\* Directed the State Purchasing Department to do more performance-based contracting on all state buildings for energy and water conservation retrofits.\* Stressed that Nevada needs a stronger state energy office."

""But before people switch, they feel I should demonstrate that it's cost-effective. I can't do that."" \""Our phone's ringing off the hook,"" added Grace Caldwell at Independent Power Corp., another alternative-energy specialist. ""But the power company still has cheaper power."" \Energy prices have doubled or tripled in California in just a few months. The state has had rolling blackouts, and more are expected in summer, when power demand rises 30 percent. \Even if the same thing happens in Nevada, though, experts believe wide adoption of alternative power is decades - and dollars - away. \Most of Caldwell's business, she said, has come from people living ""off the grid,"" unconnected to utility companies. Faced with a choice of paying thousands of dollars to run power lines to a remote lot or using the same money to wean themselves from the system, a few will make the switch. \Homeowners who phone in a fit of pique over a high power bill, though, lose interest when they hear the facts. A solar backup system, to provide basic service if power is interrupted, may run @$!18,000. Building a new home to operate off the grid adds @$!25,000, and converting an existing home to sever the utilities' umbilical can be twice that. Those who simply want backup power for emergencies can buy a gasoline-powered generator for less than $$@$!1,000. \One alternative choice that is gathering momentum is solar water heating. The simplest systems feature a collector with pipes filled with an antifreeze mixture. The fluid heats in the sun, then runs through a water tank. The water absorbs the heat, then goes into the home, usually through a conventional heater for nights and cloudy spells. \Dal Hunter, owner of Black Eagle Consulting in Reno, has such a system in his Verdi home. Water comes out of the exchanger at about 160 degrees in summer, between 100 and 120 degrees on sunny winter days, he said. Since a hot bath is about 105 degrees and a dishwasher 140 to 160 degrees, he uses little extra fuel. \Caldwell said a water system can be installed for around $$@$!2,500, so ""there's a pretty quick payback."" \Otherwise, though, what interest California's energy problems have generated in Nevada has been mainly academic. \""We've sold two or three kerosene heaters, that's about all,"" said Bob Taylor, owner of Shelly's True Value Hardware in Sparks. \Space heaters are more expensive to operate than conventional furnaces, but they can save money if they're used to heat a small area while the rest of the house remains cool. Kerosene also can provide short-term emergency heat in power failures or blackouts. \Ironically, said a sales clerk at a large home improvement center, one reason sales haven't picked up with the news from California is that ""we sold all we could get for Y2K."" \The clerk, who said corporate policy prohibited him from giving his name, said that during the millennium frenzy in 1999, ""Everybody who was going to get scared already did."" Those emergency supplies are still available in many homes. \Hardware stores and home centers also report no significant increase in sales of insulation, weatherstripping or other low-cost energy-savers. \The Solar Barn's O'Kuinghttons said he's disappointed, but not surprised. \""When the (energy) prices go up, it will help. Until then, it boils down to dollars."" \o ""Our phone's ringing off the hook. But the power company still has cheaper power."" \Grace Caldwell \Independent Power Corp. \Sierra Pacific solar program draws interest \By Tim Anderson \RENO GAZETTE-JOURNAL \Although only a handful of Sierra Pacific Power Co. customers have signed up for a special program utilizing solar energy, interest in the idea is on the rise, according to a company spokesman. \""Over the last month, we've had many inquiries. And we expect the level of interest to remain high based on recent developments regarding power supplies and costs,"" said Sierra Pacific consultant Colin Duncan. \Steadily increasing electric and natural gas rates, combined with the utility crisis in neighboring California, are expected to continue to push consumers toward alternative solutions. \The ability of residential and commercial customers to work with utilities in generating power through natural resources came through 1997 legislation. Both Nevada and California lawmakers passed ""net metering"" measures for those who want to take advantage of energy from the sun or wind. \So far, the program has focused on solar power, generated through photovoltaic tiles installed on the roof of a home or business. Under the system, excess power can be fed to the utilities, then returned to the consumer when it's needed. \Sierra Pacific officials said the system is designed so everyone benefits - and customer costs are cut dramatically. \But there is a major drawback to the concept, said Duncan. \""Installations can be very costly. And this immediately scares away a lot of people,"" Duncan said. \He said an efficient system can be installed for about $$@$!10,000. But in some cases, installation can double that amount - which Duncan said rules out the likelihood of the participant ultimately making up the initial expense in energy savings. \But at least one Sierra Pacific customer is doing very well at her home, which includes 60 photovoltaic tiles on her south-facing garage roof. Marion Barritt, who lives in Gardnerville's Chichester Estates, was the first Nevadan to take advantage of the ""net metering"" law. \Her home, a mini-power plant, includes three power company meters. One indicates how much electricity the system produces; one measures how much is sent to the power company grid; and the third tells how much of the stored power is returned to Barritt. \The Carson Valley resident, who lobbied the 1997 Nevada Legislature, is president of Sunrise, a 250-member non-profit alternative energy group actively involved in getting the word out about the benefits of ""net metering."" \Even though there are times of the year when the sun isn't shining on her home and power generation is negligible, Barritt said her annual electric bill has averaged @$!6,000. Duncan said the expense was less than it would be normally because she was first in line. \Sierra Pacific has seven ""net metering"" customers in its Nevada service areas, and one in nearby California. No customers for Las Vegas-based Nevada Power have signed up. \""Some people are interested because they want to be self-sufficient, or they are environmentally friendly,"" Duncan said. He said he expects much of the serious interest in the future to come from those who are affluent or who want to help the environment. \Only one business, environmentally-conscious Patagonia, has signed up for the program in northern Nevada. The outfitter for outdoor recreationists has a distribution center in west Reno. \The program is designed for residential systems requiring 1-2 kilowatts of electricity. Duncan said Patagonia has a 5 kilowatt PV system. The allowable limit under the law is 10, and Duncan said this rules out larger industrial operations participating. \Also, the legislation passed four years ago caps the number of users at 100 in both northern and southern Nevada. Utility companies fought for the cap but state regulators have said they might want to reconsider as supplies dwindle and costs escalate. \FOR INFORMATION \Where to call: For information on Sierra Pacific Power Co.'s ""net metering"" program: 834-3673.

It uses 3 to 7 gallons of hot water each time you use it. \o Let your dishes air dry; if you don't have an automatic air-dry switch, turn off the control knob after the final rinse and prop the door open a little. \o Remember that dishwashers use less water than washing dishes by hand, about 6 gallons less per load. \Refrigerator/freezer \o Don't keep your refrigerator or freezer too cold. Recommended temperatures are 37 to 40 degrees for the fresh food compartment of the refrigerator and 5 degrees for the freezer section. A separate freezer for long-term storage should be kept at 0 degrees. \o Make sure your refrigerator door seals are airtight. Test them by closing the door over a piece of paper or a dollar bill so it is half in and half out of the refrigerator. If you can pull the paper or bill out easily, the latch may need adjustment or the seal may need replacing. \o Cover liquids and wrap foods stored in the refrigerator. Uncovered foods release moisture and make the compressor work harder. \Other kitchen \o Be sure to place the faucet lever on the sink in the cold position when using small amounts of water; placing the lever in the hot position uses energy to heat the water even though it never reaches the faucet. \o In gas appliances, look for blue flames; yellow flames indicate the gas is burning inefficiently and an adjustment may be needed. \o If you cook with electricity, turn the stovetop burners off several minutes before the allotted cooking time. The heating element will stay hot long enough to finish the cooking without using more electricity. \Laundry \o About 80 to 85 percent of the energy used for washing clothes is for heating the water. There are two ways to reduce the energy used for washing clothes - use less water and use cooler water. \o When shopping for a new washer, look for a front loading (horizontal-axis) machine. This machine may cost more to buy but uses about a third of the energy and less water than a top-loading machine. With a front loader, you'll also save more on clothes drying, because they remove more water during the spin cycle. \Heating \o Clean or replace filters on furnaces once a month or as needed. \o Clean warm-air registers, baseboard heaters, and radiators as needed; make sure they're not blocked by furniture, carpeting, or drapes. \o Use kitchen, bath, and other ventilating fans wisely; in just 1 hour, these fans can pull out a houseful of warmed or cooled air. Turn fans off as soon as they have done the job. \o Keep draperies and shades open on south-facing windows during the heating season to allow sunlight to enter your home; close them at night to reduce the chill you may feel from cold windows. \Air conditioners \o Whole-house fans help cool your home by pulling cool air through the house and exhausting warm air through the attic. \o Set your thermostat as high as comfortably possible. The less difference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures, the lower your cooling bill will be. \o Don't set your thermostat at a colder setting than normal when you turn on your air conditioner. It will not cool your home any faster and could result in excessive cooling and, therefore, expense. \o Consider using an interior fan in conjunction with your window air conditioner to spread the cooled air more effectively through your home. \Indoor lighting \o Turn off the lights in any room you're not using, or consider installing timers, photo cells, or occupancy sensors to reduce the amount your lights are on. \o Use task lighting; instead of brightly lighting an entire room, focus the light where you need it. \o Consider three-way lamps; they make it easier to keep lighting levels low when brighter light is not necessary.

80,"CARSON CITY - NV Energy will propose allowing customers who already have solar panels or applied for them before the new year to keep more favorable rates for up to two decades, the company said in a statement as blowback over a recent rate hike continues.\The company announced its plan Monday, just after regulators at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission voted to further discuss the possibility of ""grandfathering"" existing customers into lower rates. NV Energy plans to submit its proposal Feb. 1, before a hearing that regulators scheduled for Feb. 8.\""A fair, stable and predictable cost environment is important to all of our customers,"" said NV Energy CEO Paul Caudill, acknowledging that it was a difficult task to come up with solutions in the solar rate debate. ""Our proposal seeks a balance for those who selected solar prior to the implementation of the new rules ordered by the (Public Utilities Commission) and those without solar.""\Under the plan, which would need commissioner approval, the more favorable rates would apply to more than 17,000 net metering customers who sell excess energy from their solar panels back to the utility.\The lower rates would also covered customers who applied to start net metering before the commission ordered the rate change; more than 14,000 customers fall into that category.\The announcement came the same day that solar companies intensified the fight and filed a petition in hopes of taking the solar rate matter to the statewide ballot. Their proposal, which would need more than 55,000 signatures to go up for a vote, would go much further than NV Energy's plan and allow both existing customers and an unlimited number of future customers to take advantage of old, more favorable rates.\""We're grateful that NV Energy has recognized the importance of protecting the investments 17,000 Nevadans have already made in solar,"" said Lyndon Rive, CEO of rooftop solar company SolarCity, which backs the petition. ""However, it's vital that the state fix the rules to allow all Nevadans to choose clean energy in the future.""\Rive also called on state lawmakers to convene a special session to address the matter -- a long shot considering two-thirds of legislators would have to agree to call themselves into session, and all but one lawmaker voted in favor of the bill the referendum seeks to gut.\Debate over solar rates gained steam last spring, as Nevada approached a statutory cap on the amount of rooftop solar panel users who could participate in net metering.\Nevada lawmakers ultimately passed a compromise bill that directed regulators to set new rates for customers that avoid any unreasonable cost-shifting.\Regulators approved new rates effective Jan. 1 that raise base charges for solar customers and reduce reimbursements for their excess power over the course of four years.\Commissioners said the rates will phase out subsidies that traditional customers pay to support solar customers, spread out the burden of maintaining electrical infrastructure and would better reflect the declining cost of solar energy. Rooftop solar companies, which sell or lease panels on the premise that customers will save enough on their energy bills to easily make payments on the panels, say the changes make their business model unworkable.\""The Public Utilities Commission's rules have been taxing on the rooftop solar industry and have already cost the state nearly 1,000 jobs in less than a month, with more job losses likely on the way,"" said former Nevada Gov. Robert List, a lobbyist for rooftop solar company SolarCity. ""The rules fail the public the commission purports to represent, and are simply not reasonable, balanced policy.""\Many current solar customers have attended commission meetings saying they installed systems to help the environment and lower their energy bill but will now need to make payments for years longer to cover solar panel investments of $40,000 or more.\Republican state Sen. Patricia Farley, who led efforts to pass the solar bill that's now being challenged, said solar companies helped vet the bill, testified in favor of it and thanked her for it. She said it was their right to change course, but said she was in favor of NV Energy's latest proposal.\""I think we need a long-term policy on this,"" she said. ""We need to develop the solar industry but not at the expense of the ratepayers. Multi-billion dollar companies trying to force their profit agenda is probably not the best way to go."""

""We appreciate all parties coming together to expedite the process on behalf of our customers.""\The grandfathering agreement will apply to about 32,000 customers, including those who had a pending application on Dec. 31, 2015. Customers who withdrew a valid application or had their application for the RenewableGenerations expire between Dec. 21 and Dec. 31 are eligible to be grandfathered as well. The agreement still must be approved by the PUC, which is expected to vote on it on this week.\Jon Wellinghoff, former consumer advocate for the State of Nevada and current SolarCity Chief Policy Officer pushed for the settlement to be approved quickly.\""This agreement is a victory not only for 32,000 solar customers in Nevada, but also for all Americans who expect these investments to be protected,"" Wellinghoff said in a statement.

The solar debate became even more heated following the December rate hike and the decision by the PUC in January to keep the new rates, leading to a packed hearing in Carson City that included an appearance by actor and solar supporter Mark Ruffalo.\By late January, NV Energy indicated that it was supporting the grandfathering of eligible rooftop solar customers under the old rates. If approved, the grandfathering agreement will be in effect for 20 years.\Monday's agreement was welcomed by Gov. Brian Sandoval, who said it was ""time to move on.""\""I am pleased with the result and believe it is in the best interests of all Nevadans,"" Sandoval said. ""I am hopeful that the PUC will act quickly on this agreement.""\Even if the agreement is approved, however, there is still a looming battle over the new rates for rooftop solar.

In July, applications under the solar program were down to 14.\The solar lobby frequently points to the steep drop in applications when talking about the impact of the new rates on the rooftop solar industry and any potential deals to address it.\""A compromise means meeting halfway, but you can't do that when solar is already shut down,"" said Chandler Sherman, a spokeswoman with the solar advocacy group Bring Back Solar Alliance, earlier this year.\The battle is expected to switch next year to the Nevada Legislature. State lawmakers were responsible for kicking the new rate decision to the PUC after washing its hands off the net metering debate in frustration during the last session.\NV Energy, meanwhile, has consistently found itself in the crosshairs of solar supporters, including heavyweights such as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. For the Nevada utility, the rooftop solar debate is just one challenge arising from disruptive models in the energy sector. Earlier this year, the Peppermill Casinos, Inc. filed notice that it wanted to leave NV Energy and procure its energy from out of state. It is the latest Nevada hotel-casino to do so, following Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts International.

82,"sierra pacific power titus local localized\ |Associated Press\ Gardnerville resident Marion Barritt's solar attic fan is one of many items she is having installed by contractors as part of a program that allows her to receive credit for power her panels send to the power company's grid. She is the first Nevadan to participate in the program.\ Nevada's sunshine put to use\ Associated Press\ GARDNERVILLE - Nevada's abundant sunshine will soon generate electricity for a tract home whose owner is being called a pioneer in new options for solar energy use.\ Marion Barritt is the first Nevadan to sign up for a new ""net metering"" program that will let her send electricity to the power company or draw it in, depending on how much energy is generated by solar tiles tacked to her roof.\ As soon as the net metering plan was approved by the 1997 Legislature, Barritt was ready to sign the paperwork to put her home, now under construction, at the top of the list. Nevada is the 17th state to pass such a law.\ ""This is a tract home of the next century,"" said Barritt, a sailplane instructor. ""Nevada is a state populated by pioneers and that's what I want to be in this area.\ ""I want to lead the way and live in a house that's a responsible house, one that works with the environment and utilizes our state's abundant natural resources.""\ Homeowners should wean themselves from dependence on fossil fuels and become energy self-sufficient by taking advantage of renewable resources, Barritt said, adding that solar technology will become cheaper as more people switch.\ ""It's not cost-effective today but it's expected to come down within five years,"" she said of the photovoltaic tiles soon to be installed on her south-facing, pie-shaped garage roof, not visible from the street.\ Although solar systems are often criticized as too pricey, Barritt's 1-kilowatt system will cost only $7,000. A 1,500-to-2,000-square-foot house could pay between $3,000 and $25,000 for a photovoltaic system.\ Barritt expects to produce more electricity than she'll use because the house also has thick insulation, special heat-reflective paint, fluorescent lights, extra soffit vents and a radiant barrier in the roof.\ ""We need to convince people at my income level - which is very low - that they can make a difference,"" she said. ""If you add that cost onto a 30-year mortgage, the electricity saved each month will more than cover the additional cost of the mortgage payment.""\ During the day, the photovoltaic cells will convert sunlight directly into electrical power. Any excess electricity will go to the Sierra Pacific Power Co. grid. At night, electricity will flow into the house from the power company.\ Barritt will get an electricity bill crediting her for the power she generates, although the utility won't have to pay cash for any extra electricity added to its grid.\ Dave McNeil, energy program specialist with the state Energy Office, said Nevada is an ideal solar energy state: It's one of the three sunniest states in the country, along with Arizona and New Mexico.\ Nevada is blessed with a high quality and quantity of energy resources but is dependent on fossil fuel imports, which act as a dollar and job drain, he added.\ Sen. Dina Titus, D-Las Vegas, got the net metering bill approved this year. That followed her 1995 bill barring homeowners associations from restricting solar panels in their covenants, conditions and restrictions."
83,"Regarding the recent column ""Solar net metering plan benefits wealthier people"" by Randi Thompson:\With good reporting from RGJ on the 2017 Nevada Legislature, I kept up with actions concerning solar energy in the state. When Tesla called me and offered me the opportunity to become a rooftop solar energy producer, it did not take much thinking for me to say ""count me in."" Net metering, which will allow me to contribute my solar production into the power grid for reduced rates, was passed by Democrats in the Legislature.\According to Ms. Thompson, this is a subsidy for the 1 percent of rich people, at the expense of the 99 percent. I am not in that 1 percent. She writes the Democrats have presented a ""guise that net metering is good for the environment and will create jobs."" A guise is defined as a ""false appearance."" Ms. Thompson, this is no guise.\According to SolarCity's 2015 Impact Report ""Over 30 years, the net carbon reduction of a typical system deployed by SolarCity is equivalent to 166,000 pounds of coal unburned.""\Because she has written opinions praising entrepreneurs, it surprises me that in this case Ms. Thompson does not know entrepreneurship when she sees it. I am an entrepreneur. My rental properties provide many jobs. I have to spend money to make money. Solar technicians and construction workers will get jobs. My solar expense will have a ripple effect as I pay to remove a tree that is in the way, providing more jobs.\Thank you, Democratic Legislature, for enabling me to go into the solar business. Thank you, my Republican Gov. Sandoval, for not vetoing this legislation. He realized that encouraging renewable energy is a bipartisan goal. The federal government will give me a 30 percent write-off on the total cost of my solar, to be applied to my income for the year.\So also thank you, federal government, for enabling me to become a solar producer. That 30 percent write-off is a result of federal legislation from 2009 called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Although written by Democrats and one Independent, it got some Republican votes, which makes it bipartisan.\Energy production, and the jobs that come from it, is a very important regional dynamic. Hillary Clinton told crowds in West Virginia and Pennsylvania that when their coal-producing economy was destroyed, the government would come in and create a new economy. People are not that stupid, and that comment did not work out well for her.\In our region renewable energy (solar, geothermal, wind and hydroelectric) is a reality. I suggest President Trump, Sen.

84,"Nevada can be a national leader in solar energy, and reap the benefits -- if our representatives support some important bills during this legislative session.\Most of us probably remember the debacle that unfolded at the end of 2015, when the Public Utilities Commission raised the rates on solar energy. That decision temporarily jacked up my energy bill, wiped out the residential solar industry, put several of my friends out of work, and chased some good companies out of Nevada. But let's not rehash that again. Instead, let's look to the future.\AB270 is the bill that could get us back on track by reinstating higher net metering rates. Net metering makes it possible for people to sell power from their panels back to the utility at a profit, meaning they can eventually recoup their investment (solar panels are expensive!) while producing clean energy.\If this bill passes, we'll see an immediate increase in solar jobs in Nevada. The short-term effects will be positive without a doubt, as the residential solar industry recovers. In the long term, I'm sure the net metering discussion isn't over -- but at least we'll be starting with fair, consumer-friendly rates.\Speaking of the long term: AB206 sets a statewide goal of using 80% renewable energy by 2040. Currently, we're at 20% renewable energy, and 90% of that is purchased from out-of-state. A sad state of affairs, considering Nevada is blasted by free solar energy every time the sun shines (which is a lot). AB206 also includes adding rooftop solar to the grid -- another plus for homeowners.\All those changes mean one thing: we need better infrastructure to handle and store energy, so we don't wind up with wild fluctuations in availability (and cost) between daytime and nighttime. That's why SB204 was created to investigate how energy storage systems will work, and come up with a plan.\Between these three bills, Nevada's energy economy stands to receive a huge boost. But it's already booming. Sunshine is Nevada's most abundant natural resource, next to tumbleweeds. Utility-scale solar arrays are popping up everywhere, because it's really a no-brainer. Safe, cheap, ubiquitous power that doesn't need to be shipped, processed, burned or disposed of? Who wouldn't go solar?\With all this opportunity and a pretty low risk, the time to act is right now. We can take the lead, reap the economic benefits and keep our air and water clean. And eventually, we might go from paying for power, to getting paid for it.\Time to make hay while the sun shines. Let's tell our representatives to pass those pro-solar bills, and make Nevada a national leader in solar energy. It's good for the environment, it's good for the economy, and it's the right thing to do.\Jessica Reeder is an author and editor in Northwest Reno.\ONE VIEW\JESSICA REEDER"

Two Republicans are vying for the seat. The race will be decided in the primary since no one from another party filed for the election. The seat currently belongs to Assemblyman Randy Kirner, R-Reno, who declined to seek re-election.\Jason Guinasso, Republican, has never run for office before. He is an attorney by practice, devoting 20 percent of his practice's work pro bono to nonprofits.\One of the most important issues to Guinasso is workforce development, especially with large, high-tech companies like Tesla, Switch, Amazon and Faraday coming into the state. He said many of the social issues he cares about - abortion, domestic violence and poverty - could be alleviated with a robust economy.\""My first priority is to get the economy and jobs straight and everything else that I do will flow from that,"" he said. ""If I had just one term and one thing to task, that's what I would want to have my name attached to because I think it would provide the most opportunities to the most people.""\Organ tissue donation and combating sex-trafficking are other high priorities of Guinasso. He donated a house to Awaken, a local nonprofit that helps victims of sex trafficking.\Guinasso is a supporter of Gov. Brian Sandoval's education tax package and of education funding overall. The governor endorsed Guinasso citing his commitment to education. Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison also endorsed Guinasso.\Guinasso said he was open to considering new revenue if there is a demonstrated need, but added it was prudent to look at the expense side first to ""make sure we're not funding priorities from the '80s and '90s.""\He is the Washoe County chair of Nevadans for Responsible Drug Policy, the organization working against the November ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana. Guinasso also opposes the gun background check ballot initiative.\Lisa Krasner, Republican, is an instructor at Truckee Meadows Community College, teaching courses in the U.S. and Nevada constitutions. She ran for the same seat in 2014, losing to Assemblyman Randy Kirner.\Krasner is vehemently anti-tax, often speaking out against the commerce tax and vowing to work toward its repeal.\""Part of economic development and jobs is creating an environment where there are low taxes and low regulations on our businesses in the state of Nevada,"" she said. ""When there is an economic development where there are low taxes and low regulations on businesses, then businesses can thrive and compete and create jobs for people who want to work.""\Controller Ron Knecht and Treasurer Dan Schwartz, both vocal commerce tax opponents, endorsed Krasner.\Krasner signed the candidate pledge stating she would ""vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes."" The pledge is from Americans for Tax Reform, a national advocacy group that opposes any rise in taxes.\""Well I didn't have to sign it,"" she said. ""No one was forcing me, but the people in my district felt so betrayed by so many of our Republican legislators that said they were going to be no on taxes.""\Despite the pledge, she said she would consider revenue if there was a demonstrated need and the voters in her district supported it.\Krasner sits on the Nevada Commission on Aging. She also considers education one of her core issues and supports school choice and expanding charter schools.\Krasner opposes recreational marijuana. She worked against a proposed dispensary on the corner of Mt. Rose Highway and Thomas Creek Boulevard. She opposes the gun background check ballot initiative.\Assembly District 25\Assembly District 25 includes portions of southwest Reno stretching to the state border, including Verdi. The district runs north and includes the Silver Lake and White Lake area. Four Republicans are running in the primary. The seat previously belonged to Assemblyman Pat Hickey, R-Reno, who left to take a board seat on the Nevada Board of Education.\Kime King, Republican, is a realtor and homeschool advocate who has never run for office.\King was initially running on an anti-commerce tax platform, but said the issue is largely moot at this point after Controller Ron Knecht pronounced the ballot initiative to repeal it dead. She said instead she would work to be vigilant about future tax increases. She signed the pledge vowing never to increase taxes.\She said the education system needed reform, part of the problem being burdensome rules about how and where to educate children.\""One of the greatest things about charter schools is they are not encumbered by some of the rules of buildings and where they can be held like public school is,"" she said. ""But they also have the flexibility that even our private schools haven't had yet of administering education in different formats like online and half-and-half - some online, some in the classroom.""\She is generally against tax abatement packages like the one meant to lure Tesla to the state. She thinks companies who do get tax breaks need to pay for infrastructure upgrades made necessary by an influx of population.\""I love Reno,"" she said. ""If anyone wants to come to Reno, they should pay the same taxes I have to pay. I should not have to pay or give a tax incentive for someone to come to my favorite place in the entire nation.""\She said she likely won't vote on the recreational marijuana ballot initiative and planned to not intervene with whatever the voters decided. She opposes the gun background check ballot initiative.\Jill Tolles, Republican, is an instructor at the University of Nevada, Reno. She teaches courses in communication and has never run for office before.\Tolles said her primary concern is workforce development and making sure Nevadans were properly educated for jobs in new private sectors in the state.\""Some of the things I'm looking at are occupational licensing and pre-seed capital for entrepreneurs who are inventing a prototype at the pre-prototype stage,"" she said.\She said she is also focused on supporting home-grown entrepreneurs in the state in conjunction with luring large firms like Tesla and Switch. She said tax abatements have a ""place in the conversation.""\""I'd like to see how we can really align our education system with emerging industries,"" she said. ""We're moving beyond just gaming and mining. We're diversifying to other industries like advanced manufacturing, logistics and aerospace.""\Tolles has not indicated whether or not she would have voted for the commerce tax, but has said she is against its repeal.\Tolles has also done pro bono lobbying work in Carson City and sat on a child abuse prevention task force. She said she would like to continue working on the issue, finding ways to address it in the medical community.\""I'd like to see how we can engage the medical community by continuing (education) requirements for pediatricians and nurses, looking at ways we can continue to address sex trafficking issues in our state,"" she said.\She is opposed to the recreational marijuana and gun background check ballot initiatives.\Jennifer Terhune, Republican, is a dental hygienist who has never run for office before. She is the daughter of conservative activist Wayne Terhune.\Terhune's main campaign issue has been the repeal of the commerce tax. She admitted this was unlikely, but said there are other avenues to decrease the tax burden on Nevadans.\""I would like to do a tax holiday,"" she said. ""There's one they do in Texas for people heading back to school and there's certain items that are tax free if they're back-to-school. That's a tax holiday that I think would help all Nevadans as they're getting ready to head back to school.""\Terhune said she was looking at how to streamline Nevada tax code, but did not provide specifics. She signed the pledge vowing never to increase taxes.\She said the state should eliminate what she described as excessive fees and regulations by the government. She cited the fee on new tires as an example, but did not give an example of a regulation.\""I'm not really prepared at this point to say one specifically that I would get rid of, but it's sort of an overall philosophy,"" she said. ""I think you have to look at each specifically and weigh them one-by-one and see if the cost outweighs the benefit.""\Terhune is one of the few Republican candidates who openly supports the recreational marijuana ballot initiative.\""I'm glad that is going to be decided by the voters because that's who should decide it,"" she said.\She is a supporter of concealed carry on college campuses and said she wants to introduce the bill if elected. She is opposed to the gun background check ballot initiative.\Terhune also said she wants to eliminate the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, with an end goal of getting Nevada entirely out of President Barack Obama's health care law.\Clint Jamison, Republican, did not respond to multiple requests for an interview.\Assembly District 40\Assembly District 40 includes the majority of Carson City and Washoe Valley. It is the only legislative race in Northern Nevada where an incumbent faces a primary challenge, with three challengers to Assemblyman P.K. O'Neill.\P.K. O'Neill, Republican, is a freshman assemblyman from Carson City and a former law enforcement official.\O'Neill voted for Gov. Brian Sandoval's education tax package in the 2015 Legislature. Sandoval endorsed him this year.\He said one of the foremost issues before the upcoming Legislature is to revisit the education plan and tweak it as necessary.\Part of that, he said, involves auditing how the money was distributed and used. He said those audits would provide a clearer picture of areas of need.\O'Neill also said he wanted to address community college funding, which has required temporary appropriations in recent years. He said the role of community colleges has changed to include technical programs while the funding formula has remained geared toward moving students on the four-year institutions.\""They have a vital position both in the education and delivering support in expanding our economy,"" he said. ""I want to make sure their funding is appropriate.""\O'Neill said he wanted to make it easier for veterans to transfer skills from the armed forces to the civilian workforce.\O'Neill also said one of the major issues that needs addressing in 2017 is the solar net-metering issue. He said he does not have a full-on solution as of now, but wants to hear from all sides as well as the New Energy Task Force and bring other forms of green energy into the discussion such as geothermal and wind.\He is opposed to the gun background check ballot initiative and the recreational marijuana ballot initiative.\Al Kramer, Republican, was the treasurer of Carson City for 20 years.\Kramer said he decided to run after being upset with O'Neill's vote on the commerce tax. He signed the pledge vowing never to increase taxes.\""That tax is over the top and it kind of changed the environment for Nevada to where we stopped being business friendly,"" he said. ""That's a reputation that's very hard to get and it seems we're on the tipping point of losing that reputation.""\Kramer said it was unlikely the tax would be repealed, but said it was pertinent for Republicans to ""not let the creeping taxes come in"" and ""ensure they don't get more onerous on Nevada businesses.""\Kramer said he also wanted to expand healthcare access to veterans as well as create an incentive program for businesses to hire them.\He also said the open meetings law and public records requests should apply more broadly to legislators, including their emails and public schedules. He said personal conversations should be redacted, but the public should be able to find out about communications related to the job.\""You never find out who they were talking to in their offices,"" he said. ""Seems to me like the public has the right to now.""\Kramer is against the recreational marijuana ballot initiative, but said he was keeping an open mind about legalization in general. He said he wanted to observe Colorado and Washington's recreational program to see if legislation should be passed instead of a ballot initiative.\""At heart, I'm kind of a libertarian,"" he said. ""I don't see marijuana, in a lot of respects, worse than alcohol. There are some people I respect who tell me it's a gateway drug, and I'm a little concerned about keeping it out of the hands of people who shouldn't have it.""\He is opposed to the gun background check ballot initiative.\Sam England, Republican, is a veteran and physician's assistant. He has never run for office before.\England's main election issue has been the repeal of the commerce tax, which he said was excessive and did not address the structural issues in education.\""We have to bring accountability to where the money is going,"" he said. ""The school districts would actually have enough money and facilities if it had not been squandered. We need to go line-by-line to figure out where the money isn't going.""\England said schools should cut down on administration and what he described as excessive programs. He cited the anti-bullying law signed in 2015, which provided $16 million for social workers in schools, as an example of an excessive program.\""We're all against bullying, but I don't think we can fix a moral issue with money,"" he said.\England also said he wants to expand healthcare access and ease wait times for emergency care. He said the state should do this by incentivizing primary care doctors to take Medicaid.\""We need to shift this population (that uses emergency care) into primary care,"" he said. ""Family care doctors are incredibly good at treating chronic disease. ERs are not.""\England said campus carry was another important issue for him and said lawmakers lacked the ""political will"" to call it for a vote in 2015. He is against the gun background check ballot initiative.\England said he is voting against the recreational marijuana ballot initiative, but supports it being decided by a popular vote.\Assemblyman Ira Hansen, R-Sparks, is backing England against incumbent Assemblyman P.K. O'Neill, R-Carson City. Hansen was an outspoken opponent of the commerce tax while O'Neill voted in favor.\Chris Forbush, Republican, declined several requests for a phone interview.\Senate District 13\Senate District 13 includes downtown Reno and Sparks. It encompasses Assembly Districts 24 and 30 currently occupied by Democrats Amber Joiner and Mike Sprinkle, respectively. The seat previously belonged to Sen. Debbie Smith, D-Sparks, who died in February after a battle with brain cancer.\Kent Bailey, Republican, is a telecommuter worker for Motorola.\Bailey is a supporter of Gov. Brian Sandoval's education tax plan and also supports the Washoe County sales tax referendum to pay for school infrastructure. He said if Nevada plans to attract upwards of more than 50,000 new jobs to the area, the education system needs to be radically improved.\""I'm not a tax proponent at all,"" he said. ""I think that's kind of why I consider myself fiscally conservative. But I'm also a realist to know that sometimes we have to put on our big boy pants and make hard choices.""\Bailey said the education system needs reform to address issues such as class size. He said he wants to audit education funding to make sure money makes its way to classrooms.\""I'd like to discuss the possibilities of let's audit education funding, let's make sure we're putting our financial priorities where they need to be in and, in my opinion, that's the classroom,"" he said. ""We need to make sure we're giving the teachers the resources they need.""\He said he wanted his first bill to address a specific issue pertaining to veterans, particularly those who have been the victim of sexual abuse. Veterans who end up as victims often have to attend mandatory counseling and he wants to pass a bill ensuring they are not discriminated against for things like jobs and concealed carry permits.\Bailey is also in favor of law enforcement and drug policy reform in the state, preferring a rehabilitation-first model rather than incarceration, he said. Bailey is married to a rehabilitation services specialist.\He said he is against the recreational marijuana ballot initiative because he doesn't believe in legislating at the state level via initiative, but would consider a bill to the same effect.\He is against the gun background check ballot initiative.\Samantha Brockelsby, Republican, is the owner of Weathervane Auctions in Sparks. She has never run for office before.\Brockelsby is an anti-tax candidate whose main plank is repealing the commerce tax. She said its effect on the state could lead to near-apocalyptic results for Nevada's economy.\""Right now we have small businesses and medium-sized businesses that are being crushed by this tax and will continue to be crushed over the next several years,"" she said. ""I foresee a falling out of lots of businesses. With the falling out of businesses, we're going to have higher unemployment and job losses.""\She said it was unlikely the tax would be fully repealed, but hoped portions could be rescinded.\Besides the commerce tax, Brockelsby said she was concerned with the security and safety of Nevada.\""We have, it seems, a lot of terrorist-like people milling around and we don't have the ability to do proper background checks on foreigners who are coming in on either visas or migrants who migrated here,"" she said. ""They're migrants who migrated here, they're fleeing from some other country. We don't have that ability to do that. I think that we should have some kind of a check in place to be able to do a background check and I don't think that's readily available. So I think we should be weary right now.""\When asked what she would do at the state level since the federal level handles most background checks with immigrants, Brockelsby said she would fight for expanded gun rights, including advocating for campus carry.\""Well, I would support our Second Amendment rights for our own citizens to be able to protect their own property, businesses, their children,"" she said. ""If I can't do anything in the legislation (sic), then I would be able to help protect gun owners' rights and the individuals' rights to protect themselves as well.""\She is against the gun background check ballot initiative and the recreational marijuana initiative.\Senate District 15\Senate District 15 includes portions of southwest, west and north Reno including Verdi and Sun Valley. It encompasses Assembly Districts 25 and 27. Assembly District 25 is currently vacant while Assembly District 27 is held by Democrat Teresa Benitez-Thompson, D-Reno.\Heidi Gansert, Republican, is the former Nevada Assembly minority leader and chief-of-staff to Gov. Brian Sandoval. She is currently the director of external relations at the University of Nevada, Reno.\Gansert said one of the most important - and least talked about - issues this election cycle is healthcare access.\""Our Medicaid rolls - the number of people who are enrolled - has gone from about 300,000 to 600,000,"" she said. ""If you were to look at the emergency department at Renown, they used to see about 180 to 200 patients a day and now they're peaking at 350. Part of the reason is because there's not enough access in the community.""\She said the state needs to find more providers via the medical school at UNR and residency programs. She said mental health needed an overhaul so people get proper treatment instead of being treated in emergency rooms or ending up jail.\Gansert said workforce development is also pivotal for next session, especially with large, high-tech companies coming into the state.\""This community - the Reno-Sparks-Truckee Meadows community - is growing and the employer base is becoming more tech-oriented,"" she said. ""We have to have a highly-educated workforce to meet the demands of those businesses.""\She has not said whether or not she would have voted for Gov. Brian Sandoval's education tax plan, but is against its repeal because it would disproportionately affect education.\Gansert does not support the recreational marijuana or gun background check ballot initiatives.\Eugene Hoover, Republican, is a small business owner who has never run for public office.\Hoover has largely run on an anti-commerce tax platform, which he said could strangle small businesses. He is generally open to new revenue, but only as a last resort after reorganization and reform.\Creating a business-friendly environment was paramount to the future of Nevada, he said.\He said education needs reform, but wanted to focus on structural changes like curriculum and administrative pay.\""I've talked to many teachers walking door-to-door asking for votes, and I can tell you by and large, the teachers are not happy,"" he said. ""And they're not happy because they're being forced to teach to children how to take a test instead of two plus two equals four.""\One of the most important issues to Hoover is the Second Amendment. He opposes the gun background check ballot initiative and supports campus carry.\He is personally against recreational marijuana, but said it should be left up to the will of the voters and he would respect their wishes.\Hoover said the transgender bathroom issue that's made headlines as of late is an example of ""catering to the one percent instead of the 99 percent."" One option, he said, is to move to singular, unisex bathrooms in schools and public places or to require bathroom usage based on birth sex.\""I would say that however your plumbing is, that's the restroom you use,"" he said. ""You get your plumbing changed, well then you can use the different bathroom. But whatever your plumbing is, that's the bathroom you use."""
87," To the editor:\ The Nevada Conservation League, a statewide, nonpartisan conservation organization founded in 2001, released its first conservation scorecard evaluating state legislators. Your editorial on April 23, ""Free markets ignored again"" had little to do with the Nevada Conservation League and was simply a tirade on taxes.\ The Nevada Conservation League is not affiliated with any political party. We support any elected official, regardless of party affiliation, whose voting record and actions support a clean healthy environment.\ Your editorial led one to believe that our scorecard was about ""high taxes and heavy handed government regulation."" This is simply not true. While the Nevada Conservation League monitored the budget on conservation projects such as the preservation on Lake Tahoe and funding for the fight against the proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain, we chose not to score any of the budget or tax bills given that the legislator's vote could not be directly linked to a clear choice on conservation.\ The 2003 conservation scorecard tracked the voting record of our Nevada state representatives on such issues as renewable energy; regulation of hazardous waste; air quality improvements for Las Vegas and Reno; public transit use of alternative fuels; invasive plant species control, such as tamarisk and Russian thistle; maintaining the rural surroundings of the Red Rock Conservation Are;, and attempts to privatize water in Nevada for profit. We scored bills that tended to offer legislators politically difficult but clear conservation choices on a range of environmental issues.\ Many legislators stood out for their conservation efforts during the 2003 session. Your editorial failed to acknowledge the hard work -- clearly recognized by the Nevada Conservation League as ""Distinguished Deeds"" -- of Republican legislators who went to bat for conservation ethics in Nevada.\ Minority Leader Lynn Hettrick, R-Reno, introduced legislation that now allows energy from small hydropower projects at private residences and on ranches to be bought back by the power companies as part of the net metering program. He was also one of the co- sponsors of Assembly Bill 398, which encourages public/private partnerships to implement energy conservation programs in public buildings.\ State Sen. Warren Hardy, R-Las Vegas, blew the whistle on a bill which proved to be a sweetheart deal for Vidler Water Co. to form public/private partnerships with every county except Clark to privatize the development and sale of Nevada's water. This would set a dangerous precedent, as private companies are not accountable to the public and would be in a position to sell water out of state or to the highest bidder rather than seeking the best use for the residents of Nevada.\ Assemblyman Jason Geddes, R-Reno, a freshman legislator, demonstrated political savvy and scientific expertise in the areas of air quality and energy conservation by introducing and passing progressive bills on both issues.\ For several decades, our beautiful state has grown faster than any other in the country. In many ways, this growth has created the attractive lifestyle that draws more residents to the Silver State every year. But with that growth come the responsibility of managing its impacts to our water quality, our air quality and our cultural and natural resources.\ Unfortunately, there are legislators who are not paying attention to the environmental concerns of Nevada voters. That's why we want Nevadans to ""know the score.""\ The Nevada Conservation League is proud to act as watchdog for state elected officials in their actions to preserve and protect Nevada's water, air and lands.\ GRACE POTORTI\ RENO\ The writer is executive director of the Nevada Conservation League (www.nevadaconservationleague.org)."
88,"By JOHN G. EDWARDS\REVIEW-JOURNAL\The electric company, which for several years has provided financial incentives to homeowners who install solar power systems, will start doing the same for home wind turbines in a few days.\Nevada Power Co. of Las Vegas and affiliate Sierra Pacific Power Co. of Reno are offering rebates of $2.50 per watt for wind turbines, based on the turbine's electricity production capacity. The maximum rebate for each customer would be $25,000.\Wind systems that generate more than 10,000 watts of power qualify for a $1.50 per watt rebate, but most home wind turbines will be smaller and will qualify for the $2.50 rebate.\Wind turbines can be used to generate electricity at homes, businesses, farms, schools and public buildings.\""I believe (wind turbines) will get pretty popular,"" said John Hargrove, RenewableGenerations program manager for the two electric companies. ""People want choice. They want the opportunity to be as green as they can.""\""I believe it will be a slow start and then (wind energy) will take off,"" said Jason Geddes, a Reno city official and member of the Nevada Renewable Energy Task Force.\The question is whether wind turbines will be permitted in many urban locations and whether they are economically viable in Southern Nevada. Experts are divided on those questions.\Clark County allows wind turbines in all zones, said Dan Kulin, a county spokesman.\The Las Vegas City Council in January 2007 approved small wind turbines in some residential zoning districts, but some homeowner associations may object, particularly if the wind turbine reaches high in the air or is noisy. Reno also has adopted a wind turbine ordinance, and Washoe County is reviewing a draft of a wind turbine ordinance.\""Wind turbines still don't make a whole lot of sense in an urban or suburban environment,"" said Chris Brooks, director of renewable energy at Bombard Electric. \The wind generally doesn't blow consistently enough in Southern Nevada to make wind power economically feasible, Brooks said.\Bombard typically wants a wind turbine to reach 30 feet high and to have no obstacles within a 300-foot radius, which eliminates many urban sites, Brooks said.\Mike Hess, chief executive officer of Mariah Power, a Reno-based wind turbine maker, disagreed with Brooks. A wind turbine fed by 12 mph average wind will pay back the initial cost in 10 years without a rebate, Hess said.\Hess said his company offers a 1,200-watt wind turbine that costs $5,000 and works well with winds averaging 12 mph.\Mariah Power also sells an $8,000 unit that works with average wind speeds of 8 mph, he added.\Customers can visit www.mariahpower.com for information about the company's wind turbines.\Before selling a wind turbine to a customer, Mariah Power looks at satellite pictures to determine whether the person's site is in a ZIP code with satisfactory wind power, Hess said.\The company also can install an anemometer to test a specific location for wind, Hess said.\Mariah Power has arrangements with companies that will install wind turbines for customers in Southern Nevada.\Hess ultimately hopes to get approval to put wind turbines on street lights.\Meanwhile, rural areas and public buildings, including schools, may make better sites for wind turbines than densely populated residential neighborhoods.\As required by new state law, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power are continuing their solar power rebate programs. The utilities will start taking applications for wind and solar projects at 10 a.m. Sept. 4.\The companies also are accepting applications for rebates on hydroelectric power projects on farms and ranches. Few, if any, customers are expected to have opportunities for water power in Southern Nevada.\Hargrove recommends that interested customers apply as soon as possible for wind and solar rebates because the maximum amount of solar power rebates goes quickly, often in the first day.\The rebates alone will cost Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power up to $23.3 million, depending on the number of applicants.\Homeowners can apply for rebates at www.solargenerations.com, but Brooks recommends that they go through an electrical contracting firm like his, which is accustomed to answering technical questions.\Customers with solar panels and wind turbines qualify for net-metering provisions. That means they get credit for each kilowatt hour of excess electricity that they feed into the electrical grid.\Contact reporter John G. Edwards at jedwards@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0420."
89,"rhagar@rgj.com\The four Republicans running in state Senate District 4 agree on one thing, that lawmakers should not renew the nearly $1 billion in tax increases approved by the 2009 Legislature.\Renewing the taxes will be one of the first battles of the 2011 session. Each candidate has other ideas on how to help the state's struggling economy.\Although the state faces a deficit projected at more than $3 billion, Todd ""Taxpayer"" Bailey wants the state's Modified Business Tax eliminated.\""No. 1, eliminate the payroll tax,"" Bailey, 45, said. ""The payroll tax is inherently unfair because some of the highest-paid employees in the state of Nevada do not pay the payroll tax. The payroll tax is not paid by any public employees and some of the highest-paid employees are public employees.\""If we want to talk about broadening the tax base, we need to broaden the payroll tax or get rid of it. It is not fair. It creates a skewed employment market place that is absolutely unfair and ineffective.""\Bailey also wants Nevada to build an energy park, push for more manufacturing industries and move toward unlimited net-metered bill for electricity.\""Taxes are a big thing but one of the barriers to a big manufacturing facility in Nevada is the cost of electricity and to getting the power out to where ever the location is,"" Bailey said.\Frank Wright of Incline Village wants to return state government to the level of 2000. Many Republicans have contended that state government grew too large in the last decade.\""We need to streamline government and take out the fluff we have been adding for the past 10 years,"" Wright, 61, said. ""It was much more efficient 10 years ago and I think we need to take a look at that.""\Wright, an author and former teacher, wants parents to take more responsibility to help improve the education system.\""Parents should not be allowed to let their kids drop out of school without being taxed or penalized, to encourage them to keep their kids in school,"" Wright said. ""Schools should allow nothing but graduation. Also maybe we should have a state law that says you can't leave school until you are 18 under any condition and that would stop the dropout rate right away.""\Cobb is the only Senate candidate with legislative experience, serving two terms in the Assembly. In that time, Cobb said he has been fighting for many of the issues that are dear to Republicans, including immigration reform.\""I've sponsored many bills that have become GOP talking points, including putting Yucca Mountain to use, reforming the PERS (Public Employee Retirement Fund), reforming the educational system,"" Cobb said.\""When I voted against the largest tax increase in Nevada history last session, I predicted that we would have higher unemployment because of it and sure enough, the unemployment rate has gone up several points since then. So for us to think we can raise taxes and somehow turn the economy around, is foolish.""\If elected, Cobb see a clear path: ""First of all, do no harm to the economy. If we continue to raise taxes, we will continue to lose jobs.""\Kieckhefer, 33, would work to push growth for businesses, which would include keeping Nevada a tax-friendly state for businesses.\""One thing we need to do to spur job growth and bring new businesses into Nevada is think outside of just California. We need to reach internationally and focus on some of those companies that are creating a lot of the components for renewable energy that we are trying to lure into this state, the wind turbines, the solar cells,"" Kieckhefer said.\""Especially in Northern Nevada, along the I-80 corridor, we have geothermal resources available to us,"" he said.\""And coupled with the key transportation corridors of I-80 and the railroad right there, we have the ability to market Northern Nevada as a prime place to manufacture those components that will be used throughout the western United States and the United States as a whole.""\FIVE QUESTIONS\Todd ""Taxpayer"" Bailey\1. Nearly $700 million in increased sales, payroll and business license taxes will expire in 2011. Would you vote to extend those increases?\""No. Taxpayers in Senate District 4 have lost their jobs and businesses and have had to tap into their savings and their children's future. They cannot afford that tax increase. They could not afford it in 2009 and can't afford it in 2011. The answer to this problem is the expediential creation of jobs and that should be the No. 1 job of the Nevada Legislature in 2011, creating an environment to create many, many new jobs.\2. The state is expected to face a nearly $3 billion revenue shortfall in 2011. How would you propose addressing this problem? What would you cut and/or how would you raise revenue?\""Depending on the economy, the shortfall could be $4 billion. Very tough decisions need to be made. We need to eliminate the payroll tax so that everybody in the United States and in the world who is thinking of moving to Nevada will know Nevada is serious about creating an environment that creates many, many new jobs. That is how we solve this problem. If the solution can't be found there, we'll have the continued discussions about fewer and fewer resources. Now that is a discussion I am prepared to have but that is not the discussion I want to have. But I am prepared for it. I am prepared to make the tough decisions.""\3. Does the state need to reform its basic revenue structure? What ideas do you have to do that?\""Reforming the revenue structure often means higher taxes when it comes out of the mouth of a politician. The area that needs the most attention is reform of the current taxes that we have, property tax being No. 1. That will require a vote of the people to change the constitution and I will work to give the people of Nevada that opportunity. if there is going to be a solution that requires new revenue, the people of Nevada should have their voices heard, not just the voices in the Nevada Legislature. I trust the people of Nevada to make the decisions that are best for the people of Nevada. I will work to give them that opportunity.""\4. Nevada has consistently ranked poorly in education indicators. How would you improve the quality of the state's education system?\""There are many, many things that can be done to change polices at the Legislature that will improve education in Nevada and make it more effective that are revenue neutral. The way we measure how successful our education system in Nevada is broken. You have to look at it a lot more specifically, you have to look at the individual groups in the school system to make a determination of who is being successful. The education system in Nevada should not be the one-stop shop to cure every social problem in our community. However, that is the responsibility we have placed on it and that needs to change.""\5. Nevada's economy has suffered more than most states in the current recession. What would you do to spur job creation, address the housing crisis and otherwise stabilize our troubled economy?\""No. 1, eliminate the payroll tax. The payroll tax is inherently unfair because some of the highest-paid employees in the state of Nevada do not pay the payroll tax. The payroll tax is not paid by any public employees and some of the highest-paid employees are public employees. If we want to talk about broadening the tax base, we need to broaden the payroll tax or get rid of it. It is not fair. It creates a skewed employment market place that is absolutely unfair and ineffective.""\""No. 2, build a Nevada energy park and everything that goes with it. Nuclear reprocessing, big time research in that area, big time research in renewable energy, that is what gets the universities focused on a growth sector. The third part is really go after manufacturing. Manufacturing is where Nevada is weak, in terms of a broad economy. We need manufacturing.\""No. 4 is unlimited-net metering for electricity. I want to turn every property owner into a power generator. Right now we don't have unlimited-net metered billing for electricity. There are some technical difficulties with that but we can overcome them. That will provide some incentive for every commercial property owned and every home owner to use something, be it wind or solar, to get that power meter to work in the other direction. Nevada could start exporting energy instead of importing energy. We can bring down the cost of energy. Taxes are a big thing but one of the barriers to a big manufacturing facility in Nevada is the cost of electricity and to get the power out to where ever their location is. If we have unlimited-net metred billing, that will really help that problem.""\TY COBB\1. Nearly $700 million in increased sales, payroll and business license taxes will expire in 2011. Would you vote to extend those increases?\""I voted against that tax hike in the last legislative session. That is one of the things that differentiates me from my opponents. I have held the line on taxes and will continue to do so to get this economy turned around. I have said that those tax increases would be job killers and believe I was right, because the unemployment rate has gone up several points since. It is foolish to think that we can tax ourselves into prosperity in the future.""\2. The state is expected to face a nearly $3 billion revenue shortfall in 2011. How would you propose addressing this problem? What would you cut and/or how would you raise revenue?\""We need to do what every private-sector business and family are doing and that is to cut back and live within their means. In my private sector job, I am part of a management team that has seen a decrease of about 30 percent in revenue and we are still breaking even as a company. If the private sector can do it, the government can do it. It is a matter of the desire to do so, not the ability.\""In terms of specifics, we need to implement some of the institutional reforms that have been ignored by the Democrat leadership, including the PERS reform, the reform of our education system to allow for greater competition and we need to prohibit state benefits for illegal immigrants. We also need to have serious consideration of the future of Yucca Mountain as a new revenue source for the state, as opposed to our blind opposition of the past. I was one of the people who encouraged Gov. Gibbons to establish the SAGE Commission back in 2007. The SAGE Commission responded with some very solid ideas and almost none of them were installed last session. They amount to multi-million dollar savings over the years and those proposals need to considered and implemented.""\3. Does the state need to reform its basic revenue structure? What ideas do you have to do that?\""Any state in this current economy is facing a budget shortfall, so it is kind of a red herring to suggest that our structure is somehow unique in the deficit we have been running. The worst thing we can do now is increase taxes and expect to tax ourselves back into prosperity. We need to cut back like every private sector individual is doing and prioritize our spending as best as possible to prevent job-killing tax increases.""\4. Nevada has consistently ranked poorly in education indicators. How would you improve the quality of the state's education system?\""In the special session, we heard testimony from superintendents and school board members and they said we have had education reform, including pay for performance (for teachers) and things like that. And in our discussion I said that is fine if you want to consider pay-for-performance but it is not true reform. True reform not only has the carrot on one end of the stick but it also the stick on the other end. Right now, we keep dumping money into pay increases, in to benefit increases and bonuses without any type of accountability on the other end. What is lacking in the Nevada education system is any kind of accountability. I would require that, as part of an overall education reform package, that would also include the greater flexibility for charter schools and vouchers for underprivileged kids.""\5. Nevada's economy has suffered more than most states in the current recession. What would you do to spur job creation, address the housing crisis and otherwise stabilize our troubled economy?\""First of all, do no harm to the economy. If we continue to raise taxes, we will continue to lose jobs. When I voted against the largest tax increase in Nevada history last session, I predicted that we would have higher unemployment because of it and sure enough, the unemployment rate has gone up several points since then. So for us to think we can raise taxes and somehow turn the economy around, is foolish. What we need to do is focus on institutional reforms that will save us money in the short term and the long term as well as short-term budget cuts so we can make sure that the money is in the private sector, creating jobs. When I go knock on doors and talk to people, rarely do I hear people say hey, take more of my money into the government sector. Instead they say that I have been out of work for a year or my child has been out of work for months and they just want a job. And if you put more money into the private sector, you are going to turn this economy around and everyone is going to benefit from it.""\BEN KIECKHEFER\1. Nearly $700 million in increased sales, payroll and business license taxes will expire in 2011. Would you vote to extend those increases?\I don't support extending those tax increases as we go into the next legislative session. We need to be stimulating business growth and not hindering it and I believe that payroll has a significant impact on a company's ability to hire people out of this recession.""\2. The state is expected to face a nearly $3 billion revenue shortfall in 2011. How would you propose addressing this problem? What would you cut and/or how would you raise revenue?\""First and foremost, we need to prioritize what we do as a government. The executive branch is currently undertaking an effort to look at that and I support that effort to really review all of our services that are provided by the state and evaluate which ones we deem the most important and fund those first.\""Secondly, one of the things I would like to focus on is the programs we are subsidizing out of the general fund that should not be funded by those general fund dollars. One of the examples is the Millennium Scholarship Program. That was a program that was set up to be funded by the tobacco settlement. When those funds started coming in short as to what is needed to maintain the scholarship program we ended up dumping millions of dollars form the state's general fund into the Millennium Scholarship Fund. Those dollar are being taken away from K-12 education, those are dollars that are being taken away from public safety and services that could be used more for the core functions of government.\""It (Millennium Scholarship Program) served a purpose. And with the shortcomings of the program overall, I would prefer a much broader overhaul of the program. We should really convert it into a revolving loan fund instead of a grant program. That way, it will become self-sustaining and it will extend the life of the program so we can help more people over the long haul.""\3. Does the state need to reform its basic revenue structure? What ideas do you have to do that?\""Like most states in the country, we are in a recession right now. So to suggest the shortfalls of our current revenue are based on our tax structure, ignores the broader picture of what is happening nationally and globally.""\4. Nevada has consistently ranked poorly in education indicators. How would you improve the quality of the state's education system?\""First and foremost, the state needs to create more accountability within the system. I support the empowerment model, including giving greater decision making authority over funding to the individual schools. Secondly, we need to take back some of the power that has been turned over to the teachers union. We need to keep in mind what the purpose of the teachers union is. And that is to protect the salaries and the benefits of its members, the teachers and not the school children. So when we are taking our advice on how to educate from teachers, from the union, the union is there to protect the teachers and not the kids. That is not to disparage teachers. My mom was a teacher and I have a great amount of respect for what they do. But we need to keep our eye on where we are getting our advice all of the time.\""We also need to prepare people so they are ready for the work place. I am a strong supporter for career and technical education.""\5. Nevada's economy has suffered more than most states in the current recession. What would you do to spur job creation, address the housing crisis and otherwise stabilize our troubled economy?\""One thing we need to do to spur job growth and bring new businesses into Nevada is think outside of just California. We need to reach internationally and focus on some of those companies that are creating a lot of the components for renewable energy that we are trying to lure into this state, the wind turbines, the solar cells. Especially in Northern Nevada, along the I-80 corridor, we have geothermal resources available to us. And coupled with the key transportation corridors of I-80 and the railroad right there, we have the ability to market Northern Nevada as a prime place to manufacture those components that will be used throughout the western United States and the United States as a whole. We can spearhead that through the lieutenant governor's office and the Commission on Economic Development.""\FRANK WRIGHT\1. Nearly $700 million in increased sales, payroll and business license taxes will expire in 2011. Would you vote to extend those increases?\""No. I think there are other ways to fill the budgets gaps without taxing people who are working more than they are already being taxed. Taking money away from hard-working people is immoral and that needs to sunset.""\2. The state is expected to face a nearly $3 billion revenue shortfall in 2011. How would you propose addressing this problem? What would you cut and/or how would you raise revenue?\""I would immediately want across-the-board budget administrative cuts in the government and I would find ways to cut salaries but not fire people. Taking a salary cut, like the Washoe County teachers have done, is important. I would rather see 1,000 teachers take a 5 percent cut than to fire 50 teachers. I would rather see small cuts in government workers' pay, and pensions, if possible, to keep everybody working and keep the system operating the best it can. We need to streamline government and take out the fluff we have been adding for the past 10 years. It was much more efficient 10 years ago and I think we need to take a look at that. As far as bringing business in, we need to have outside recruitment of businesses. We have to have incentives to bring them here and we have to have an education base that is strong and makes people want to bring their families here. And if we have an educational system that is broken, that is going to be very difficult to do.""\3. Does the state need to reform its basic revenue structure? What ideas do you have to do that?\""Go ahead and have a sales tax on cigarettes, a bigger sales tax on liquor, a bigger sales tax for bigger vehicles that consume extra gas, and if possible, have a gas tax that would make people go to smaller vehicles. Your smog licenses fees, you may be able to increase those by a percentage. There are all kinds of ways of raising revenues that we don't do right now so we won't have to tax the heck out of everybody.""\4. Nevada has consistently ranked poorly in education indicators. How would you improve the quality of the state's education system?\""What they are doing right now is not working. We have a problem. We have hard working families that really can't go to the classroom and follow their kid's academic achievement and they (students) get lost in the shuffle. So we need to go back and have the community part of the school system. We need the parents to become more actively engaged in the class room and by going into the classroom, the parents will be able to witness what their kids are experiencing. The parents need to take control about what is going on with their kids. Parents should not be allowed to let their kid drop out of school without being taxed or penalized, to encourage them to keep their kids in school. Schools should allow nothing but graduation. Also maybe we should have a state law that says you can't leave school until you are 18 under any condition and that would stop the dropout rate right away.""\5. Nevada's economy has suffered more than most states in the current recession. What would you do to spur job creation, address the housing crisis and otherwise stabilize our troubled economy?\""I would suggest some legislative action to try and slow down the foreclosure rates and find ways to restructure loans from the state level. Also, we can't rely any longer on the gaming industry. We have to encourage other industries and other companies to come in. I think we need to create other import-export businesses that produce goods here. We have everything here. We need to fill these empty buildings with industry and technology. We need to sit down with campaigns or committees or delegations to go out and recruit companies to come in here. We should travel to other places to find out what is working. We have to look at ways to change what we are doing and not just sit around and talk about it.""\Biographies\TODD ""TAXPAYER"" BAILEY\Age: 45\Home: Reno\Family: Engaged; two children\Occupation: Businessman involved in iPhone application development, real estate and strategic planning.\Education: High school graduate, has taken classes at Truckee Meadows Community College and the University of Nevada, Reno and has focused on speech communication and digital media.\Political experience: Board member of Sierra Nevada Community Access Television 1996-99.\TY COBB\Age: 34\Home: Reno\Occupation: Lawyer for Jensen Precast\Education: Law degree from McGeorge School of Law\Family: Divorced; one daughter\Political experience: Two-term assemblyman from Reno\BEN KIECKHEFER\Age: 33\Home: Reno\Occupation: Public information officer for the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services\Family: Married, wife April; two sets of twins, ages 4 and 1\Political experience: First campaign\Education: Master's degree in public-affairs report from the University of Illinois-Springfleid, 2001\FRANK WRIGHT\Age: 61\Home: Incline Village\Family: Married to Lisa; five children\Occupation: Retired teacher and author\Eduction: Two masters degree, history/government and administration\Political experience: Former candidate for Incline Village board of trustees"
90,"rps nevada master planned communitiy photo color john gurzinski debra bass\By Debra D. Bass\Review-Journal\Master-planned communities have houses and schools, roads and parks, shopping centers and pervasive landscaping.\The concept of master-planned apartments for low-income families, on the the other hand, doesn't have quite the same majestic ring to it.\But maybe it should.\Affordable, well-designed, attractive facilities that look as if they were plucked from the burgeoning communities on the fringes of the city, complete with hot tubs, pools, fitness classes, and programs to provide food, jobs and safe neighborhoods for tenants, have become a part of Las Vegas.\""I was discouraged by the best. Behind closed doors, people told me, 'You'll never do this ... You'll never get money ... No one cares about low-income families,'"" said Arnold Stalk as he explained that his company has $50 million worth of construction projects catering to low-income families under development in Clark County.\Stalk, an architect with more than 23 years' experience, said he didn't understand why affordable housing had to look like cheap housing - cinder block buildings with brown lawns, painted in drab green and characterized by dilapidation. He didn't understand why the presumption of apathy was used to justify the poor conditions residents endured.\""I wanted to create places where people could live in dignity,"" he said.\Stalk's development company, RPS Nevada, creates what he calls ""master-planned affordable housing."" The for-profit company relies on a nonprofit corporation, Angels in the Community, to help make this possible. Stalk, RPS's vice president, doubles as the founder and president of Angels.\By teaming nonprofits with social service agencies and private banking institutions, low-income master planning strives to create islands of stability in aging neighborhoods plagued by the downward spiral of poverty.\Banks offer low interest rates, nonprofits provide volunteers and staff, and social service agencies chip in with programs and grant money.\This symbiotic relationship is turning heads at 121 N. 15th St., where residents can't remember the slum that once stood at the site now transformed into the $4 million Fremont Villas YMCA Neighborhood Center.\""I've lived in the area for the past four years. I moved in as soon as I saw the YMCA sign go up. I thought what a wonderful idea, it was the perfect place for it, where people really need it,"" said Danita Strode-Britt, who smiles in wonder when asked about the structure that stood on the plot of land before the center and can't recall what preceded the year-old center.\The facility, on which cinder block duplexes sometimes used as houses of prostitution once stood, offers food supplied by a local supermarket to residents two days a week, holds after-school programs, organizes cultural excursions and provides fitness classes, money management programs, sports and civic leadership courses.\After six months of volunteering in the center's office, Strode- Britt applied and was appointed site director in December.\""It feels so good to be involved in helping bring up people everyone else thought were hopeless,"" she said.\The efforts will likely take some time to catch on. The Fremont residents association planned to rally in the streets March 1 to warn away drug dealers and prostitutes who blatantly walk the area's streets.\""These are every day, hard-working people who are tired of living in an environment dictating to them what they must accept. They are sending out a message to draw the attention of undesirables that there are people in the community that care about their environment and are watching them,"" said Earl White, an RPS neighborhood enrichment housing coordinator.\Stalk supported the movement.\""People talk about ring-around-the-valley projects and containing growth and this and that, but the heart of the city is in the center and we have to take care of it,"" he said of inner-city areas that middle-class families are vacating en masse, driving property values down and making room for communities of people who can't afford to leave.\The March 1 protest drew only a handful of residents from the Neighborhood Watch program and their children - not enough to rally, only enough to realize that ""taking back their streets"" will take some time.\Angels in the Community was instrumental in designing the Mobilized Assistance and Shelter for the Homeless (MASH) and is coordinating the Shade Tree Shelter Capital Campaign.\Stalk, one of four Angels board members, said his group believes that the shelters were the first step and low-income housing was the logical next step.\He turned a phrase with the African adage used by Hillary Clinton in her book, ""It takes a village to raise a child.""\""I'd like to write a book titled, 'It takes a home ...'"" Stalk said.\""We call it master-planned because these places have a social infrastructure of their own. It's like a small village - not just plunking down apartments,"" he said.\The Fremont center and other RPS facilities being planned house programs of the YMCA, Boys & Girls Club of Las Vegas, and Women, Infant and Children medical program. The state Housing Division provides an attractive tax credit. And it has a residence council that organizes activities.\RPS will open Judith Villas, at 711 Nelson St., on Friday.\Like Fremont Villas, it will offer after-school tutoring, monthly on-site medical services, swimming courses, employment referrals, job skill classes and parenting workshops. The services are also available to neighborhood residents living outside the complex.\Stalk said his group is concentrating on building developments, including child care and YMCA centers, in seven low-income neighborhoods. Four projects are up and running; six are in construction or planning phases."

At Patagonia, we believe businesses have a unique opportunity to be a part of the solution in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Since our founding more than 40 years ago, Patagonia has actively engaged in efforts to protect and preserve the environment by committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, defend clean air and water and invest in clean technologies. Our commitment to these values is not what we do after hours — it is the reason we are in business and part of our everyday work.\Following Gov. Sandoval's veto of a proposed increase to the state's renewable portfolio standard (RPS), Nevada must double down to create a prosperous clean energy future. Patagonia believes the advancement of clean energy plays an essential role in our commitment to create a sustainable future for people, the outdoors and our bottom line. A stronger RPS will drive clean energy investment in Nevada — strengthening our economy and creating local jobs.\Clean energy has a major role in the upcoming election. As Nevadans head to the polls this November, they will have the opportunity to weigh in on a proposal to increase Nevada's RPS to 50 percent by 2030. For this to become law, voters must approve it in two consecutive elections, this year and in 2020. During this time, state lawmakers also will have an opportunity to increase the RPS through legislative action.\At Patagonia, we strive to reduce our impact on the environment in all aspects of our business. Our commitment to sustainability is not only something that our customers value, it also benefits our bottom line. For example, during 2017, we generated 120,440 kWh of on-site renewable energy at our offices in Ventura, California, and at our Reno Service Center. Through our Tin Shed Ventures Fund we have also invested in two residential solar funds, the most recent of which generates over 6,000,000 kWh per year. Nevada businesses of all sizes are investing in renewable energy at a rapid pace. Clean energy standards like the RPS create policy certainty and help attract companies that are looking to make long-term investments to achieve ambitious climate and clean energy goals.\Nevada has taken many important steps toward an economically strong clean energy future, but there is more work to be done. We are counting on Nevada's next governor to embrace a stronger RPS and keep our state's clean energy economy thriving. The future of our planet — and a thriving energy economy in Nevada — depends on it.\Ron Hunter is Patagonia's environmental activism manager at its Reno Service Center.\Your Turn\Ron Hunter\Guest columnist"
92,"Caprice Thurlow joan whitely photo color gurzinski caprice thurlow rps\|John Gurzinski/Review-Journal\YMCA tutor Eli Chandarlis visits Elmwood Villas to help 4-year-old Steve Monarrea with his writing skills.\YMCA, apartment owner team up to help children after school\By Joan Whitely\Review-Journal\Elmwood Villas is an apartment complex in a tough neighborhood. It's right on 28th Street - near Eastern Avenue and Bonanza Road - which some consider prime gang territory.\But Elmwood Villas has something going for it that nearby apartment tracts lack: a team effort between its owners and the YMCA of Southern Nevada to offer wholesome after-school activities on apartment grounds.\Apartment management - RPS Nevada Affordable Housing Corp., which also owns the complex - provides free space. The YMCA provides the tutors.\Youngsters from kindergarten through fifth grade who live at Elmwood Villas are eligible for the free after-school program. Two tutors are there from 3 to 5:30 p.m. every weekday to help with homework and to lead games.\""IZEL YMCA,"" read the poster that Izel Pacheco, 9, was constructing out of colored paper on a recent afternoon. He was one of about 10 youngsters on hand. Izel chose to spell out ""YMCA"" instead of his last name because he likes the program so much.\""They only know Spanish,"" Izel said of his parents. They can't help him much with his homework, so he relies on the tutors instead. Izel is a fourth-grader at Lunt Elementary School.\""It's fun being with the kids,"" said Ruth De Paum, 10, a fourth-grader at Sunrise Acres Elementary. According to tutor Eli Chandarlis, some parents have told him that if it weren't for the supervised program, their children would have to play inside their own apartments after school, for fear of encountering unsavory gang members outdoors.\The children in the program work and play in a community room at Elmwood Villas. By design, the window blinds are drawn, even though it's still daylight.\Chandarlis explained why.\Some of the neighborhood's tough youths - possibly gang members - have taken to taunting those who participate in the program. Once, a firecracker was set off right outside the community building.\Another time, older boys were making gang signs with their hands outside a window - and then threw a rock in, breaking the window. Glass bits spilled into the room where the tutoring program was under way. Fortunately, Chandarlis had anticipated trouble, and already moved everyone away from the window before the breakage.\""The idea is to keep the kids safe, to keep them in an environment where they can learn,"" Chandarlis said. ""We try to get them more exposure ... to activities that don't include hanging out in the street.""\According to Chandarlis and fellow tutor Caprice Thurlow, about 25 young residents of Elmwood Villas have enrolled, although not all attend every day. Sometimes, the young participants bring along even younger siblings that they are baby-sitting. Occasionally, a child older than fifth grade will join, such as Enrique Bernal, 14, a ninth-grader at Las Vegas High School who benefits from extra help learning English.\The Elmwood Villas program began in mid-January. It is the seventh tutoring site for the local Y to take on. Christine Vaughn, a YMCA spokeswoman, said her organization is attempting to broaden its reach to those who may not have the transportation or money to attend programs at the YMCA's building near Meadows mall.\The tutors at Elmwood Villas are paid by a grant from the state Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse. A grant for supplies came from the D.A.C. Foundation, a charitable group that is affiliated with RPS Corp., a housing company that does business in 37 states, according to Arnie Stalk, its vice president of development.\RPS purchased the 156-unit Elmwood Villas in January 1996. Stalk said the company focuses on building or rehabilitating apartment tracts in low-income areas. He said it has started work in six other local projects near downtown or in North Las Vegas.\RPS did extensive remodeling of the units at Elmwood Villas, according to Stalk. Other improvements included installation of security gates, so that only residents would have access to the Elmwood Villas parking lots. Stalk said that before RPS Corp.'s purchase, ""it was like a drive-through drug haven.""\After taking ownership, RPS evicted nonpaying residents and formed a residents council, which set safety and wholesome activities for children as a top priority, Stalk said. It also arranged for a weekly mobile health clinic from the Women, Infants and Children program to operate on site for eight hours each Monday.\Stalk said he came to Las Vegas four years ago to help plan and launch the M.A.S.H. Village downtown, which assists the homeless."
93,"By Gloria Savko\Real Estate Writer\On Tuesday evening, single-family neighborhoods throughout the Las Vegas Valley will join thousands of communities nationwide in celebration of National Night Out, a residential crime and drug prevention program in its 15th year.\""This event encourages citizens to turn on outside lights, hold special block parties, organize Neighborhood Watch block groups and generally encourage support for cooperative police-community crime- prevention programs,"" said Ron Corbin, crime prevention specialist for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\National Night Out is sponsored nationwide by the National Association of Town Watch, and locally by the Metropolitan Police Department, which involves apartment complexes in the observance by way of the Las Vegas Crime Free Multi-Housing program.\""The Neighborhood Watch program wasn't successful for apartments because of their high transient rate and a low feeling of ownership in the community,"" Corbin said, pointing out that the multihousing program is in its third year. ""It's become one of the most popular community relations programs introduced in the Las Vegas area. It's similar to Neighborhood Watch, but is designed specifically for residents of multifamily housing. And it's not just for the private sector, it's also for HUD and Section 8 housing as well.""\The program is a cooperative effort among property managers, residents, police and government. It comprises three phases: phase one, management training; phase two, securing the property; and phase three, tenant safety training.\""Participants typically want to know how to work together with management and the police department,"" Corbin said. ""(Crime) is not just a police problem, a management problem or a tenant problem - it's all three.""\Of the more than 800 apartment complexes in the valley, about 50 have completed all three phases of the program. To date, about 500 complexes have completed at least phase one.\""That entails 26 different management or realty companies,"" Corbin said. ""We're trying to keep up with the growth of the city, but it'll probably take a few years for us to catch up with everybody.""\The program has resulted in a reduction in police service calls by as much as 50 percent at participating complexes.\""The greatest success we've seen was at a complex on East Fremont (Street). In the year prior to management completing the program, they had over 1,000 calls for police service in one year,"" Corbin said. ""That dropped to 300 calls the next year. I have to say, though, this does not necessarily mean 300 calls about crime; it includes calls for things such as kids playing music too loud or whatever.""\To renew membership in the program requires residents and property managers to repeat phase three each year in the form of a neighborhood gathering.\The Nevada Housing Division co-sponsored such a gathering Monday at RPS Fremont Villas, a 138-unit apartment complex on North 15th at Fremont streets in downtown Las Vegas.\""It's a new property whose ownership and management have demonstrated an awareness of the need to involve the community,"" said Charles Horsey, division administrator. ""They have a very progressive management team that has shown an interest beyond just renting apartments.""\The event at RPS Fremont Villas, one of the division's bond-tax credit projects, was the first of what Horsey hopes will be repeated at other properties.\""The focus is to increase public awareness of safety, just like the Neighborhood Watch program, and to increase cooperation among residents to their mutual benefit,"" he said.\""Safe units tend not to be vandalized or graffitied. It's good for the community, tenants and owners.""\Arnold Stalk is vice president of RPS Corp., the property manager for the complex.\""We are very proud of the involvement of the residents,"" Stalk said.\""It makes them secure, because they know it's a safe environment. We have a neighborhood council, much like Neighborhood Watch, who watch out for each other, which is a very good blend. Safe housing makes a safe downtown.""\The program, based on a 5-year-old plan that originated in Portland, Ore., has been implemented in about three dozen states and parts of Canada."
94,"""New Nevada"" is a term we hear a lot these days to describe the rapid economic and social changes within the state. But if the state truly wants to lead, if not be progressive, we need our leaders to implement progressive clean energy policies.\That's why Gov. Brian Sandoval's recent veto of AB206, a bill to increase the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to 40 percent by 2030, represents such a substantial missed opportunity. Modeling by respected, objective experts found that the bill would have attracted over $3 billion in new investment, created jobs, and generated economic growth in the state's rural areas. With the veto of AB 206, one can legitimately ask: ""What companies will never consider calling the Governor's Office of Economic Development in the future?"" as this was an opportunity to attract forward-thinking, progressive companies to our region.\Passing AB206 would have laid the foundation for long-term economic growth and expanded access to clean energy for all Nevadans. It would have signaled to large companies that Nevada is committed to growing its use of clean energy. And, it would have brought certainty to renewable energy companies, allowing them to confidently invest and hire.\Many businesses of all types, including my own, want their energy to come from clean energy sources. If they can't get that power from in-state utilities, they may look elsewhere -- or choose not to locate here at all.\Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows cares about how our power is generated, and today there are more clean, low-cost options available than ever before. Last year, we worked with Liberty Utilities to encourage their moving off dirty coal entirely and the development of a 50-megawatt solar array outside Luning. That single plant now provides 25 percent of all Liberty's customers' energy needs.\Access to clean energy isn't just an environmental issue for us, it's important from a business perspective. The cost of solar has declined 85 percent since 2009, and new utility-scale solar power is now beating all other sources in some cases, and cost competitive in most others. We know that clean energy can benefit our bottom line, help reduce pollution and protect our environment.\The demand for more clean energy isn't just limited to businesses. Average consumers are demanding it, too. Last November, Nevadans overwhelmingly chose to deregulate their electricity, allowing them to choose their electricity supplier, or generate their own. This was a clear signal to state politicians that consumers want access to clean energy, and more of it.\Well over 70 percent of Nevadans supported the RPS or AB206, and as we know, that support will not be dislodged by the step backward as demonstrated in the governor's veto.

95,"The Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce is dedicated to increasing economic success for our members and supporting key policies during the 2019 Legislative session that protect free enterprise, reduce regulations and ensure a competitive business environment.\As such, we are working with our legislators to support the increase in Nevada's Renewable Portfolio Standard to match current market demand for clean energy by using our state's renewable resource potential. Senate Bill 358 would raise the current standard to 50 percent by 2030, requiring utilities to use renewable energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal power. Nevada boasts some of the best potential for solar and geothermal resources in the nation; this is a prime time to capitalize on our existing assets.\Voters already have supported an RPS of 50 percent by 2030 and we agree. A higher standard could bring new investments and job opportunities to our community, continuing to increase the number of Nevadans employed in clean energy. With additional investments in geothermal and wind energy, Nevada could be among the best places for tomorrow's workers.\Our business members are always looking for ways to be more efficient and profitable. Deriving half of their energy from renewable resources could help reduce power bills and lower costs across the marketplace.\The Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce supports any legislation that will bring more clean energy to our state without raising costs for consumers and businesses. We encourage our lawmakers to create new opportunities for economic vitality and workforce development by passing Senate Bill 358.\Ann Silver, CEO, Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce\The story about Lemmon Valley Little League being unable to use their home fields due to too much water is very saddening. It is not much of a stretch to see that the youngsters are losing out on some great experiences because of years of bad decisions by people who should know better.\Who are these people? Politicians and bureaucrats who can't say no to development in the North Valleys. There are likely no rocket scientists in those groups. Biut t doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that Lemmon Valley is a closed basin with impermeable soils. More roofs and roads put in the valley increases runoff to less ground which can hold it — see numerous RGJ stories about North Valley flooding for proof.\Play ball?

96,"The 2018 ballot provides an opportunity for our state to continue to be a leader in renewable energy.\Right now, Nevada's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is currently at 25 percent and voting yes on Question 6 would double that to 50 percent by 2030.\We all know Nevada is ripe for solar development and will continue to play an essential role in our energy portfolio. However, it's important to recognize we also have wind resources which can contribute to our renewable energy goals. Not only is wind a reliable energy source, when solar production decreases during the late afternoon and evening hours, wind speeds increase, which complements solar and provides grid and pricing stability.\Renewable energy standards continue to reduce our carbon footprint and improve our environment, but clean energy production also creates good-paying jobs and strengthens our economy. Throughout the United States, more than 105,000 Americans have careers in the wind industry and according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, wind techs and solar installers are the country's two fastest-growing jobs.\Nevada can continue to be a self-sufficient leader in clean energy due to our natural supply of wind, solar, and geothermal resources.\Voting yes on 6 secures a cleaner and healthier future for Nevada and will spur economic development throughout the state.\Lucas Ingvoldstad, Reno\Why should Nevada care about Steve Sisolak for governor? While there are many reasons, here are two:\Steve made Nevada his home 42 years ago. It is where he worked his way through school, started a business and raised his two daughters — as a single dad.\Adam Laxalt moved to Nevada just six years ago to begin his political career.\So far, all that he has proven to Nevadans is that he'll do the bidding of his billionaire donors, like the Kochs.\Stand up for Nevada. Stand up and vote for Steve Sisolak. Polls are open now.\Rosalie Mahler, Reno"
97,"scott gulbransen AB74 ab17 ab476\The recent Fremont Villas Apartments affordable-housing development seems a mark of success for Assemblywoman Barbara Buckley, D-Las Vegas, a noted housing advocate.\Buckley introduced many housing bills to various assembly committees in 1997, including: Assembly Bill 74, which would let local governments donate land for affordable housing; Assembly Bill 14, which would let cities give residential-density bonuses; and Assembly Bill 17, which would let local governments use real estate taxes for affordable housing.\Buckley said she's proud to see Fremont Villas Apartments open.\""Whenever you have government and the private-sector working together to provide quality housing, it's an accomplishment,"" Buckley said. ""The RPS Corporation has committed itself to building high quality, affordable housing so people can live in nice neighborhoods.""\When residents of affordable housing have a clean and functional living environment, Buckley said, it helps them in all that they do.\""The Fremont Villas will be a place the residents will be proud to live and will fight to maintain,"" Buckley said. ""That builds their self-esteem and will help strengthen the family unit.""\Buckley has also backed AB76, a law that would prohibit local governments from disapproving affordable housing developments unless they could prove substantial adverse effects.\AB476 has been the most controversial of the bills, receiving heavy opposition from some fellow lawmakers.\Buckley has also advocated changing the way the city determines who is low to middle income.\Last February, Buckley reported Las Vegas defines low to middle income as 110 percent or less of the median salary of an area. She has urged lawmakers to redefine low income as 80 percent of the median or lower, and medium income between 80 percent and 110 percent."
98,"Passing bills in any legislative body can be akin to making sausage.\The Nevada Legislature is no exception.\As the 2017 session hits the home stretch, bills can turn into bargaining chips for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who want to get tougher legislation passed -- like Gov. Brian Sandoval's push for a controversial Education Savings Account, for example. It's the essence of legislative compromise.\The Legislature also serves as the battleground for business-related initiatives, including measures that not only impact community members but also pit rival business interests against each other. These include longstanding, fiercely contested issues in the state such as renewables and ridesharing as well as less known topics that are just coming to the fore.\Here's a look at some key business-related bills to pay attention to prior to the session's deadline.\Minimum wage hike\Any bill that raises the minimum wage will be a hot-button issue on both ends of the political spectrum.\In Nevada, the minimum wage is $7.25 for jobs with health insurance and $8.25 for positions that do not come with health benefits.\Senate Bill 106 aims to raise the minimum wage by 75 cents annually for the next five years until it reaches at least $11 or more for positions with health insurance and $12 or more for jobs without health benefits.\The bill passed in the Senate on May 17 and awaits a vote in the Assembly. Even if the bill is passed, there's no guarantee that Sandoval will sign it barring an agreement involving other legislation. As a result, supporters of SB 106 have also filed a Senate Joint Resolution 6, which calls for a constitutional amendment to raise the minimum wage and put the issue to a public vote. Such amendments must be approved twice -- meaning this session and the next legislative session after two years -- before it could go to a public vote in the 2020 elections.\More energy from renewables\Assembly Bill 206 aims to raise the percentage of energy that Nevada gets from renewable sources.\Nevada Revised Statute currently mandates an increase every two years in the amount of energy the state gets from renewable sources until it hits 25 percent by 2025.\AB 206 aims to increase the share of renewables to a significantly higher 80 percent by 2040. For comparison, neighboring California -- which has one of the highest RPS targets in the country -- has a goal of 50 percent by 2030.\Supporters see an abundance of renewable energy sources as not only a win for the environment and reducing dependence on foreign oil, but also a great recruiting tool for attracting companies that have placed a premium on green energy such as Apple and Google. Critics, meanwhile, question the practicality, reliability and added costs from switching to renewable energy from conventional energy sources.\Net metering\Assembly Bill 270 resurrects a highly charged issue that fueled great debate across the state in recent years: net metering.\After Nevada reached a compromise that allowed existing customers to be grandfathered into more favorable net metering rates for the extra energy they produce and sent to the grid, AB 270 aimed to make net metering available to more rooftop solar customers.\As the cost of solar foes down and technology such as Tesla's storage batteries become more viable, the dream of a ""net zero"" household continues to be appealing to many homeowners. Given the acrimony seen in the last net metering debate, which included some frustration in the 2015 Legislature, any addition to current net metering beneficiaries will be a challenge to say the least.\In the meantime, AB 270 has been merged with AB 405 -- which passed overwhelmingly in the Assembly on May 23 -- to create a more comprehensive rooftop solar bill.\Self-driving cars\After becoming the first state to pass driverless car legislation, Nevada finds itself playing catch up as other states aggressively jump into the driverless car fray.\Assembly Bill 69 is an attempt to bring Nevada up to speed by allowing activities now seen in other states such as Florida and Michigan. At the top of the list is the ability for companies to conduct driverless car testing without a person present inside the vehicle.\Supporters say the changes will allow for greater development of the sector in the state, including the creation of self-driving vehicle fleets.\Critics, however, question whether the technology is moving too fast at the risk of endangering public safety. The bill was granted a waiver in April 12 to buy it more time and had its latest meeting in the Assembly Transportation Committee on May 11.\Ridesharing\After a high-octane legal tussle between Uber and Nevada's taxi lobby that navigated its way to the Legislature, ridesharing officially became legal in Nevada in late 2015.\This was not the end of this debate, however, with Senate Bill 226 serving as proof of the ongoing tug of war between ridesharing supporters and critics.\A key change brought about by the bill is requiring drivers for services such as Uber and Lyft to carry at least $300,000 in insurance while using their ridesharing apps and at least $1.5 million when providing transportation services to a passenger. The bill also requires ridesharing companies to maintain records of trips, inspection records, complaints and accidents for three years and make them available to the Nevada Transportation Authority for investigations.\Supporters say the bill provides added protections for consumers. Critics say it puts undue burdens on the sector and hamper ridesharing services.\Fracking\Fracking has proved to be the great equalizer for North American oil and gas operations, opening up a swath of resources that used to be difficult to extract. At the same time, the activity also has raised concerns ranging from pollution to increased earthquake risk from wastewater disposal.\Assembly Bill 159 leans toward the anti-fracking side and will ban hydraulic fracturing in the state if passed.\This issue is proving to be a classic environmental debate that pits business against conservationists.\Supporters of fracking say that allowing for hydraulic fracturing will generate revenue for the state while also helping ranch owners earn additional income through oil and gas leases.\Opponents of fracking contend that the activity pollutes the air and can have an adverse impact on groundwater.\The bill passed the Assembly on May 26 and is awaiting votes in the Senate."

WHY ARE YOU RUNNING FOR SPARKS MAYOR IN 2010?\MARTINI: I am seeking re-election because the city of Sparks needs a leader who can guide it through this unfortunate economic situation. As a lifelong resident of Sparks, I have worked hard to make sure Sparks is a safe place to live and run a business as well as a great place to visit. I have worked diligently to diversify the city's economy so that it's not so dependent on one or two industries. With this diversification, the city of Sparks can recover faster from this economic situation. If re-elected, I will maintain this forward thinking mindset in the coming years. Additionally, I am running because I have the support of my friends and family and all but one of the members of the Sparks City Council.\NEWHALL: I was born and raised here and I think the other two candidates have been in office so long (over nine years) that they have nothing new to offer to the point all of their thinking is stagnant. Also due to health issues I will not be able to run anymore in the future. Meaning my life can go at anytime and since I have no children I want to leave behind something for the future where people one day will look back and say ""Hey Gene Newhall cared about the people of Sparks.""\SCHMITT: In the last decade the city of Sparks has seen many changes. We have grown from a small town to a large community. With these changes comes more responsibility for our elected officials as well as the staff that serves our citizens. In my time as a city councilman I have worked hard to provide new economic development within the city. I am running for mayor to move this important mission to the top of our agenda to provide the needed jobs and business in our area.\2. WHAT ARE THE KEY ELEMENTS OF YOUR PRIMARY ELECTION CAMPAIGN?\MARTINI: There are many elements to my primary election campaign. Without revealing too much, I will reach out to the voters to ask for their support once again via traditional campaign methods, such as walking neighborhoods and putting up campaign signs. Also, I have accepted that we're in the digital age so I've set up a campaign website """" www.mayormartini.com """" to communicate with my constituents and have been updating my supporters via Facebook and Twitter.\NEWHALL: 1. To either slow down or get rid of the current and future budget problems without having to worry about laying people off and sacrificing the public safety.\2. To do this? I plan on having a city of Sparks license plate with something like the SP Railroad Steam engine on it to honor the railroad that helped bring Sparks to life. Lake Tahoe has one that according to DMV has made them close to $2 million and Vegas has one that has made over $4 million ... So even if Sparks made say $500 from it? That would save how many jobs?\3. Come up with a new plan for downtown Sparks besides a parking lot. Maybe a new entertainment center bigger and better than Reno's, also something to bring visitors as well as local people to downtown on a regular bases. And stop Reno from stealing everything from Sparks like the baseball team as well has the basketball team.\4. Offer to give the seniors a discount on things like the sewer bills.\5. Come up with a plan to attract more local businesses to open up in Sparks.\SCHMITT: I will provide the needed leadership to move the city of Sparks forward to a more fiscally responsible and economically stable state.\3. WHAT IS THE NO. 1 ISSUE FACING SPARKS AS THE PRIMARY ELECTION APPROACHES?\MARTINI: The No. 1 issue facing Sparks, not only as the primary election approaches but also for the next few years, will be city's financial situation and how quickly we can recover from the downturn. The next four years are going to be based in reality.\And our reality right now is we have reduced services for residents. Sparks has a limited budget due to declines in property and sales taxes. I've always been a proponent of living within your means. We have to do the same as a city.\Our city parks and pools will be maintained less often. Our streets may go a little longer before they're repaired. For the city of Sparks to be in a good position when the nation's economy rights itself we must maintain a sense of fiscal responsibility.\The Sparks City Council, with my full support, began to implement incremental reductions so as to minimize the impacts on the residents and businesses in Sparks.\I am committed to sound fiscal practices when dealing with the city of Sparks budget, including cutting back on less important items and services while still providing for basic needs. A recovery will be a steady recovery at best because of our state's property tax cap.\NEWHALL: The budget and safety issues because of the budget, meaning police and fire.\SCHMITT: The last two years have been difficult for the city financially. We have had to eliminate or lay off over 200 valuable employees and positions. Members of our community are working to make ends meet in an unpredictable environment. Not only do we need to stay on top of a volatile economy, we need to be planning for the future. How are we going to take the next steps to prosperity for our community? By making economic development a No. 1 issue for the city, we can focus our efforts on the turn around and what the city will look like when that happens.\4. WHAT SEPARATES YOU FROM THE OTHER MAYORAL CANDIDATES IN THE JUNE 8 PRIMARY?\MARTINI: I feel my experience, integrity and accomplishments set me apart from my opponents. I was a city councilman from July 1999 to February 2005. In 2006, I was re-elected mayor of Sparks garnering 76 percent of the vote. As mayor, I have guided the city by applying the same principals I used while serving as councilman. The city of Sparks has experienced some tremendous successes in light of our nation's struggling economy.\I proudly witnessed the opening of the Golden Eagle Regional Park, the Legends at Sparks Marina and the White Water Park at Rock Park. Each one of these projects has had a positive impact on our community's economy.\In a time when unemployment is high, these projects have provided both temporary and permanent jobs that may not have otherwise been created.\I realized early on in my political career that it is critical to maintain favorable relationships with the city of Reno and Washoe County. In order to create the best possible situation for Sparks, Reno and Washoe County residents, the three entities must maintain open lines of communication and work toward common goals that benefit the majority of citizens. I have been a constant proponent of fostering and nurturing these relationships.\NEWHALL: I am a independent person, meaning I have no hidden agenda. I have no one giving me tons of money to do their bidding. I only have to worry about the voters themselves and answer to them. I am not out here for the power or the money. In fact I will do the job for free until the city budget is back on track...Martini/Schmitt both said they would not do the job for free. I know I can make a difference and in doing so help a lot of people in the city of Sparks. No matter if it's a money issue or pet adoption or just getting their street repaired or a free meal.\SCHMITT: Both of my opponents are fine gentlemen, and I have had the pleasure to work with them personally. My experience as an employer as well as owning several companies in my life time has given me the forward thinking needed to help Sparks into the future. My work as chair of the Tourism and Marketing Committee is helping to define Sparks as a leader on the West Coast of event producers and a place for tourism to expand. This experience separates me from my opponents because it gives me the foresight to make the necessary fiscal changes for the health of our future.\5. WHY SHOULD VOTERS SELECT YOU?\MARTINI: The voters should select me as mayor for several reasons. I have the financial background and leadership capabilities to guide the city of Sparks through the current economic situation. I have support from all but one of the Sparks City Council members and having their support means they believe in me and my ability to lead the city into the future. The annual Sparks Public Attitude Survey revealed that 92 percent of those polled feel Sparks is an excellent place to live. I've dedicated myself to making Sparks a great place since I was first appointed to the city council in 1999, and I won't abandon it in this time of need.\NEWHALL: I work for a living. I do not have lots of money coming in from other sources. I know what it is like to work paycheck to paycheck. Not like these two candidates that have a silver spoon and never have to get their hands dirty or worry about where their next meal is coming from or if they will be able to make the house payment next month. Plus I am able to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that have never been tried and look towards the future not only just for my family and(myself) but for everyone. I love Sparks and hate to see a good thing end.\SCHMITT: I have the leadership skills to help the city of Sparks through this tough economic climate and the follow through to see our city of Sparks develop into a more prosperous community."

To either slow down or get rid of the current and future budget problems without having to worry about laying people off and sacrificing the public safety.\2. To do this? I plan on having a city of Sparks license plate with something like the SP Railroad Steam engine on it to honor the railroad that helped bring Sparks to life. Lake Tahoe has one that according to DMV has made them close to $2 million and Vegas has one that has made over $4 million ... So even if Sparks made say $500 from it? That would save how many jobs?\3. Come up with a new plan for downtown Sparks besides a parking lot. Maybe a new entertainment center bigger and better than Reno's, also something to bring visitors as well as local people to downtown on a regular bases. And stop Reno from stealing everything from Sparks like the baseball team as well has the basketball team.\4. Offer to give the seniors a discount on things like the sewer bills.\5. Come up with a plan to attract more local businesses to open up in Sparks.\SCHMITT: I will provide the needed leadership to move the city of Sparks forward to a more fiscally responsible and economically stable state.\3. WHAT IS THE NO. 1 ISSUE FACING SPARKS AS THE PRIMARY ELECTION APPROACHES?\MARTINI: The No. 1 issue facing Sparks, not only as the primary election approaches but also for the next few years, will be city's financial situation and how quickly we can recover from the downturn. The next four years are going to be based in reality.\And our reality right now is we have reduced services for residents. Sparks has a limited budget due to declines in property and sales taxes. I've always been a proponent of living within your means. We have to do the same as a city.\Our city parks and pools will be maintained less often. Our streets may go a little longer before they're repaired. For the city of Sparks to be in a good position when the nation's economy rights itself we must maintain a sense of fiscal responsibility.\The Sparks City Council, with my full support, began to implement incremental reductions so as to minimize the impacts on the residents and businesses in Sparks.\I am committed to sound fiscal practices when dealing with the city of Sparks budget, including cutting back on less important items and services while still providing for basic needs. A recovery will be a steady recovery at best because of our state's property tax cap.\NEWHALL: The budget and safety issues because of the budget, meaning police and fire.\SCHMITT: The last two years have been difficult for the city financially. We have had to eliminate or lay off over 200 valuable employees and positions. Members of our community are working to make ends meet in an unpredictable environment. Not only do we need to stay on top of a volatile economy, we need to be planning for the future. How are we going to take the next steps to prosperity for our community? By making economic development a No. 1 issue for the city, we can focus our efforts on the turn around and what the city will look like when that happens.\4. WHAT SEPARATES YOU FROM THE OTHER MAYORAL CANDIDATES IN THE JUNE 8 PRIMARY?\MARTINI: I feel my experience, integrity and accomplishments set me apart from my opponents. I was a city councilman from July 1999 to February 2005. In 2006, I was re-elected mayor of Sparks garnering 76 percent of the vote. As mayor, I have guided the city by applying the same principals I used while serving as councilman. The city of Sparks has experienced some tremendous successes in light of our nation's struggling economy.\I proudly witnessed the opening of the Golden Eagle Regional Park, the Legends at Sparks Marina and the White Water Park at Rock Park. Each one of these projects has had a positive impact on our community's economy.\In a time when unemployment is high, these projects have provided both temporary and permanent jobs that may not have otherwise been created.\I realized early on in my political career that it is critical to maintain favorable relationships with the city of Reno and Washoe County. In order to create the best possible situation for Sparks, Reno and Washoe County residents, the three entities must maintain open lines of communication and work toward common goals that benefit the majority of citizens. I have been a constant proponent of fostering and nurturing these relationships.\NEWHALL: I am a independent person, meaning I have no hidden agenda. I have no one giving me tons of money to do their bidding. I only have to worry about the voters themselves and answer to them. I am not out here for the power or the money. In fact I will do the job for free until the city budget is back on track...Martini/Schmitt both said they would not do the job for free. I know I can make a difference and in doing so help a lot of people in the city of Sparks. No matter if it's a money issue or pet adoption or just getting their street repaired or a free meal.\SCHMITT: Both of my opponents are fine gentlemen, and I have had the pleasure to work with them personally. My experience as an employer as well as owning several companies in my life time has given me the forward thinking needed to help Sparks into the future. My work as chair of the Tourism and Marketing Committee is helping to define Sparks as a leader on the West Coast of event producers and a place for tourism to expand. This experience separates me from my opponents because it gives me the foresight to make the necessary fiscal changes for the health of our future.\5. WHY SHOULD VOTERS SELECT YOU?\MARTINI: The voters should select me as mayor for several reasons. I have the financial background and leadership capabilities to guide the city of Sparks through the current economic situation. I have support from all but one of the Sparks City Council members and having their support means they believe in me and my ability to lead the city into the future. The annual Sparks Public Attitude Survey revealed that 92 percent of those polled feel Sparks is an excellent place to live. I've dedicated myself to making Sparks a great place since I was first appointed to the city council in 1999, and I won't abandon it in this time of need.\NEWHALL: I work for a living. I do not have lots of money coming in from other sources. I know what it is like to work paycheck to paycheck. Not like these two candidates that have a silver spoon and never have to get their hands dirty or worry about where their next meal is coming from or if they will be able to make the house payment next month. Plus I am able to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that have never been tried and look towards the future not only just for my family and(myself) but for everyone. I love Sparks and hate to see a good thing end.\SCHMITT: I have the leadership skills to help the city of Sparks through this tough economic climate and the follow through to see our city of Sparks develop into a more prosperous community."
