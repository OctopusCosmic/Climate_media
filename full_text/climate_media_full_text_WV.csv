0,"Money to repair highways, rising health-care costs and controversies surrounding attempts to combat global warming are among topics the nation's governors plan to tackle when they gather this week in West Virginia. The National Governors Association summer meeting, which runs until Saturday at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, comes as states find themselves grappling with an array of issues that defy easy answers. Those include long-range funding for infrastructure upgrades, the effects of prolonged drought and adequately funding public schools and colleges.\States' economic conditions generally have improved since the national recession, but the retirement of the baby boom population will put pressure on governments as public pension and health care costs continue to rise, said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in southern California.\""In the short term, it's not too bad because the economy has been recovering and a lot of the states are not in those dire fiscal situations they were in a few years ago, Pitney said. ""However, every farsighted state governor knows the good times won't last.\Some storm clouds already are appearing. An Associated Press analysis this spring found that at least 22 states will be dealing with budget shortfalls for the 2016 fiscal year. This month, the AP also found that enrollments and costs have surged way beyond projections in many of the states that opted to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act.\Because Medicaid costs account for such a large part of state budgets, that is raising concerns that states will have to make cuts in education and other areas to afford the low-income health care program once the federal government begins reducing its share.\Missing from the conference will be the four governors who are vying for the Republican nomination for president next year. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin have commitments elsewhere, according to their staffs and campaign officials.\Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, the association chairman, and Republican Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, the vice chairman, did not make themselves available for interviews before the meeting.\West Virginia's struggling southern coalfields help illustrate the divide between governors who urge swift action on climate change and those who are fighting regulations against greenhouse gas emissions because of their state's reliance on the fossil fuel industry.\California Gov. Jerry Brown had been scheduled to give an address at the conference but instead flew to Rome, where he attended a Vatican summit called by Pope Francis following the release of his encyclical on climate change and poverty. In a speech Tuesday, Brown said global warming deniers were putting ""troglodytes into office rather than environmentally responsible leaders.\The Democratic governor is pushing a state plan that his administration calls the most aggressive carbon-reduction benchmark in North America. It would increase statewide renewable electricity use to 50 percent, have drivers use half as much gasoline and make buildings twice as energy-efficient as they are now.\By comparison, elected officials from both parties in West Virginia blast the Obama administration's push to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They say the regulations unfairly target an already-fizzling Appalachian coal industry.\The state has led or joined lawsuits against several U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations.\This year, West Virginia got rid of its state alternative energy standard, although it was hardly strict. Burning many types of coal - and even tires - counted as alternative energy. The coal industry helped write the law in the first place but came out in opposition to it this year.\""When we look at changes in our policy in this country, we need to also look at the economics involved with it and what effect it's having on coal states, said West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat. ""Obviously, we can all see what effect it's having here in West Virginia, as far as the loss of jobs and, which goes along with that, the loss in tax dollars.\Faced with ballooning health-care costs, governors also will hear from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, a West Virginia native. U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez will be the other high-level federal official addressing the group.\Governors also are anxiously awaiting action from Congress on a transportation bill as their roads, highways and bridges worsen. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, announced a deal on a six-year funding bill earlier this week, but it immediately ran into procedural delays from Democrats.\Authority for transportation programs expires July 31, which would eliminate the transportation department's ability to process promised highway and transit aid to states.\Already, the total money available to states from the Federal Highway Trust Fund has declined 3.5 percent during the five-year period ending in 2013, according to figures compiled by The Associated Press.\Some states, including ones like Michigan with Republican leadership, are mulling tax and fee hikes to address pressing road problems.\Credit: Jonathan Mattise The Associated Press"
1,"The day after West Virginia Republican lawmakers started tax reform talks, coal giant Murray Energy laid off 214 miners with a clear message calling for lower state taxes to unearth coal. After last week's layoffs, Murray's subsidiary condemned the Obama administration and lamented cheaper natural gas reserves. What surprised Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, though, was that Murray blasted the state coal severance tax as ""extremely excessive.\""That's really the first time I've had anyone say anything about our severance tax, said Tomblin, a Democrat.\The tax will be under review as the GOP-led Legislature mulls ways to reshape the tax code, said Senate President Bill Cole, R-Mercer.\During the industry's downturn, the spigot of coal severance cash has slowed considerably. Tomblin expressed concerns about trying to cut an already-shrinking revenue source that helps cover a variety of costs, from education to health care.\A chunk also goes back to county governments. Recently, struggling southern coal counties have laid off law enforcement officers and made other cuts, attributing them at least partly to falling severance money.\""One of the things we're blessed with is our energy in West Virginia, Tomblin said. ""I can't imagine right now reducing the taxes.\Cole called the tax review ""the next step to help coal, after passing bills last session to trim mining regulations and scrap a state alternative energy standard. Tomblin signed both.\A committee on tax reform is underway, and the next session starts in January.\Robert Murray, the company's namesake and a loud critic of President Obama's energy policies, just last week bet even bigger on coal. Murray Energy paid $1.4 billion for a controlling interest of Foresight Energy, which mines the thick coal seams in the Illinois Basin. Murray's West Virginia mines are up north, which has remained a more productive region than the state's thinning southern seams.\The coal executive also gave state Republicans a big lift last election. His company's $250,000 donation to a conservative super PAC was one of the biggest all cycle, and helped lift Republicans to their first state legislative majorities in more than eight decades.\At the federal level, Murray and other coal operators say they'll be crippled by Obama's climate change pushes, which call for reductions in carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\At the state level, the company says coal pays well more than its fair share.\Other than a surtax likely disappearing next year, the coal severance tax hasn't been raised since 1989. In 1997, mines with thinner seams got a break.\Companies now pay 1, 2 or 5 percent, depending on seam thickness.\Since December 2005, producers have paid 56 cents per ton to cover a worker's compensation debt, a tax expected to be dropped sometime next year, according to the Department of Revenue.\Combined, coal severance brought in $407.2 million last budget year, including $63.7 million for the debt payback. That's compared to $451.6 million in 2013 and $531.1 million in 2012.\Similar taxes exist for extracting resources like natural gas, which has boomed and helped prop up the budget during coal's decline.\It's hard to compare severance taxes across states because different coal burns at different rates, state Deputy Revenue Secretary Mark Muchow said.\Wyoming charges 3.74 percent underground and 7 percent for surface mining; Kentucky taxes a flat 4.5 percent; Pennsylvania has none; Ohio levies 10 cents per ton, plus reclamation fees; and North Dakota taxes 37.5 cents per ton, according to the West Virginia Department of Revenue.\West Virginia Coal Association President Bill Raney said the state's severance tax level puts it at a competitive disadvantage. However, he doesn't want money that goes to counties cut, either.\""I think there's a balance in there, Raney said. ""I don't know where that line is.\Credit: JONATHAN MATTISE The Associated Press"

3,"A global warming skeptic and leading climate change expert plan to debate the potential impact of cap-and-trade legislation on West Virginia's economy. \David Hawkins, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Climate Center, and Patrick Michaels, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, will face off at 6 p.m. Monday at University of Charleston's Geary Auditorium.\Under legislation passed by the U.S. House and now under consideration in the Senate, the federal government would set limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Businesses would then buy and sell permits to emit the gasses.\Hawkins says the proposal would provide opportunities for economic growth.\Michaels says the proposal would lead to job losses in mining, trucking railroad and other industries.\""Cap and trade is a very difficult issue to discuss,"" said UC President Ed Welch, who will moderate the debate. ""One side says that cap and trade would devastate the economy of West Virginia, while the other side believes that without it we will destroy our environment. I hope we can have a real dialogue on what cap-and-trade proposals mean to West Virginia.""\The Rotary Club of Charleston is organizing the debate, which is open to the public. The Charleston Gazette and Charleston Daily Mail are the event's main sponsors."
4,"WHEN Congress returns from its summer recess, the U.S. Senate is expected to begin consideration of the House Bill 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, otherwise known as ""cap and trade.""\While the House of Representatives narrowly passed (219-212) this legislation at the end of June, I am thankful that West Virginia's three representatives - Alan Mollohan, Shelley Moore Capito and Nick Rahall - stood up for our state and voted against this.\Now it is time for Sens. Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller to work to defeat this proposal once and for all.\Byrd already has come out and has stated his opposition to HR 2454, and Rockefeller has said he has ""serious reservations.""\This is good news, but they need to go further. The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce urges our senators to fight against this legislation on the Senate floor and to exercise their clout and seniority to defeat this legislation.\The bill would severely hurt West Virginia by threatening the economic use of coal, establishing even more burdensome federal regulations, piling new costs on state manufacturers and businesses, and imposing a new tax on everyone.\Here are some unnerving statistics about House bill 2454, from a study prepared recently by the National Association of Manufacturers. The measure would:\* Cause an estimated 2.4 million jobs to be lost by 2030, which will result in a 6 percent to 7 percent drop in domestic manufacturing jobs.\* Reduce industrial input by 5.3 percent to 6.5 percent by 2030.\* Raise electricity prices between 31 percent and 50 percent by 2030.\* Drop coal production by 38 percent by 2020 and up to 75 percent by 2030..\* Cause a decline in annual American household income of between $730 and $1,248\This report shows West Virginia will be one of 15 states disproportionately impacted by passage of HR 2454. This is a very high price to pay for legislation that does more to provide for ""income redistribution"" than to help the environment.\While employers appreciate the various points of view surrounding climate change and environmental issues, how Congress addresses this matter will have a bearing on our state's overall well-being, on our jobs, on our families' incomes, and on energy costs.\The West Virginia chamber, along with other national groups, suggests that climate change should be addressed as part of an overall energy strategy that balances a number of issues, including sustaining a healthy economy, encouraging better use of energy, and nurturing investments in our existing energy industry and in new technologies:\* Efficiency: We must find more ways to encourage energy consumers and producers to use fuel and power more efficiently by improving building designs and appliance standards, and by improving our electricity and transportation infrastructure.\* Technology: Government and businesses should promote investment in and use of new technologies that use traditional sources more cleanly and examine how we can incorporate emerging and alternative energies as part of our nation's energy production portfolio.\* Global action: The United States should exert strong, inclusive global leadership to conclude a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol that emphasizes technology, efficiency, and flexibility and includes ALL greenhouse gas emitters.\West Virginians will be hurt severely by HR 2454 and by the continued, ludicrous attacks on our nation's affordable, abundant energy supplies.\Think of the results here in West Virginia of what the House of Representatives is proposing - significant increases in electricity prices; devastation of our energy sector; the loss of thousands of mining and manufacturing jobs; cuts in schools, public safety, community services, and health care; and the loss of millions and millions in tax revenues.\Worse, if we continue to restrict domestic production and impose new costs and hardships on industries and businesses, then America as a whole will be less competitive, jobs and investment will continue to go overseas - and we will be more dependent on foreign supplies of energy.\HR 2454 is a recipe for disaster.\Now is the time to speak up for our state's future and to defend our livelihoods. The U.S. Senate needs to defeat this legislation."
5,"THE Washington power play to pass cap-and-trade legislation is deflating like a punctured balloon, but all the air is not out of it yet. \According to Reuters, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a climate legislation supporter, told environmental leaders in a private meeting last week that ""cap-and-trade is dead."" Graham has been working with John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., for months to get a cap-and-trade bill through the Senate.\The House of Representatives approved a climate bill last June.\But in recent months, climate fears have dissipated. Americans are much more worried about the economy - and less convinced that man's activities are causing a global meltdown.\A nationwide poll done by West Virginia's Mark Blankenship Enterprises for the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that 52 percent of Americans oppose cap-and-trade, while 37 percent support the legislation.\Americans worry that cap-and-trade will drive up their energy bills, cost jobs, and limit economic growth.\Those are additional burdens Americans want to avoid at a time when they continue to struggle with an uncertain economy and a slow recovery.\Now Kerry-Graham-Liberman have developed a fallback position to try to revive the process. The New York Times reports the trio will propose ""different types of limits for different sectors of the economy, beginning with electric utilities and then turning later to manufacturers such as chemical plants and pulp and paper mills.""\Meanwhile, the pressure is building on the Environmental Protection Agency to back away from its attempt to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by fiat. The EPA is in the process of designating carbon and other greenhouse gases as pollutants, then using the Clean Air Act to reduce the amount of carbon released into atmosphere.\Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ark., is pushing a measure in the Senate aimed at stopping the EPA, and now there's a similar measure in the House of Representatives. Two top House Democrats, Collin Peterson, D-Minn., and Ike Skelton, D-Mo., are co-sponsoring a resolution along with Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., to trump the EPA's attempts to regulate carbon emissions.\Meanwhile, Sens. Jay Rockefeller and Robert Byrd of West Virginia have sent a letter to the EPA telling the agency not to proceed with greenhouse gas regulations. The letter, co-signed by a number of other energy state senators, says the EPA should leave it to the Congress to develop energy policy.\EPA has agreed to slow down its implementation of the Clean Air regulations on CO2 until at least 2011. Total regulation would not come until 2013.\That gives the Democrats some breathing room until they have a better opportunity to pass climate legislation.\So here's how the merry-go-round works:\The Obama administration and some members of Congress want cap-and-trade legislation to protect the environment and bring in billions of dollars in new revenue. When the bill starts to bog down, the EPA threatens to regulate carbon on its own.\Proponents of cap-and-trade think the EPA action is enough to convince wavering lawmakers that it's better for the Congress to pass cap-and-trade than live by the EPA's decision.\It was a pretty smart maneuver, the ultimate Washington power play.\And it could still work if lawmakers like Byrd and Rockefeller continue to see cap-and-trade as inevitable.\But the advocates have misjudged by not considering the full impact of Climategate revelations or the obvious reluctance of the American people to further damage the economy and raise their own taxes to achieve the improbable goal of lowering the earth's temperature by a fraction."
6,"More than 400 people gathered at the Culture Center at the state Capitol on Saturday to protest cap-and-trade legislation being considered by the U.S. Senate. \Last month, the House passed legislation that would cut carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S., particularly those from coal-fired power plants.\Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., opened a town hall meeting at the Culture Center, which was followed by a rally on the Capitol steps at noon.\Capito expressed her concern about saving jobs for West Virginia coal miners, who make on average $63,000 a year.\Capito believes the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, passed by the House, could cost a household of four between $1,700 and $3,000 a year.\""A lot of people in West Virginia are living on fixed incomes. This also puts our nation at a competitive disadvantage across the world,"" she said.\At the recent G8 Summit meeting in Italy, Capito noted, ""Obama couldn't get China to sign on to reducing anything on emissions until 2050....\""Go off to the outer continental shelf and drill for our own resources,"" she said to strong applause from the audience.\""We need clean coal. We need more alternative energy - wind, solar, a good natural gas industry. And we need to use nuclear power.""\Don Nehlen, retired West Virginia University football coach, said, ""I am a friend of coal. I am not an expert on the environment. I am not an expert on global warming. But I am a friend of coal....\""This bill is bad for West Virginia. It is bad for the coal industry. And it is bad for America,"" Nehlen said.\Delegate Troy Andes, R-Putnam, a public relations official for Massey Energy, led the rally on the Capitol steps.\""I love the climate just the way it is,"" Andes said. ""Do you want to pay 90 percent more for electricity?""\People attending the rally carried signs stating: ""Cap & Trade Will Cost Jobs,"" ""Cap & Trade is Another Tax for West Virginia"" and ""Obama: Anti-Christ.""\Mike Stuart, who heads the West Virginia Conservative Foundation, urged people attending the rally to ""call Sen. Rockefeller and tell him to get off the fence.""\On Friday, Rockefeller said, ""I will absolutely fight for the future of coal and jobs in our state. I will not support an energy bill that threatens West Virginia's future.\""Technology can make coal even cleaner, but our nation cannot survive without energy from coal.\""People in the rest of the country need to know how dependent on West Virginia coal they are,"" Rockefeller said.\The Senate is working on its own energy bill, which could come up for consideration this fall.\The bill passed by the House is 1,500 pages long and contains 365 new federal regulations.\Reps. Nick J. Rahall and Alan Mollohan, both D-W.Va., also voted against cap-and-trade legislation.\Rahall said on June 26, ""It would be a mistake to sit back and allow other countries to devise international rules that will affect America's economic and energy interests....\""The international community has no interest in protecting American businesses.""\Rahall believes the U.S. should lead an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but must ""strike a balance between environmental preservation and the preservation of jobs.""\China leads the world in carbon dioxide emissions, the leading greenhouse gas, with 24 percent of the worldwide total.\That's followed by the U.S. (21 percent), the European Union (12 percent), India (8 percent) and Russia (6 percent), according to an estimate by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\Charles Wilfong, president of the West Virginia Farm Bureau, told the audience at the Culture Center that cap-and-trade legislation will ""probably be the biggest tax increase in American history.""\Wilfong rejected the ""assumption that global warming is caused by humans...a radical fringe is trying to implement this legislation.""\He added, ""A little under $1 trillion in new taxes over a 10-year period will be spent on social programs supported by the liberal leaders of Congress.""\Kenny Kemp | Sunday Gazette-Mail photos Crystal Newman, husband, Chris, and son Tristen, 10, protest cap-and-trade legislation at the state Capitol Saturday.\People at the rally were encouraged to send e-mails to Sen.

7,"GOV. Manchin is a relentless optimist. He believes the merits of his argument combined with the force of his personality can ultimately bring skeptics and opponents over to his way of thinking. \MoJo is West Virginia's salesman-in-chief.\Thursday, he took his pitch for coal to the White House. He and governors from a dozen other energy states met behind closed doors with President Obama, Vice President Biden and top members of his administration to talk about the nation's energy strategy.\Manchin's pitch: Coal is crucial to the long-term energy needs of the country. Cap-and-trade will be ruinous for West Virginia's economy. West Virginia needs the EPA to be clearer about rules for mountaintop removal mining.\""It was the most honest, frank, respectful dialogue I've ever had at that level,"" Manchin told me on Metronews Talkline a day after the meeting.\Manchin appeared hopeful Obama and his people had heard him.\But did they?\The president came out of the meeting with a commitment to clean coal technology and the construction of five to 10 carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects by 2016.\That sounds like a small carrot, which is attached to a considerably larger stick.\That stick is cap-and-trade legislation; Pass cap-and-trade or a carbon tax and there will be a few billion for clean coal.\The same day Manchin and the other governors were meeting with President Obama, Carol Browner, the administration's ""Climate Czar"" was touting carbon taxes to representatives of renewable energy companies.\The message is clear: Tax carbon-based fuels such as coal and oil and use the money to prop up green energy firms.\The New York Times reports that Browner used the words ""cap"" and ""price signal"" several times, and told the group that President Obama is not backing away from his commitment to a carbon trading system.\Browner said carbon caps would reduce ""dangerous pollutants that contribute to global warming"" and create jobs in a new green economy.\Not in West Virginia, however.\A study by the WVU Bureau of Business and Economic Research released last month found that the House of Representatives' version of cap-and-trade would cost the state almost 23,000 jobs and $1.8 billion in gross domestic product by 2030.\Browner wasn't alone.\The Times reported that Undersecretary of Energy Kristina Johnson told conferees: ""Let's not give up the fight"" for a ""comprehensive energy and climate bill.""\I'm not sure exactly what Manchin was told by President Obama and others in the administration during their meeting, but we do know what the people in charge of the president's environment and energy policies are saying when they're not locked in a room of coal state governors.\Their views should be enough to dampen even Gov. Manchin's dogged optimism."
8,"West Virginia's two U.S. senators said Wednesday there's a long way to go before they will vote for environmental legislation that could hurt the state's coal industry. \Sen. Robert Byrd and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, both Democrats, indicated they could not support new Senate legislation that would limit, or cap, companies' right to release carbon dioxide and set up a system to trade rights to emit the gas.\The House passed a bill earlier this summer that included such a ""cap and trade"" system, which is meant to reduce the emission of the gas many scientists say is causing global climate change.\The new 821-page Senate bill, introduced by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., tries to rebrand that cap and trade system as the ""Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act.""\The bill's stated goal is to ""create clean energy jobs, promote energy independence, reduce global warming pollution and transition to a clean energy economy.""\But both West Virginia senators said it would hurt the coal industry.\Rockefeller, who coal industry officials and environmentalists say is fence sitting, was blunt in his assessment.\""The climate legislation proposed today by Senators Boxer and Kerry is a disappointing step in the wrong direction and I am against it,"" the senator said in a statement.\He said the bill's call for a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 was ""unrealistic and harmful.""\Byrd's position is similar.\""I will continue to work with my colleagues to strike a balance that treats West Virginia's interests fairly as the legislative process moves forward,"" Byrd said in a statement.\""However, I will actively oppose any bill that would harm the workers, families, industries or our resource-based economy in West Virginia.""\Byrd said he was glad to see the bill put ""greater focus"" on clean coal technology.\""While this is an encouraging sign, we have a long way to go on this legislation,"" Byrd said. ""Many issues have yet to be addressed. There is still a tough road ahead.""\Both West Virginia senators are also pushing for the bill to encourage more energy efficiency and provide more funding for ""clean coal"" technologies, like carbon capture and storage, which could allow power companies to continue burning coal without emitting as much carbon dioxide. Much of that technology is so far unproven on a large scale.\Rockefeller and other senators from coal-producing states are likely to try to make the climate change bill more favorable to coal.\""I will continue studying the bill and all of its implications for our state and the coal industry,"" Rockefeller said. ""This is by no means the defining word on climate legislation in the Senate.""\West Virginia's senators stand in stark contrast to other Senate Democrats who spent Wednesday trying out a new catch phrase to sell their global warming bill: pollution reduction and investment, or PRI.\But it's just another name for cap and trade, a term derided by Republican critics as ""cap and tax"" because it will increase energy prices. Democratic polls have shown it faring poorly with voters.\The rebranding is an indication of the uphill battle the climate bill - which would cap greenhouse gases and also allow industries to buy emission allowances - faces in the Senate.\A number of Democratic senators, currently entangled in the heated health care debate, said they continued to have trouble with key elements of the climate legislation. Several said it would be a huge challenge - perhaps impossible - to try to get a climate bill passed this year.\The idea to remake ""cap and trade"" into ""pollution reduction and investment"" came from Kerry, author of the bill unveiled Wednesday. He came up with it about a month ago to refocus attention on what the bill would do, not how it goes about doing it.\""Cap and trade doesn't mean anything to people, "" Kerry said in an interview, insisting that ""this is an actual description of what's happening here.""\At a news conference on the bill, cap and trade, the legislation's centerpiece, got nary a mention. Instead, the buzz words were ""national security,"" ""economic growth"" and ""jobs from clean energy development.""\""We are here and we introduced this legislation because of one word - security,"" said Kerry. ""It is time to reinvent the way Americans use energy.""\The words ""cap and trade,"" ""global warming"" and ""climate"" also didn't appear in a White House statement responding to the bill's introduction.\""With the draft legislation ... we are one step closer to putting America in control of our energy future and making America more energy independent,"" President Barack Obama said. ""My administration is deeply committed to passing a bill that creates new American jobs and the clean energy incentives that foster innovation.""\Cap and trade is still the centerpiece of the Senate bill, as it is in the House-passed version. Under cap and trade, emissions of heat-trapping gases from power plants, refineries and factories would face increasingly more stringent limits, or caps. Companies could then invest in pollution-reducing technologies, or buy and sell permits to meet the cap - the trade portion.\The bill calls for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020, and an 80 percent cut by mid-century.\Environmentalists said Wednesday that all along they had been touting the energy security and jobs that would come from the bill.\""We don't even talk about it in terms of cap and trade,"" said Anna Aurilio, director of Environment America. ""Cap and trade is a very confusing term and it is not accurate. What we are doing is reducing pollution.""\Republican critics, who frequently have referred to the House-passed bill as ""cap and tax"" maintaining it would lead to soaring energy prices, weren't about to join in on the rhetorical shift.\""These are fancy, complicated words for high-cost energy,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.\Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a strong critic of climate legislation, said Kerry and Boxer were making ""an earnest attempt ... to refashion the obvious"" but that they ""produced yet another massive energy tax that will destroy jobs (and) raise electricity and gasoline prices.""\Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., called the Democratic bill a ""cap and trade scheme"" that ""would suppress our economic recovery, cost jobs across our economy and result in higher prices on everything from energy to food for every single American.""\The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, put additional pressure on Congress to address climate change by announcing that for the first time it will regulate carbon dioxide releases from new power plants, factories and refineries or whenever they are significantly expanded. Supporters of the climate legislation have argued Congress should act to avoid less flexible action by the EPA."
9,"WASHINGTON - In the 1970s and early '80s, having seized control of the United Nations apparatus (by power of numbers), Third World countries decided to cash in. \OPEC was pulling off the greatest wealth transfer from rich to poor in history. Why not them?\So in grand U.N. declarations and conferences, they began calling for a ""New International Economic Order.""\The NIEO's essential demand was simple: Transfer fantastic chunks of wealth from the industrialized West to the Third World.\On what grounds? In the name of equality - wealth redistribution via global socialism - with a dose of post-colonial reparations thrown in.\The idea of essentially taxing hard-working citizens of the democracies to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies went nowhere, thanks mainly to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (and the debt crisis of the early '80s). They put a stake through the enterprise.\But such dreams never die.\The raid on the Western treasuries is on again, but today with a new rationale to fit current ideological fashion. With socialism dead, the gigantic heist is now proposed as a sacred service of the newest religion: environmentalism.\One of the major goals of the Copenhagen climate summit is another New International Economic Order shakedown: the transfer of hundreds of billions from the industrial West to the Third World to save the planet by, for example, planting green industries in the tristes tropiques.\Politically it's an idea of genius, engaging at once every left-wing erogenous zone: rich man's guilt, post-colonial guilt, environmental guilt.\But the idea of shaking down the industrial democracies in the name of the environment thrives not just in the refined internationalist precincts of Copenhagen. It thrives on the national scale, too.\On the day Copenhagen opened, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over the regulation of carbon emissions by declaring them an ""endangerment"" to human health.\Since we operate an overwhelmingly carbon-based economy, the EPA will be regulating practically everything. No institution that emits more than 250 tons of CO2 a year will fall outside EPA control.\This means over a million building complexes, hospitals, plants, schools, businesses and similar enterprises. (The EPA proposes regulating emissions only above 25,000 tons, but it has no such authority.)\Not since the creation of the Internal Revenue Service has a federal agency been given more intrusive power over every aspect of economic life.\This naked assertion of vast executive power in the name of the environment is the perfect fulfillment of the prediction of Czech President (and economist) Vaclav Klaus that environmentalism is becoming the new socialism, i.e., the totemic ideal in the name of which government seizes the commanding heights of the economy and society.\Socialism having failed so spectacularly, the left was adrift until it struck upon a brilliant gambit: metamorphosis from red to green. The cultural elites went straight from the memorial service for socialism to the altar of the environment.\The objective is the same: highly centralized power given to the best and the brightest, the new class of experts, managers and technocrats.\This time, however, the alleged justification is not abolishing oppression and inequality but saving the planet.\Not everyone is pleased with the coming New Carbon-Free International Order.\When the Obama administration signaled (in a gesture to Copenhagen) a U.S. commitment to major cuts in carbon emissions, Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote the president protesting that he lacks the authority to do so unilaterally. That requires congressional concurrence by legislation or treaty.\With the Senate blocking President Obama's cap-and-trade carbon legislation, the EPA coup d'etat served as the administration's loud response to Webb:\The hell we can't. With this EPA ""endangerment"" finding, we can do as we wish with carbon.\Either the Senate passes cap-and-trade, or the EPA will impose even more draconian measures: all cap, no trade.\Forget for a moment the economic effects of severe carbon chastity. There's the matter of constitutional decency.\If you want to revolutionize society - as will drastic carbon regulation and taxation in an energy economy that is 85 percent carbon-based - you do it through Congress reflecting popular will. Not by administrative fiat of EPA bureaucrats.\Congress should not just resist this executive overreaching, but trump it:\Amend existing clean air laws and restore their original intent by excluding CO2 from EPA control and reserving that power for Congress and future legislation.\Do it now. Do it soon.\Because Big Brother isn't lurking in CIA cloak.\He's knocking on your door, smiling under an EPA cap."
10,"An attempt by the Legislature's Republican majority to pass legislation repealing a 2009 energy law has cleared its first hurdle in both the House and Senate, but one critic of the measure says the action provides no benefit to the state. Both chambers are working on bills to do away with the Alternative and Renewable Energy Portfolio Act, the so-called cap-and-trade bill, originally passed when Sen. Joe Manchin was governor. Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, told members of both the House Energy Committee and the Senate Energy, Industry and Mining Committee his organization supported the original bill, House Bill 103, but has had second thoughts as the industry has changed over the past six years.\""It came about as one of those things we thought would be a good idea, looking at Longview being built and Mountaineer plant doing its carbon sequestration project and a number of things, Raney told the House committee, referencing two large-scale projects aimed at improving energy efficiency across West Virginia. ""I think at that point, the (Manchin) administration felt like that would be a great idea. If you recall, the original bill was passed but then it was brought back to amend in clean coal technologies that would provide for different generations' abilities of plants around the state. We figured it was a foregone conclusion so we tried to get it fixed as best we can to protect our people, protect those generating electricity with coal. We've been all over the board with this. We defended it, but today it's a different world than it was in 2009.\Raney said Environmental Protection Agency regulations and rules implemented since then have changed how the Coal Association views the bill, which passed in special session.\""It becomes even more critical now not to dictate what fuel is used. We should let the free market determine that, Raney told lawmakers. ""We don't think West Virginia ought to be in the business of advocating or mandating a certain amount of electricity be generated in a certain way.\The 2009 bill establishes standards for the sale of electricity generated from alternative and renewable energy sources. Manchin said the Legislature heard from industry leaders, coal miners and environmentalists to pass a bill that takes advantage of all of West Virginia's energy resources.\""Our law showed the country that coal could continue to lead our nation toward energy independence, while also reducing emissions, Manchin said in a statement issued Thursday. ""Coal will be a part of our nation's energy portfolio for the next several decades, and West Virginia must lead the way in showing other states how to produce and burn coal more efficiently and cleanly. This law struck a balance between our economy and our environment, and has reduced utility rates for middle class West Virginians, something all of our elected officials should be focused on.\Sammy Gray, a lobbyist for FirstEnergy, told both legislative committees the utility company can meet the standard set forth in the bill through 2025. He said repealing the bill isn't necessary, but such action wouldn't harm the industry.\""We've never been favorable of picking winners and losers, he said.\House Bill 103 didn't do anything to change FirstEnergy's business plan, but regulations handed down by the EPA since then have, Gray said. He noted several states have a similar law, but he thinks the market should determine the pools from which power utilities draw energy rather than set that in policy.\Gray said FirstEnergy already gives a credit to customers for energy they produce from sources such as windmills and solar panels. That's a regulation handed down by the Public Service Commission, and House Bill 103 simply codifies that regulation.\No one from the PSC was present at the House Energy Committee meeting to answer questions. The committee unanimously passed the bill, which will now be sent to the judiciary committee.\A portion of the discussion in the Senate committee focused on an amendment put forth by Sen. Herb Snyder, D-Jefferson, on net metering, a practice that provides credits to solar energy system owners for electricity added to the system's grid.\After some discussion, Sen. Mitch Carmichael, R-Jackson, who was one of the bill's sponsors, agreed with the concerns of his colleague and asked for an amendment to the bill to include a provision on net metering.\The bill will now be worked on by committee staff members to address issues with net metering, said Sen. Jeff Mullins, R-Raleigh, who serves as committee chairman. ""We want to make sure that people who have invested in that type of energy be able to maintain their credits, he said.\Mullins said he has not heard any resistance from anyone else, beyond the net metering concerns, regarding the bill and that its repeal will benefit the state's coal industry.\""Repealing this bill will basically make the markets dictate who wants to use what type of energy. So if people want to use more coal they can, he said.\But not everyone agreed with the potential impact the legislation could have on the state.\""The bill doesn't make anyone do anything, said John Christensen, who lobbies on behalf of Mountain View Solar. ""This bill is not a West Virginia bill. It's an ALEC bill, he explained. Christensen said the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, has drafted bills for state legislatures throughout the country to advance its conservative agenda.\Christensen said the bill's purpose is not what West Virginia lawmakers are making it appear to be.\""This is not about traditional energy versus renewable energy. This is about keeping the rules for net metering in their place, he said.\Christensen said dozens of concerned West Virginians spent time on Thursday to call lawmakers to urge their support of keeping net metering rules. While he remains hopeful that their concerns will be heard, Christian said the proposed legislation was nothing more than the new Republican majority putting on a show.\""It's them flexing their muscles so they can tell their people that this is what we want to accomplish, he said.\Carmichael dismissed the notion that the bills were coming from the American Legislative Exchange Council. ""In no way shape or form, he said. The majority leader said state lawmakers have made similar attempts dating as far back as when the original law was passed.

11,"Staff writer\A top official with the nation's second largest coal producer on Thursday urged Congress to pass tough legislation to cap power plant emissions that contribute to global warming.\Preston Chiaro, chief executive for energy and minerals at Rio Tinto, testified in favor of capping carbon dioxide emissions and starting a market to allow companies to trade emissions permits.\""Unmanaged climate change is a threat to our assets, our shareholders, and our employees, and also to civil society and political institutions in many of the countries in which we operate and across the globe,"" said Chiaro, whose company mines in the western United States and in Australia.\Chiaro was among several witnesses who testified about coal and climate change during the final day of a three-day hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on the latest global warming bill.\Mike Carey, president of the Ohio Coal Association, said the legislation would destroy the coal industry and greatly damage the American economy as a whole.\""Without a doubt, this legislation which the committee is considering will devastate our communities, bankrupt our region, cause energy costs to soar across the country, and according to the EPA have almost no impact on global temperatures since China, India and the rest of the developing world will continue to increase their emissions,"" Carey told lawmakers.\But Gene Trisko, a lawyer for the United Mine Workers union, said the legislation does much to help the coal industry to develop and deploy equipment to capture and store greenhouse gas emissions.\Still, Trisko said the UMW is concerned that the short-term emissions reduction - a 20 percent cut by 2020 - is too much too soon to allow coal-fired power plants to adapt.\""Any new power plant designed for CCS technologies and scheduled to be in commercial operation by 2020 should be in the design and siting process today,"" Trisko said.\David Hawkins, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the tough near-term emissions reductions are necessary to avoid the most serious effects of global warming.\""The bill provides generous incentives for investing in power plants and other industrial facilities equipped with carbon capture and storage,"" Hawkins said.\Reach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.com or 304-348-1702."
12,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Oregon is on the precipice of becoming the second state after California to adopt a cap-and-trade program, a market-based approach to lowering the greenhouse gas emissions behind global warming.\Supporters call it the United States' most progressive climate policy, saying it not only cuts emissions but invests in transitioning the state economy and infrastructure to better prepare for more intense weather events as climate change worsens.\""We have an opportunity to invest a substantial amount into low-income communities off the backs of the 100 or so major polluters that caused this problem,"" said Shilpa Joshi, with the lobbying group Renew Oregon. Joshi has spent years working with dozens of organizations around the state to help shape the final legislation.\Cap and trade has been a top priority this year for Oregon's majority Democrats, and Gov. Kate Brown has said she would sign the measure, noting in a statement that ""Oregon can be the log that breaks the jam nationally"" on climate policy.\Though the program's approval is shaping up to be a sure bet, a decade's worth of baggage from California's cap-and-trade program has fractured support for the policy among environmental groups. Some question whether Oregon can truly meet its lofty emission goals and keep its promise to prioritize investments in low-income communities and Native American tribes' ability to prepare for a changing climate.\The division underscores a larger fight on the left over how to best tackle climate change, which scientists warn poses a global existential threat. Some progressives have balked at any solutions less than those outlined in the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate platform from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez that calls for the decarbonization of nearly every industry.\""Strong climate policy requires steep regulations on business and a total transformation of our current infrastructure,"" said Shawn Fleek with OPAL Environmental Justice, one of the main organizations on the left against the bill. ""Cap and trade does none of that. Just like in California, Oregon's bill has instead turned into a Frankenstein's monster in handouts to industry.""\Under a cap-and-trade program, the state puts an overall limit on emissions and auctions off pollution permits or ""allowances"" for each ton of carbon industries plan to emit. Only the largest polluters are targeted, and the idea is that as the emissions limit becomes stricter over time, it will be in industries' financial interest to switch to green technology. Oregon's program would begin in 2021, and the state wants to reduce emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.\Most of the money raised - estimated to total $550 million in the first year - would be used to fund a sweeping progressive platform that encourages further emission cuts and prioritizes investments in low-income and tribal communities' ability to respond to climate change.\""We're seeing the effects of climate really hammer people who can least afford it,"" said Rep. Karin Power, a Democrat from Milwaukie and one of two key lawmakers behind the bill.\The proposal also contains a $10 million investment to protect workers adversely affected by climate change policy, as some in transportation or manufacturing sector could face layoffs. The legislation provides unemployment benefits and pathways to clean energy jobs that, under the law, must provide competitive wages and benefits.\It's provisions like these that make the changes some of the country's most progressive, Joshi said.\""We are showing other states that it's not an impossible dream to hold big polluters accountable and use the funds to invest in clean energy and in our most vulnerable communities,"" she said.\Detractors on the left note Oregon's program, like California's, offers concessions to nearly every industry to dampen the potential financial impact. For the program's first few years, the state will cover a majority of pollution allowances for some industries, including natural gas and utilities companies. The fossil fuel industry is essentially the only one on the hook for paying the full price.\The plan gets mixed reviews from industries. While some, including Nike and Uber, have come out in favor of cap and trade, others from the logging and agricultural sector say it will lead to increased fuel prices, mass layoffs and shuttered businesses.\Stimson Lumber, west of Portland, laid off 60 sawmill workers in anticipation of cap and trade and other new taxes pursued by Democrats. CEO Andrew Miller said in a statement that rural and agricultural communities are paying the price for ""Oregon's assault on businesses.""\And opponents from both parties note cap and trade likely won't radically reduce emissions. While California's emissions have noticeably dropped since the state implemented its program less than a decade ago, only 20% of those reductions can be tied to cap and trade.\Dallas Burtraw, an economist with the think tank Resources for the Future who advises California's cap-and-trade program, said cap and trade is still the most efficient way to reduce emissions. High pricing is a powerful motivator in encouraging businesses to invest in green technology, something Burtraw said will set Oregon apart and possibly provide an economic boost.\California's program has added 2 million jobs and grown its GDP by $700 billion since taking effect in 2012. The nine northeastern states with a more limited cap-and-trade program saw $1.4 billion in net economic benefits and 14,500 new jobs from 2015 to 2017, according to a report from Analysis Group.\""These programs can cut emissions all while providing a more stable business environment that will attract new investors,"" Burtraw said.\For Sen. Michael Dembrow, the other main lawmaker behind Oregon's bill, the program is less about solving the global climate crisis and more about raising the money needed to prepare for a heating planet's worst effects.\""This is a worldwide problem, and if we hit businesses too hard with regulations, they'll simply move out of Oregon and pollute at the same rates somewhere else,"" the Portland Democrat said. ""That solves nothing.""\Credit: SARAH ZIMMERMAN Associated Press"
13,"The nation's health-care overhaul was imperfect, and ""cap and trade"" legislation is not the solution to climate change, say the three Democrats and one Mountain Party candidate running in West Virginia's U.S. Senate race - but they disagree on the reasons why. \In a meeting with Gazette editors Tuesday, the Democrats - former state Delegate Sheirl Fletcher, former Rep. Ken Hechler and Gov. Joe Manchin - and the Mountain Party's Jesse Johnson discussed their views on global warming, health care, the federal deficit and other issues.\They are running in the Aug. 28 special primary to replace the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd. Ten Republicans are also seeking the seat.\Fletcher said she is ""100 percent against"" federal legislation in which caps are set on greenhouse emissions and companies that exceed the limit can trade credits with those that emit less.\""Cap and trade, in my opinion, is nothing more than a tax on the energy sector,"" said the 53-year-old Fletcher, who is president of the Morgantown consulting firm Fletcher Environmental Services.\The former Republican, who switched parties after two terms in the Legislature, said she would work tirelessly to fund research on clean coal technologies.\She said she does not believe that global warming is the result of human activity, despite scientific consensus on the matter.\""I've always believed that the cooling and warming cycle is a natural cycle,"" said Fletcher, who challenged U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller in the 2008 Democratic primary. ""I'm not convinced with the science.""\Hechler, the 95-year-old former congressman and secretary of state, said he believes there are more direct ways of reducing emissions. Cap and trade, he said, is ""the product of compromise.""\Johnson, 51, believes the trading system would be too susceptible to abuse.\""We're talking about basically a casino for big industry,"" Johnson said, adding that the nation's leaders lack the political will to develop clean forms of energy such as wind and solar power.\Manchin, 62, has previously spoken out about cap-and-trade legislation. On Tuesday, he called it ""a grand trading scheme"" and said he would work to advance research on carbon capture and sequestration.\""I just believe there's not enough efforts being put towards the technology,"" he said.\Hechler's candidacy in West Virginia's special election has helped put environmental issues in the spotlight. His campaign focuses almost solely on his opposition to mountaintop removal, the practice in which mine operators blast off hilltops, dumping rock and dirt into valleys and burying streams.\On Tuesday, Hechler mentioned how Manchin often says he is seeking a balance between the environment and the economy.\""But the balance always goes in favor of the coal industry, even though he's listened openly to the environmentalists on a personal basis,"" Hechler said.\Johnson also opposes the practice of mountaintop removal. Fletcher and Manchin do not.\The candidates all agreed that parts of federal health-care reform package were flawed.\The pharmaceutical and insurance industries had too much influence on the law, Johnson said, adding that he was disturbed ""that Obama went behind closed doors to cut this deal to begin with.""\Hechler favors a single-payer system. Congress should start over on health care reform, he said.\""Unfortunately, when you have the insurance industry, which has millions of dollars to throw around lobbying, then you begin to dilute the major goal"" of insuring all Americans, he said.\Manchin said reform was necessary because ""health care in America has not worked,"" citing skyrocketing costs and the prevalence of poor health. He added that the bill wasn't perfect because it addressed so many issues.\The governor said all working West Virginians should have coverage, and emphasized his belief that people must take personal responsibility for their health.\In 2009, Manchin proposed expanding Medicaid to cover more West Virginia adults, but backed off those plans. He said Tuesday his administration put the effort on hold because it was waiting to see how federal reform would turn out.\Fletcher said she believes every American should have health care, but added that the law's breadth means its effects on businesses, hospitals and doctors are yet to be seen.\Still, she said, ""the cost of doing nothing ... would have been far greater.""\Candidates also discussed how they would address the nation's debt.\Manchin said the issue worries him greatly and touted what he called a record of fiscal responsibility in his two terms as governor. He said people need to take a hard look at entitlement programs and ""the entitlement mentality this country is dependent on.""\""That's not what this country was built on,"" he said.\Johnson and Hechler both said federal spending could be cut by ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\Cutting spending doesn't necessarily have to mean cutting programs, Fletcher said. Policymakers should target waste and abuse, she said, and the government should hold its contractors more accountable.\In the meeting, Manchin declined to comment in detail on the two federal subpoenas served to the state Department of Administration and Division of Highways last week, saying only that he has asked state officials to cooperate with investigators.\His office has said it has not been told that either the governor or any other state official is under investigation.\After the meeting, Manchin said he didn't know what information the subpoenas sought.\""I swear, I have no idea,"" he said.\Reach Alison Knezevich\at alisonk@wvgazette.com\or 304-348-1240.\Credit: Staff writer"
14,"TOKYO - On a man-made island in Tokyo Bay, garbage is getting a makeover.\Tons of waste are trucked here daily to a large industrial building. What can't be recycled is burned and filtered for toxins. The ash is turned into building material, and the heat is converted into electricity - enough to power 55,000 homes. \The process saves landfill space. Air pollution is minimal. The four-year-old firm, Tokyo Waterfront Recycle Power Co., will turn its first profit this year, said President Ikuo Onaka. But, he contends, the rewards aren't purely financial.\""We're making a social contribution,"" said Onaka, whose business is one of nine firms operating on Tokyo's waterfront to reuse the city's garbage instead of burying it.\These private-sector companies are part of a very public push by Tokyo's metropolitan government to turn this dense urban area, home to 13 million people, into the world's most eco-friendly mega-city.\In addition to reducing solid waste, Tokyo over the last few years has unveiled a slew of environmentally conscious initiatives. Those include toughened environmental building standards, cash incentives for residents to install solar panels and a plan for greening the city, including planting half a million trees and converting a 217-acre landfill in Tokyo Bay into a wooded ""sea forest"" park.\This month Tokyo kicked off its most ambitious effort yet: a mandatory program for 1,400 of the area's factories and office buildings to cut their carbon emissions 25 percent from 2000 levels by the end of 2020. The plan includes a carbon cap-and-trade system, the first ever attempted by a metropolitan area. The mechanism sets limits on emissions and requires those who exceed their quotas to buy pollution rights from those who are under their caps.\Tokyo's strategy is reminiscent of California's. The state's landmark legislation known as AB 32 requires polluters to curb their emissions significantly over the next decade. But while opponents, including large oil refiners, are bankrolling a campaign to stall that effort in the Golden State, Tokyo is hitting the gas.\More than half the world's population now resides in cities. Metropolitan Tokyo and its surrounding prefectures have about as many people as the entire state of California. The way such teeming places respond to climate change will largely determine whether global warming can be slowed.\""We recognize our role as big mega-city ... to be a leader,"" said Teruyuki Ohno, director general for climate strategy for Tokyo's Bureau of the Environment. ""It is because we are capable of doing it that we have the responsibility to do it.""\Some say Tokyo doesn't have a choice. Endowed with few natural resources, Japan has long been a champion in energy efficiency and clean technology. But the nation is falling short on a commitment to cut greenhouse gases, which it made more than a decade ago, when it hosted the United Nations convention on climate change in Kyoto.\Japan's federal legislators so far have failed to agree on a cohesive national strategy. Now some local officials, including Tokyo's maverick governor, Shintaro Ishihara, are taking up the slack.\Ishihara, best known in the U.S. as the author of the controversial book ""The Japan That Can Say No,"" is a conservative with a green streak. His administration banned older diesel trucks from the city's roads and led Tokyo's failed effort to win the 2016 Olympics with a pledge to make the city's Games the most environmentally friendly ever.\While some businesses have grumbled about his administration's new carbon-cutting plan, others see it as an opportunity.\Masahiro Takeda, manager of sustainability for Mori Building Co., one of Tokyo's largest commercial developers, said demand is rising for buildings that save energy and lower tenants' operating costs. Large-scale recycling, greenery, rainwater reuse and waste heat recapture have become standard features in Mori developments.\Tokyo rooftops are also sprouting solar panels. To spur adoption of photovoltaics, the metropolitan government offers its homeowners a subsidy of 100,000 yen (about $1,070) per kilowatt. (A typical system is about four kilowatts.) That comes on top of the federal subsidy of 70,000 yen (about $750) per kilowatt. The metropolitan government is also offering solar incentives to businesses.\But not everyone is impressed. Environmental activists have severely criticized Tokyo's administration for supporting housing on Minamiyama, a forested mountain near Tokyo whose trees are being felled by developers. And places such as Aichi prefecture, home of the city of Nagoya, have been much more aggressive in their solar efforts.\Still, Tokyo is well ahead of other major cities on a variety of environmental issues. Environmentalists are particularly enthusiastic about the government's willingness to push ahead with its cap-and-trade program in the midst of a sluggish global economy.\""Tokyo is the first metropolitan area in the world to try this,"" said Tetsunari Iida, executive director of the nonprofit Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Tokyo. ""They want to show it can work.""\MCT photo Workers toil on a rooftop garden at Roppongi Hills, a major retail and office complex in Tokyo.

15,"Rep. Shelley Moore Capito on Thursday disputed the need for swift action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and questioned whether projections of negative impacts warrant new regulations she fears will harm the coal industry and otherwise hamper the economy.\Despite a widespread scientific consensus, the West Virginia Republican said she's ""not convinced"" that human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide are leading to global warming that will alter the planet's climate in ways that could be dangerous.\""I'm looking at the studies, and trying to understand it,"" Capito said in a phone interview. ""But I'm not convinced that the urgencies or the doomsday predictions are factual.""\Scientists from around the world have called for deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, to try to stabilize the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere within the next decade and avoid major sea level rises, widespread species extinctions and a host of other damaging impacts.\But Capito has joined with other Republicans to attack a Democratic proposal for a cap-and-trade program to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and opposes President Barack Obama's plans to require cuts in the heat-trapping gases.\Along with several GOP leaders, Capito has been citing an MIT study in arguing that the legislation would cost the average household $3,100 a year. But the MIT professor who wrote the study said the GOP has mischaracterized his research, and that the true cost is closer to $300 per year.\Earlier this week, Capito visited a Kanawha County strip mine owned by one of her campaign contributors, Charleston businessman Andrew Jordon, to promote her view that the Obama administration's outlook on climate change and limiting the damage from mountaintop removal will destroy the coal industry.\Capito has repeatedly said her goal has been to get the public and fellow lawmakers to focus on the potential economic impacts of these policies.\""While we all march toward the goal of cleaner air, of a cleaner environment, we have to be realistic here,"" Capito said during a previous press conference in Washington.\In Thursday's phone interview, Capito said she didn't recall the details of a federal government study that found mountaintop removal was causing significant damage, but was confident that regulatory agencies would have tightened their rules if that were the case.\""I think that if the science shows that there is irreparable harm to the environment, that those enforcement and regulatory agencies would have come in and changed the methods, the procedures and the ability to even go that far,"" Capito said.\On climate change, Capito said carbon dioxide emissions globally are undoubtedly rising, because of expanding use of automobiles, increased population and growth in the economies of emerging nations. Capito said perhaps someday the emissions growth will warm the planet and cause problems, but ""I don't think this is going to happen tomorrow.""\Two years ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, issued a series of reports that outlined the consensus view of the scientific community on global warming. The IPCC is a network of more than 2,000 scientists from around the world. It was formed by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization to assess and report on the vast body of peer-reviewed science on climate change.\Among other things, the IPCC concluded, ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level.""\The IPCC added that the increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century ""is very likely"" - meaning scientists agreed they were more than 90 percent certain of it - to have been caused by increases in human-caused greenhouse emissions. These emissions increases, the IPCC said, ""are due primarily"" to fossil fuels, with land-use change ""providing another significant but smaller contribution.""\In its 2007 reports, the IPCC warned that unabated greenhouse gas emissions could increase global temperatures by as much as 11 degrees by 2100. To minimize the damage - limiting temperature increases to about 3.6 degrees - global carbon dioxide concentrations would need to be stabilized at about 445 parts per million by 2015. Doing so would require a carbon dioxide emission cut worldwide of between 50 percent and 85 percent, the IPCC says.\The IPCC also reported that these reductions could be reached with emissions cuts across a broad range of economic segments, from transportation to buildings to energy production. Also, the IPCC said in 2007, the cuts could be made with a resulting economic cost of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product spread over 23 years until 2030.\Capito said she could not point to any specific scientific studies, papers or reports that back up her uncertainty about climate change.\""I can't tell you a particular article,"" Capito said. ""This is something that I've come to reading a variety of articles and listening to experts.""\Capito noted that she heard a fellow congresswoman give a floor speech the other day warning that if action is not taken on climate change soon, her children ""won't have a planet to live on.""\""I think that's ludicrous,"" Capito said.\Reach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.com\or 304-348-1702\Credit: Staff writer"

Kennedy, is president of Waterkeeper Alliance and chief prosecuting attorney for the Hudson Riverkeeper, a group that seeks to protect the Hudson River and its tributaries.\In a column in The Washington Post in March, Kennedy referred to mountaintop-removal coal mining as ""the greatest environmental tragedy ever to befall our nation.""\""This radical form of strip mining has already flattened the tops of 500 mountains, buried 2,000 miles of streams, devastated our country's oldest and most diverse temperate forests, and blighted landscapes famous for their history and beauty,"" he wrote.\The approval of mountaintop mining permits amounts to a ""death sentence"" for streams, mountains and communities, he wrote.\Blankenship has been an outspoken critic of U.S. trade policy, climate change and cap-and-trade legislation.\He spoke at a Labor Day rally at a reclaimed Logan County strip mine, where he said global warming is ""pure make-believe"" and that the U.S. government wants to shut down coal mines with its energy policy.\This summer, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a version of the Waxman-Markey bill, which would set a cap on the emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas mostly blamed for warming the planet. The legislation also would set up a market for ""trading"" permits for carbon dioxide emissions, which puts a price on the emissions. A related bill is pending in the U.S. Senate.\""American energy policy impacts jobs, the economy, and national security,"" Blankenship said in a UC statement. ""I'm pleased to have the opportunity to address these important issues with Dr. Welch and Mr. Kennedy and clarify what I believe is the right direction for our country's future.""\In recent weeks, former Charleston city councilman Ted Armbrecht had discussed the idea with Welch, who then reached out to both Blankenship and Kennedy.\Welch looks forward to bringing both men to the campus, and said each is passionate on a different side of the issue.\""It's very exciting for the university,"" he said. ""We want to be a forum for the exchange of ideas. That's the essence of education.""\Reach Davin White at davinwhite@wvgazette.com or 304-348-1254.\Credit: Staff writer"
17,"Burning issue The news: The Democratic race is shifting to states that depend heavily on coal, putting Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in a bind as they try to appeal to green audiences. The backdrop: Coal producers and their allies are spending heavily to bolster public support for coal. The politics: In some states, efforts to build coal-fired plants are pitting Democrats in rural areas against city and suburban dwellers worried about climate change and air pollution.\The race for the Democratic nomination hinges on a handful of states where coal is still king. That puts Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in a bind: how to attack global warming without threatening an industry that provides half of U.S. electricity and more than 80,000 mining jobs.\Campaigning in the Pennsylvania presidential primary this month, Sens. Clinton and Obama are championing technology to capture and store carbon-dioxide emissions from coal - while vowing to invest in renewable energies such as wind and solar power.\Saudi Arabia in Pennsylvania\""Coal is going to remain a major player in American energy,"" Sen. Clinton told the Pittsburgh Business Times last month.\""We are the Saudi Arabia of coal, and it could be a very important way for us to meet our long-term energy needs,"" Sen. Obama told voters Wednesday in Levittown, Pa.\The candidates' comments reflect a broader challenge for Democrats, as efforts to build coal-fired plants pit Democrats in struggling rural areas against city and suburban dwellers worried about climate change.\In Kansas, rural Democratic lawmakers joined Republicans in opposition to Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius' decision to reject two new coal-fired plants that would have brought $3.6 billion in investment to the state. In New Mexico, Navajo leaders are sparring with Gov. Bill Richardson, who opposes their effort to build a coal-fired plant to bring jobs to the Navajo reservation. Both governors said the projects would contribute to global warming.\Wise, Va. power plant\In Virginia, Democrats at opposite ends of the state are clashing over a $1.8 billion coal-fired power plant proposed for the state's impoverished southwest corner. Gov. Tim Kaine backs the plant even as he vows to cut greenhouse gas emissions - a stance that has confounded many supporters in the state's affluent northern suburbs.\""There's no way to power the needs of our commonwealth or our nation without using our coal resources,"" Gov. Kaine said.\These state-level skirmishes are forerunners of the debate taking shape in Washington over how to address global warming. Democratic congressional leaders - and all three remaining Democratic and Republican presidential candidates - advocate the creation of a ""cap-and-trade"" system that would place limits on carbon-dioxide emissions and let companies buy or sell rights to pollute.\That support masks significant differences over how to cap emissions without hurting industries that rely heavily on coal. Democrats from rural states that rely on coal for electricity support legislation that would allocate some emissions credits for free to utilities and other large carbon-dioxide emitters.\Other Democrats, including Sens. Obama and Clinton, say all pollution credits should be auctioned, to ensure that companies don't obtain windfall profits. Some, such as Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, want to put an immediate halt to construction of any new coal-burning plants that lack technology to sequester carbon dioxide emissions. Many experts say that the technology is years from widespread commercial viability. The Energy Department withdrew its support for a project to test such technology in January after huge cost overruns.\Kaine's dilemma\Groups funded by the coal industry and its allies are spending heavily to bolster public support for coal, and to reinforce fears that limits on its use will raise living costs. A Virginia-based group called Americans for Balanced Energy Choices is spending as much as $40 million on TV ads and other outreach efforts.\In Virginia - whose 13 electoral votes could be decisive in November - the dilemma facing Kaine centers on efforts by Richmond's Dominion Resources Inc. to build a 585-megawatt plant in Wise County, an Appalachian coal-mining community where 20 percent of the population lives in poverty.\Build plant, cut emissions\Kaine has gone out of his way to promote the project. His 2007 Virginia Energy Plan, a document meant to guide state policymakers, mentions the project 10 times. It says that Virginia ""should work together"" with its coal producers ""to maintain a viable mining industry that supports the economy in southwest Virginia.""\At the same time, Kaine is spearheading Virginia's push to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2025, an undertaking that some fear will be undercut by the new plant. The facility would emit 5.4 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent of putting 895,000 more automobiles on Virginia roads, by some estimates.\Some Democrats worry that the plant also will emit large quantities of smog-forming pollutants that could drift beyond Wise. But those complaints rankle many in Wise County. The plant would generate hundreds of new jobs, double Wise's tax base and fund a renovation of the county's 1950s-era high schools. In the winter, students wear coats in class because only one of the school's three boilers still works.\Campaign donations\Some environmentalists have questioned Kaine's motives for supporting the proposed plant. Since 2001, Dominion has contributed more than $230,000 to Kaine's campaign coffers, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, a group that tracks campaign contributions in Virginia. Kaine says Dominion's donations haven't influenced him, adding, ""I'm sure I've received as much or more from people on the other side of this issue.""\To contact Stephen Power, e-mail stephen.power@wsj.com1\To contact Nick Timiraos, e-mail nick.timiraos@wsj.com2\Credit: The Wall Street Journal"
18,"Gov. Joe Manchin is one of the nations most popular governors and a centrist Democrat who the state AFL-CIO and Chamber of Commerce are practically begging to have in the U.S. Senate. Even so, not everyone is onboard. When he reflects on his five and half years in office, Manchin touts getting the states fiscal house in order, working well with all parties and attempting to balance environmental and energy policies. Liberals, including those in the left-most wing of the Democratic Party, acknowledge Manchins work to control spending and pay down debt. But they also say Manchin got a lucky break; that he rode a strong economy, pushed few major initiatives and maintains a myopic, coal-centered approach to the states future. If Manchin runs for the open Senate seat, as expected, Washington is highly likely to gain another Democrat. The governor supported health care reform and is behind the Obama administrations education reforms. But during a speech Monday to the Rotary Club of Charleston, Manchin suggested he might be at odds with portions of the presidents economic, energy and environmental agendas. That might not be a bad political plan, given President Barack Obamas deep unpopularity in West Virginia. A recent poll found Obama has only a 35 percent job approval rating in the state. But Delegate Nancy Peoples Guthrie, D-Kanawha, who attended the Rotary Club speech, said she thought Manchin sounded more like a Republican. That didnt sound like a talk by a centrist Democrat; that sounded like a talk by a centrist Republican, she said. Guthrie, who has recently been at odds with the Manchin administration, said she isnt sure how much Obama would be able to count on a vote from Manchin in the Senate. I wouldnt be looking to Joe Manchin for any help, she said. Manchin has been a prominent critic of the Obama administrations environmental and energy policies. He says the president is in danger of hurting the nations economy by affecting the availability and price of coal. He calls for balance between energy production and the environment. Environmentalists call Manchins approach anything but balanced. I dont think he cares very much about the environment, said Joe Lovett, one of the states leading environmental lawyers. Lovett said he doesnt care one way or the other about Manchins party affiliation. I dont think George Bush was very good for the environment; he was a Republican. And I dont think Joe Manchin is either, and hes a Democrat, he said. Lovett said Manchin seems to be like a ostrich with his head in the sand on global warming and has not done enough to curb mountaintop removal mining. Manchin has touted state land use laws that he says are more stringent than the national standards. Lovett noted that the head of the state Department of Environmental Protection, who is selected by Manchin, has been critical of regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and that the governor is, too. He does what we can do to make sure southern West Virginias mountains, forests and streams are destroyed forever, leaving little legacy, Lovett said. Guthrie said the state has not done enough to support renewable energy. In 2009 Manchin signed the Alternative and Renewable Energy Portfolio Act, which requires 10 percent of electricity sold in the state be produced using alternative or renewable energy sources by 2015. This figure increases to 25 percent by 2025. Republicans have criticized it, calling it a mini cap and trade, but liberals say its not enough, criticizing the act for being too lenient and allowing the use of non-renewable resources like cleaner-burning natural gas or even coal, provided its clean coal. That renewable energy portfolio was nothing more than words on a page, Guthrie said. Manchin is widely credited for bringing the state budget under control and for creating a plan and funding sources for paying down massive workers comp and teacher retirement debts, all while reducing taxes. Hes done a really good job about paying down the debt, said Ted Boettner, the executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, a liberal but nonpartisan think tank. Nobody denies that. Youve got to give him all the credit in the world for doing that. Since 2005, the state budget has shrunk as compared to the states gross domestic product. In 2005, the $3.4 billion budget was 6.45 percent of the states $53 billion economy; in 2008, the $3.8 billion budget was 6.2 percent of the states $61 billion economy, according to the most recent figures available from the Center on Budget and Policy. He really does believe unlike some of the people in less government, Boettner said. But Boettners group and Manchin have been at odds. The center argues for investing more in social programs, which Boettner said Manchin hasnt done enough of. He didnt create really any new programs, other than a few things here and there, Boettner said. State House Health and Human Resources Committee Chairman Don Perdue, D-Wayne, said Manchin has been a little slow on the uptake on health care issues. I felt like in many cases we were so afraid of shooting ourselves in the foot, we wouldnt even take a step, Perdue said. Perdue said he has always been frustrated that the Manchin administration didnt take advantage of a bill passed in 2004, during Gov. Bob Wises last year in office, that would have attempted to set price controls for prescription drugs. Critics said the bill may have been unconstitutional and a small state like West Virginia couldnt have done much to budge national drug companies, but Perdue said testing the law and provoking a lawsuit could have had national ramifications, emboldening larger states to follow suit. But Perdue said Manchin never implemented the bill. We did something no other state had done, he said. The only thing we didnt do is after we put it in writing, in ink we filed it away. Perdue added, It would have had national impact, national importance, but the fear of antagonizing the drug industry is palpable. But Perdue, who voted against workers compensation reforms, said if a person wanted to know what Manchin had accomplished, they wouldnt have to look much farther. He did a good thing, he said. He did something that needed to be done. Boettner said part of the reason Manchin was able to begin paying off the debts was the state reaped revenue from the massive tobacco settlement and enjoyed a relatively strong economy at the beginning of his term. While Manchin has been known for saying no to new spending, Boettner said the governor has not had to deal with a situation where there would be deep cuts or potential tax increases. He never had to take one of those really unpopular positions, Boettner said. Perdue also has been critical of the governors unwillingness to spend more money on providing in-home care for seniors or on drug abuse prevention programs. Our substance abuse policy in West Virginia is kind of tattered and worn and faded, Perdue said. Manchin administration officials would say its their tough decisions that have kept the state from having to make tough decisions. And they have said recently and repeatedly they are preparing the state to weather a couple of rough budget years, including a 2012 budget where the state will have to fill a $160 million budget gap, largely a product of the expiration of federal stimulus money and declining tax revenue. Adding new programs isnt the best way to save money. But all the criticisms are unlikely to affect Manchins chances for the Senate seat. The governors popularity is extremely high in the state. A poll last week by Rasmussen Reports of 500 likely voters found Manchin would win 53 percent of the vote in a Senate race against Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, if the election were held today. Capito, the states most formidable Republican, is still deciding whether she will run. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent. We appreciate everyones comments, and I think its important to note that if you know this governor, then you know that this governor welcomes everyones input, positive or negative, said Manchin spokeswoman Sara Payne Scarbro. Even Guthrie said, given those poll numbers, the governor should go ahead and appoint himself to the Senate seat. But she takes issue with the way the governor has been presenting himself lately. What I do take exception to is the narrative he has been painting for the last six years that he came from humble beginnings, Guthrie said. Manchin grew up in a three-bedroom garage apartment in Farmington, population 387. He and four siblings Janet, John, Rocky and Paula shared a single room packed with bunk beds. He worked in his fathers furniture and carpet store as a young man, and eventually ran the carpet store. But he also later brokered coal and energy deals and owned Enersystems Inc., an energy brokering company, while serving as secretary of state. Everybody knows he made his money as coal broker, and if everybody doesnt, they should know it, Guthrie said. Perdue said the governor could use his political abilities to attract liberals if he wanted to but so far he hasnt. I dont think hes ever tried to gain the support of that group. He hasnt turned his considerable abilities in that direction, Perdue said. Thats part of the problem the kind of lack of connection between the more liberal side of the party and the governor.\File photo With his business friendly approach and centrist views, Gov.

19," DAILY MAIL STAFF\ What the government doesn't know about mercury could be dooming some children to a life of developmental problems.\ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a national compilation of fish consumption advisories.\ In 2003, the number of fish advisories increased by 280 to a total of 3,094 advisories in 48 states, the District of Columbia and American Samoa.\ But some say they aren't testing enough.\ Overall, about 35 percent of the total lake acres and 24 percent of the river miles in the nation have enough pollution to make eating fish from those waters a potential health risk.\ The main risk is to pregnant women and young children because methylmercury, which accumulates in fish, is a neurotoxin that has been shown to cause developmental problems in fetuses and young children.\ Don Welsh, Region 3 administrator for the EPA, said the growing list of advisories shows states are doing a better job of testing than before.\ Most of the new advisories were due to mercury pollution.\ ""We don't want that to be confused with the idea that mercury emissions are up or that the problem is getting worse,"" he said.\ According to EPA data, mercury emissions from human sources have dropped from 220 tons in 1990 to 120 tons in 1999.\ Coal-fired power plants account for about 40 percent of the 120 tons.\ Navis Bermudez, a national spokeswoman for the Sierra Club, said the growing number of advisories suggests that mercury contamination is more prevalent than the EPA suggests.\ ""If there are waters that are still not being monitored, we could find out there are more waters that we shouldn't be catching fish from,"" she said.\ So far, West Virginia only has one mercury-related fish advisory - for the Ohio River. That doesn't mean, however, that other waters in the state don't have high levels of mercury.\ Bill Toomey, a program manager in the state Bureau for Public Health, said the state has been working under an EPA grant for the last couple of years to do more statewide fish samples.\ The number of advisories hasn't changed in the last year because the state is still evaluating the results, he said.\ Those results could become a political football. Behind the mercury debate is a tug of war with environmental groups on one side and public utilities on the other.\ At the end of the Clinton administration, the EPA was working on a proposal that would require coal-fired power plants to reduce their mercury emissions by 90 percent in 2008.\ The regulation would require all plants to install pollution controls, switch fuels or shut down to meet that goal.\ The Bush administration has proposed a cap-and-trade program that sets a target of a 70 percent reduction by 2018.\ Under the program, plants that reduce emissions by more than their targeted amount would have ""credits"" they could sell to other plants having trouble meeting their targets.\ Tim Mallan, West Virginia environmental manager for American Electric Power Co., said the Bush proposal is the only one that wouldn't send the state and national economies into a tailspin.\ ""The only way (90 percent) could conceivably be done is to switch to natural gas on a nationwide basis and shutdown all the coal units,"" he said.\ By comparison, AEP expects to get an 85 percent reduction in mercury emissions from its largest units, including the John Amos plant, due to pollution controls it is adding to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions.\ Installing those controls on just three of the company's 26 units, however, is costing about $1.2 billion.\ ""You look at our smaller, older plants. The investment is just not there for them,"" he said.\ Under cap and trade, AEP can make the investments that cut some of its largest emissions while eventually replacing the older plants, Mallan said.\ An additional factor is that manmade mercury emissions are relatively minor compared to natural emissions such as from active volcanoes, he said.\ Consequently, the EPA can't predict how much of a health benefit the country would see from even a 90 percent reduction of mercury emissions from power plants.\ ""They think there is one, but they can't quantify how much of one,"" he said.\ Bermudez, however, said a Florida study shows there was a significant drop in mercury levels in fish after the state implemented mercury controls on municipal and medical waste incinerators.\ ""Here's evidence that if we reduce our local emissions we're going to have a local positive effect,"" she said.\ Mallan said mercury emissions from incinerators tend to come from concentrated bursts, such as when a bunch of thermometers are incinerated. Florida also has a different ecology than West Virginia, and those differences mean that pollution controls on power plants here might not produce the same results, he said.\ Vivian Stockman, spokeswoman for the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, said its time for power plants to meet the same requirement as incinerators. ""They're the largest, single unregulated source of mercury,"" she said.\ While cap-and-trade programs can work for some pollutants, there's enough evidence to conclude that mercury emissions tend to create ""hot spots"" downwind of their sources, she said.\ ""At which end do we want to pay? Do we want to pay a little more on our electric bills, or do we want to pay with our children's health?"" she said.\ Contact writer Brian Bowling at brianbowling@dailymail.com or 348- 4842."
20,"E/The Environmental Magazine\Dear EarthTalk: In my business courses in college, we were taught that ecological degradation was an ""externality"" - something outside the purview of economic analyses. Now that the environment is of such concern, are economists beginning to rethink this? - Josh Dawson, Flagstaff, Ariz. \By definition, economic externalities are the indirect negative (or positive) side effects, considered un-quantifiable in dollar terms, of other economic acts. For example, a negative externality of a power plant that is otherwise producing a useful good (electricity) is the air pollution it generates.\In traditional economics, the harmful effect of the pollution (smog, acid rain, global warming) on human health and the environment is not factored in as a cost in the overall economic equation. And as the economists go, so go the governments that rely on them.\The result is that most nations do not consider environmental and other externalities in their calculations of gross domestic product (GDP) and other key economic indicators (which by extension are supposed to be indicators of public health and well-being).\For decades, environmentalists have argued that economics should take into account the costs borne by such externalities to discern the true overall value to society of any given action or activity. The company or utility that operates the polluting factory, for instance, should be required to compensate the larger society by paying for the pollution it produces so as to offset the harm it does.\So-called ""cap-and-trade"" schemes are one real-world way of monetizing a negative externality: Big polluters must buy the right to generate limited amounts of carbon dioxide (and they can trade such rights with other companies that have found ways to lower their carbon footprints, thus creating an incentive for polluters to clean up their acts).\While cap-and-trade was invented in the United States to clean up acid rain pollution, it is a model used in Europe but not yet in America, which has yet to pass legislation mandating it. Until Congress acts to regulate the output of carbon dioxide in the United States - via cap-and-trade means or others - such emissions will remain ""external"" to the economics of carrying on business.\Recent news that has many greens excited is that the World Bank, the leading financier of development projects around poorer parts of the globe, is starting to think outside the traditional economic box.\This past October, World Bank president Robert Zoellick told participants at a conference for the Convention on Biological Diversity (an international treaty signed by 193 countries - not including the United States - that went into effect in 1993 to sustain biodiversity) that ""the natural wealth of nations should be a capital asset valued in combination with its financial capital, manufactured capital and human capital.""\Zoellick's comments are the first sign from the World Bank of its recognition of the need to consider externalities in any overall economic assessment.\""[We] need to reflect the vital carbon storage services that forests provide and the coastal protection values that come from coral reefs and mangroves,"" he added.\Critics are still waiting to see if the World Bank will walk its talk. ""It's a fine rhetorical start,"" says the New York Times' Andrew Revkin in his blog. ""But the announcement by the bank of a $10 million 'Save Our Species' fund, with the United Nations Global Environmental Facility and International Union for Conservation of Nature, seems quite piddling in a world where money flows in the trillions,"" he adds.\Indeed, we may still be a ways off from including our environmental impacts into our measures of social wealth and health, but at least the World Bank has gone on record as to the need to do so, and you can be sure that environmental advocates will be working to hold its feet to the fire.\CONTACTS: World Bank, www.worldbank.org; Convention on Biological Diversity, www.cbd.int.\SEND YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTIONS TO: EarthTalk , c/o E - The Environmental Magazine, P.O.

21,"Gov. Joe Manchin said the Obama administrations plan to auction permits that would allow companies to emit greenhouse gases could clobber electric customers. The governor also said Rio Tinto Alcans top executive wants to make a major investment in the companys Ravenswood rolling mill. Manchins comments came Monday during a meeting with the Daily Mail Editorial Board. Appalachian Power Co.s proposed 43 percent rate hike is a drop in the bucket compared to cap-and-trade, Manchin said. With a cap-and-trade system, youll pay twice what you do now. I believe cap-and-trade is coming, but in what form? If the proceeds are used to fix the problem for research to find ways to use the carbon emissions or to stop it and if, say, half of the money is used to find the fuel of the future, like renewables, Im OK with that, Manchin said. But if you tell me you want to use the money to take care of health care, to do the middle income tax credits, then what youve done is raise my bill and the economy weve known, the economy we have, is not the same. Manchin said the Obama administration is being open on this and willing to talk. He said a letter written earlier this month by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, seven other Democratic senators and 25 Republican senators slowed things down in Congress. We need to find a cure to greenhouse gas emissions, Manchin said. We all agree burning coal creates carbon dioxide. Security comes in. My number one concern is the security of the nation. And that means being less dependent on foreign oil. I know that if I can liquefy coal until we get to fusion, then Im saying Im fine. But they (coals opponents) havent raised it to that level. They say its dirty, it kills the environment, and 70 percent of the people believe that. I say we can fix it with technology but were going to pay a lot more. I say if youre going to give my aunt a $400 tax rebate but youre going to charge her $100 a month more for electricity, shell figure that out. I dont think thats going to go over very well. Manchin said 25 midwestern states are the center of the nations industrial might, where all of the heavy lifting is done. He said pressure is coming from New York and the East Coast to raise electricity costs here to 12 or 13 cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity. They say, now we have a level playing field. I say you didnt build this country on that. Our country was built on competitive energy. India wont slow down, he said. China doesnt play by the rules. Regarding Appalachian Powers proposed rate increase, No one in todays market can take a 43 percent increase no one, Manchin said. But we need reliable power. I have confidence and faith in the Public Service Commission and the staff. Mike Albert (the commissions chairman) has as much expertise as anybody Ive seen. Hes done this all his life. Im sure he and his staff and the other commissioners will evaluate this request carefully. Manchin said that although he appointed two of the three commissioners, theyre like the judiciary They put that black robe on and theyre gone. Speaking of energy, Manchin said one heavy user of electricity Rio Tinto Alcans Ravenswood rolling mill might get a hefty investment. Manchin said Christophe Villemin, an executive with Rio Tinto Alcan, called from France on Monday to say the company is reorganizing and hopes to make a major investment in the Ravenswood mill. The mill has contracts with Boeing and other aerospace manufacturers. The mill has the largest aluminum stretcher in the world and is able to supply aluminum plate that is thicker and wider than anyone else in the industry can provide. This allows airframe manufacturers to reduce costs and weight using monolithic structures. Its a niche, Manchin said. He has high hopes for tremendous investments. Of course there are always a lot of conditions. But its promising, from everything we hear. Rio Tinto Alcan is the largest employer in Jackson County. Its rolling mill ran last year with 1,200 workers. On Jan. 21 the company announced it would cut 168 jobs because of the weakening economy. The rolling mills neighbor, Century Aluminums smelter, shut down last month, throwing about 650 employees out of work. Century cited high costs and a plunging price for aluminum on the world market.

22,"The conservative poet and thinker Peter Viereck came up with the best working definition of reality that I've found so far. In a poem called ""Hex,"" he defined it thus:\""It's what, when you don't believe in it, won't go away.""\It's becoming clearer that global climate change might fall into that category.\The Powers That Be in West Virginia, and I'm not referring to the elected ones, have a vested interest in denying or minimizing the reality of it and limiting or delaying actions taken to counter it. The coal that keeps the lights on produces a lot of CO2.\But as powerful as those interests are here, they don't control the whole world or even the whole country. Sooner or later, we're probably going to be looking at significant national legislation to deal with climate change.\It's the reality thing.\Rather than wishing it away, places like West Virginia would be better served if we started thinking and talking now about policy options that would do the least harm to the state, its people and its economy while also limiting the amount of overall damage caused by climate change.\The damage done to the public and environment by carbon emissions is a classical example of what economists call an externality-i.e. a social cost that doesn't show up on the buyer's or seller's bottom line. At their best, markets ""tell the truth"" about prices and costs. But when costs get shifted to others or to the world as a whole, this doesn't happen. It's a common form of market failure.\I know the idea that markets can sometimes fail is a shock for true believers in the cult of the market god, but these things happen. It's the reality thing again.\A likely scenario is that at some point, the United States will get serious about dealing with it, either by imposing a carbon tax or by a cap and trade system, which would limit greenhouse gas outputs and allow companies to exchange carbon emission allowances. If these are well designed, they can ease the impact of these changes on ordinary people and the public.\If we go the cap and trade route, it's important that carbon emission allowances be auctioned off by the federal government rather than simply given away as windfall profits to corporations and that the revenues generated by this be used responsibly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a cap and trade system could generate $50 to $300 billion a year in revenue.\Robert Greenstein and other researchers at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities have done some groundbreaking research on how these resources could be used to strengthen the economic well-being of the country as a whole.\For starters, they recommend that 15 percent of the revenue from a cap and trade auction should be dedicated to compensating energy companies for losses under the new system. That figure is derived from CBO estimates\The people who will be hit the hardest by rising energy costs, however, are low-income Americans. If Congress eventually adopts a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent, energy costs for these families could rise by $750-$950 per year, including home energy, gasoline and other kinds of consumption. But by setting aside as little as 14 percent of the revenues generated by a good climate change policy, these families could receive an energy rebate along the lines of the popular Earned Income Tax Credit.\This would leave around 70 percent of cap and trade revenue for other important purposes, including assisting communities and workers in places like West Virginia affected by these changes. Other potential uses include investing in research and development of alternative energies, providing energy cost assistance to middle-income families and offsetting rising energy costs to federal, state and local budgets.\The old saw that we have to choose between economic well-being and the environment is getting lamer and lamer. As you may have noticed, both are taking a dive right now.\With luck and effort, we can have some of both - or a whole lot of neither."
23,"Gov. Joe Manchin says there's continued interest in West Virginia coal, but he's worried about foreign investors controlling the vital commodity. \Manchin said global demand is only set to increase, despite the looming threat of environmental regulations that could affect U.S. coal production.\""They can tell you what they want to tell - there's going to be more demand,"" Manchin said.\During a Tuesday interview with the Daily Mail, Manchin outlined his disagreements with the Obama administration, which he believes could be leading the country into an economic catastrophe as it tries to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases.\Manchin also promised to bring the hammer down on natural gas drillers if they violated the law; had advice for President Barack Obama on the handling of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico; and acknowledged the ongoing speculation about his own political future, which he said is still up in the air.\The governor said there's ""more speculating going on"" in West Virginia's coalfields now by foreign companies.\Recalling a conversation with Obama he had earlier this year, Manchin said, ""Mr. President, do you understand we have Russians, we have Chinese, Indians who are speculating and trying to buy our coal property from us?""\""I said, 'It scares the living daylights of me. If they are able to control the coke and coal that makes the steel, then they are able to control the steel markets and we are going to be held captive one way or another.'""\Manchin appears to have honed a message he wants to take across the country using a federal political action committee, ""Country Roads PAC.""\His message is ""balance,"" he said. As in a balance between the right and the left, Republicans and Democrats, and the economy and the environment.\Manchin said he told Obama during a February meeting at the White House that China is working to find the ""fuel of the future"" in a way that doesn't sacrifice that country's growing economy to protect the environment.\But the governor said Obama sees finding the fuel of the future - one that is affordable, dependable and reliable - as his version of President John F. Kennedy's race to the moon.\Manchin sees a distinct difference between the two. "" 'The difference is China looks at funding the new fuel, clean fuel of the future as a business opportunity,' "" Manchin recalled saying to Obama. "" 'I believe you and this administration are looking at it as a moral obligation - and you can't win that one.' ""\China has not inflicted the economic pain that a proposed cap-and-trade program would in curbing the use of coal, Manchin said.\""They have not raised the prices, they have not overtaxed it and they won't regulate it out of being,"" he said.\""Now, they have a long way to go to just come up to our standard of regulations, which we would hope for that, but you won't see them inflicting further or reaching further until they know that base is protected.""\At the same time, Manchin said the ""hammer will come down"" on natural gas drillers that are violating state laws.\Natural gas is considered by many to be key in weaning the country off coal.\But the industry has taken several hits lately. One of those was the explosion in Marshall County last week that sent seven workers to the hospital. Following that, the federal Department of Environmental Protection ordered permit holder AB Resources PA, LLC, to halt all of its West Virginia operations until investigators found the cause of the explosion.\The DEP's preliminary investigation indicated the operator failed to follow the plan outlined in a permit, which possibly created conditions that led to the explosion.\""My goodness, you watch television, they say, 'Before you dig, please call,' "" Manchin said. ""Well, hell, before you drill, you ought to call somebody.""\Manchin compared reactions like that to those of Obama, who has been criticized for his handling of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\He said following a crisis, ""You've got to get on it quick"" - something Obama has been criticized for not doing.\""Everybody has a different style, but right now he's starting to have to work from the defense and not being on the offense, the president,"" Manchin said. ""So whatever style it is, it's one that people feel should be a more aggressive style.""\Manchin, who took licks for the confusion during the Sago Mine disaster, has recently been praised for his role as ""comforter-in-chief"" during the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster.\At Sago, Manchin said he walked into the room and knew the situation wasn't under control. ""Who's in charge? That's my first question. Who's in charge?"" he said.\He was told federal and state regulators and the mine's owner were all in charge. ""When you all don't agree, who's in charge?"" Manchin said he replied.\The governor also plans to start soliciting donations for his new Country Roads political action committee soon, using the contacts and exposure he's received from being the vice president of the National Governors Association. Manchin is in line to be named president later this summer.\""I am going for more of a centrist group of people who want to bring this country back to the middle,"" he said.\Asked if he is planning a run for president, Manchin grinned but said, ""No.""\Asked about being vice president, he said, ""I don't know if you run for that.""\When asked about being a U.S. senator, he said federal spending regulations didn't make the Country Roads PAC a good vehicle for campaign fundraising.\""I'm interested in public service,"" Manchin said. ""Do I serve it from the private sector or from the public sector?\""With that, I'm just looking at all options.""\Also during Tuesday's meeting with the Daily Mail:\* Manchin said the West Virginia Lottery Commission is allowed to spend only $30 million total for a new headquarters. The commission had about $70 million in funds set aside and is in the process of buying City Center West in Charleston for $22 million. It has plans for about $8 million in renovations.\""They're allowed to spend up to 30, period,"" Manchin said.\He said that's something he made clear to Lottery Director John Musgrave.\""I said, 'John, live within that budget, because we're taking all the 40,' "" Manchin said.\The governor said the leftover money will go back into the state budget, which next year could be about $160 million in the hole.\* The governor said he hopes Marshall University and West Virginia University's football teams continue their annual tradition of playing each other. He said WVU President Jim Clements and Marshall President Stephen Kopp both know how important the game, now called the Friends of Coal Bowl, is to the state.\""I know that Jim knows how important it is and I know that Steve knows how important it is,"" Manchin said.\He added, ""I have not gotten involved, but I will if I have to.""\Manchin, a fan of outgoing WVU Athletic Director Ed Pastilong, also praised the university's new athletic director Oliver Luck for his ""proven track record.""\Contact writer Ry Rivard at ry.rivard@dailymail.com or 304-348-1796.\Credit: DAILY MAIL CAPITOL REPORTER"
24,"Energy-efficiency provisions of the climate change bill working its way through Congress could save the average West Virginia household $237 per year and create 1,900 new jobs statewide by 2020, according to a report issued Wednesday.\The savings would increase to $521 per year and 2,700 new jobs by 2030, according to the report issued by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and the group Environment America.\If the Senate were to strengthen the energy efficiency language, the savings would jump to $288 per year and 2,900 new jobs, according to the report.\These provisions also would prevent 6 million metric tons of global warming emissions, the equivalent of removing 1 million cars from the road for a year.\Among other things, the bill requires utilities to by 2020 obtain 20 percent of their energy from a combination of renewable sources and efficiency improvements. Energy efficiency is allowed to meet up to 8 percent of the 20 percent goal.\Other provisions are designed to improve energy savings associated with building codes and retrofits, as well as appliance efficiency standards and better efficiency in the transportation and industry sectors.\""Americans know that energy efficiency is the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way of reducing our energy use and pollution,"" said Alison Adams, preservation associate at Environment America. ""These common sense solutions will put cash back in our pockets and help protect the air we breathe, the water we drink and the future of the planet.""\The report was released as coal industry officials and the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce gear up their campaign against the carbon dioxide ""cap-and-trade"" provisions of the American Clean Energy and Security Act.\All three of West Virginia's members of Congress voted against the bill when it passed the House of Representatives.

""As our report shows, the Senate can boost those benefits by improving the energy efficiency provisions in the Waxman-Markey bill.""\The study did not consider the impact on consumers of the cap-and-trade provisions, but its authors said the energy efficiency savings ""would more than offset"" costs projected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\""Energy efficiency policies offer a critical opportunity to offset increased energy costs that could result from the cap-and-trade provisions in the bill,"" the report said.

25,"WASHINGTON - A Senate climate bill will require a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020, deeper than the reductions mandated by the House, according to a draft of the bill. \The draft obtained by The Associated Press, remains subject to change. But the overall carbon reduction requirements are expected to stand. The Democratic bill is to be released today by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee with a vote by the panel likely in late October.\The draft includes an economy-wide cap and trade system that would require power plants, industrial facilities and refineries to cut carbon dioxide and other climate changing pollution. But it does not lay out how emission allowances would be distributed, leaving that for later. The bill is viewed widely as an early focus of Senate negotiations.\The 684-page draft calls for a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions beginning in three years, to be tightened annually so that emissions would be 20 percent lower in 2020 than they were in 2005.\Emissions would have to be 83 percent lower by 2050. While the long term cuts are the same as required by the House in June, the Senate bill requires a faster early ramp-up, something many in industry had wanted to avoid.\The House called for a 17 percent emission cut by 2020 and President Barrack Obama originally had sought only a 14 percent cut.\But Democratic aides involved in crafting the bill, said the legislation also includes measures that would make early reductions requirements easier to achieve. Also, they argued that information released since the House acted shows carbon dioxide emissions in the United States today already are 6 percent lower than what they were in 2005, a reduction attributed largely to the economic recession.\The Democratic bill will be co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the environment committee's chairman, and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., two of the Senate's strongest advocates for aggressive action to counter global warming.\The bill to be unveiled today is viewed by both supporters and opponents of climate legislation as largely a starting point in what is expected to be intense and difficult negotiations in the Senate.\Republicans, with the exception of a few, have voiced strong opposition to cap-and-trade climate legislation calling it a massive energy tax on consumers as energy prices increase amid the shift away from fossil fuels. And many centrist Democrats - especially from rural areas and from states with energy intensive industries - have expressed reluctance to support any bill that does not protect against energy cost spikes and protect domestic industries.\The Senate draft does not spell out how emission allowances will be distributed, leaving one of the most contentious issues to further negotiations.\The House would provide for free 85 percent of emission allowances to various industries, especially electric utilities to help reduce the cost to consumers.\Democratic aides, speaking on condition of anonymity because the bill had not yet been released, said it would include measures to benefit the nuclear industry and for the natural gas producers - both attempts to garner broader support.\Unlike the House version, the Senate draft does not prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases under the existing Clean Air Act. Democrats wanting a bill this year have used the argument that if Congress doesn't act, the EPA will.\Credit: and Dina Cappiello; The Associated Press"
26,"IN 2007, then Gov. Jon Corzine had New Jersey join nine other states in the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. It was to create a trading market for permits to emit carbon dioxide. \Corzine sold this as creating ""green"" jobs.\But the cap-and-trade fad cost the state more than $100 million in higher electricity costs, and soon it will cost the state 250 jobs.\Ocean Spray will build a $120 million plant in Pennsylvania to replace a 68-year-old plant in Bordentown, N.J.\The company said it will save $15 million a year through ""lower utility and transportation costs, taxes and other expenses.""\As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, industrial electricity in New Jersey costs, on average, 12 cents per kilowatt hour - or 50 percent more than it costs in Pennsylvania.\As a cap-and-trade state, New Jersey's electricity prices are expected to rise as further restrictions take hold in the next decade over how utilities produce electricity.\Pennsylvania is not a cap-and-trade state.\Such job losses occur across the country in states that have fallen for the economic stupidity of cap-and-trade policies, the latest legislative fad.\But while everyone wants to protect the environment, not everyone places as much faith in the development of alterative energy. Not only have other states not followed this White Rabbit down the hole, but entire nations have not.\The Kyoto Protocol, which would have limited carbon dioxide production worldwide, exempted China, which is now the No. 1 emitter of carbon dioxide.\The United States Senate voted unanimously against the protocol.\Russia, Japan and Canada - three nations that signed the protocol more than a decade ago - announced last week that they are dropping out.\By adopting cap-and-trade, states are not saving the world, but hurting themselves. They are ceding a competitive advantage on energy prices to other states and other nations.\Last week, new New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced his state is dropping out of the cap-and-trade coalition.\That is good news for New Jersey, but it should not have taken the loss of 250 jobs in a town of 4,000 people to get state officials to realize their mistake.\Credit: Dmedit"
27,"CONCORD, N.H. - Two of the 10 Northeast states that agreed to dedicate millions of dollars to reduce carbon emissions and promote green energy have reneged on their promise, instead diverting substantial funds to saving their budgets. \New York and New Jersey over the past year have raided accounts set up under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the first mandatory U.S. cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide. The accounts were created to pay for energy efficiency programs aimed at reducing the region's pollution by 10 percent by 2018.\Citing their example, New Hampshire dipped into its fund in June to help balance its budget.\New York took $90 million last fall - roughly half of its fund; New Jersey zeroed out its fund, taking all $65 million; and New Hampshire, a much smaller state, took $3.1 million in June. In all three states, the money was used to pay the state's bills.\Maryland made no withdrawals but diverted some funding to help the poor pay their electric bills.\Defenders of the raids that say in tough economic times, resources should to be diverted to the most pressing needs.\But critics argue the moves are shortsighted, saying everyone benefits more in the long run from reductions in energy demand from efficiency programs.\RGGI is a 10-state compact begun two years ago to reduce air pollution by large fossil-fuel power plants. Under the country's first mandatory cap-and-trade program, the states agreed to cap the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by power generators to 188 million tons. They require the generators to either reduce pollution or to bid at auction for allowances giving them the right to produce certain amounts of carbon dioxide. Generators whose emissions drop can sell surplus allowances at auction and trade them on commodities markets.\The amounts paid to the three states were to go into special funds to pay for such energy efficient programs as weatherization and rebates on newer appliances.\The allowances are auctioned quarterly with the proceeds - $729 million through September - going back to the states. Each state adopted its own laws and regulations governing the funds, but the compact signed by the states' governors calls for at least 25 percent to be spent on energy programs.\Participating states are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.\Environmental activists want to change the New Jersey Constitution to protect against future raids, saying it should not be left to legislative whim, said Matt Elliott of Environment New Jersey. The state used the money to help close an $11 billion budget hole last spring and could face a similar hole next year.\""New Jersey has now set the precedent that cap and trade creates some kind of cash cow to help balance the state's budget whenever we need a bailout. That's the wrong precedent. It's the wrong message to send,"" he said.\Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, calls the raid ""RGGIcide"" because RGGI-funded programs were discontinued as a result.\""Unfortunately, once government discovers a new source of money, it's like a potato chip: They keep going back for more,"" he said.\New Hampshire did not touch its $2.2 million share of the $66 million in proceeds from the latest auction Sept. 8. Elliott said the same is true so far of New Jersey's $10 million share. Rob Sargent, energy program director for Environment America in Boston, said New York so far hasn't tapped its $22 million share, either.\The remaining RGGI states have continued to fund their energy efficiency programs. And New Hampshire diverted federal stimulus funding to pay for initiatives similar to those being paid for with RGGI money.\Erik Kriss, spokesman for the New York state budget division, defended New York's action as necessary to help plug a $9.2 billion deficit in its $80 billion operating budget. No RGGI projects were put on hold, he said.\""Money is swept from time to time from dedicated accounts to generate funds to avoid tax increases and other unsavory things people don't like,"" he said.\Kriss said the state faces a $315 million deficit this year, but there is no plan to take more money from RGGI.\New Hampshire lawmakers also argued higher spending priorities had to be funded.\""Right now, although I believe the situation is improving, the state is very short of enough funds to meet essential survival services,"" said retiring New Hampshire House Finance Chairwoman Marjorie Smith.\Democratic Gov. John Lynch, who signed the memorandum with the other states and signed New Hampshire's law, also cited the difficult economic times as reason to raid the fund. He did not rule out tapping the fund again and insisted the overall goal to reduce emissions is being met.\""I don't think the issue is where the money comes from. I think the issue is what are the goals and are we addressing the goals as a state. We're spending a lot more money on energy efficiency projects than we ever have as a state,"" he said.\Meanwhile, Congress has been unable to deliver a national cap on greenhouse gases to President Barack Obama. The House passed a cap-and-trade plan last year, but Senate Democrats lack the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican delaying tactics. With the House now in Republican control, passage of a federal cap and trade program is even less likely anytime soon.\California regulators last week overwhelmingly approved the nation's most extensive cap-and-trade system, giving owners of power plants, refineries and other major polluters financial incentives to emit fewer greenhouse gases. Enforcement of the new pollution rules begin in 2012.\The Western Climate Initiative, a coalition of seven western states and four Canadian provinces, also is working on a plan to control emissions.\Credit: THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"
28," WASHINGTON - Democratic leaders in Congress who confidently pledged far-reaching action this year on energy independence and climate change repeat the phrase ""new direction"" like a mantra.\ But so far, the record of this Congress could be summarized by a text-message acronym: BAU, ""business as usual.""\ The next few weeks will test whether Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders can deliver a new energy bill that raises fuel- efficiency standards for cars, requires utilities to generate more electricity from renewable sources and mandates greater efficiency in buildings and appliances.\ Pelosi also wants to shift more tax credits and incentives to solar, wind and other alternative sources.\ Advocates have been frustrated by the slow pace of progress on global warming. They hope that this week a bipartisan bill from Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Joe Lieberman, Connecticut independent, will jump-start an effort to set a cap on carbon emissions and allow producers to trade emissions credits.\ But the ambitious timetable outlined by Democrats at the start of the year - an energy bill to President Bush by early fall, real progress on climate change legislation by the end of the year - is falling short. Al Gore, Nobel Peace Prize in hand, can step up his call for action, but Congress moves at its own speed.\ That has left some advocates discouraged, and scaling back their goals for this year.\ ""The energy bill is about the only hope in this Congress to have some impact on global warming, and it's not a sure thing,"" said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch. ""It's really been disappointing that legislative action has been so slow.""\ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who has worked for years to enact higher fuel efficiency standards, said she wasn't sure Congress has the will to do it this year. ""The mood in Washington is not a good one,"" she told a business group in San Francisco last week.\ Because of procedural and partisan issues, Congress has moved slowly to reconcile two very different bills passed this summer by the House and Senate. The Senate bill includes the first increase in fuel efficiency standards in more than 20 years - to an average of 35 mpg in cars and light trucks by 2020. But some House Democrats, under pressure from automakers and unions, won't support that.\ The House bill, which left out auto fuel efficiency, included a requirement that utilities generate 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020. That's well below the goal of 25 percent set early in the year by the Center for American Progress, a think tank working closely with congressional Democrats.\ About half of the states already have established ""renewable portfolio standards"" designed to wean utilities from coal and oil. California's target of 20 percent by 2010 is among the most ambitious.\ Even so, the 15 percent requirement may not survive in a final bill because many senators, especially from the South, object. Southern utilities rely heavily on coal and argue they can't easily shift to solar, wind or bio-mass.\ Both bills also phase out some tax breaks for oil and gas drilling and extend or create incentives for the use of renewable sources of energy.\ But even the incentives for renewables are not a given. Charles Gay, vice president of San Jose-based Applied Materials, which manufactures solar technology, said he was working hard in Washington last week, trying to persuade members about the need for an extension of an investment tax credit for solar use.\ Pelosi has remained upbeat about the prospects for a far- reaching energy bill.\ ""The New Direction Congress is completing work on a landmark energy bill that is our first step toward addressing global climate change,"" Pelosi said last week in a statement. ""Soon after, the House will consider cap-and-trade legislation that will greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""\ Resistance to an ambitious energy bill and any cap-and-trade plan comes from some unions and industries, and reveals divisions among Democrats. ""There's a rift between manufacturing Democrats and those from suburban areas who are environmentalists,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton political scientist and author of several books on Congress.\ ""It's hard to resolve that basic tension within the party,"" Zelizer said. ""Any cap-and-trade system involves a huge regulatory challenge.""\ The problem in the Senate is ""sewing together 60 votes for a package of efficiency, renewables and tax changes, and that's not easy,"" said Dan Weiss, an energy expert who has closely tracked the bills for the Center for American Progress.\ Another ""business as usual"" factor is the impact of political contributions from utilities and manufacturers.\ The nation's 10 largest utilities have donated more than $400,000 this year to a majority of members on the House and Senate committees that handle energy legislation.\ (EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\ ""These aren't like contributions to the March of Dimes. These companies want a seat at the table as the deals get cut,"" concluded an analysis of contributions by Clean Air Watch.\ (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\ Industries say their economic future is at risk in any system that tries to reduce emissions, citing economists' predictions that caps would mean higher fuel and power costs.\ But a growing number of corporate leaders support mandatory limits on carbon emissions. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey last month of 600 businesses found that while 60 percent worry about compliance costs, 56 percent of private companies said the government should do more to reduce global warming, and that included requiring greater use of renewable energy.\ Sen. Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who chairs the Environment Committee, said she hopes the Warner-Lieberman bill will be the vehicle that strikes enough balance to attract broad support. ""If the votes are there,"" Boxer said she will try to move it out of committee and give it momentum for next year.\ (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)\ But the urgency and will in Congress to tackle big decisions on carbon reductions remains unproven.\ The corporate survey that found ambivalence on the issue ""reflects the dilemma that Congress and America as a whole face,"" said Michael Steel, a San Francisco partner in the law firm that sponsored the survey.\ ""Most people would like to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced to help curb the effects of climate change,"" Steel said. ""But serious questions remain about how best to do it and pay for it.""\ Credit: San Jose Mercury News"
29,"BOXER-KERRY BILL The bill will be modeled largely on legislation passed by the House of Representatives in June that aims to cut carbon emissions by 17 percent by 2020 and more than 80 percent by 2050 compared to 2005 levels, reported ClimateWire and other publications.\WASHINGTON - Two top Senate Democrats are set to introduce a climate-change bill this week that would put new limits on carbon emissions, as world leaders prepare for a climate summit in Denmark after agreement last week by the G20 nations on phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels.\Sens. Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and John Kerry, D-Mass., will reportedly unveil their bill on Wednesday after months of closed-door meetings. The bill will be modeled largely on legislation passed by the House of Representatives in June that aims to cut carbon emissions by 17 percent by 2020 and more than 80 percent by 2050 compared to 2005 levels, reported ClimateWire and other publications.\But it's unclear how far the bill will get this year, or how fast. The bill from Kerry and Boxer would come as senators are intensely busy with health-care legislation, President Barack Obama's top domestic priority. Obama is aiming to sign a health-care overhaul this year that would cut costs and cover the uninsured.\At the same time, the Boxer-Kerry bill also comes just over two months before a Dec. 7 meeting in Copenhagen, where world leaders are hoping to finalize a new agreement to reduce greenhouse gases. At last week's G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, leaders pledged to ""intensify [their] efforts, in cooperation with other parties, to reach agreement in Copenhagen."" They also agreed to slash subsidies in the ""medium term"" for oil and other fossil fuels as part of their fight against global warming.\But observers say there is little time for Congress to finish a bill before the Copenhagen conference.\""I don't think expectations are that a bill will be signed, sealed and delivered by that point,"" says Environmental Defense Fund spokesman Tony Kreindler. ""There's not a lot of legislating room between now and December.""\Indeed, a climate-change bill faces a steep uphill climb in the Senate after passing the House on a narrow 219 to 212 vote in June. Republicans have consistently portrayed Democrats' efforts to reduce global warming as a tax on families and businesses, and say it will lead to loss of jobs and U.S. competitiveness. Moreover, Democrats from industry-heavy states like Michigan and Ohio want breaks for manufacturing industries that would be affected by the legislation's caps on emissions.\Obama argues that the House bill will create jobs through new energy investments, but critics say the ""cap and trade"" system at the heart of the bill amounts to a tax. Under the ""cap and trade"" system, companies would buy and sell permits to meet emissions limits.\Kerry, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said last week that the bill would be a ""starting point"" to win over moderate and conservative Democrats as well as Republicans, reported ClimateWire.\""I have no pretensions, and neither does Barbara, that this will be the final product. It is a starting point, a commitment, full-fledged, across party lines to do what we need to do to protect the planet for the next century,"" Kerry said last week. Hearings on the bill are expected early next month.\Meanwhile, senators' focus on health-care legislation has delayed two energy-related congressional hearings originally scheduled for this week. Hearings in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee about the economic effects of climate change legislation and managing federal forests in response to climate change ""will be rescheduled as soon as possible,"" according to a committee statement on Monday.\The committee's chairman, Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, will be involved in the Senate Finance Committee's work session on the health-care bill.

30,"It's a warm-up act of sorts.\A global warming skeptic and leading climate change expert plan to face off during a Dec. 7 debate at the University of Charleston. \Patrick Michaels, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, and David Hawkins, director of Climate Change at the National Resources Defense Council, will debate the potential effect of federal ""cap-and-trade"" legislation on West Virginia's economy at the University of Charleston's Geary Auditorium. UC President Ed Welch will moderate.\The following month, Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship and environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will square off on the same UC stage and debate many of the same issues - America's energy policy and climate change.\In an interview with the Gazette-Mail, Michaels predicted that cap-and-trade legislation would prompt job losses in West Virginia - and not just in the coal industry. Railroad, trucking and other businesses that support mining also would suffer, he said.\""Cap and trade will put coal at a disadvantage unless the carbon dioxide from the combustion of coal is captured and stored,"" said Michaels, a fellow in environmental studies at The Cato Institute, a conservative think-tank. ""It will cause great economic disruption, particularly in West Virginia, and you're not going to get any noticeable climatic effect.""\Hawkins, an expert on greenhouse emissions, has an entirely different view of cap and trade. He suggested that West Virginia look at the legislation as an opportunity for economic growth.\""This is an issue West Virginia politicians should embrace, rather than close their eyes and hope it goes away, because it won't go away,"" said Hawkins, who advocates market-base approaches, such as cap and trade, to solve environmental problems. ""Since a significant part of West Virginia's economy depends on coal production, it's a challenge, but the way you deal with a challenge is not by ignoring it.""\Under cap and trade, the federal government would establish the maximum amount of carbon dioxide emissions that U.S. companies could put in the atmosphere. The businesses would then buy and sell permits to emit greenhouse gases. In other words, the plan calls for making polluters pay for damaging the environment.\The U.S. House already has passed cap-and-trade legislation. The proposal is under consideration in the Senate.\Hawkins said developers and investors understand that the climate change issue isn't going to go away, and that additional regulations will be enacted to reduce carbon emissions.\""The business model going forward is climate change is a problem, and there will be policies to deal with it,"" Hawkins said. ""West Virginia needs to be proactive and look for ways to shape climate change legislation so it can provide a pathway of opportunities that West Virginia can take advantage of.""\Hawkins said West Virginia is positioned to be at the forefront of carbon capture and storage -seizing carbon dioxide from at power plants and storing it underground.\The cap-and-trade legislation sets aside $150 billion for carbon capture and storage projects, Hawkins said.\The legislation is designed to reduce greenhouse gases by 17 percent by 2020, and by 83 percent by 2050.\Michaels, a frequent speaker at events sponsored the energy industry, argues that the U.S. should take no action because new technologies will replace those that emit greenhouse gases.\He said predictions about global warming have been flat-out wrong.\""The major point [during the debate] will be how much warming we've had compared to what has been predicted, and what policies are justifiable by these observations,"" Michaels said. ""The warming that has been observed is less than what was predicted. You have to look at actual climate history.""\Hawkins said the use of coal and other fossil fuels threatens to wreak havoc with the earth's climate system.\""The reality is global warming is a genuine problem which is going to intensify,"" Hawkins said. ""And with that intensity, there will be a chance to deal with it.""\The Rotary Club of Charleston is organizing the debate, which starts at 6 p.m and is open to the public. The Charleston Gazette and Charleston Daily Mail are the main sponsors.\""The issue of cap and trade and how we respond to that legislation, whatever form it ultimately takes, is important to all West Virginians,"" said Park Chapman, the Rotary Club's program chairman who also works for Charleston Newspapers.

Forcing students to attend school does not change their home environment or the other variables in their lives that put them on the path to dropping out.\During a Feb. 1 education subcommittee meeting, Sen. Dan Foster, D-Kanawha, expressed his intuition that the ""die is cast down in the elementary grades, long before a child reaches the upper levels.""\At the same meeting, Dale Lee, West Virginia Education Association president, supported the idea that identifying potential truancy problems prior to high school, as well as engaging parents to be a part of the solution, provides legislators with a better route towards impacting students who drop out of school.\John Carey, representing Heritage Communications, has provided legislators with outcomes from studies that compare dropout rates from other states.\States allowing students to quit at age 16 have a higher average of high school completion than those requiring attendance to 17 or 18.\Identifying problems early and redirecting students towards a better outcome is more cost-efficient and effective.\This problem cannot be ignored; however, we need to consider the effectiveness of what the Senate bill proposes.\Data and testimony support improving the learning environment and early intervention, not raising the compulsory attendance age. This problem can be made worse if we make the wrong choices.\Agnes L. Casto\Fayetteville\Environmental debate\is over freedom itself\I attended the Don Blankenship vs. Robert F.

Joe Wilson can be heard from the mouth of Sen. Jay Rockefeller. In a recent response to Obama lifting $2 billion in tax breaks to coal companies, Rockefeller made the statement that the president is ""beginning to be not believable to me.""\Obama is doing exactly what he said he would do - bankrupt coal companies.\Cap-and-trade legislation will do just that. Obama's intentions should therefore come as no surprise to Sen. Rockefeller.

32,"E - The Environmental Magazine\Dear EarthTalk: Given that the presidential election is just around the corner, what can you tell me about each candidate's environmental track record and positions? - Jane Miller, Chicago, Ill. \Just because the environment is getting short shrift this election season due to our nation's lingering economic woes doesn't mean that candidates Obama and Romney can ignore the issue.\Environmentalists have cheered several of President Obama's moves during his first term, including: passage of the Recovery Act and its funding for environmental and habitat restoration and water quality improvements; passage of the first comprehensive National Policy for the Stewardship of the Ocean, the Coasts and the Great Lakes; and the signing of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, which expanded land protections and water conservation across two million acres of federal wilderness.\Obama also formed the Partnership for Sustainable Communities to bring together federal agencies to help communities nationwide improve access to affordable housing and increase low-cost transportation options while protecting the environment.\He also established new rules to reduce the negative impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining, set historic standards limiting greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, made substantial investments in clean energy, proposed the first-ever carbon pollution limits for new fossil-fuel-fired power plants, and reduced carbon emissions within the federal government.\On the downside, green leaders dismay Obama's lack of follow-through on a 2008 campaign promise to label genetically modified foods so that consumers know what they are getting when they buy corn, sugar or breakfast cereal. Also, a 2011 Obama decision to deregulate the planting of genetically modified alfalfa and sugar beets incensed organic farmers and environmental leaders.\Greens also worry about Obama's enthusiasm for an ""all-of-the-above"" energy policy that includes the practice of hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") to access natural gas in shale beds under wide swaths of the northeast and western U.S.\If re-elected, Obama would no doubt work to expand U.S. leadership on setting emissions limits in unison with other nations, and has pledged to continue to reduce our dependence on oil so as to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\Conservationists are also hopeful that Obama will set aside threatened lands for protection from development, as both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did soon before leaving the White House.\While Mitt Romney doesn't have much of an environmental track record from his days as Massachusetts' governor, he did get kudos for being open minded to both regulatory and market-based policy ideas.\He also supported a 2003 northeastern states agreement to reduce carbon emissions from power plants via a regional cap-and-trade emissions reduction plan. But in 2005 Romney abruptly pulled Massachusetts out of the plan, telling reporters that it didn't protect businesses and consumers from increased energy costs.\Romney is now pitching an energy plan that that embraces all the options, including fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewables. But he recently told ScienceDebate.org that he opposes any kind of carbon tax or cap-and-trade system ""that would handicap the American economy and drive manufacturing jobs away,"" adding that economic growth and technological innovation, ""not economy-suppressing regulation,"" are key to protecting the environment in the long run.\CONTACTS: Mitt Romney: Energy, www.mittromney.com/issues/energy; Barack Obama: Environment, www.barackobama.com/environment; ScienceDebate.org, www.sciencedebate.org."
33," kward@wvgazette.com\ The United Mine Workers union said Monday that a Bush administration plan to reduce mercury emissions from power plants favors the western coal industry over Appalachian mine operators.\ UMW President Cecil Roberts said the proposal allows plants burning sub-bituminous coal from Wyoming to emit twice as much mercury as those using bituminous coal found in Appalachia and the Midwest.\ Roberts said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plan, if finalized, would cause a ""large-scale shift in production from Appalachia and the Midwest to the West.""\ ""Some industry folks in these areas are already publicly bemoaning what a John Kerry presidency might mean for coal, but here we have the federal EPA, under the direction of President Bush, advocating proposals that will severely devastate the coal industry in several regions nationwide - including theirs,"" Roberts said in a news release.\ In newspaper ads last week, the Bush-Cheney campaign said that Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry has a ""19-year record in the Senate of supporting anti-coal policies that would devastate the industry in West Virginia.""\ The ads cited Kerry's support for efforts to curb global warming and against an effort by U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to overturn a court ruling that limited mountaintop removal mining.\ On the mercury issue, Kerry has sided with environmental groups that said the Bush proposal is inadequate to address a known health threat.\ Mercury is a highly toxic chemical, especially to developing fetuses. It can cause severe neurological and developmental problems, including poor attention span and delayed language development, impaired memory and vision, and problems processing information.\ Last month, a new EPA study found that between 300,000 and 600,000 of the 4 million babies born in the United States in 2000 may have been exposed to ""unacceptable"" levels of mercury because their mothers ate a diet rich in fish.\ Electric power plants are the nation's largest uncontrolled source of mercury into the environment.\ The Bush administration dropped a proposal that could have eliminated 90 percent of power plant mercury emissions. Instead, the EPA proposed a ""cap-and-trade"" approach that would reduce mercury by 70 percent by 2018. Under such proposals, companies must meet overall emissions caps, but can spread the reductions among various plants. Critics say such rules lead to pollution hot spots in areas where reductions are not made.\ Last week, EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt agreed to extend the public comment period on his agency's mercury reduction proposal by two months. Leavitt also said he would delay final agency action from December 2004 until March 2005.\ Environmental groups had sought the delays, wanting more time to comment and urging EPA to do more analysis of the issue.\ In previous congressional testimony, the UMW had generally supported the less stringent ""cap-and-trade"" approach, but with a less firm timeline and cap.\ The National Mining Association has praised the Bush proposal, saying that ""the flexibility inherent in a well-designed emissions trading program ... is preferable to the rigidities of unit or source-specific controls.""\ EPA has said that it is more difficult to control and reduce mercury emissions from lower-heating coals such as sub-bituminous coal. More research on such technology is needed, EPA said.\ On Friday, the union harshly criticized the regional variations in emissions limits that would result from the EPA proposal.\ ""Fact is, the Tri-State region of West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania has already lost 4,000 mining jobs since Bush took office,"" Roberts said. ""We believe the EPA mercury rules will only increase those numbers.""\ Frank O'Donnell, a spokesman for the Clean Air Trust in Washington, D.C., agreed with the UMW that ""the EPA proposal seems illogically crafted to aid sub-bituminous and lignite coal.\ ""But, the UMW approach would unnecessarily delay needed reductions in mercury,"" O'Donnell added.\ ""To be honest, I am actually a little surprised that the union would promote the concept of emission trading here, since the acid rain trading program is generally credited with boosting western coal production at the expense of higher-sulfur bituminous coal,"" he said.\ ""I am even more surprised because it is generally believed to be easier to remove more mercury from bituminous coal than from other types of coal,"" O'Donnell said. ""I would think more mining jobs would be created if EPA set a tough, across-the-board mercury standard.""\ Wendy Radcliff, who follows air pollution issues for the Appalachian Center for the Economy and the Environment, said, ""The health of West Virginians should not be overlooked in the argument of East versus West coal production.\ ""The UMW is right to be concerned about the Bush administration's plans, but they should be concerned that Bush does not have a plan that will immediately address the health effects of mercury on the environment and health of children and pregnant women,"" Radcliff said.\ To contact staff writer Ken Ward Jr., use e-mail or call 348- 1702."
34,"THANKS TO the go-ahead on offshore drilling, and despite much hand-wringing to the contrary, there are signs that America's energy amnesia is finally in remission. \Yet this good news gives rise to questions: Will an increase in offshore oil and natural gas production provide the impetus for developing other energy resources to shield consumers from high fuel prices? Will Congress address the need for coal and nuclear power? Or will nothing be done to help finance the construction of ""base-load"" power plants that use advanced technologies like coal-to-gas systems and carbon capture-and-storage?\Building additional electric power capacity is essential. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts a 29 percent increase in the demand for electricity by 2030. On top of that, more than half of our coal-fueled power plants are at least 40 years old. Many will have to be retired or refurbished. Environmental issues, particularly the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, are making these issues more difficult to deal with.\The problem facing many electric utilities is a lack of financing for power-plant construction. While almost everyone in Washington talks a good game about loan guarantees to help utilities obtain financing for new coal and nuclear power plants, the loans have yet to be made. Maintaining a strong electric-power system, however, is essential to restoring confidence in the economy.\Quite simply, we cannot afford to let the Wall Street financial crisis lead to a paralysis in power-plant construction. Coal and nuclear power are critically important to America's energy future because they account for more than 70 percent of electricity generation. Since they are domestic energy sources, coal and nuclear power don't contribute to our energy security or trade deficit problems.\The larger question is whether we can afford to leave the future of clean-coal technology and nuclear power to the free market. Loan guarantees are needed because possible delays caused by opponents of coal and nuclear power have made any new major construction project a financial risk. Electric utilities in most states are required by law to provide reliable power at a cost that's economical for customers. They have taken this responsibility seriously. Unfortunately, in today's environment, it has become increasingly difficult for them to meet those obligations.\Just 24 coal-fueled power plants are under construction, but no nuclear plants. The implications of this slowdown in power plant construction are disturbing. They go to the heart of industries such as chemicals, food processing, steel, aluminum, paper and textiles as well as new industries like computers and semiconductors. Indeed, should electricity supply fail to meet customer needs, the resulting curtailment of production and job layoffs will reverberate through our economy.\The irony is that we are headed for the very situation that our nation's long-term energy policy was designed to avoid. The trend is toward greater use of natural gas in electricity production, which means higher costs for consumers.\The financial burden on consumers will grow if the next administration and Congress impose a cap-and-trade system on carbon emissions before the technology for capturing and storing coal-plant emissions becomes available. Should that occur, utilities would be forced to shift from coal to high-priced natural gas, and not even increased offshore production will provide enough gas to go around. This is no time for ""business as usual"" on energy policy.\Lyons is a professor of engineering at WVU."
35,"Time to drop this ""war on coal"" talk. Time to ignore the hollering by coal country politicians over President Obama's beefed-up plan to combat global warming. No, the Clean Power Plan will not ruin their local economies, because coal has already done that, certainly in Appalachia. Look at those barren flats where majestic mountains once stood. The coal industry lopped off the mountaintops and fouled the streams, depriving West Virginia and eastern Kentucky of a key recruiting tool for modern employers prizing a healthy environment.\But let's not go overly negative here. Coal did its job. It powered 20th-century America. The Appalachian coal regions gave and gave. We honor their sacrifice.\So rather than call the new plan a war on coal, let us call it a retirement party for coal. Coal is the largest source of planet-warming gases. It must make room for 21st-century power.\Mother Nature has already offered us a foretaste of what she has in mind should global warming go unchecked. Higher temperatures have worsened drought in the West, igniting large swaths of California, Washington and Oregon.\Glacier National Park in northern Montana may sound like a cool, watery place. But tourists there have been abandoning their cars to flee wildfires. The glaciers themselves are melting and may be gone in 30 years.\Flooding in other parts of the country is part of the same climate phenomenon.\Natural gas emits about half as much carbon as does coal and can transition us to truly clean power. But the future is clearly renewable energy from such sources as the sun and wind.\The new rules push us in that direction. They will require utilities to generate at least 28 percent of their electric power from renewable sources by 2030. (Renewables accounted for only 13 percent last year.)\This is not mission impossible. In 2011, California mandated that 33 percent of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020. California's economy is booming - aided no doubt by all that clean-energy venture capital (almost 60 percent of America's total) flowing into the state.\Obama's plan promotes a cap-and-trade system. States place a limit on greenhouse gases and let businesses buy and sell permits to emit them. This market-based approach started off as a conservative idea. Do remember that when the opposition rails against the idea as ""cap and tax.\California already has a cap-and-trade system, and 10 other states have followed suit. At least 30 other states also have mandates for renewable energy.\Foes will no doubt bash the Clean Power Plan as radical, but the public should know that even these stricter regulations will not save us from global warming. They will only stop a free fall into planetary catastrophe.\What about other countries? A reasonable question. The plan will give Obama something serious to unfurl at the climate change summit this December in Paris. When the United States offers a plausible blueprint to meet the challenge, other countries, notably China, will be pressed to follow suit.\And what about the coal regions? Appalachia has considerable natural beauty left, a great location and plenty of water. Coal-producing Wyoming has its own attractions, some quite magnificent.\Coal is yesterday's fuel. Give it a respectful goodbye and dry the tears.\Credit: Froma Harrop"

37,"IN the quest to come up with an effective response to the climate change challenge, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is among the most promising options. \It greatly reduces industrial human-generated CO2 emissions, a major contributor to greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, from both existing and new fossil fueled energy producing facilities. This reduction is achieved by capturing CO2 before it is released to the atmosphere and storing it permanently and safely long term in deep geologic formations, often over a mile underground.\Many scientists and experts believe rising CO2 emissions from fossil fuels - coal, oil and natural gas - could adversely affect the Earth's atmosphere and climate. This concern, coupled with the reality that today over 85 percent of the world's primary energy supply comes from fossil fuels, makes CCS a fundamental requirement in attaining a sustainable world over the long-term.\The U.S. and other nations continue to introduce renewable energy supplies for electricity generation and production, but projections for the next 50 to 100 years recognize that plentiful and inexpensive supplies of coal, oil and natural gas will be the primary sources of energy in both developed and, especially, developing nations such as China and India. This is the reality; but it does not require making a choice between sustainability and affordability. With CCS we can choose both!\CCS implementation is critical and leadership is essential. The U.S. leads the combined efforts of the rest of the world in two areas: 1) project demonstration investment; and 2) Research Development and Deployment (RD&D).\Project demonstrations are commercial scale facilities that deploy CCS to gain essential experience in design, construction, and operation of these first-of-a-kind facilities. The RD&D that continues concurrent with these demonstrations is sustaining work required to further reduce costs and obstacles for existing technology and to transform CCS into game-changing innovations for tomorrow.\Leadership comes in many ways. Technology is the enabler but the market framework cannot be ignored. That is why the U.S. has and will continue to lead CCS toward commercial deployment.\In the absence of a global cost for CO2 emissions in either cap-and-trade or taxes, why should industry or governments invest in CCS? Because it is commercially and environmentally responsible to do so. To create the market driver for commercial advancement, the U.S. Department of Energy and its Office of Fossil Energy have recognized CO2 from fossil fueled facilities can make a significant contribution to projects and the economy through use in Enhanced Oil Recovery.\Enhanced Oil Recovery utilizes CO2 to increase the amount of crude oil that can be produced from otherwise depleted reservoirs. It allows maximizing our existing domestic resources and creates jobs, improves the balance of trade and enhances energy security. Meanwhile, it helps prevent man-made CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and safely and permanently stores CO2 in geologic formations. At DOE, we call this ""CCUS"" (carbon capture, utilization and storage) and believe it is good for both business and the environment. The U.S. has taken the lead globally in this CCUS effort that fundamentally will realize real reductions in CO2 greenhouse gas emissions while helping the economy. This leadership is built on a record of RD&D achievement by DOE and its industry partners:\- Over 30 years ago, DOE began supporting enhanced oil recovery research to improve processes and demonstrate them in the field. Today, by a large margin, the U.S. is the world leader, providing nearly 14 percent of domestic oil production. Fossil Energy has already envisioned a roadmap that could expand enhanced oil recovery to 30 to 40 percent of domestic production. The carbon footprint of enhanced oil recovery produced crude oil will be significantly lower than either domestic or imported conventional or unconventional oil.\- 1997 was the beginning of CCS RD&D by Fossil Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory. The lab is focused on sustainable long-term fossil fuel technology advancements and serves as the focal point for U.S. project deployments and collaboration with international initiatives and research.\It is now launching further efforts through many different globally recognized vehicles.\- In 2003, DOE helped form the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, an international climate change initiative originally focused on CCS and now carbon capture, utilization and storage.\That same year, Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships across the U.S. and Canada were established; they subsequently have completed over two dozen injection and storage tests demonstrating safe and permanent sequestration of millions of tons of CO2.\Credit: Charles D.

38,"Before just about the most interested audience he could possibly address - the West Virginia Coal Symposium - Gov. Joe Manchin further described his discussion about coal with President Obama. \Manchin on Thursday told representatives of West Virginia's coal industry that his meeting with Obama ""was an absolutely wonderful start"" to a dialogue about the future of coal and ""I know we moved the ball forward.""\Manchin and the governors from 10 other states met with Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and the administration's top environmental policy executives at the White House for an hour and a half on Wednesday to talk about energy.\""It was the most unbelievable meeting I've ever been in at that level,"" Manchin said Thursday in a speech at the 37th Annual West Virginia Mining Symposium. ""I got to say everything that was on my mind.""\Manchin participated in a conference call with reporters after the meeting with Obama, but Thursday's comments were his first before a public audience. He gave a blow-by-blow account of the conversation.\Manchin said he respectfully told Obama, ""'The perception is, this administration does not realize the value of what coal and coal-fired energy has done for this country and will do.' He said, 'We agree there's a transition.' I said, 'Yes, a transition over the next 20, 40 or 50 years.'\""That was our first agreement - there's a transition going on now.\""I said, 'The fuel of the future must be affordable, reliable and dependable,'"" Manchin recalled. ""'If not, we won't have a base load you can run the country on and be a world power.' I said, 'I don't think one of your economists or scientists have said it can be done without coal. Yet every roadblock put up hurts us.'""\Manchin distributed a handout he had state Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Randy Huffman compile showing ""what's gone on with the EPA, how they've intervened (with mine permits), how things have come to a halt. They've assured me I'll get answers on some of these things.""\The governor said he's convinced Obama believes the United States has to be a leader in clean energy or finding a fuel of the future. ""I'm OK with that,"" Manchin said. ""Where he and I differ is, I think they believe in using the carrot and the stick - that if they put enough costs on coal, they'll find another fuel quicker.""\Obama pointed out China's advances in developing clean energy technologies. ""I said, 'China is still using the product they depend on - the product they know is cost effective. We're wanting to put the cart before the horse. We're wanting to put the cost on energy before we have the alternative. We're regulating ourselves to where we can't compete in the market.'""\Manchin told the several hundred coal executives gathered at the Civic Center, ""Where I believe the whole thing is going is, it's the economy. Nobody can stand losing one job because we're not competitive. We can't justify coal unless we're trying to move to a transition fuel. But they've got to realize that you've got to use the product the Good Lord gave you.""\Manchin said he respectfully told the president, ""You believe we've turned a blind eye to the environment and safety."" But that's not true, Manchin said. When the state tightened its safety laws a few years ago after the Sago Mine disaster, ""Not one operator, not one miner said, 'That's too costly. We can't do it.' We sat down and found a cure. We're now a world safety leader. We can do the same with the environment.""\The governor told the coal executives, ""I can tell you nobody in that administration is acceptable with mountaintop removal. I said, 'I respectfully take exception. Your administration is blaming us for the sins of the past. But look at where we are today.'""\Manchin said he pointed out that West Virginia has a post-mining land-use policy.\""We say if you want to use the surface you have to plan for the land afterwards to diversify our economy. If we can't show you we can do that then we should not do it. But if we show you we can you should not impede us from doing it. You should work with us.""\Regarding mine permitting, Manchin said he made the point that, ""We want clarity."" He said he told federal Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson, ""We've got to find a way to operate, to know what's expected so we can all work together. We've got to find a direction.""\Manchin said he's hopeful that will happen.\Regarding the cap-and-trade legislation pending in the Senate, Manchin said Obama harkened back to the 1970s, when the coal industry and utilities fought regulations designed to reduce acid rain.\Manchin said he wasn't involved then but ""the bottom line is"" that back then the federal government ""put a stick to the industry if they didn't fix the problem,"" yet kept the money raised in an acid rain credit-trading program in the industry.\""Now you want a worldwide cap-and-trading program that doesn't direct the resources to fix the problem and at an increase in prices that will make us more noncompetitive,"" Manchin said he respectfully told the president.\""I think he (Obama) understands that on cap-and-trade as he proposed it, we will fight it.""\The governor praised Obama for creating an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage."" Manchin told the coal executives here on Thursday, ""If coal is paying 100 percent of the bill to transform the future, to find renewables, we should at least get 50 percent of the resources until that transition is complete.""\Manchin said of the White House meeting, ""I hope a lot of good will come out of it. I know we moved the ball forward. I think they understand this economy can't take a hit. We've lost major industries on a half a cent kilowatt-hour. I think they know how delicate this thing is.""\The governor told the coal executives, ""This administration is going to be there at least another three years. I'm going to stay right in their face. I'm going to be respectful. I'm going to speak out when I think they're going down the wrong road. When they do something good, I'll praise it.\""The meeting was an absolutely wonderful start. Was there meat? We're going to find out. It was a respectful dialogue. They've invited me back so I think they know I was respectful and appreciative but I also have very strong opinions. I will speak up for our citizens and what I think is right for this country.""\The coal symposium, sponsored by the West Virginia Coal Association, concludes today.\Contact writer George Hohmann at business@dailymail.com or 304-348-4836.\Credit: DAILY MAIL BUSINESS EDITOR"
39," FOR more than 15 years now, three presidents and the U.S. Congress have debated, delayed and denied the critical need for passage of a Climate Protection Act. During that time, according to NASA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have increased 17 percent. Average global temperatures are nearing a 12,000-year high point and hurricanes, droughts and heat waves are growing progressively worse.\ Numerous solutions that would reduce and eventually reverse the buildup of greenhouse gases already exist, but they are not being widely implemented. Recent landmark studies, such as the October 2006 Stern Report and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report on Feb. 2, recommend that governments begin implementing these solutions now to avoid future catastrophic economic and environmental consequences.\ The remedies can be generally categorized as political, consumer and industry solutions.\ The two most popular political solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are forms of regulation called cap-and-trade and carbon taxes. Under a cap-and-trade system, the government would establish maximum annual allowable gas emissions. Facilities that emitted below their permitted levels could sell the difference to another facility. This method is well established in countries who have signed the Kyoto agreement and it might be well suited for the United States, given the profit motive inherent in our capitalist system. Carbon taxes are levied against the volume of greenhouse gases emitted or the carbon content of fossil fuels. This system probably wouldn't be viable in the United States since neither consumers nor industry like tax hikes.\ Congress has debated and heard scientific testimony on the dangers of climate change since the National Academies of Science issued its first report on global warming in 1979. The United States is still the world's greatest emitter of greenhouse gases with just 5 percent of the planet's population contributing an enormous 25 percent of the total. Clearly any attempt at mitigating the impacts of climate change requires our cooperation. If the next president breaks his or her campaign promise to make climate change a priority, as the past three presidents have failed in their commitments, a Climate Protection Act may take another decade. We need to focus more on Earth's schedule and less on bipartisan bickering. There are other political solutions besides waiting on Congress to do nothing.\ A powerful coalition of individual states might ratify cap-and- trade legislation. California, the nation's largest greenhouse gas emitter, enacted a climate change law in 2006 that set caps and emission reduction goals. If states such as New York, Florida and Illinois, who are significant emitters, enacted laws mirroring California's law with reciprocal cap-and-trade agreements, a large percent of the United States' GHG output would be regulated. A federal law would be a preferable option, but such state action may spur Washington out of its lethargy.\ The easiest strategies - consumer solutions - require no government involvement at all. Since about 70 percent of the energy we use is derived from fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases, energy conservation is a major tool to fight climate change. Many of these conservation strategies have been around for more than 20 years and are discussed in detail in Al Gore's book and movie An Inconvenient Truth (2006), in 50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth (1989) and in The Green Consumer (1988). The good news about consumer solutions is that they save money and the environment. Some of these solutions include: using compact fluorescent bulbs, buying more fuel-efficient cars, washing with cold water, buying energy-saving appliances and properly insulating our homes. A national energy policy that prioritizes conservation would help, but until that happens, wise shopping will help tremendously.\ According to a 2004 study, all the industrial and technical solutions to solve the climate change problem during the next 50 years have been invented and are now already available. Besides energy conservation, solutions include increased use of biofuels, wind power, geothermal power, solar power, better forest management and carbon capture and storage from power plants. Many lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry are quick to point out that renewable energy sources only supply a tiny percent of our power. True. Only about 10 percent of America's energy now originates from renewables. However, their full potential has not been tapped because they are not implemented on a grand scale yet. Plus, the availability of cheap coal and the artificially low cost of gasoline haven't helped. If fossil fuel lobbyists were serious about the environment, they'd stop their misinformation campaigns about climate change in the media and Congress. Finally, the really great news is that in 2006 investors plowed more than $63 billion into clean-energy technologies, according to The Economist. The free enterprise system is more powerful than Exxon and the U.S. government combined.\ Tyree is a former geologist for the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and is a part-time volunteer with the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition."
40,"Environmental groups are urging Congress to strengthen energy efficiency policies in national legislation, saying it could lead to added job creation and household savings. \West Virginia was estimated to create 1,900 new jobs, save an average of $237 in yearly household costs and reduce annual carbon emissions by 3.8 million metric tons by 2020 under the proposed American Clean Energy and Security Act, according to Environment America, which cited a report released this month by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\The Washington, D.C.-based council estimates that additional energy efficiency improvements could help boost those numbers to 2,900 new jobs in West Virginia over the next 10 years and lower average household costs in the state by $288 a year.\""Greater efficiency is the key for greater cost reduction under the bill,"" Steve Nadel, the nonprofit council's executive director, said Wednesday.\New jobs could include weatherizing homes, retrofitting buildings, engineering more energy-efficient appliances and technology and building super-efficient new buildings, according to the citizen-funded advocacy group Environment America.\""Energy efficiency is one of the tools you can use to accomplish the global warming pollution reductions required under cap and trade,"" said the group's preservation associate, Alison Adams, who held a news conference in Charleston on Wednesday. ""It is the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way of reducing our energy use and pollution.""\The proposed cap-and-trade policy in the national energy legislation would limit greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the air and would allow companies to trade or sell allowances for such emissions. The bill, which passed the House in June, was currently delayed in the Senate.\Enhancements to energy efficiency provisions in the bill that the council has proposed in its study include:\* Requiring that utility companies show a 10 percent reduction in energy use compared with a 5 percent to 8 percent reduction. Utility companies would help residential and business customers reduce energy use by promoting energy-efficient light bulbs, heating and cooling equipment, insulation and other retrofits. The companies would then demonstrate savings from the program equal to 10 percent of their sales.\* Requiring electric utilities to use a third of their allowances from the cap-and-trade provision for energy efficiency, just as gas utilities would be required to under the bill.\* Keeping the total states' share of the emissions allowances value - much of which would go toward energy efficiency - at 9.5 percent, rather than decline starting in 2016.\Energy efficiency programs cost utilities a lot less per kilowatt hour than building a new power plant, Nadel said.\""We find that the efficiency programs are averaging about 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity they save,"" Nadel said. ""Whereas power from a new power plant costs 8 to 14 cents per kilowatt hour.""\""So the big advantage to the utility and its rate payers is - this is less expensive,"" Nadel said.\Utilities would design and operate their programs with some oversight from state utility commissions, Nadel said.\""They would have to pay for the program,"" Nadel said. ""But they are less expensive than the alternative, which is building new power plants.""\Appalachian Power spokeswoman Jeri Matheney was checking with company officials for comment on the proposed enhancements but said Wednesday that both Appalachian Power and its parent company, American Electric Power, support the American Clean Energy and Security Act.\Meanwhile, the state also can consider legislation of its own to promote energy efficiency, said West Virginia Environmental Council member Vickie Wolfe, who hopes to revive a bill that failed in the last regular session that would have included a revenue sharing mechanism for utilities so that if the utility could lower a customer's bill it could keep a higher profit rate.\""West Virginia needs to be doing its part,"" Wolfe said.\Wolfe attended the news conference, along with Sen. Randy White, D-Webster, who called energy-efficient technology a ""win-win.""\While there is no easy answer to issues of climate change and energy security and affordability, ""the closest thing to a silver bullet is energy efficiency,"" White said.\""We're talking about being able to save the consumer and the coal miners and families in general, a cost-effective way of saving money,"" said White, whose 11th district also includes Clay, Fayette, Nicholas and Upshur counties. ""If you're not using as much energy to run your washers, dryers, refrigerators, whatever, that directly goes back into the pocket of the consumer.""\As far as new energy efficient jobs, West Virginia, for example, manufactures a lot of windows and is working on pilot projects with carbon sequestration, White said.\""Being able to safely take carbon out of the production of electricity and through carbon sequestration will create jobs here in West Virginia,"" White said. ""The technology that we learn here is also something that we can export to other countries.""\""The United States needs to be a leader in new technology,"" White said.\Contact writer Michelle Saxton at michelle.saxton@dailymail.com or 304-348-4843.\Credit: DAILY MAIL CAPITOL REPORTER"
41,"SEATTLE - Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has gained national attention for rolling out some of the most ambitious climate initiatives in the country, signing pacts with other Western states and speaking at an international summit. But during the legislative session that ended recently, Inslee failed in his own state to pass carbon-reduction proposals, including the centerpiece cap-and-trade plan to charge emissions from oil refineries, power plants and fuel suppliers.\The Democratic governor also conceded to a Republican provision that set back another climate initiative: He signed a $16.1 billion transportation package that prevents any state agency from implementing a low carbon fuel standard for eight years.\Inslee, who has made climate change a key issue since taking office in 2013, blamed the Senate Republican majority, saying the party ""is now in the stranglehold of the oil and gas industry.\""I have proposed many, many proposals to reduce carbon pollution in the state, the governor told reporters Friday. ""The state Senate has acted on no meaningful carbon pollution.\Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, who chairs the committee dealing with environment issues, said Inslee's ""remark disparaging Senate Republicans is misplaced.\He noted that the Democrat-controlled House failed to pass the governor's climate plan out of its own chamber.\""Unfortunately, the legislative agenda he pursued is more geared toward a national or international landscape than one small state with a low-carbon emission footprint, Ericksen said.\The governor knew it would be difficult, but it didn't dissuade him from trying, Inslee spokesman David Postman said. ""He isn't going to make it easy for lawmakers to avoid the discussion and debate, he said.\Mark Stephan, associate professor of political science at Washington State University Vancouver, said Inslee is looking at the bigger picture.\Credit: Phuong Le The Associated Press"

43,"WASHINGTON - Three Democratic governors told a Senate panel Tuesday that efforts to curb global warming and spur the development of cleaner sources of energy have created jobs and new businesses in their states, a trend that could expand nationwide if Congress passes federal legislation. \All three states - New Jersey, Colorado, and Washington - have adopted measures to achieve reductions in the gases blamed for global warming and standards requiring a certain percentage of electricity from renewable sources.\But this view was not shared by all state leaders testifying Tuesday before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, including North Dakota's Republican governor and a Democratic state legislator from Arkansas, highlighting regional differences in addressing climate change.\A bill passed earlier this summer by the House that is now under consideration by the Senate would impose the first nationwide limits on greenhouse gases and require electric utilities to produce at least 12 percent of their power from pollution-free sources by 2020.\""If there is a lesson...for other states and the nation as a whole, it is that good energy policy and climate policy can energize the economy and help create good-paying private sector jobs,"" said Colorado Gov.

He told the panel national leadership was needed to create the energy future the country needs.\But Republican Gov.

45," A Bush administration decision to propose reducing mercury emissions by 70 percent over the next 15 years instead of a previously discussed 90 percent reduction in five years raises some health questions for West Virginia residents, a medical official said.\ Dr. Alan Ducatman, chairman of West Virginia University's Department of Community Medicine, said the questions raised by the proposal are difficult to answer because, as far as he knows, the state population's exposure to mercury emissions and the health effects of that exposure never have been studied adequately.\ What is known is that the people living closest to the plants or other airborne mercury sources are the ones most likely to be affected.\ ""Most of the danger, if there is any danger, is going to be within 20 miles of the plant,"" Ducatman said.\ In particular, that's the traveling distance for organic mercury generated by coal burning, which is the kind of mercury most likely to get inside a human body and do damage.\ The closer someone lives to a plant or other airborne mercury source, the more likely they are to also breathe in metallic mercury, which also can cause damage. Metallic mercury also tends to end up in the water where it undergoes a chemical change and builds up in fish flesh.\ While the state has studied mercury accumulation in fish, he couldn't recall off the top of his head any studies of airborne exposures, Ducatman added.\ According to the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, West Virginia ranked fifth for the amount of mercury released into the air by its electric utilities in 2001. The other top five states, in order, were Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana.\ American Electric Power Co.'s John Amos plant released about 19 percent of the state's total mercury emissions from power plants in 2001. Dominion Energy's Mount Storm plant in Grant County was the largest source at 29 percent.\ An EPA study released earlier this year, ""America's Children and the Environment,"" found that about 8 percent of women of childbearing ages have mercury levels in their blood that are high enough to cause concern.\ Mercury exposure can cause neurological damage, particularly in children, and also causes birth defects and developmental disabilities in children, according to the study.\ The EPA originally looked at a requirement that all coal-fired boilers install the ""maximum achievable control technology"" - also known as MACT - for mercury emissions.\ Under the proposal announced earlier this month, the administration is considering a MACT option and a cap-and-trade option.\ Under a cap-and-trade system, the federal government would cap the total amount of mercury power plants could emit annually, but allow them to trade ""emission credits"" among themselves so that some plants could continue emitting higher mercury levels while others install control devices.\ A main economic advantage of a cap-and-trade system is that it allows the affected companies to decide where pollution controls would be most cost-effective. The MACT proposal, by comparison, would require them to install controls on all plans within three years after the regulations took effect.\ The EPA claims the MACT option only would reduce mercury emissions by 30 percent while the cap-and-trade proposal would reduce it by 70 percent.\ Environmental groups claim the agency previously said the MACT alternative would reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent.\ EPA spokeswoman Cynthia Bergman said the agency never said that.\ ""That has never been an official proposal,"" she said.\ Praveen Amar, director of science and policy for the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, said Bergman is technically correct ""because the mercury MACT never got proposed.""\ The Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management is an interstate group made up of the air quality directors of the six Northeast states plus New York and New Jersey.\ Amar was one of the stakeholders who worked on the technology option for EPA. While both the agency and the stakeholder group used the same test data from real-life efforts to control power plant mercury emissions, the agency ultimately used a different methodology for analyzing how effective the technology was, he said.\ The Northeast group conducted its own analysis of the data that confirmed the technology option could cut mercury emissions by 91 percent.\ ""That's what we said. We're still saying that,"" Amar said. ""I think we have a much higher faith in technology that EPA does.""\ One aspect of the different proposals is that the technology proposal would cost utilities, and therefore, ratepayers more in the short run while the cap-and-trade proposal the Bush administration favors would maintain higher levels of mercury emissions in return for lower electricity costs.\ Ducatman said the tradeoff is difficult to quantify.\ ""I think we're allowing ourselves to continue to be exposed to a clear health hazard, but we don't know if that level of exposure causes human health effects,"" he said.\ Mark Burton, an economist at Marshall University, said the information from Ducatman and Amar raises questions about the Bush proposal.\ In particular, cap-and-trade systems generally rely on the same population sharing both the disadvantages and benefits of delaying pollution controls. With most of the mercury effects taking place within 20 miles of the source, however, that the population around the plant would carry most of the burden of delaying controls while ratepayers generally would receive the benefit, he said.\ ""That really does change things,"" he said.\ There's also the larger unanswered question of how much of a health hazard is created by using less strict standards over a longer time, he said.\ ""What the correct tradeoff is, I don't know,"" Burton said.\ However, in his initial review of the Bush administration mercury proposal, Burton said he's not too alarmed.\ ""There have been some energy and environmental issues where the Bush administration has been rightly criticized, but I don't think this is one of them,"" he said.\ However, Amar said another tradeoff of particular importance to West Virginia is that the mercury in Central Appalachian coal tends to be oxidized and, therefore, is easier to remove than the mercury in western coal, which tend to be more elemental and, therefore, harder to capture in a power plant's emissions.\ Since 1990, Clean Air Act provisions have been giving western coal an edge on eastern coal because it was easier to meet other sulfur dioxide emission standards by switching to low-sulfur western coal than to install the scrubbers needed to burn eastern coal.\ As evidence, 150 scrubbers were installed before 1990 while only 26 have been installed since, he said.\ ""Now, in respect to mercury, it's the opposite,"" Amar said.\ With a scrubber and another pollution control device required by nitrogen oxide standards, a plant burning eastern coal can usually meet the toughest mercury standard without having to install additional pollution controls, he said.\ Consequently, if the administration goes with the MACT standard and requires a 90-percent reduction, it would give eastern coal more of an edge in the market, Amar said.\ Writer Brian Bowling can be reached at 348-4842 or by e-mail at brianbowling@dailymail.com."
46,"WASHINGTON - Hours before the House passed its cap-and-trade bill last week, freshman Democrats Tom Perriello and Frank Kratovil were pondering the political fallout of the votes they were about to cast in favor of a plan Republicans were denouncing as ""cap and tax."" \""Maybe we should be called the conscience caucus,"" said the 34-year-old Perriello, who won his Southside Virginia district last year by 727 votes, even as Barack Obama was losing it by 7,512.\He recalls Kratovil, 41, replying that perhaps they would be known as the caucus of soon-to-be unemployed congressmen.\Kratovil, who narrowly won a Maryland district that Obama lost to John McCain by 18 points, does not remember his precise reply to Perriello, but he acknowledges that ""it would have been easier politically not to take that vote.""\That some highly vulnerable Democrats in the House were willing to face tens of thousands of dollars worth of Republican attack ads as the price of supporting a bill to curb global warming is the untold story of what, so far, is the year's most dramatic legislative showdown.\Accounts of the battle typically focus on how many industry giveaways were added to the bill to get it passed, how much it had to be weakened to round up the necessary votes, and how much pressure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Obama brought to win a 219-to-212 majority.\All of that is true, but it misses another dimension of the fight: a number of relatively young, politically vulnerable House members who had campaigned on promises to cleanse the environment decided that this vote was a risk worth taking. ""A bill created by the old politics,"" says Perriello, ""was passed by the new politics.""\Well, yes, but as Perriello is the first to acknowledge, old politics operated right to the end.\Take the cases of Kratovil and Colorado's Betsy Markey, another freshman Democrat from a district Obama lost. Both represent significant numbers of farmers. Their votes weren't secured until the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., won last-minute changes protecting farm interests.\For Kratovil, one key was making sure that Maryland farmers, who already work under stringent state-imposed environmental standards, would receive the same benefits under the bill as farmers in states with less-demanding rules.\For Markey, major issues included helping rural electric cooperatives and protecting dairy farmers who feared the bill might impose a ""cow tax"" on cattle for producing methane by way of, shall we say, a thoroughly natural process.\Kratovil said he could not have supported a bill that hurt agriculture, ""which is huge as an economic engine vital to my district."" With the amendments, he was free to vote in line with his core campaign promises: to promote ""renewable fuel, to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, and to protect the environment,"" including the Chesapeake Bay.\But another factor is changing the political calculus: the rise of a substantial alternative-energy business that encompasses wind and solar. For the first time, the political meaning of the word ""energy"" is not confined to oil and gas, even if old energy is still far more connected politically.\Among the employers in Markey's district are Vestas, a leading supplier of wind power, and Abound Solar, a spinoff of research at Colorado State University that manufactures photovoltaic panels.\Markey adds that a large strip of her district is one of the most promising parts of the country for producing wind energy, and ""this bill really helps our eastern plains.""\Underscoring the dawn of a new energy politics were the eight Republican votes cast in favor of the bill, notably those of Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Castle of Delaware. Both are considering campaigns for the U.S. Senate next year, and they might see a future that others in their party don't.\Still, for many potentially vulnerable Democrats who backed the bill, there will be short-run political pain. Perriello and Markey were among 14 House members targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee for their votes. In Perriello's case, a tough television ad predicts huge increases in electricity prices.\Perriello is philosophical about the assault, although he says he's surprised that Republicans are ""using information they know is fundamentally wrong."" He plans to use the July 4th weekend in his district to talk about the urgency of energy independence and the potential for renewable energy jobs. Perriello's fate will be a test of just how new our politics have become."
47,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) In 2007, Australians were ready to do something to combat climate change, even if it was expensive. More than two-thirds of them said so in a poll, and both major political parties vowed to make industries pay for greenhouse-gas emissions. The undoing of that perspective will likely be complete after a new Senate is sworn in today. It's expected to give Prime Minister Tony Abbott the votes he needs to repeal a 2-year-old tax charged to around 350 of Australia's biggest carbon polluters. Three top political leaders lost their jobs over the issue as support for climate-change measures plummeted.\A global recession, political miscalculations and failed negotiations only partially explain the dramatic change.\Opponents of the carbon tax implemented in 2012 had the media largely on their side. Electricity prices soared - not mainly because of the tax, but because power companies were spending billions on infrastructure. Most electricity users were compensated for the added cost of the tax, but many of them didn't know that. And rising gas prices fed the fury - even though the tax didn't apply to gasoline.\Australia's experience illustrates how easy it is to scuttle complicated environmental laws, and serves as a warning to President Barack Obama, whose recent proposal to force a 30 percent cut in power plants' carbon emissions is drawing anger from both sides of politics.\""One of the keys was the fact that we did lose bipartisan support for emissions trading as one of the solutions, said John Connor, CEO of the Sydney-based Climate Institute think tank. ""And that then threw this issue into the sort of political and cultural trench warfare that you see in the U.S., but not so much of elsewhere.\Australians' concerns about global warming peaked before elections in 2007. Prime Minister John Howard had grown unpopular for joining Washington in refusing to accept U.N. Kyoto Protocol targets for cutting carbon emissions. Both Australia and the U.S. are leading producers of coal, a major source of the pollution.\An annual poll by the Lowy Institute for International Policy shows the proportion of Australian voters who saw global warming as a serious problem that demanded immediate steps - even at significant cost - peaked at 68 percent in 2006. The telephone survey of 1,007 voters had a 3.1 percentage-point margin of error.\Facing defeat, Howard's conservative coalition back-flipped. Both sides advocated a cap-and-trade scheme in which free-market forces set the price of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide.\Kevin Rudd's center-left Labor Party won, but the Senate thwarted his efforts to introduce a cap-and-trade system. Some senators considered his plan too extreme, while others found it too weak. Meanwhile, the global economic crisis eclipsed the environment in Australian politics.\The government and the leader of Australia's conservative opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, were on the verge of a cap-and-trade deal in 2009. But Turnbull lost his leadership post to Abbott, then a senior opposition leader and a fierce opponent of the proposal.\Rudd shelved the plan. His popularity plummeted, and he lost his job in a Labor Party leadership vote to Julia Gillard.\The minor Greens party soon became pivotal. Rather than a cap-and-trade scheme, the Greens advocated a carbon tax in which government, not the market, set the price of pollution. After the 2010 election, Gillard needed the Greens' support to form a government. To get it, she agreed to a carbon tax, something she had vowed not to allow.\The tax, which went into effect in July 2012, charged major polluters a fixed price on carbon. It was to switch in mid-2015 to a cap-and-trade scheme, with a floating price set by market forces and linked to the European Union market.\Gillard and her government's popularity nose-dived. The 2012 Lowy poll showed support for costly steps to combat global warming hit bottom: 38 percent.\While Gillard's broken promise drove much of that anger, other forces were at work.\Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns 70 percent of Australia's newspapers, supported Rudd in 2007 but by 2010 was backing Abbott. The top talk radio hosts in every major Australian city pushed the climate skeptic line.\Within days of the tax taking effect, Australia's consumer watchdog cautioned two companies that sold solar panels for falsely claiming electricity prices under the tax would rise 400 percent by 2019. The managing director of a major bakery franchise resigned over a memo in which he urged store owners to raise prices and ""let the carbon tax take the blame. There were hundreds of complaints of misleading advertising and price-gouging.\It was easy to attribute higher electricity costs to the tax. Between 2006 and last year, the average Australian household power bill increased more than 85 percent, the Grattan Institute think tank reported.\But the government says the tax has accounted for only around 9 percent of the increase since July 2012. And most households were compensated through tax breaks or welfare.\Grattan said about half the rate hikes were related to expensive upgrades by Australian electricity providers. The companies can increase rates to recoup capital expenditures. Many critics accused them of ""gold plating their networks but industry officials said they were improving infrastructure to meet rising demand.\Opinion polls indicated Australians were overestimating the impact of the carbon tax.\A survey by the think tank Per Capita soon after the tax started found that most people blamed it for higher gasoline prices - even though the tax didn't apply at the pump.\Most estimated the tax increased their weekly cost of living by $19 or more, about twice the government's estimate. And while 90 percent of households received tax-related government compensation, half those surveyed said they hadn't received anything. The Per Capita online survey of 1,422 Australians did not publish a margin of error.\By 2013, six years after Howard's government was reeling over its failure to respond to climate change, the Labor Party was scrambling to undo its response.\Party lawmakers ousted Gillard and restored Rudd, who promised to ditch the tax and begin the cap-and-trade scheme earlier, greatly reducing the cost of a ton of carbon. Abbott's conservative coalition won the 2013 elections in a landslide, anyway.\Abbott promised to replace the tax with a AU$2.55 billion fund to help polluters convert to cleaner technologies. He also has said Australians will be able to keep the government compensation they began receiving to defray carbon-tax costs.\""The irony of all this is that Tony Abbott did describe the whole thing as socialism dressed up as environmentalism, and it's interesting that what he's taken away is the environmentalism, but keeping the tax shifts, or the socialism, if you like, said Connor, of the Climate Institute.\When new senators take their seats Monday, Abbott should have enough votes for repeal. Clive Palmer, a coal mining magnate and carbon tax critic who created the Palmer United Party, leads an influential voting bloc of four new senators.\In a bizarre twist June 25, climate change activist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore offered congratulations as Palmer announced his party would vote to repeal the tax. Palmer won Gore's praise by supporting a future cap-and-trade scheme and backing Australia's commitment to boost wind, solar and hydroelectric energy.\As Obama has sought support for the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed carbon rules, he has noted the political perils.\""If we're blithe about saying this is the defining issue of our time but we don't address people's legitimate economic concerns, then even if they are concerned about climate change they may not support efforts to do something about it, he told the League of Conservation Voters last month.\Australia's tax faces its demise as support for change appears to be rebounding. Forty-five percent of respondents in this year's Lowy poll see global warming as a ""serious and pressing problem, up 5 percentage points from 2013 - Australia's hottest year on record.\Meanwhile, Australians are limiting pollution themselves. Australia's power consumption declined for the first time in 2010, and has fallen every year since. Its greenhouse gas emissions dropped a record 0.8 percent from 2012 to 2013.\One reason for the change, according to an Australian Institute think tank report, was all the carbon tax attention.

48,"WASHINGTON - The caller needed no introduction - except, perhaps, to Sen. Joe Manchin. ""He says, Joe, this is Donald.' And I'm thinking, Donald who?'the West Virginia Democrat remembered from the first time President Donald Trump called his cellphone. ""I didn't know the voice. Then I kind of got who it was, and I said, Oh, Mr. President-elect.\That late November conversation was the beginning of an unlikely bond between the coal-country politician and New York real estate mogul, a relationship that's turned Manchin into one of the Democrats' best - and nearly only - conduits into the new Republican administration.\In Manchin, Trump sees the potential for a partner in a Democratic Party that's all but declared war on his agenda.\In Trump, Manchin sees a lifeboat for his brand of bipartisan politicking. A centrist from a state that went overwhelmingly for Trump, West Virginia's only congressional Democrat now finds himself in the middle of the political hurricane sweeping through Washington.\Fueled by a wave of national protests, furious Democrats are demanding nothing short of complete resistance to Trump's agenda from lawmakers. Republicans, meanwhile, see Manchin as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in next year's midterm contests.\While not quite friends, Manchin and Trump have developed a political rapport. They call each other directly on their cellphones, have met at Trump Tower and even flirted with the idea of a Cabinet post. Manchin has met twice with Vice President Mike Pence, who has made frequent visits to Capitol Hill, and he has an open line to some of the administration's top aides.\""Trump's looking to do stuff, and Manchin sees how popular he is here in West Virginia, said Chris Regan, who lost the chairmanship of the state Democratic Party to a Manchin ally in June. ""And he's looking to see if some of that rubs off on him.\Manchin said his pragmatic approach hasn't changed since he was a state legislator in West Virginia; it's Washington that's grown more divided.\He said he's committed to remaining a member of the Democratic Party and is hopeful he'll be able to negotiate with a man he describes as a consummate deal maker. But he isn't giving the new leader of the free world much advice.\""He is who he is. He's not going to change, Manchin said during an interview with The Associated Press at his Senate office. ""And if you're a Democrat and you take it personally when he attacks, you better understand he respects also when you think you're right and you fight back. So don't be so mealy mouthed about it.\So far, Manchin has voiced opposition to just one of Trump's nominees: Betsy DeVos for education secretary. This past week, he was the first Senate Democrat to meet with Trump's Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch.\""We'll see whether Manchin stands up or if he caves on this as well, said Kurt Walters, campaign director of the left-wing group Demand Progress, which has been organizing protests against Democratic senators.\The pressure is coming from both sides: Conservative groups have said they will spend more than $10 million pushing Senate Democrats to confirm Trump's nominee.\""I'm sure when I run they'll all try to beat me, Manchin said. ""That's the way the gig goes, but that doesn't mean I don't try to still make this place work.\David Urban, a Republican lobbyist who ran Trump's presidential campaign in Pennsylvania, credited Manchin as someone ""who has reached across the aisle to try to work with Republicans.\There's no guarantee Manchin's seat won't be a GOP target. ""He's got a D' after his name, Urban said.\Former aides said both sides would be foolish to misjudge Manchin's deep connections to his home state, where he served as governor for six years.\""Never underestimate Joe. He's masterful at what he does, said Republican Gil White, who worked for Manchin as his chief legislative liaison.\A former carpet store owner from a small mining town, Manchin has shown an almost reflexive need to try and confound his party's leadership.\After firing a rifle at President Barack Obama's ""cap and trade energy bill in a 2010 campaign ad, he ended up becoming a surprising ally for Obama during his 2013 push to craft a bipartisan deal on background checks for gun purchases. The bill failed.\Manchin recognizes some of his past positions may hurt him, particularly his support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, which earned him the label ""Traitor Joe.\Within the Obama administration, Manchin became better known, perhaps, for what he was against. Manchin opposed the nuclear agreement with Iran in 2015 and sided with a Republican-backed bill to halt federal funding for Planned Parenthood. And as a lawmaker representing thousands of coal workers, Manchin has long derided Obama's environmental regulations as a ""war on coal that failed to strike the proper balance between the needs of the environment and industry.\The coal industry has also been a focus of his conversations with Trump, Manchin said. He's asked the president to back legislation that would ensure long-term health and pension benefits for retired coal miners, which he said are at risk because of a host of coal-company bankruptcies.\""I'm trying everything I can, Manchin said.

50,"Republicans are attempting to undermine Gov. Joe Manchin's apparently firm support of the coal industry. \Their prime target is the 2009 Alternative and Renewable Energy Portfolio Act, a relatively little-known state law backed by the Democratic governor's administration.\The act forces state power companies to produce a quarter of the state's electricity using renewable or alternative energy sources by 2025.\Currently, 99 percent of the power consumed in the state comes from traditional coal-fired power plants.\Republican U.S. Senate candidate John Raese says Manchin is behind ""West Virginia's own version of cap and trade.""\He calls the Energy Portfolio Act a direct attack on the coal industry. He has been telling audiences across the state about the law, saying it will force utility companies to move away from coal to other, less familiar sources of power.\""Is he going to burn Banana Wackies?"" Raese said recently, referring to an old General Mills cereal.\But the West Virginia law is different from the Obama cap-and-trade bill in key respects and is also unlike similar proposals in other states. For one thing, the law does not set any cap on emissions. The bill also counts coal as an ""alternative"" energy source, so long as it is burned more cleanly than it is today.\Even Raese concedes the law is ""not quite as severe"" as the federal cap-and-trade plan, which is intended to address global climate change by limiting the greenhouse gases in the air. The gases, primarily carbon dioxide, are a major byproduct in the burning of coal.\Manchin campaign manager Sara Payne Scarbro said coal would remain ""a huge part of our state's energy portfolio for many years.""\""This act is a responsible approach,"" Scarbro said. ""Our state can be a leader when it comes to meeting our nation's future energy needs, while also balancing our economy and our environment.""\For his part, Manchin said he strongly opposes the Obama administration's stalled and unpopular cap-and-trade plan.\""President Obama is wrong on cap and trade,"" Manchin said at a Wednesday rally for the coal industry in Washington. ""Lisa Jackson is wrong with the EPA attacking the energy that fuels America.""\Jackson is the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\But Raese and some state GOP lawmakers say the only reason the state has the law is to please Washington Democrats.\""I think that Manchin does just anything he can conceive of to make Obama happy with him and certainly this is his centerpiece,"" Raese said.\Some 29 states have adopted so-called energy portfolios, which are meant to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and dependence on traditional coal-fired power.\The goal of West Virginia's law is clear: lower carbon dioxide emissions; attract new businesses and jobs; and increase the state's ability to generate power.\The law mandates a move away from traditional coal-fired power plants but not necessarily from coal itself.\Getting such a law in West Virginia was one of Manchin's top priorities in 2009. He highlighted the plan in his State of the State Address.\The law's goals seem ambitious for a state that gets nearly all its power from coal: It requires the state to get 10 percent of its power from renewable or alternative energy sources by 2015; 15 percent by 2020; and 25 percent by 2025.\But the law here is not a ""cap-and-trade"" plan in the strictest sense. For one thing, it does not require companies to reduce their carbon emissions. It requires them only to increase their mix of non-traditional electric generation.\It's theoretically possible - though highly unlikely - that carbon dioxide emissions could actually increase so long as companies also increased the ratio of clean coal, wind, solar and hydroelectric power they generate.\But Delegate Daryl Cowles, R-Morgan, who has closely followed the law, said even without a strict cap there is an implicit cap.\""It's a little bit to dance around and say there is no cap,"" he said. ""There is a cap - only 75 percent of your energy can come from traditional sources here in West Virginia.""\Complying with the law might not be as daunting as it seems, at least in the short term.\About 99 percent of the power consumed in West Virginia comes from coal - the other 1 percent is from hydroelectricity. But the state already has the capacity to produce at least 3.6 percent of its power from hydroelectricity and wind. That's according to a 2008 federal estimate of state renewable energy capacity. The actual figure is certain to have increased since then as new windmills have come online.\But West Virginia isn't able to count much of that for its own because utility companies in other states pay to claim much of this state's renewable power production. They do that to comply with their own states' renewable energy standards.\Some states already are using their own complicated credit trading systems similar to the one power companies in West Virginia are now going to have to become a part of.\The state Public Service Commissions is currently working on the system so utility companies here can buy and sell renewable or alternative energy credits. Under such a system, a coal-fired power plant could buy renewable energy credits from a wind farm to meet the standards set by the law.\Large utilities, such as Appalachian Power, are expected to begin investing in wind or hydroelectric power generation on their own to comply with the law.\Manchin expected the Energy Portfolio Act to encourage private investment in wind, solar and other renewable power sources and also spur investment in research on so-called ""clean coal"" technology.\""We can't simply abandon the way we live and generate electricity, but we must find newer and cleaner ways to produce energy with the abundance of resources we already have,"" he said during his 2009 State of the State.\Manchin said the investment would be a step toward expanding the state's energy portfolio.\But most states are forcing a move to ""renewable"" energy in their portfolios, which typically means power sources like solar or wind energy.\West Virginia is one of only four states that also allow ""alternative"" energy to count as part of the portfolio. ""Alternative"" energy includes power produced by natural gas or ""clean coal.""\Theoretically, the state could meet all the goals while continuing to burn coal and natural gas, neither of which is a renewable energy source.\Bruce Burcat, the executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, which includes eight states and D.C., said other states require power companies to generate a certain of amount of wind or solar power to meet their portfolio standard. West Virginia doesn't do that.\""In essence, it's possible that a significant portion, if not the whole thing, could be made up of 'alternative technologies' - and not necessarily renewable technologies - with a strong emphasis on coal and natural gas,"" said Burcat, whose group primarily advocates wind energy.\The only limits West Virginia set work the other way: Manchin asked lawmakers to amend the law in fall 2009 after it had been passed earlier that spring to prevent electricity generated by natural gas from making up more than a tenth of the overall yearly goal. He did the same thing for coal burned in supercritical boilers, a technology already used in many West Virginia power plants.\That means that by 2025 current natural gas and coal technology can account for a combined 5 percent of the 25 percent renewable or alternative energy goal.\The law still allows other clean coal technologies to account for an unlimited portion of the portfolio, meaning coal could be used without limit so long as it is burned more efficiently than today.\True ""clean coal"" technology is not yet widely available or cheap and is being tested only on a small scale. Republicans say that will drive up the cost of complying with the law - a cost that likely will be passed on to power company customers.\Cowles said preventing coal and natural gas from being used more extensively was a mistake. While he was one of the few Republicans who voted for the bill in the spring, he voted against the changes in the fall.\""I think the final product is far too heavy for the rate payers of West Virginia to carry, and I think it came as a result of a little bit of trickery and objections from the feds in D.C.,"" Cowles said.\Cost is an as-yet-unknown consequence of the bill.\Lobbyists from Appalachian Power told state lawmakers last year the bill could force a rate hike in the range of 5 percent to 10 percent for residential consumers.\This week a company spokesman said that estimate was based on another version of the bill and the company is waiting on the PSC's final rules to determine how much it might take to comply with the law. He said the amended version actually gave the company more flexibility and would allow them to comply at a lower cost.\But even a 5 percent to 10 percent rate increase wouldn't be unusual for ratepayers who have recently faced similar increases.\Jeff Herholdt, the director of the state Division of Energy, said an increase would be worth it. Right now, customers pay about 6 cents per kilowatt hour.\""We're giving an incentive for our coal-based electric utilities to incorporate clean coal technologies in their energy mix,"" he said.\He added, ""We're making investments in West Virginia energy systems to be long-term players in our energy future.\""If we can do that for a half a cent per kilowatt hour, I'd say we're doing pretty good,"" Herholdt said.\Raese said the details of the state law are not as bad as the federal cap-and-trade bill but additional costs still would be borne by consumers.\""The West Virginia Renewable Energy Act is not quite as severe, shall we say, but the real cost is going to be passed along to the public,"" Raese said.\Raese doesn't see eye-to-eye with the law's premise.\Raese doesn't believe carbon dioxide is a health hazard, and he doesn't believe it is contributing to global climate change.\Nor does he believe the government should be stepping into private industry. He also suggested lawmakers could come back and make the law more burdensome in the future.\""Ronald Reagan said something that applies to this. He said there is no such thing as partial freedom, there is only freedom,"" Rease said. ""So it starts off, 'Oh, it's not that bad,' then in five years, 'Let's tweak it a bit,' then in 10 years, 'Let's tweak it again.'

51,"WASHINGTON - Republicans are trying to sell the false premise that protecting the environment inevitably means sacrificing jobs. President Obama should denounce this snake oil for what it is - rather than appear to accept it. \The GOP presidential candidates are in remarkable agreement on two articles of faith: The human imagination, apparently, is incapable of conjuring any circumstance under which any tax may ever be raised. And the Environmental Protection Agency is a sinister laboratory where Birkenstock-shod evildoers conjure regulations purposefully designed to rob Americans of their God-given jobs.\Actually, I'm being somewhat unfair to Mitt Romney, who tempers his EPA-bashing with the admission that he supports the agency ""in much of its mission."" When he was governor of Massachusetts, Romney favored initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, perhaps even a regional cap-and-trade system. He doesn't bring this up much on the campaign trail, but his opponents do.\The other contenders range from anti-EPA all the way to ... well, to Michele Bachmann's pledge to abolish the agency. Bachmann told an Iowa crowd last month that if she is elected president, ""I guarantee you the EPA will have doors locked and lights turned off, and they will only be about conservation. It will be a new day and a new sheriff in Washington.""\At the GOP debate in New Hampshire, Bachmann added that ""there is no other agency like the EPA. It should really be renamed the Job-Killing Organization of America."" Newt Gingrich agrees that the EPA - established in 1970 by that noted tree-hugger, Richard Nixon - should be dismantled.\Rick Perry has an actual record as an EPA-basher, having taken the agency to court in an effort to block rules on greenhouse gas emissions. Obama's ""EPA regulations are killing jobs all across America,"" Perry said. His book ""Fed Up!"" cites an estimate by the conservative Heritage Foundation of catastrophic job losses from greenhouse gas rules. Perry also refers to Al Gore as ""a false prophet of a secular carbon cult,"" whatever on Earth that means.\Ron Paul says most environmental questions should be resolved through the courts. Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman take the orthodox position: that any new environmental regulations should be put on hold because enacting them would kill jobs.\On Friday, Obama appeared to cede the point. He blocked new EPA rules limiting ground-level ozone - otherwise known as smog - as part of a larger effort to reduce ""regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty"" for U.S. businesses. The move came hours after a disappointing labor report showing that the economy added no new jobs in August.\The move to block the ozone rules may make sense politically, since it defuses an issue on which Republicans were prepared to hammer Obama and the Democrats all year. As a matter of public policy, however, it's wrong.\In developing the rule that Obama nixed, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was simply fulfilling the agency's prime mission: protecting human health.\""Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion,"" says the agency's website. ""It can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ground-level ozone also can reduce lung function and inflame the linings of the lungs. Repeated exposure may permanently scar lung tissue.""\In 2008, the Bush administration set a permissible standard for ozone that exceeded the limit recommended by EPA scientists. Jackson sought to bring the standard within the range that her agency deems safe.\As for the predictions of massive job losses, they sound just like the warnings we heard when environmental regulations ended acid rain, or ensured that the citizens of Cleveland no longer had to worry about the Cuyahoga River catching fire.\There is plenty of evidence that the net effect of smart environmental regulation is to create jobs, not destroy them. New, more efficient plants are built; older, dirtier facilities are retrofitted. Companies innovate by developing new technology - ultimately making U.S. industry more competitive. And everyone is a little healthier.\As Jackson noted in a statement, the Obama administration has made great strides in limiting such atmospheric pollutants as sulfur dioxide and mercury. Not every conceivable environmental regulation makes sense. But the ozone rule seemed well-grounded, and the objections to it were more political than rational.\We don't have to choose between jobs and health. History demonstrates we can have both.\Robinson is a columnist for The Washington Post.\Credit: Eugene Robinson"
52,"Gov. Joe Manchin, the Democratic frontrunner in the U.S. Senate race, touts his ability to find a balanced position that pleases both sides. \But the other two Democrats in the race have strong opinions on some issues where Manchin favors nuance.\Ken Hechler, a Democratic elder statesman, firmly opposes mountaintop removal; Manchin seeks balance.\Sheirl Fletcher, a two-term member of the state House, opposes a federal plan that would make it easier for unions to organize; Manchin wants a compromise.\In a meeting Tuesday with the Daily Mail editorial board, the three Democratic candidates and the lone Mountain Party candidate Jesse Johnson, came to few complete agreements but never grew heated in argument.\Johnson, an environmental lobbyist and a figurehead of the state Mountain Party, said if he got to Washington he would have no obligations to what he called the moneyed interests that are ""destroying our democracy.""\He said that in a time of ""planetary upheaval"" and high defense spending, America is in danger of going the way of the Soviet Union.\""They went the way of all empire,"" Johnson said. ""And I feel that this country is dangerously close to following that same spin around the drain.""\Manchin, who has faced criticism lately from Republicans and from his party's left, said he is best able to go to Washington and get things done.\""I'm not blaming who's at fault, I just need to fix it, or help fix it,"" Manchin said.\Asked about criticism from the Republican field that he couldn't be trusted to stand up to the Obama administration or congressional Democrats, Manchin said he has spoken to every former governor who is a senator to learn about the differences between being a chief executive and being one of 100.\""I don't think anybody that knows me believes that I am a rubber stamp for anything,"" Manchin said.\The candidates, except Hechler, joined with many Republicans in suggesting that a key part of the Obama administration's health care reform effort is unconstitutional.\The so-called individual mandate requires that over the next several years most Americans who can afford health insurance buy it or face a small penalty. That goal of the provision is to get most Americans into the insurance pool so that people with insurance aren't subsidizing things like charity care for the uninsured.\Critics have challenged the mandate as an unconstitutional provision that forces Americans to buy a product.\Manchin - who has supported health insurance reform in the past - took several positions on the mandate, saying he hadn't seen that part of the law but that it didn't ring well with him; suggesting he favored the idea as part of overall reform; and apparently defending the mandate by comparing it to paying taxes or buying worker's comp.\""We're doing nothing for preventative care - worker's comp only covers you after you get hurt, it'd be a lot cheaper to take care of you before you got hurt than after you got hurt, but we mandate worker's comp but we don't mandate any insurance for working people,"" Manchin said at one point.\He also said, ""Do I believe in the punishment part? No. But do I believe you have should have coverage? Yes.""\Later, he added of being forced to buy a private product: ""I think that's unconstitutional.""\Fletcher opposed the mandate.\""I'm not sure that it is constitutional,"" she said.\Johnson said he thinks the individual mandate is unconstitutional and a deal for the insurance industry.\""In a word, 'No,'"" he said. ""This deal was cut without sunshine laws, behind closed doors.""\But Johnson appeared to favor a government-run single-payer insurance system that would likely be far more objectionable to many Republican critics.\And, while such a system would not require Americans to buy private insurance, it would require them to pay higher taxes. If Americans don't pay taxes, of course, that comes with a penalty.\""Well, it's a constitutional tax,"" Johnson said.\Hechler compared the individual mandate to the draft.\""I cannot believe it is unconstitutional to afford health care for all Americans,"" he said.\Manchin also walked a fine line on the federal Employee Free Choice Act, a bill that would make it easier for unions to organize.\Business and labor groups that both back Manchin differ on what he thinks of the bill. The head of the state Chamber of Commerce has suggested it is unlikely the governor would support it, but leaders of the state AFL-CIO point to evidence that Manchin likes the legislation.\Manchin said he has doubts about the bill in its current form, especially if it hasn't made it through a Democratic-controlled administration and Congress.\""I told labor, 'Something is wrong with that piece of legislation if you haven't been able to get it passed by now,'"" Manchin said.\At the same time, he said unions need to be able to have ""equal billing"" and ""equal footing"" with business leaders in large workplaces to test support for a union. He said the current scuffle about union access to workplaces seems to have arisen mostly because of attempts to unionize Wal-Mart. Manchin suggested some compromise could be reached.\At the same time, he said any law should maintain the ""precious"" right to a secret ballot for workers who are considering whether to unionize. That secret ballot would be jeopardized in recent versions of the federal employee choice act.\Fletcher didn't walk such a fine line.\""Well,"" she said, ""I'm against it. I'll just come right out and say it.""\She said rank-and-file workers have told her they are afraid of the pressure unions would apply on them to join if the ballots were no longer secret.\Hechler said he would have to wait and see and did not want to shoot from the hip on the issue.\But he quoted Thomas Jefferson's ""equal rights for all, special privileges for none.""\Hechler added that the problem with Congress is, ""There's too much arm-twisting and special interests.""\Johnson said he was an advocate of union access but said the secret ballot is ""sacred"" and would want time to digest the legislation if he were a senator.\During the editorial board meeting, Manchin also indirectly responded to Republicans who have said he is not sufficiently opposed to cap-and-trade legislation.\""I'm at odds with cap and trade - I think it's absolutely wrong,"" he said.\Fletcher, 53, an environmental engineer, was equally against cap and trade.\""Cap and trade is nothing more than a tax on the energy sector,"" she said.\Fletcher said the bill, which is currently dead in the water in Washington, gives China and India a trading advantage. She also said that as an environmental engineer she had spent her life doing what she could to protect the environment but also allowing for viable development.\Hechler said he opposed mountaintop removal and emphasized the importance of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which he wrote as a congressman.\""Every one of those 29 miners who were killed at Upper Big Branch Mine on April 5 would be alive today if my '69 act had been enforced,"" Hechler said, referring to a provision that would have mandated a stream of fresh air in the mine.\Johnson said he opposed cap and trade but is in favor of the ""cap"" on carbon emissions. The ""trade"" - of credits to emit greenhouse gases - does nothing, he said.\""What cap and trade does - it brings forth a new game for big industry,"" Johnson said.\He opposes mountaintop removal mining and the burning of coal for power, arguing instead that coal could be used to create carbon composite materials.\Hechler gave conflicting statements about his run. He at times listed what he would do in the Senate when he got to Washington; at other times suggested he was running only to give people a choice in the election; and at least once defended Manchin from criticism.\The 95-year-old was elected to the House in 1958, the same year Robert Byrd was elected to the Senate. The two served together for 18 years.\""I think that he would agree that this seat is not a seat for one person, this is a seat that belongs to the people,"" Hechler said.\Then, he added that his difference with Manchin - who he at one point called ""Senator Manchin"" - was over mountaintop removal, which Hechler wants to see abolished and Manchin says he wants to see done with appropriate ""balance.""\""Otherwise I have faith in the integrity of Gov. Manchin,"" Hechler said.\Last week it was revealed that federal prosecutors are seeking records from the Manchin administration's Division of Highways and Department of Administration.\""I have full confidence that he and his administration will come out on the up and up and clean,"" Hechler said.\Contact writer Ry Rivard at ry. rivard@dailymail.com or 304-348-1796.\Credit: DAILY MAIL CAPITOL REPORTER"
53,"A few months ago, the Gazette published my satires proposing ""single payer"" and ""cap and trade"" nutritional systems to address the poor health status and eating habits of Americans. Some did not find the articles funny, claiming that some experts seriously propose what I presented as ""spoof.""\I dismissed the criticism until I read a Sept. 10 New York Times commentary by Michael Pollan (""Big Food vs. Big Insurance""). The most glaring subject missing from the health-care debate - and the major reason America spends twice as much on health care compared to most European countries - is that we are fatter, Pollan opines. He further elaborates that regardless of what health reform we enact, the system will not be sustainable until we address this issue. He may well be correct.\However, Pollan then contends that the etiology of the problem is the food industry (second most powerful special interest) that politicians are fearful to confront but might do so with the support of the health insurance industry (first most powerful special interest).\Certain marketing and other practices and products, such as fast foods, trans-fats, sugary drinks, of the food industry no doubt contribute to the problem, but proposing that the solution lies in more central government regulatory action to slay an alleged corporate boogey man is na ve.\For example, the food industry has little control over inactivity, at least half the problem. The issue is much more complex.\As a child, I remember parents - hoping to avoid a long, complex explanation - motivated their children to avoid dangerous behavior by evoking the fear of the boogey man. As we matured, we realized that there were always opportunists and bad folks who would, respectively, tempt or harm us, but that our health, safety and well-being was largely within our responsibility to control, not the boogey man's.\The sign my high school football coach hung in the football locker room read, ""No pain, no gain."" Most of us realize that to maintain our health and fitness we need to forego certain pleasures, such as eating french fries, and engage in other activities, such as exercise. In addition, as surveys reveal, most of us admit we do not display the discipline we should in this regard. Studies also show that third-party rewards and penalties (from employers or government) can enhance such discipline.\It follows that we should promote the incorporation of rewards and penalties into health insurance premiums to promote health and control costs, since unhealthy people cost more. In reality, enthusiasm is limited, as evidenced by the near-unanimous support of Americans to prohibit insurance policy preexisting condition exclusions, regardless of the etiological behavioral factors, such as smoking, poor nutrition and inactivity, that contribute to a condition.\There are scientific and practical reasons for the lack of enthusiasm. Scientific discovery reveals that it is likely that a significant portion of human behavior is genetically influenced; thus, some people might have a harder time than others embracing healthy behavior. For example, experiments are ongoing with infusion of RNA-coated gold, nanoparticles to shut off the production of certain brain proteins thought to contribute to addiction to drugs and other substances.\Practically speaking, since\the government's payment share for health care keeps increasing, the impact of using personal monetary premium inducements to maintain health keeps decreasing.\There is also the difficulty and cost of measuring and monitoring behavioral compliance.\Viscerally, however, it is difficult to accept imposing no sanctions so that responsible citizens (through insurance premiums or taxes) must pay for inhalers and Viagra for an emphysema patient who has money to continue to buy cigarettes that largely contribute to the need for these drugs.\Pollan is correct about the magnitude of the problem and our need to address it. Central government regulation of certain food products might have a marginal impact upon the problem.\However, the majority of Americans are unlikely to return to purchasing and preparing locally produced raw foods, even realizing it might be healthier to do so.\They are not going to return to plowing gardens with a mule or pounding their clothes, detergent-free, in a stream, although it would be healthier for them, and the environment.\Corporate America, although irresponsible at times, primarily provides the food, rototillers, and washing machines consumers demand. Creating a boogey man will not solve the problem.\The problem will only be addressed when each community - all of us - acknowledge we have a serious problem and meaningfully create balanced sanctions and a local agenda to address it. In the words of Pogo, ""we have met the enemy and they is us."""

55,"When Chinese President Xi Jinping's handlers arranged his flight from Seattle to Washington, D.C., on Thursday, they made sure he would land after Pope Francis had left. Xi didn't want to be overshadowed by the rock-star pope. As it turned out, the Chinese leader was unable to avoid the pope's shadow. The elaborate reception ceremonies for Xi on the White House lawn were eclipsed on TV by the pope's address to the United Nations.\But, apart from timing, comparisons between the pope and Xi are unavoidable.\The two leaders command the two largest constituencies in the world, 1.2 billion Catholics and 1.2 billion Chinese, respectively. And they hold polar opposite views on how to address the problems of their flocks and the world.\Pope Francis believes that solutions must emerge from the bottom up, while Xi seeks to solve everything from the top down.\During his U.S. trip, Francis stressed repeatedly that individuals have a moral responsibility to work together to preserve the environment, fight corruption, and ameliorate conflicts. His urgings were not just spiritual homilies but calls for grassroots political action to press legislators to act.\Citing four American heroes who turned ""dreams into action - Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton - the pope made clear that individual efforts to effect change are as important as those of the political elite.\However, the pope was also concerned about the future of Western democratic institutions, many of which have become so sclerotic that they have turned voters into cynics. As he addressed a joint session of Congress, Francis urged legislators to overcome the partisan behavior that has paralyzed our government.\Xi, on the other hand, is an authoritarian, distrustful of grassroots efforts. China experts believe his outlook stems more from personal history than Leninist ideology, which has largely given way in China to a blend of nationalism and Confucianism. Despite his family's communist pedigree, Xi was forced to labor in the countryside for years during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution; he appears to have emerged with the belief that order must be strictly imposed from above.\So Xi has moved to squash China's expanding civil society and its remaining free media, and shows a Mao-like propensity to rule from the very top.\What's so fascinating is that Francis and Xi are addressing many similar problems - especially pollution and corruption - but from a totally different perspective.\The pope pleaded in Congress and at the United Nations for individual and governmental action to combat man-made climate change. Meantime, Xi proposed a cap-and-trade plan that would supposedly limit China's greenhouse gas emissions. Chinese action on this front is essential, as Beijing has surpassed the United States as the world's biggest polluter.\However, it's hard to have confidence in a Chinese government that blatantly manipulates statistics and markets, and seeks to control (and hack) the Web. When China's stock market recently tanked, the government's reaction was to bend the stats back into shape by forbidding news coverage, banning sales of shares and intervening massively to fix prices.\This hardly inspires confidence in a market for cap and trade.\Similarly, Xi is waging war on Chinese corruption from the top down, by publicly firing and arresting a number of party officials. In a country as huge as China, fighting corruption from such heights is likely to fail.\On my last trip to China, I heard from senior Chinese officials that they often depend on nongovernmental agencies working on health or environmental issues to alert them to corruption far from Beijing. Ditto for the work of local Chinese news media that struggle to expose provincial misbehavior at great risk.\But Xi is shutting down civil society and activist media, isolating himself and his circle. He is failing to take advantage of a growing middle class that could play a critical role in fighting pollution and exposing corruption.\In a sense, Pope Francis is daring us to demonstrate that our model is preferable to China's. He is trying to mobilize individuals to join together to work for the common good, and legislators to act responsibly, as well.\Yet, as he observed in Congress, the discontents and contradictions of U.S. democracy can thwart such efforts. All the more so if legislators make war on all regulations, including those that curb pollution or combat destructive behavior by banks.\As if to confirm Francis' analysis, the Republican House speaker, John Boehner - a devout Catholic who had invited the pope to address the joint session - announced his resignation Friday. The conservative Boehner had been hounded by GOP extremists who seek to shut the national government down, yet again - something the speaker opposes.\The pontiff has thrown down a challenge for Americans to do better. He urged Congress to ""confront every form of polarization, and individual Americans to pursue ""dreams that lead to action.""\The difference between Francis and Xi is basic: The pope believes in democracy's endless prospects for renewal by committed individuals and legislators. We have the chance to prove him right or wrong.\Credit: Trudy Rubin"
56,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - West Virginia coal miner Dick Curry has an idea for getting political leaders come to grips with the importance of coal: Shut off the supply to the nation's capital. \""I guarantee you they don't know how important coal is,"" said Curry, 64, a miner of 43 years from Philippi. ""I think we should flip one of the power plants off. The coal we produce lights up Washington, D.C.""\To drive home that pro-coal message, about 2,000 thousand miners and their families - many from West Virginia's coal communities - traveled to Washington Wednesday for a rally in the shadow of the Capitol.\Organized by FACES, the Federation for American Coal, Energy and Security, the rally was timed to show opposition to the Obama administration's environmental and permitting regulations, which miners said is threatening thousands of jobs across coal mining states in Appalachia.\Speaking to the boisterous crowd, coal-country politicians from both political parties pledged their support to fight Environmental Protection Agency regulations that could hinder mine production, such as enhanced water-quality standards, and energy policies like Obama's cap-and-trade plan to tax carbon emissions.\""Coal is under assault here in this town,"" said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., calling the current administration the ""most anti-coal in the history of the country.""\He urged the miners to channel their frustration at the ballot box, in the mid-term elections, on Nov. 2.\""These people who turn on a light every night need to be reminded where it comes from,"" McConnell said.\The miners came to Washington on buses from West Virginia, Kentucky and southern Virginia, toting signs such as, ""COAL - Can Obama's America Last without it?"" Speaker after speaker attacked Obama, EPA administrator Lisa Jackson and ""tree-hugging politicians.""\That included many of West Virginia's top political figures in Charleston and Washington.\""Everybody that enjoys the freedoms of this great country ought to get on their hands and knees every night and say a prayer for a coal miner and a coal family,"" said Gov. Joe Manchin, a Democrat running for Robert Byrd's U.S. Senate seat.\""President Obama is wrong on cap and trade,"" Manchin added to cheers. ""Lisa Jackson is wrong with the EPA attacking the energy that fuels America.""\U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who emceed the rally, said, ""We've got to make our voices loud, and we've got to make them heard. If we don't stand up for what we believe in, we're going to get shut down, and we have been getting shut down in a regulatory environment that I think begins to threaten us and our jobs.""\Charles Elkins of Lincoln County, a 30-year miner who currently works at a coal camp in Madison, said he's worried about legislation, filed by two U.S. senators, that would curtail mountaintop mining. Like many in the crowd, Elkins comes from a coal mining family and worries the industry won't exist in a generation.\""The environmentalists that are hollering - they're extremists,"" said Elkins, citing technological advances that lessened the environmental impacts of mining. ""I'm an environmentalist. I've got children I want to be able live on this planet.""\Other miners expressed fears about rising foreign coal production in countries such as China. And with reducing national dependence on oil a top political priority in Washington, many said they are worried coal will be forced out.\""You can't throw such a valuable resource out the door,"" said 64-year-old Buckhannon resident C.D. Wilson, a 40-year coal miner. ""I'm a hunter and a fisher. We can do this and keep our environment clean.""\JOSH HAFENBRACK/FOR THE DAILY MAIL Coal supporters met Wednesday near the U.S. Capitol to show their opposition to the Obama administrations environmental policies that they say threaten the industry.\THE ASSOCIATED PRESS The Appalachian region provided most of attendees for the rally, which was organized by the Federation for American Coal, Energy and Security.\Gov.

57," Climate change looks like a high-stakes lottery, and so far we haven't been making very smart bets. The worst-case scenarios - rapid, catastrophic, irreversible, species-annihilating, sea level- raising events - should focus our attention and prompt some conservative choices.\ In November, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that global warming is happening much faster than we thought.\ ""What we do in the next two to three years will determine our future,"" said IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri.\ This urgency has created some momentum. Last month, within hours of being sworn in as Australia's Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Al Gore made headlines with his call-to-action speech as he accepted the Nobel Prize. And in Bali, Indonesia, representatives from more than 180 countries just finished drawing a timetable for a new international climate change agreement.\ And the United States? Currently, our best chance for a national breakthrough is the Lieberman-Warner bill, which recently emerged from the Senate environment committee. The bill would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system, creating a market for something that doesn't exist: the absence of pollution.\ What will this look like? Under a cap-and-trade system, we'll decide the total amount of greenhouse gases we'll tolerate from key industrial sectors. We'll print exactly enough allowances to cover this amount of emissions. Then we'll allocate the allowances to firms, who will buy and sell them with each other. When someone sells an allowance, he's selling a promise that he didn't release one ton of emissions - giving the buyer permission to release that ton.\ Why is this a good idea? A well-designed allowance market will be the cheapest way to reduce emissions, by making sure the easiest cuts are made first. If a coal-fired power plant can cut a few tons of emissions by installing cheap scrubbers, but a paper mill down the road can't get cleaner without expensive upgrades, the plant can sell its extra allowances to the mill. As far as the earth is concerned, it doesn't matter where or by whom greenhouse gases are released, so we'll get the most environmental bang for our buck by curbing emissions wherever it's cheapest. A strong allowance market will put the right amount of pressure on the right people, making firms compete to stop polluting.\ The 2005 European Union Emission Trading Scheme has just finished its first trading period. They've had high compliance rates and millions of transactions per month. The price of allowances collapsed due to oversupply, but something similar happened in the 1990s when the United States set up an eventually successful trading system to curtail acid rain. It takes a little while to work the bugs out.\ Nine Northeastern states will create a regional emissions trading system in 2009, and California has laid the groundwork for its own statewide cap-and-trade program. Trading systems are running or scheduled to launch in Australia, Norway, Switzerland, Canada and Japan - adding up to a patchwork of little markets around the world.\ Which brings us back to Bali. The international community has set a timeframe for negotiating a post-2012 sequel to the Kyoto Protocol. ""Kyoto II"" really needs to sew all the different regional trading systems into an international emissions market. A global market would be deeper and more liquid than any regional system. It would save money by exploiting the total geographic flexibility of emissions - reducing them wherever on earth it's cheapest to do so. And it would make it easier for developing countries to get on board. They'll be able to invest in clean technology and conserve their forests, and then sell their absence of pollution to rich countries.\ This means we need to get our national system right. Allowances are like paper currency: we can print as many as we want, but the more we print, the less each one is worth. If the United States is too lax in setting an emissions target, no one will want to accept the flood of our cheap allowances. If we give our allowances away where other countries auction them, it will be a massive, unfair subsidy for American companies. And if we insist on a ""safety valve"" - a promise that at a certain point our government will print more allowances to keep the price down - we'd be forcing that safety valve on anyone who traded with us. Some of these issues are deal- breakers for our potential partners.\ These points sound technical, but really they're political. We need to decide as a country what kind of trade-offs we're willing to make to address climate change. Right now we're choosing inaction, but we have a chance to make a better choice in the months ahead. And we need to cooperate and build points of consensus with other countries, so we can make this decision as a planet. This will require the United States to show the kind of international leadership on climate change we've been tragically, self- defeatingly lacking.\ A lot of people have worked for years to raise environmental awareness in the United States - to help us think of ourselves as part of a global community, and as a species. Now is the time for our elected leaders to get the message, to believe in the power of American integrity and innovation, and to have the ""vision-thing"" as they walk on the international stage. What kind of world will we bequeath to our children? Our actions on climate change will be a big part of our answer.\ Wohl, originally of Charleston, is an international trade analyst with the U.S. International Trade Commission. He researched international carbon markets for the Pew Center on Climate Change in 2006-07 as a graduate student at Harvard Universitys Kenne"
58,"WASHINGTON - When the Senate takes up legislation next month to confront global warming, environmental groups will have some fervent new allies: evangelicals and other Christian activists.\Concerned about what they see as a moral and biblical issue, religious groups from the right are joining with environmental organizations from the left in supporting strong measures to fight global warming.\Some Christian leaders are using the clout they have built up in Republican circles to lobby conservatives in Congress to support regulations on greenhouse-gas emissions.\""When evangelicals speak, Republicans listen,"" said Richard Cizik, vice president of government affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals. ""And Republicans, frankly, are listening to what we're saying.""\For many religious groups, global warming isn't a political or environmental issue. It's a threat to God's creation.\""It's not a blue state, red state, scientific, or even a green issue,"" said Cizik, whose organization represents 45,000 churches. ""It's a spiritual issue. And that, above all else, is why evangelical Christians should be concerned.""\The once-tiny Christian environmental movement began quickly accelerating in 2006, when 85 prominent evangelical leaders signed on to the Evangelical Climate Initiative calling for action on global warming. That number has since climbed to more than 100.\""It's a bit out of the ordinary for evangelicals to be involved with this issue,"" said Jim Jewell, chief operating officer of the Evangelical Environmental Network, a group that educates and mobilizes Christians on environmental issues. ""The evangelical involvement with climate has kind of shaken the political landscape a bit.""\In March, dozens of prominent Southern Baptist leaders called on followers to acknowledge human contributions to global warming and demanded bold action to address climate change.\They said the church's cautious approach was ""too timid"" in promoting stewardship of God's creation.\""To abandon these issues to the secular world is to shirk from our responsibility ..."" they declared. ""The time for timidity regarding God's creation is no more.""\Jonathan Merritt, the 25-year-old seminary student from Atlanta who organized the Baptist environmental declaration, said younger Baptists in particular were relieved to see church leaders take a bold public stance.\Young religious voters aren't abandoning opposition to abortion and gay marriage - issues usually associated with the religious right - but seem more willing than their parents to look at a broader spectrum of political positions, Merritt said.\""Younger Christians are finding it more pressing to live a life that is consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ ... rather than toe a party line,"" Merritt said.\The Rev. Larry Rice, director of the New Life Evangelistic Center in St. Louis, has been an outspoken advocate for global-warming legislation. The left-leaning minister said Missouri is ""in the dark age when it comes to renewable energy"" and has argued for years that Christians have an obligation to protect the environment.\""There's an ethical principle that runs the whole thread of Christianity here,"" Rice said. ""You can't just say that you love your neighbors as yourself and yet be totally indifferent to how your use of fossil fuels is directly contributing to global warming around the world.""\Evangelicals will join an army of lobbyists and lawmakers now suiting up for battle over the most sweeping environmental legislation in years, which the Senate intends to debate early in June.\The bill, sponsored by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman, I-Conn., and John W. Warner, R-Va., would create a program known as ""cap-and-trade"" to limit harmful carbon dioxide emissions.\Under the bill, companies, individuals and government agencies would see their greenhouse-gas emissions capped at an annually decreasing level, with the goal of setting emissions in 2050 at 30 percent of their 2005 levels.\Entities that come in below their cap could sell their remaining credits to others that pollute beyond their limit. The effect is a sort of carbon tax that encourages pollution reduction.\The bill is already the subject of intense political gamesmanship. Some business lobbyists fear the costs of complying with pollution caps and the penalties for exceeding them. Some environmental groups say the standards are too weak.\Backers of the bill hope support from the religious right will help pressure some Republicans to support the legislation.\""There's a good deal of interaction with folks at traditionally religious organizations, who have joined with environmental organizations to begin work on this,"" said David Sandretti, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental interest group.\As the action unfolds on Capitol Hill, Missouri's two Senators are likely to play important roles.\Sen. Kit Bond, a Republican, has for years been one of the loudest critics of the science behind global warming and is a key opponent of the Lieberman-Warner bill.\The Environmental Defense Fund identified Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., as one of 10 ""Senators to watch."" McCaskill is undecided on the cap-and-trade bill, saying she favors the concept but worried about how it might affect utility costs for poor people.\McCaskill's staff has discussed cap-and-trade with religious leaders urging her to support the initiative.\""We're paying special attention to Senator McCaskill,"" said the Rev. Jim Ball, a national spokesman for the Evangelical Climate Initiative.\McCaskill's staff has also talked about the issue with religious leaders working with the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, a broad coalition of religious groups that includes Catholic, Jewish and other organizations.\""This is far and away the single highest environmental priority for the American religious community,"" said Paul Gorman, the Partnership's executive director. ""There's isn't a single state in the union where people of faith and religious leaders aren't communicating their support for this bill.""\Credit: St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
59,"Coal will continue to be a major energy source for the next 30 years or more as the nation and world transition to the energy of the future, and leaders must find a balance between the economy and the environment, Gov. Joe Manchin said Monday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event. \Coal-producing states such as West Virginia have been essential in building the nation over the past hundred years, Manchin said, and he also acknowledged that they have contributed to pollution at the same time.\""We always say we've done the heavy lifting and we haven't complained,"" Manchin said during his keynote speech at the chamber's Institute for 21st Century Energy luncheon in Washington, D.C. His speech was broadcast live on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Web site.\""We probably, in the mining and the burning of coal to provide the energy this nation needs, have probably polluted more than most other states.""\However, ""we built the greatest nation the world has ever known,"" Manchin added.\While Manchin said that does not defend the right to pollute, he said fixing the problem should include finding value in waste products such as carbon dioxide, a major byproduct in the burning of coal.\West Virginia already has made strides toward cleaner air, including through capturing and neutralizing sulfur dioxide from smoke stacks to form gypsum, a material used in wallboard, Manchin said.\""Who would have ever thought we would have found value for a waste product?"" he said.\But more needs to be done, he said.\He questioned the credit system proposed in the cap-and-trade portion of national climate change legislation working its way through Congress that would limit the amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. The proposed cap-and-trade policy would allow companies to trade or sell allowances for such emissions.\Cap-and-trade costs could increase coal prices tremendously, Manchin said, adding that money collected through cap and trade or carbon tax should be directed toward new research.\""Why not identify credits right and fix the problem?"" Manchin said. ""Unless you just need the money.""\The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce also was fighting for more balance regarding climate change legislation, said Amanda Pasdon, director of business development and investment. Pasdon attended the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's event Monday.\""With the current legislation it would drive down our industrial jobs because it would increase the cost of electricity,"" Pasdon said.\West Virginia chamber officials have estimated that the proposed climate change bill could cost as many as 3 million production jobs in the United States, she said.\Meanwhile, Manchin questioned what would happen if green jobs fail to follow because the cost of energy is so great that companies producing windmills and solar panels, for example, locate off shore or in other countries with more competitive costs, such as China.\""I got a double whammy,"" Manchin said.\""You've not only lost the good jobs that we did have,"" he said during an interview after the speech. ""We haven't attracted the new green jobs that we hoped that we would because of the high cost of energy.""\West Virginia should be on the forefront in finding a valued use for carbon dioxide, Manchin said.\He mentioned a dedication earlier this month for a pilot plant at Dow Chemical in South Charleston that will collect carbon dioxide from a coal and natural gas-fueled boiler through a joint effort with Alstom Power.\Manchin also noted the state's first commercial demonstration of carbon capture planned for late October at American Electric Power's Mountaineer Plant in New Haven.\""We are moving forward and we're still very, very aggressive in our approach to how we find that balance,"" Manchin said.\Manchin said he has been invited along with some bipartisan governors to talk about climate change at the White House later this year.\""The president and this administration has had a very open door policy,"" Manchin said.\Crossing party lines to quickly find the best results is important when working with other governors, Manchin said.\""I'm CEO of a company called West Virginia,"" Manchin said during his speech. ""If I find another CEO that's had some success, whether it be in education or health care, I call them - I don't really look if it was an R (Republican) or a D (Democrat).""\He also praised President Obama for his efforts to address education challenges, and Manchin talked about his own push for year-round schools and more concentrated subject matter.\""Most of this country is still educating on an agrarian calendar,"" Manchin said. ""I always ask parents, 'Do kids help you do all the planting? Did they help tend to the crops? Did they do the harvesting ... canning and curing the meat?' That's the cycle of education we're still in.\""When is the last time you got a three-month vacation?"" Manchin added.\He recalled that as a student he had a parent with him all the time during summer break.\""That doesn't happen today,"" Manchin said. ""Families have changed.""\Because of the long summer break teachers must spend a lot of time in the fall reviewing what students forgot when they went home, he said.\""We seem to be scared of trying anything different,"" Manchin said after the speech.

60,"Another pro-coal alliance has joined the growing array of groups fighting for an industry that has become a focal point for the nations energy debate. Grassroots efforts supporting coal seem to be growing in West Virginia, most recently with Wednesdays campaign kickoff of an alliance promoting the benefits mining brings to local economies. West Virginia is ground zero for the war on coal, said Bryan Brown, a coordinator with the Federation for American Coal, Energy and Security, or FACES of Coal. Forces from outside our state and region seek to eliminate or severely diminish the use of coal as an energy source, without, apparently, any appreciation for the benefits that mining provides to our state and nation. FACES of Coal is among several pro-coal groups working to gather support for the industry as environmental groups have staged protests in West Virginia against mining; cap and trade legislation has been pending in Congress and surface mine permits have been on hold while the federal Environmental Protection Agency evaluates their impact. Other pro-coal groups include Friends of America, a Massey Energy-supported coalition of businesses in West Virginia that plans to hold a rally on Labor Day. There also is Friends of Coal, organized by the West Virginia Coal Association. On the environmental side, groups include the coalition Friends of the Mountains, which has been fighting mountaintop removal mining. Organizations listed on the coalitions Web site www.friendsofthemountains.org include the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, Coal River Mountain Watch and West Virginia Highlands Conservancy. There also is the Sierra Club of West Virginia, which recently co-hosted an event showcasing the film Coal Country and has intervened in cases regarding mountaintop removal mining. In voicing its pro-mining message, FACES of Coal has more than 70 different coal and non-coal-related organizations, businesses and individuals, such as representatives of tourism, state government and county government, Brown said. The coalition planned to expand its grassroots efforts from West Virginia to Virginia, Kentucky, other areas of Appalachia and throughout the country, he said. Brown added that the coalition is not a political or lobbying group, but it does encourage members to voice their opinions on coal-related issues and benefits. Were not directing individuals to oppose any single piece of legislation at this point, Brown said. There are a number of efforts under way that are causing unpredictability, instability in the coal industry, and that in turn affects all of us. West Virginia has had a recent trend of community efforts regarding coal-related issues, partly in response to a national focus on mountaintop removal mining, said Chuck Smith, a political science professor at West Virginia State University. There obviously has been an increase in grassroots community-type action and demonstrations in this area, Smith said. The pro-coal increase, its the most recent development, is obviously in response to their concern that the people who are moving to have mountaintop removal ended are being increasingly successful in bringing public attention to that issue. Increased media attention has been given to protests over mining, said Jim Kotcon, chair of the energy committee for the West Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club. The impacts from mining and mountaintop removal have been going on for many years, but the news media are now starting to pay attention, in large part because it is becoming a national and even international issue, Kotcon said. Kotcon said there has been a significant decline in interest in coal-fired power plants over the last three or four years due largely to greater awareness of the costs of coal, including the need to reduce greenhouse gases and the basic construction and operating costs. Employees of coal companies have an obvious economic interest in mining issues, Smith said, and the state has a history of getting involved in community awareness, such as with labor unions addressing work place and salary issues. West Virginia is a place where grassroots response isnt too uncommon, Smith said. Support for coal also comes from outside coal companies. The County Commissioners Association of West Virginia joined FACES of Coal to raise awareness of the revenue impact to counties from coal severance taxes, said Vivian Parsons, the associations executive director. The economy is tough right now, Parsons said. Counties are having a hard time balancing their budgets, Parsons said. We have to look at all of our revenue sources. We need to help promote awareness and understanding of just how valuable those dollars are and what were doing with them. Coal severance taxes are distributed to counties in two ways, with 75 percent going to coal-producing counties and 25 percent going to all counties and cities based on population and regardless of coal production, Parsons said. In the 2009 fiscal year, West Virginia counties received about $31 million in coal severance taxes, and another $3 million was distributed to cities, Parsons said. Parsons spoke with commissioners in both coal-producing and non-coal-producing counties about how much coal severance money they got last year and where the money typically goes. Here are some examples she gave: * Berkeley County, about $300,000 Some funding used for the countys Development Authority, to fund a clean air task force and to get grant match money for court security, records management and community corrections. * Boone County, about $4.5 million Funds community cleanups, senior centers and water and sewer projects and allows county residents to take their trash to a garbage transfer site without having to pay a fee to dump it. * Brooke County, nearly $70,000 Parsons had no specific information on how this money was spent, but said that in addition to the coal severance money the local coal industry donated a building to the county commission for an animal shelter, emergency operations center and additional storage for law enforcement vehicles. * Hancock County, about $58,000 Some funding used to plug budget holes and pay a postage bill in county government. * Kanawha County, more than $1.3 million Helps fund cleanup programs, Ambulance Authority services, the Humane Society, Little League teams and volunteer fire departments, among other services. * Lewis County, more than $60,000 Funding supplements the E-911 call center emergency response system. * Mercer County, more than $214,000 Funds supplement the countys regional jail bill and pays for property and liability insurance at county offices. * Wirt County, $24,000 Funding helps with regional jail bills and to supplement other general county expenses. If the coal severance dollars would dry up and go away, so would some of the vital services that the counties are providing, Parsons said. But studies have shown coal mining may have a human cost as well, Kotcon said, referring to a 2009 report by researchers at West Virginia University and Washington State University who say that the human health cost of mining appeared to be five times greater than the economic benefits. Those health studies do not include the economic impact of damage to our roads, damage to streams and rivers, or the general decline in property values associated with mountaintop removal mines, Kotcon said. The study Mortality in Appalachian Coal Mining Regions: The Value of Statistical Life Lost found that socioeconomic indicators and age-adjusted mortality rates were worse in coal-mining areas of Appalachia than in non-mining areas. However, researchers also said that while a causal link is likely, it cannot be stated with certainty that coal mining causes these problems, as economic and public health outcomes for those areas in the absence of mining could not be determined. Meanwhile, Parsons said her group is involved with FACES of Coal because of the coalitions stated goals to preserve the environment through good stewardship of natural resources and to strengthen communities by advancing safe and responsible mining technology. My focus and my involvement in this coalition is from the county perspective, Parsons said. The political issues that are bouncing back and forth and the good and the bad we will leave to our constituents to debate.

61,"U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller and Reps. Alan Mollohan and Nick Rahall have introduced legislation that would give coal-fired power plants a two-year break from EPA regulators intent on cracking down on emissions. \The bill would put a temporary stop to any Obama administration imposition of limits on greenhouse gas emissions from the power plants and other large polluters.\Sen. Robert C. Byrd has decided not to sign on as a sponsor.\Rockefeller, Mollohan and Rahall say they want to preempt action by federal regulators. Proponents of the emission reduction argue that it would help to curb the global warming problem. Opponents say such cuts are a needless overreaction that would devastate the coal industry and impose higher costs on all Americans.\The state contingent in Congress has been under widespread public pressure in West Virginia for months to take a stronger stand in opposition to the Obama administration's regulatory crackdown on coal.\The bill would give Congress the sole authority for the next two years to do anything about greenhouse emissions from large stationary sources, like power plants, oil refineries and factories.\Byrd said he didn't want to be a co-sponsor because he's having ""significant discussions about how to ensure the future of coal as a long-term energy resource.\""I am reluctant to give up on talks that might produce benefits for West Virginia's coal interests by seeming to turn away from ongoing negotiations. I will continue to negotiate with all who are earnestly engaged in the pursuit of a proper balance between saving jobs, protecting the environment and ensuring the health of our communities.""\The Environmental Protection Agency plans to impose emission cuts starting sometime next year.\In December, the EPA found that greenhouse gases harm humans. The agency was given the authority to make that determination and begin regulation of emissions under a 2007 Supreme Court ruling.\""Congress, not the EPA, must be the ideal decision-maker on such a challenging issue,"" Rockefeller said Thursday. ""Today, we took important action to safeguard jobs, the coal industry, and the entire economy as we move toward clean coal technology.""\The EPA is still examining the legislation, said agency spokeswoman Adora Andy.\""It is important to note that Senator Rockefeller's bill, unlike Senator Murkowski's resolution, does not attempt to overturn or deny the scientific fact that unchecked greenhouse gas pollution threatens the well-being of the American people - nor would it threaten the historic clean cars program announced by the Obama Administration last year,"" Andy said.\Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has proposed that the EPA be stripped of its authority to regulate greenhouse emissions entirely. The legislation backed by Rockefeller, Mollohan and Rahall does nothing to prevent the EPA from regulating automobile emissions.\Rockefeller, Byrd, Mollohan and Rahall have said they believe that global warming is occurring, but they differ with the Obama administration and some environmentalists on how to solve the problem.\One bill, which passed the House of Representatives last year, would have created a system to limit a company's right to release carbon dioxide and set up a system to trade rights to emit the gas.\Critics say cap and trade would damage the U.S. economy by driving up the price of energy for customers and businesses. Supporters say the legislation is an essential part of heading off catastrophic global climate change.\Rockefeller and Byrd have shown support for cap and trade if it gives the coal industry money for research. But all three of West Virginia's House members, including Republican Shelley Moore Capito, voted against cap and trade.\Rahall, who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources, said Thursday: ""There is strongly felt disagreement about what is happening in our climate, why it is happening, and what humans can do about it. Most West Virginians have those questions and are concerned about the EPA moving forward with a scheme to unilaterally cap carbon dioxide emissions from coal. I share those concerns, which is why I have offered this legislation.""\Mollohan said, ""Climate change will remain deeply controversial, but our approach is the only one that has a chance of bringing all sides together to stop what most everyone agrees is a very bad idea - EPA pushing ahead with its own regulations.""\Contact writer Ry Rivard at ry.rivard@dailymail.com or 304-348-5185.\Credit: DAILY MAIL CAPITOL REPORTER"
62,"MORGANTOWN - U.S. Rep. Alan Mollohan hopes voters in the May 11 primary will look at what he's done for them during his 28 years in Congress and ignore a ""smear campaign"" he says began four years ago with Republicans. \He says that smear campaign continues today with his Democratic challenger, state Sen. Michael Oliverio.\Look around, Mollohan says, and see institutions and thousands of jobs that might not have existed without his help - an aerospace complex in Bridgeport, an FBI center in Clarksburg, a NASA facility in Fairmont, a federal energy lab in Morgantown, a technology-transfer center in Wheeling.\""I have worked to diversify our economy so it's more diverse and resilient and flexible in both good and bad times,"" says Mollohan, 66. ""We've not only tried to do that; we've been extremely, demonstratively successful in that.""\But look closer, says Oliverio, a 46-year-old financial adviser from Morgantown who claims Mollohan's vulnerability now makes him the Democratic Party's best hope at holding onto the seat this fall.\Look at lingering questions about Mollohan's ethics and personal finances, Oliverio says.\""Is it appropriate to fight for an earmark for a company, then go into business with the owner of that company? I don't think so,"" he says.\""I saw our congressman have to resign from the ethics committee,"" Oliverio says. ""I've seen our congressman on the national evening news regarding an ethical scandal. I think the congressman from northern West Virginia ought to be on the evening news for accomplishment and achievement, and not on the national news for continued ethical questions.""\Questions have dogged Mollohan since 2006, when the Justice Department opened an investigation that is believed to have focused on the rapid growth of his personal wealth and his pattern of securing federal funds for nonprofits he helped create.\Mollohan stepped down as the ranking Democrat on the House ethics committee that April and stepped aside in early 2007 from a subcommittee that handles funding for the Justice Department.\But the investigation ended in January without comment or charges.\Mollohan insists he's done nothing wrong, and that the investigation was punishment for his refusal to let Republicans undermine ethics committee rules in an attempt to protect former Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas.\The investigation began under the Republican administration of George W. Bush and ended under that of Democrat Barack Obama, and neither saw fit to charge him, Mollohan says.\""Trying to represent this as something other than an exoneration is really just unworthy of politics, and it's really unworthy of him,"" Mollohan says of Oliverio.\""The only ethical issues associated with this campaign are the questions he brings on himself by raising these accusations.""\Oliverio argues the duration of the investigation suggests there was a lot to look at. Finding no evidence to support charges is not the same as being cleared, he says.\""Maybe there's a fine line between something being 'very unethical' and something being 'criminal,' and whether the ball falls on one side of the line or the other, you still have a real problem with it,"" he says.\Oliverio, who believes voters see him as honest, hardworking and deliberative, points to his 18 years as a legislator as reason to elect him: He pushed for rules that made the lawmaking process more transparent, reduced taxes on the poor, supported higher education reforms and funding, and helped fix broken systems for workers' compensation and physicians' medical malpractice insurance.\But his campaign ads and interviews also focus heavily on his opponent.\The ethics probe was also a focal point of the Republican effort to defeat Mollohan in 2006, but the incumbent carried 64 percent of the vote over challenger Chris Wakim.\In 2008, Mollohan went unopposed.\He might have gone unchallenged in this primary if Oliverio hadn't sensed and shared the anti-incumbent sentiment that surveys nationwide have documented.\Oliverio had been planning to run for re-election to the state Senate but changed his mind in January after seeing Mollohan support health-care reform and take long to publicly oppose proposed cap-and-trade legislation.\Mollohan says Oliverio is distorting reality, and that he worked with power companies, the United Mine Workers and others to try and improve the cap-and-trade legislation while remaining ""a vigorous opponent"" who ultimately cast a no vote.\Cap-and-trade and Mollohan's support of health-care reform have cost him the endorsements of newspapers that in the past supported him, including the conservative Ogden Newspapers chain. Editorials complain he's lost touch with his district and can't be counted on to do what's best for West Virginia.\""He voted for the health-care bill, which every public opinion poll shows his constituents oppose overwhelmingly,"" said The Inter-Mountain of Elkins.\But Mollohan rejects that notion, arguing most of his constituents wanted the reform that he has championed for years. The legislation addresses ""really fundamental failures"" of the system, he says, including denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, capping benefits and allowing insurers to decide what tests and procedures a doctor can order.\Mollohan also says he worked hard to ensure no public funds are used for abortions and is confident the legislation achieved that, even though the National Right to Life Political Action Committee endorsed Oliverio.\""I've been true to my pro-life stance and also to my 28-year commitment to health care reform,"" Mollohan says. Those who disagree ""probably felt I had too progressive an agenda all along.""\Mollohan is confident voters will again recognize he has faithfully supported the district's industries, economic development and environment.\But Oliverio believes voters are grateful to have another choice.\""If they judge the ethical behavior of Congressman Mollohan to be acceptable and to their liking, and they feel that he is continuing to represent their interests, they'll vote for him,"" he says.\""If they feel that a change is necessary and they believe I'm the type of person who can represent them with honor and integrity, they'll make the change.""\Credit: The Associated Press"
63," THIS is one of those stories that I'd really like to start with a loud scream to give people some idea of how terrible it is. As a newspaper story, it has no soundtrack and comes without pictures. It appears to involve some technical aspects of an environmental regulation, and that can be counted on to bore the shoes and socks off people.\ But there is a picture, quite a famous one, that you should search out so you will know what is at stake. The picture, by the great photojournalist W. Eugene Smith, is known as ""The Madonna of Minamata"" and is of a Japanese woman in a hot bath with an expression of terrible sorrow and tenderness on her face as she holds the hopelessly deformed body of her daughter.\ Smith's classic book, ""Minamata: Words and Photographs,"" is about the site of a horrific 1970s case of widespread mercury poisoning. No one who sees Smith's photos can ever forget them. There was a years-long struggle between the townspeople of Minamata and the corporation responsible for the mercury poisoning, which did not want to admit fault. During that struggle, corporate guards beat Smith so badly he lost his eyesight.\ So, that's what this is about. Not that anyone has blinded a great photojournalist lately, but mercury in the environment is mercury in the environment, and mercury hotspots are mind- bogglingly dangerous. Mercury is a neurotoxin that is particularly dangerous to developing fetuses and infants. Even in minute quantities, it produces brain damage ranging from retardation to loss of IQ to attention deficit disorder.\ As you may know, one in six American women of child-bearing age already has enough mercury in her blood to put a developing fetus at risk. That's why pregnant women are urged not to eat many ocean and freshwater fish. Mercury also causes heart attacks among adults.\ If the Clean Air Act, already in place, were simply implemented as it is supposed to be by the Environmental Protection Agency, we would be rid of over 90 percent of mercury emissions in this country by 2008. But, of course, that would cost the power industry a lot of money, and the power industry gives lots of money to politicians. So the EPA came up with a ""cap and trade"" system, under which power plants can avoid meaningful regulation until after 2025.\ Then, the EPA, whose name is rapidly becoming a morbid joke, had the gall to put out a press release claiming its new rule will cut mercury by 70 percent in 2018. Using the EPA's own figures, it fails to do even that. We'd be lucky to get a 50 percent reduction by 2020, according to Natural Resources Defense Council.\ The worse news is that ""cap and trade"" allows individual power plants to trade emissions credits, so while some states will have less mercury emission, other states will have enormous increases. God help you if you live near one of these future hotspots. NRDC estimates an 841 percent increase for California, 176 percent in Colorado, 241 percent in New Hampshire and 56 percent in New Jersey.\ ""It is unconscionable EPA is allowing power companies to trade in a powerful neurotoxin - it is unprecedented and illegal,"" said William Becker, director of the bipartisan State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators.\ Now here's another charming note. As is becoming monotonously repetitious with the Bush administration, it turns out the EPA simply ignored scientific opinion on this subject. The Washington Post reports that the EPA based its new system of ""regulation"" on a cost-benefit analysis - cost to industry vs. public health payoff. ""What they did not reveal is that a Harvard University study paid for by the EPA, co-authored by an EPA scientist and peer-reviewed by two other EPA scientists had reached the opposite conclusion. That analysis estimated health benefits 100 times as great as the EPA did, but top agency officials ordered the finding stripped from public documents, said a staff member who helped develop the rule.""\ One hundred times as much? Gee, maybe the Harvard study is too alarmist. OK, try the EPA's definition of cost-benefit analysis. According to its numbers, 600,000 babies of the approximately 4 million born a year are potentially exposed to mercury emissions. The EPA estimates the health benefits at $50 million, which works out to $83.33 per brain-damaged child. That's some cost-benefit ratio there.\ I often think I have exhausted my capacity for outrage with this administration. Sheesh, why let what it does ruin a beautiful spring day in Texas? But I know kids with ADD and low IQs and brain damage, and I've seen the pictures from Minamata. If you can't reach outrage over this one, you may be eating too much mercury-tainted fish.\ Ivins is a syndicated columnist."
64,"As Congress continues to debate cap-and-trade, the clock will start ticking today on a measure aimed at energy and the environment in West Virginia. \Gov. Joe Manchin's proposal to boost alternative and renewable energy sources is among at least 20 legislative measures passed this year that become law July 1.\The plan sets 2025 as the deadline for tapping such sources as solar, wind, biomass and synthetic fuel for at least 25 percent of the electricity sold in the Mountain State.\But with 96 percent of West Virginia's power now derived from coal, the new law includes gasified, liquefied and waste forms of that fossil fuel under the alternative heading. That category also embraces natural gas, which is also found throughout the state but now accounts for less than 1 percent of the power it produces.\The measure shows West Virginians are ""continuing our march toward energy independence, while taking steps to better protect our environment,"" Manchin spokesman Matt Turner said.\The legislation had its critics, mostly minority Republicans in the House who questioned the need and the focus on non-coal sources. Some lawmakers had also sought to include nuclear energy in the mix, without success.\Another new law will change West Virginia's Promise college scholarship. Grappling with the successful program's explosive growth, lawmakers set a funding ""floor"" for the merit-based award at $4,750 annually.\Promise has covered tuition and fees at any of the state's public colleges and universities, or an equivalent amount at its private institutions, for up to four years. About 9,300 West Virginians now rely on Promise to attend college, and the program's resulting price tag has surged from $10.2 million in 2002 to $42.3 million this year.\The legislation allows for larger future awards if program funding increases, while slightly increasing its share of lottery revenues. Students who land the scholarship by the end of this year are exempt from the new limit.\Several of the July 1 measures emerged from the public schools section of Manchin's 2009 agenda.\One offers to help counties with after-school and summer programs aimed at third- and eighth-graders unable to meet critical skills standards. Another will exempt schools from state policies and rules when they become ""innovation zones"" designed to boost student achievement.\To lure computer-server farms and related high-tech employers, West Virginia will begin offering such businesses breaks on property and consumer sales taxes.\- The Associated Press"
65,"WASHINGTON - The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Wednesday offered legislation to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades while adding protections for consumers and industries.\The measure would be the country's most ambitious effort to reshape the economy, change the way energy is produced and used, and head off potentially catastrophic climate changes such as rising sea levels and mass extinctions.\For the first time, the bill sets a system that would cap the overall amount of earth-warming pollution that U.S. companies can emit and reduces the amount each year through 2050.\Companies would be required to pay for permits to pollute. They could sell or save permits they don't need to use immediately, and in some cases the government would grant permits to help companies make the transition to an economy in which carbon is controlled.\The new measure adds several major new elements to a version of the bill passed by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in December. The Senate will start debate on the new version of the legislation the first week in June.\The new parts include:\* A cost containment plan. If the price of carbon allowances sold on the market reaches a certain level, a limited amount of additional allowances would be released onto the market to lower the price. These allowances would be borrowed from future amounts, so that the end goal in 2050 could still be met.\* Help for consumers: The bill would set aside an estimated $800 billion in tax relief from the sale of allowances through 2050 for people who need help paying for energy. The details remain to be worked out.\It also provides an estimated $911 billion through 2050 that would be distributed through local electric and gas distribution companies to help consumers offset higher energy prices and to promote efficiency and clean energy.\* Proceeds from the sales of some allowances would be transferred to the Treasury to ensure that the system would not increase the deficit.\Just under half of all pollution permits would be sold at auction. The rest would be handed out to carbon-intensive industries to help them make the transition to cleaner energy and to states and other public entities to reduce energy-related hardships, improve efficiency and cope with problems caused by global warming.\The legislation says that 89 percent of all permits would be used for public purposes. Proceeds from some of the allowances would be used to develop clean-energy technologies.\Although the bill covers most of the greenhouse gases emitted in the United States, its goal for reductions by 2050 is less than what international scientists say is needed to prevent catastrophic climate change.\""I think the bill has been strengthened enormously,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Senate environment panel. She said the bill would create new jobs, ensure a level playing field for American businesses and protect consumers so that they don't suffer from high costs.\Boxer said she hopes that over time the goals for emissions can be toughened.\Republican John McCain and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama all support an economy-wide cap and trade program. President Bush prefers voluntary reductions.\Boxer said it was important to start work on the bill.\""Landmark bills don't pass in a week or a day,"" she said.\One hot part of the debate will be on how to ensure that China and India impose emissions cuts of their own.\The new bill would require that importers pay a fee for products from companies that do not have emission limits. Some experts say such fees could spark retaliatory trade measures or encourage the countries to sell their products elsewhere, and would not be effective in getting them to impose emissions cuts.\A study released Wednesday by two Washington research organizations, the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the World Resources Institute, argued that the best way to ensure a level playing field would be to pursue international agreements and target relief at U.S. industries most affected by emissions controls and facing international competition.\The report ""Leveling the Carbon Playing Field: International Competition and U.S. Climate Policy Design"" can be read at www.wri.org.\The legislation is called the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, after its cosponsors, Sens. Joe Lieberman, an independent Democrat from Connecticut, and John Warner, a Republican from Virginia.\To read the latest version of the bill: http://epw.senate.gov, click on ""information on the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner Substitute to the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, S. 2191""\Credit: McClatchy Newspapers"
66,"WASHINGTON - Most people don't remember Obamacare's notorious Section 1233, mandating government payments for end-of-life counseling. \It aroused so much anxiety as a possible first slippery step on the road to state-mandated late-life rationing that the Senate never included it in the final health care law.\Well, it's back - by administrative fiat.\A month ago, Medicare issued a regulation providing for end-of-life counseling during annual ""wellness"" visits. It was all nicely buried amid the simultaneous release of hundreds of new Medicare rules.\Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., author of Section 1233, was delighted.\""Mr. Blumenauer's office celebrated 'a quiet victory,' but urged supporters not to crow about it,"" reports The New York Times.\Deathly quiet.\In early November, his office sent an e-mail plea to supporters: ""We would ask that you not broadcast this accomplishment out to any of your lists ... e-mails can too easily be forwarded.""\They had been lucky that ""thus far, it seems that no press or blogs have discovered it. ... The longer this (regulation) goes unnoticed, the better our chances of keeping it.""\So much for Democratic transparency - and for their repeated claim that the more people learn what is in the health care law, the more they will like it.\Turns out ignorance is the Democrats' best hope.\And regulation is their perfect vehicle - so much quieter than legislation.\Consider two other regulatory usurpations in just the last few days:\On Dec. 23, the Interior Department issued Secretarial Order 3310 reversing a 2003 decision and giving itself the authority to designate public lands as ""Wild Lands.""\A clever twofer:\(1) a bureaucratic power grab - for seven years up through Dec. 22, wilderness designation had been the exclusive province of Congress, and\(2) a leftward lurch - more land to be ""protected"" from such nefarious uses as domestic oil exploration in a country disastrously dependent on foreign sources.\The very same day, the president's Environmental Protection Agency declared that in 2011 it would begin drawing up anti-carbon regulations on oil refineries and power plants, another power grab effectively enacting what Congress had firmly rejected when presented as cap-and-trade legislation.\For an Obama bureaucrat, however, the will of Congress is a mere speed bump.\Hence this regulatory trifecta, each one moving smartly left - and nicely clarifying what the spirit of bipartisan compromise that President Obama heralded in his post-lame-duck Dec. 22 news conference was really about: a shift to the center for public consumption and political appearance only.\On that day, Obama finally embraced the tax-cut compromise he had initially excoriated, but only to avoid forfeiting its obvious political benefit - its appeal to independent voters who demand bipartisanship and are the key to Obama's re-election.\But make no mistake: Obama's initial excoriation in his angry Dec. 7 news conference was the authentic Obama. He hated the deal.\Now as always, Obama's heart lies left. For those fooled into thinking otherwise by the new Obama of Dec. 22, his administration's defiantly liberal regulatory moves - on the environment, energy and health care - should disabuse even the most beguiled.\These regulatory power plays make political sense. Because Obama needs to appear to reclaim the center, he will stage his more ideological fights in yawn-inducing regulatory hearings rather than in the dramatic spotlight of congressional debate.\How better to impose a liberal agenda on a center-right nation than regulatory stealth?\It's Obama's only way forward during the next two years. He will never get past the half-Republican 112th what he could not get past the overwhelmingly Democratic 111th. He doesn't have the votes and he surely doesn't want the publicity.\Hence the quiet resurrection, as it were, of end-of-life counseling.\Obama knows he has only so many years to change the country.\In his first two, he achieved much: the first stimulus, Obamacare and financial regulation. For the next two, however, the Republican House will prevent any repetition of that.\Obama's agenda will therefore have to be advanced by the more subterranean means of rule-by-regulation.\But this must simultaneously be mixed with ostentatious displays of legislative bipartisanship (e.g., the lame-duck tax-cut deal) in order to pull off the (apparent) centrist repositioning required for re-election.\This, in turn, would grant Obama four more years when, freed from the need for pretense, he can reassert himself ideologically and complete the social-democratic transformation - begun Jan. 20, 2009; derailed Nov. 2, 2010 - that is the mission of his presidency.\Krauthammer may be reached by e-mail at letters@charleskrauthammer.com.\Credit: Charles Krauthammer"
67," LONDON - Big business fears that the fight against climate change will cost billions are now giving way to a different view: Green can be the color of money.\ The United States, Europe and Japan are locked in a frantic race to cash in on the exploding business of saving the planet. London has become the center for the multibillion-dollar market in carbon emissions, attracting investors who trade CO2 allowances.\ Silicon Valley is leading the way in attracting venture capital for green technologies that shows signs of mirroring the dot-com boom - and critics say eventual bust - of the 1990s. Japan's Toyota has sold more than a million Prius hybrid models, its cutting-edge eco-friendly car.\ Like all markets, the clean-energy industry faces risks.\ A sustained fall in the world's steep oil prices could make investment in alternatives to fossil fuels seem less attractive.\ More important, to sustain business's new attraction to clean energy, governments must maintain, or even step up, efforts to cut carbon emissions. Toward that end, a major U.N. meeting will be held in Bali, Indonesia, in December aimed at reaching a new global climate pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.\ For now, the battle against global warming continues to offer investors an unusual chance to be idealistic and greedy at the same time.\ ""Everybody is jumping on the bandwagon,"" said Milo Sjardin, a senior associate at New Energy Finance, a research house in London on the world's clean energy and carbon markets.\ The City of London financial district has taken the lead in making billions from the management of CO2 emissions, one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services.\ The carbon market was created after Europe signed the 1997 Kyoto agreement on curbing greenhouse gases. In 2005, European governments started capping the amounts of carbon dioxide industries could emit, while letting them buy and sell CO2 emission allowances.\ The cap-and-trade system encourages factories and industries to cut emissions by giving them ""pollution permits."" If they produce less greenhouse gases than the total of their permits, they can sell the surplus certificates - also known as credits - to companies that find them cheaper than cutting their own emissions.\ That created the fast-growing carbon markets, where certificates are bought and sold like a commodity. It also includes investments in projects that help to generate additional credits.\ America has emerged as the world leader in developing clean- energy technologies.\ It involves a wide range of sectors, including wind, solar, biofuels, biomass (organic material to produce power and heat), energy efficiency technology, hydrogen and fuel cells, and tidal power.\ Dr. Andrew Dlugolecki, head of Andlug Consulting, a strategic consulting group on climate change and the financial sector based in Perth, Scotland, said oil companies, carmakers and power generators are increasing their investments in renewables and biofuels.\ Silicon Valley venture capitalists also are rushing into the business, hoping to design revolutionary technologies, drive down prices and defeat energy business giants, said Dlugolecki.\ Some entrepreneurs are seeking technological and scientific innovations to produce alternatives to oil and coal, while others hope to find ways of using those fuels in cleaner and more efficient ways.\ Other investors are pouring money into wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower.\ as countries such as China and more than 20 states in America require a certain portion of energy sold to come from renewable sources.\ A recent survey of investors found many of them are turning green.\ Deloitte Touche's 2006 ""Global Venture Capital Survey"" in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa found that for a second year in a row respondents selected energy/ environment as the sector most likely to see the highest increase in investment focus.\ That also has led to a word of caution for investors.\ ""There's a lot of money chasing not so many ideas, so the prices are going up fast, raising some concern that this activity by venture capitalists and hedge funds could produce the next dot-com bust,"" said Dlugolecki.\ New Energy Finance, which tracks all investment flows in the clean-energy market, said 1,250 capital and private equity funds were investing in companies involved in the market in 2006.\ In that year, $4 billion in investment originated in the Americas, mostly the United States, compared to $1.6 billion for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\ The investment in the clean-energy market also doubled from 2005 to 2006 in the Americas, while remaining about the same in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, New Energy Finance said.\ However, when it comes to initial public offerings for clean- energy companies in 2006, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, turned the tables, producing a total value of $4.8 billion, compared to $2 billion in the Americas, said New Energy Finance.\ One reason is that clean-energy IPOs appear to favor London because AIM - the Alternative Investment Market submarket of the London Stock Exchange - allows smaller companies to float shares with a more flexible regulatory system than is applicable to the main market and Wall Street.\ Credit: The Associated Press"
68,"PITTSBURGH - President Obama pressed Congress to scrap billions in oil company tax breaks and pass legislation to help the nation kick a dangerous ""fossil fuel addiction"" Wednesday, trying to channel disgust over the worsening oil disaster into a force for clean energy.\Seeking opportunity in a crisis, Obama argued for action in Congress as crews struggled into a seventh week to contain BP's mangled oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. He urged lawmakers to shift the tax-break money toward clean-energy research and approve a major energy bill, now stalled in the Senate, that would slap a price on carbon emissions.\""Our continued dependence on fossil fuels will jeopardize our national security,"" he declared. ""It will smother our planet. And it will continue to put our economy and our environment at risk.""\Among the costs, Obama said in a speech at Carnegie Mellon University, is the risk that comes with drilling deep below offshore waters to find oil. He received sustained applause when he said, ""We have to acknowledge that an America that runs solely on fossil fuels should not be the vision that we have for our children and grandchildren.""\Obama's tough words about Big Oil came as he and oil giant BP face growing unhappiness from a public watching the disaster unfold day by day. What started with an oil rig explosion on April 20 has become the worst spill in U.S. history, with oil reaching shorelines and still gushing with no permanent fix in sight.\The Justice Department is investigating, and Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday of BP: ""My guess is that there are all kinds of discussions about whether or not they pushed the envelope with the rig operator beyond what it should be pushed to safely pursue."" Biden, in a pretaped interview for Charlie Rose's PBS talk show, said that if any civil or criminal violations are found ""they will be pursued to the extent of the law.""\The president tried to tap into the discontent and use it as an urgent call for legislative action.\""If we refuse to take into account the full cost of our fossil fuel addiction - if we don't factor in the environmental costs and national security costs and true economic costs - we will have missed our best chance to seize a clean energy future,"" he said.\Obama faces serious difficulties in pushing for the bill he wants - a shrinking legislative window in a divisive election year, the distracting nature of the oil spill crisis itself and the contentious idea of putting a price on carbon pollution.\The House last year narrowly passed legislation creating a system, known as ""cap and trade,"" to limit global warming emissions and auction allowances to polluters. A bipartisan effort on a different version of climate and energy legislation in the Senate has been in the works for months but has no clear path ahead.\The president offered his most determined promise to date.\""The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months."" Obama declared.\He added, ""The next generation will not be held hostage to energy sources from the last century.""\Tucked in there was a reminder from the president that he does support more offshore drilling at home. Indeed, Obama was viewed by environmentalists as proposing giveaways to the oil industry when he announced a limited expansion of offshore drilling in March.\Since the Gulf explosion, Obama has pulled back on some of those plans and ordered an investigation into the spill. In his speech, he made sure to say that any new drilling would be just one part of an energy strategy, and only as a short-term bridge toward a clean energy economy.\Obama has consistently championed alternative energy sources and adopted energy efficiency programs and standards for cars and homes.\The president has been getting increasingly aggressive in his proposals to raise taxes on oil companies since taking office last year.\But he had little success before the BP oil spill.\Obama proposed about $31 billion in tax increases on oil and gas companies in his first budget proposal, released shortly after taking office. After none were enacted, he proposed nearly $37 billion in tax increases in the budget plan he released in February.\Congress showed no appetite for the tax increases until the House passed a bill last week that would increase the per barrel tax on oil from 8 cents to 34 cents to help finance a federal fund to clean up spills in the nation's waterways. That tax hike, now before the Senate, would raise nearly $12 billion over the next decade.\Overall, Obama's economic speech struck a deeply partisan tone as a potentially pivotal midterm election looms in November. He repeatedly sought to frame Democrats as the party in favor of reshaping the economy and holding powerful interests accountable, while he cast Republicans as trying to obstruct him by saying no.\Here, too, Obama tried to connect with people struggling with economic insecurity - and perhaps likely to blame the party in power, Democrats. He contended that Democrats see the value of a safety net while Republicans favor such little government help that they leave people ""on their own.""\Credit: The Associated Press"
69,"Jay Rockefeller began his serious political career by betraying thousands of people who knew strip mining was ruining our mountains. Now, nearing the end of his political career, he has betrayed his co-conspirators in the massive destruction of our mountains. \On June 20, 2012, Rockefeller gave a speech on the Senate floor. He spoke against a resolution that called for lower limits for mercury and other toxins coming from coal-fired power plants. In his speech he accused coal industry leaders of cynical scare tactics, attacking false enemies like the EPA, denying ""real problems"" like global warming, refusing to compromise, closing themselves off opposing voices, being afraid to ""dare to speak out for change - even though it's been staring them in the face for years,"" and wanting to turn back the clock, ignore the present and block the future.\Rockefeller told coal leaders to listen to what West Virginians are saying about our water, air, our health and our concern for our grandparents and grandchildren who "" ... are the most susceptible to pollution.""\He used strong words and a tone of disdain for his fellow mountain destroyers in a July 16 West Virginia Public Radio interview. He said he has had it with coal industry leaders' refusal to entertain any middle ground, and denying even a hint of legitimacy for the views on the other side.\Orwell's novel, 1984, came to mind hearing Rockefeller say that coal industry leaders are ""caught in groupthink, they can't split off and say something the others don't approve of, even if it would be helpful.""\Rockefeller told of a meeting with 20 coal executives after a speech concerning cap and trade that they didn't like. All they did was complain about Obama and the EPA for two hours. ""Obama hates coal; we hate EPA, for two hours nothing else came up."" He told Beth Voorhees of West Virginia Public Radio.\It is refreshing to learn that Rockefeller believes there is a scientific consensus on global warming and a mounting national desire for a cleaner, healthier environment. Rockefeller, unlike Republicans and DINOs Joe Manchin, Earl Ray Tomblin and Nick Rahall, agrees with the research showing that coal pollutants cause debilitating chronic illness. Rockefeller praised the EPA for establishing that coal-fired power plant emissions have serious and long-term impacts on premature deaths, heart attacks, hospitalizations, pregnant women, babies and children. He declared to the Senate that ""Maybe some can shrug off the advice of the American Academy of Pediatrics and others but I cannot.""\Among the ""others"" must be the WVU studies, screamed at by the coal industry, showing elevated major diseases and birth defects in counties where coal is mined and especially so near mountaintop removal strip mining. Coal industry lawyers posted online that the birth defects could have been caused by inbreeding. Those are the kind of folks Rockefeller has been carrying water for since he lost to Arch Moore and took up with the coal industry.\Make no mistake. Rockefeller isn't anti-coal. He wants to save the coal industry. He wants them to get smart and honest - a giant task for sure. He says it's not too late for the coal industry to accept scientific findings and quit trying to scare people. He still shouts out for the oxymoron ""clean coal."" That way, his baby, mountaintop removal strip mining, can continue its destruction, and the coal industry can continue to reap their profits from destroying our mountains.\Rockefeller has not renounced his renunciation of our mountains. There is nothing new from him about the tragedy of strip mining and the debilitating major diseases in areas where mountaintop removal and other forms of coal mining take place. The same kind of stats he uses to attack the coal industry on coal-fired power plant emissions apply to the production of coal from beginning to end.\I look forward to Rockefeller coming home to Emmons and, standing on scalped Ashford Ridge, announce that he is once again for the banning of strip mining.\Martin, of Charleston, is vice president for state affairs of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy.\Credit: Julian Martin"
70,"GREEN BAY, Wis. - In early June, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed a long-term plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. The agency describes its Clean Power Plan as a ""common-sense way to reduce risks to public health and the economy posed by climate change. It argues that the new rules will maintain an ""affordable, reliable energy system while also ""cutting pollution and protecting our health and environment now and for future generations. As expected, critics argue falsely that the EPA plan will harm the economy and cost jobs.\The agency's power plant rules reflect the failure of Congress to consider climate change policy. Most House and Senate Republicans, and some Democrats, have made clear that they do not accept the scientific evidence that climate change is real and that human actions are responsible for it.\Along with the fossil fuel industry, they have demonized scientists and advocates for policy action and confused the public about the risks and costs of climate change.\As a result, the Obama administration is forced to use its executive authority under the Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the nation's economy and public health. The EPA plan, currently open for public comment, offers a creative, flexible and efficient way to do that.\The plan's goal is to reduce carbon pollution from power generators, chiefly older coal-fired plants, by 30 percent from 2005 levels, by 2030. Such plants are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and they are being phased out already because of their age and inefficiency. As a result, we are now about halfway toward meeting the 2030 goals.\There is an added benefit to the new rules. Reducing carbon emissions also will cut levels of other dangerous pollutants such as fine particles and ozone by more than 25 percent. Thus the plan brings substantial and measurable public health benefits.\The EPA estimates the climate and public health benefits together are worth from $55 billion to $93 billion per year by 2030, an amount that greatly exceeds the estimated compliance costs of $7.3 billion to $8.8 billion a year.\The agency's economic analysis shows a substantial annual net benefit to the economy of between $49 billion to $84 billion for the year 2030, and creation of tens of thousands of new jobs. In short, we can reduce carbon pollution and still enjoy strong economic growth.\Of course, costs and benefits, and job gains and losses, are not uniform across the nation; some states and regions will be affected more than others. This is why the EPA plan gives the 50 states exceptional flexibility and encourages them to find the most economical ways to reach their goals.\Among the choices the states will have in addition to cleaning up the worst coal-fired power plants are to rely more on renewable sources, cleaner natural gas, or nuclear power; to invest in energy efficiency and conservation; and to join with other states in regional cap-and-trade market-based programs.\EPA administrator Gina McCarthy is committed to working closely with the states to achieve national energy and environmental goals at minimal cost to the economy; each state will have plenty of time to make adjustments consistent with its unique situation. This is especially important for those states that are heavily dependent on coal.\The substantial benefits of the rules come from improved energy efficiency, reduced waste and development of new energy sources and technologies, all of which will create jobs and improve the economy. An energy efficient economy also can be innovative and competitive, which is essential for the nation to do well in a global economy.\Critics will continue to blame the EPA for wrecking the economy. The facts, however, suggest the opposite is true.\Michael E. Kraft is professor emeritus of political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.\Credit: Michael E. Kraft"
71,"WASHINGTON - President Obama signaled his willingness to tackle climate change with his pick of Gina McCarthy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, one of three major appointments he announced Monday. \A 25-year veteran of environmental policy and politics, McCarthy has worked for Republicans and Democrats, including Obama's presidential rival, Mitt Romney, who tapped her to help draft state plans for curbing the pollution linked to global warming. Along with McCarthy, Obama nominated MIT nuclear physicist Ernie Moniz to lead the Energy Department and Wal-Mart's Sylvia Mathews Burwell to head the budget office.\Burwell, from Hinton, W.Va., is a Washington veteran, having served in several posts during the Clinton administration, including deputy OMB director. She currently heads the Wal-Mart Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the retail giant, and previously served as president of the Gates Foundation's Global Development Program.\McCarthy, 58, a Boston native, has led the EPA's air pollution division since 2009, ushering in a host of new rules targeting air pollution from power plants, automobiles, and oil and gas production.\In a statement, Rep. Shelley Moore Capito said she is disappointed but not surprised that Obama chose McCarthy.\Capito said that McCarthy was behind many of the anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama administration, including ""the CSAPR rule that was struck down as unlawful by a federal appeals court.\""This nomination represents a missed opportunity for the President to chart a new course that balances environmental regulations with the need for jobs in our local communities,"" Capito said. ""Coal jobs are not the only ones put at risk by the President's environmental policy. On Friday another study found that the Keystone pipeline would have no significant environmental impact.\""Nonetheless, the President continues to delay approval of a project that will create thousands of American jobs and improve our energy security at a time when gas prices climb higher and higher,"" Capito said.\In nominating McCarthy as the nation's top environmental official, Obama is promoting a climate change champion at a time when he has renewed his commitment to address global warming and the agency is contemplating a host of new rules that could help achieve that. But McCarthy will have to balance the administration's ambitions with a dwindling budget: Congress has cut EPA's budget by 18 percent during the last two years, and the automatic budget cuts that went into effect Friday will hinder the agency's energy efficiency programs and climate research.\Moniz, 68, as head of MIT's Energy Initiative, has worked on developing ways to produce power while curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\He was also a former Energy Department undersecretary under Clinton. He's advised Obama on numerous energy topics, including how to handle the country's nuclear waste and the natural gas produced by the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing.\Environmental groups are wary of Moniz, because of his support of natural gas and nuclear power. His MIT Energy Initiative has received funding from oil companies such as BP, Shell and Chevron.\""They're going to be making sure we're investing in American energy, that we're doing everything we can to combat the threat of climate change, that we're going to be creating jobs and economic opportunity,"" Obama said.\He then praised McCarthy for putting in place during the last four years what he said were ""practical, cost-effective ways to keep our air clean and our economy growing.""\Already, McCarthy has orchestrated many of the agency's most controversial new rules, such as placing the first-ever limits on greenhouse gases on newly built power plants and a long-overdue standard to control toxic mercury pollution from burning coal for electricity. On her plate, should she be confirmed by the Senate, will be even more rules - from lowering sulfur emissions from gasoline to controlling global warming pollution from the older coal-fired power plants.\Like those regulations, her nomination is all but guaranteed to spark criticism from Republicans, who charge that the agency is killing jobs and undermining the coal industry. Environmentalists, meanwhile, will be looking to ensure that McCarthy issues the toughest rules possible, particularly when it comes to controlling emissions from the existing fleet of power plants.\Despite the partisanship in Washington, McCarthy has said the environment is a non-partisan issue, saying that the choice ""doesn't have to be, 'Can I have a job or can I breathe clean air.'""\But she hasn't backed down when politicians have falsely portrayed her agency's work, such as suggesting EPA was poised to regulate cow flatulence to combat climate change and was looking to go after farmers for spilling milk.\""When I listen to their concerns, I am struck by the fact that what they think we are often doing bears little or no relationship to what we are actually doing,"" she said in testimony before Congress in April 2011.\Obama called her on Monday ""a straight-shooter"" who ""welcomes different points of views.""\Last year, the American Petroleum Institute praised an EPA rule for which she was responsible because it gave drillers two additional years to curb pollution from recently drilled oil and gas wells.\At the state level, McCarthy pressed for federal action to reduce greenhouse gases and was a key player in setting up the nation's first mandatory cap-and-trade system to reduce global warming pollution from power plants in 10 states. As head of Connecticut's environmental department, she is credited with convincing Republican Gov. Jodi Rell not to abolish a 10-state regional pact, even as other Republicans, including Romney, pulled out.\McCarthy was also Connecticut's point person on the environment when the state joined a lawsuit aimed at forcing the EPA to regulate global warming emissions from automobiles. When the Supreme Court ruled in April 2007 in the state's favor, McCarthy said ""there's no downside."" Many of the regulations she has helped shape at the agency stemmed from that case.\But the state of Connecticut also sued the Bush administration for a limit on ground-level ozone, the primary ingredient in smog, which McCarthy believed was too weak. That standard is still in place, thanks to a decision by Obama to stall the fast-tracking of a stricter smog limit that had been drafted by McCarthy's division at EPA.\Environmentalists praised the nomination Monday, stressing her pragmatic approach to solving environmental problems and her ability to work with both parties.\Former Obama climate adviser and Clinton EPA administrator Carol Browner said in an interview that McCarthy has ""a good understanding what the president needs to do, wants to do on climate change, which is to find the sweet spot for everyone, from the environmentalists to the states to companies.""\But conservatives immediately stressed her role in what they view would be destructive policies from EPA.\""McCarthy will continue the regulatory attack on oil, coal and natural gas with the result that Americans will experience increasing energy costs and high unemployment rates,"" said Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a conservative think tank that receives some support from the fossil fuel industry.\Moniz, 68, was a former Energy Department undersecretary under Clinton.

73,"WASHINGTON - If the long conservative era that began with Ronald Reagan's election is over, will the judges appointed during the right's ascendancy be able to block, frustrate and undermine the efforts of a new progressive majority? \Consider this analysis from two influential journalists describing Supreme Court justices as ""the last hope of the conservative interests in the United States.""\Imagine, they write, that a new liberal approach to the country's problems ""had been overwhelmingly approved both in Congress and at the polling booths,"" so ""conservative interests resorted to the courts, starting literally thousands of actions to stay the government's hand."" Of the ensuing fight, they say: ""The liberal justices themselves called their conservative colleagues arbitrary and madly unwise. But while the liberals warned, the conservatives laughed ... .""\Yes, we may go back to the future. Those words are from a still-compelling 1938 book called ""The 168 Days"" by legendary Washington journalists Joseph Alsop and Turner Catledge. They were writing about the conservative Supreme Court that struck down so much of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program and the effort by FDR to be given the power to name additional liberal justices to break the court's conservative majority.\Roosevelt's reach for expanded executive authority was unwise because he made it easy for his opponents to compare him to Hitler and Stalin. FDR lost the court-packing fight, but eventually got to name justices in the normal way, and conservative judicial dominance ebbed.\The spate of 5-4 conservative decisions during the Supreme Court term just ended should stand as a warning that we may soon revisit the fights of 70 years ago. Yet almost nobody is talking about this danger. To the extent that judges have been a campaign issue in recent elections, the focus has been on a few hot-button issues, notably abortion. After last week's sharply contested Second Amendment case, perhaps gun rights will join the list.\But the more important question is whether conservative judges will see fit to do exactly what conservative courts did for much of the New Deal era by using a narrow, 19th-century definition of property rights to void progressive economic, environmental and labor regulation.\Many judicial conservatives view the late-1930s period as a disaster because it marked the end of their power on the courts. After the court-packing battle, the Supreme Court began to defer to the democratically elected branches of government and their efforts to regulate the economy in the public interest. Property rights were well protected throughout this time, yet government was allowed to set rules on the uses of property that judicial conservatives of the pre-New Deal period viewed as suspect.\A new generation of conservatives wants to bring the old order back under the auspices of what's called the Constitution in Exile movement. Their driving idea is that the thrust of jurisprudence since the late 1930s voided the ""real"" Constitution.\As legal scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in The New Republic, this movement favors ""reimposing meaningful limits on federal power that could strike at the core of the regulatory state for the first time since the New Deal."" He wrote that ""justices could change the shape of laws governing the environment, workplace health and safety, anti-discrimination, and civil rights, making it difficult for the federal government to address problems for which the public demands a national response.""\It's not hard to imagine the cases that conservatives would bring against laws passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by a President Barack Obama. Why wouldn't a movement that has tried to eviscerate wetlands laws and the Endangered Species Act challenge cap-and-trade legislation aimed at dealing with global warming?\If Congress ever passed a ""card-check"" law to make it easier for unions to organize, those who never much liked the minimum wage or collective bargaining would certainly try to overturn the new labor right in court.\And what would be the legal fate of new regulations on banking called forth by the economic devastation of the subprime mess, or bank bailouts that may be necessary to keep capitalism on track, or mandatory mortgage renegotiations to keep citizens from being thrown out of their homes?\The four conservatives on the Supreme Court, when empowered by the swing vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy, have already shown their willingness to overturn the will of Congress and local legislatures when doing so fits their political philosophy. The same majority could keep conservative ideas in the saddle long after the electorate has decided that they don't work anymore."
74,"Seems like all of a sudden everyone's talking about coal and mountaintop removal. \West Virginia's favorite son and respected venerable icon Sen. Robert Byrd had this to say in a recent op-ed and speech titled ""Coal Must Embrace the Future"":\""The greatest threats to the future of coal do not come from possible constraints on mountaintop removal mining or other environmental regulations, but rather from rigid mindsets, depleting coal reserves, and the declining demand for coal....""\Many of us heard or saw the much ballyhooed ""debate"" in January between leading environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Don Blankenship, CEO of Massey Energy. Was it a debate? Or was it more a case of these two trading talking points from their entrenched positions? Sorry to say, it would appear quite doubtful that either one changed the other's mind on their fundamental differences. Blankenship: Coal is clean, safe, well regulated and provides paychecks for many West Virginians. Kennedy: Coal is the dirtiest energy source of all; mountaintop removal is an illegal and immoral disaster to people and the environment; clean renewable energy is ready to replace coal.\Rory McIlmoil and Evan Hansen of the environmental consulting firm Downstream Strategies in Morgantown released a new report getting a lot of attention in the state and nation. Titled ""The Decline of Central Appalachian Coal and the Need for Economic Diversification,"" they reach some convincing conclusions:\* ""Coal production in Central Appalachia is on the decline, and this decline will likely continue in the coming decades....""\* ""These declines in production are due to three primary factors: increased competition from other coal-producing regions and sources of energy; the depletion of the most accessible, lowest-cost coal reserves; and environmental regulations.""\* ""While it is still not known whether a federal carbon dioxide cap-and-trade program will be implemented, new climate change laws or regulations are likely to significantly impact the future demand for coal....""\* ""Given the numerous challenges working against any substantial recovery of the region's coal industry, and that production is projected to decline significantly in the coming decades, diversification of Central Appalachian economies is now more critical than ever. State and local leaders should support new economic development across the region....""\In a new study, Michael Hendryx, public health researcher at WVU, explodes the myth that coal is good for the people or communities or economy of West Virginia. He clearly makes the case that the cost in dollars of severe health impacts and premature deaths exceeds any tax, wage and other financial benefits from coal many times over.\Enough said? Perhaps. But I believe nearly all of us agree on certain basic facts:\* Coal is a dirty energy source. It causes significant harm to human and natural communities when it is mined and burned.\* The future of coal is not promising. Demand is falling and expected to continue to do so.\* Coal cannot be relied on to provide the employment and tax base in West Virginia in the future that it has in the past.\* Many West Virginians depend today on jobs in coal mining to support themselves and their families.\To me it's as if I went to the debate and declared both sides the winner. You over there, you're right. And you over there, you're right.\So obviously, we must be asking the wrong questions, and coming up with the wrong answers. Is coal good/bad? Do we ""stay the course,"" pursue ""business as usual,"" put on the blinders, keep on going just as we are today? Let's hope not.\What is so very sorely lacking is the leadership we need. Leadership to acknowledge the problems, and to begin creating workable solutions. Normally we the citizens would expect this leadership to come from those we, wisely or stupidly, choose to fill our public leadership positions - governor, Congress members, etc. And how's that working out for you? Not so well. The governor meets secretly with industry. When he deigns to meet with citizens from the affected communities he claims to ""hear their pain"" one day and badmouths them the next. But he's an avowed Friend of Coal, so no surprises there.\Congressionals? Other than Sen. Byrd's statement, they seem as intent as the governor on fanning the flames, demonizing, and haranguing against change and progress.\Sen. Rockefeller is as good a friend as coal could ask for, and of course all three of our representatives were front and center to join Congress's new Coal Caucus.\The status quo is manifestly untenable. We need better leadership, men and women with the vision and determination to see a bright future for West Virginia. We need that bright future - and we deserve it."
75,"WASHINGTON Appealing for courageous action before its too late, President Barack Obama launched a major second-term drive Tuesday to combat climate change and secure a safer planet, bypassing Congress as he sought to set a cornerstone of his legacy. Abandoning his suit jacket under a sweltering sun at Georgetown University, Obama issued a dire warning about the environment: Temperatures are rising, sea level is climbing, the Arctic ice is melting and the world is doing far too little to stop it. Obama said the price for inaction includes lost lives and homes and hundreds of billions of dollars. As a president, as a father and as an American, Im here to say we need to act, Obama said. I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet thats beyond fixing. At the core of Obamas plan are new controls on new and existing power plants that emit carbon dioxide heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. The program also will boost renewable energy production on federal lands, increase efficiency standards and prepare communities to deal with higher temperatures. Obama called for the U.S. to be a global leader in the search for solutions. But Obamas campaign will face extensive obstacles, including a complicated, lengthy process of implementation and the likelihood that the limits on power plants will be challenged in court. Likewise, the instantaneous political opposition that met his plan made clear the difficulty the president will face in seeking broad support. There will be legal challenges. No question about that, former EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said in an interview. Its a program thats largely executive. He doesnt need Congress. What that does, of course, is make them (opponents) madder. Obama also offered a rare insight into his deliberations on whether to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, deeming it in Americas interests only if it doesnt worsen carbon pollution. Obama has faced intense political pressure from supporters and opponents of the 1,200-mile pipeline from Canada to Texas. Declaring the scientific debate over climate change and its causes obsolete, Obama mocked those who deny that humans are contributing to the warming of the planet. We dont have time for a meeting of the flat-earth society, Obama said. Obamas announcement followed years of inaction by Congress to combat climate change. A first-term effort by Obama to use a market-based approach called cap-and-trade to lower emissions failed, and in February a newly re-elected Obama issued lawmakers an ultimatum in his State of the Union: If Congress wont act soon to protect future generations, I will. Four months later, impatient environmental activists reveled in the news that Obama was finally taking matters into his own hands, announcing a series of steps that dont require congressional approval. This is the change we have been waiting for, said Michael Brune, who runs the Sierra Club, an environmental group. Today, President Obama has shown he is keeping his word to future generations. Republicans on both sides of the Capitol dubbed Obamas plan a continuation of his war on coal and war on jobs. The National Association of Manufacturers claimed Obamas proposals would drive up costs. Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of the coal-heavy state of West Virginia slammed what she called Obamas tyrannical efforts to bankrupt the coal industry. The federal government should leave us the hell alone, said Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, whose agency handles Texas environment and energy markets. Even industry groups that have been friendly to Obama and supportive of his climate goals, such as the Edison Electric Institute, which represents power plants, signaled their apprehension by calling for achievable compliance limits and deadlines. Obama said the same arguments have been used in the past when the U.S. has taken other steps to protect the environment. Thats what they said every time, Obama said. And every time, theyve been wrong. Obama broke his relative silence on Keystone XL, explicitly linking the project to global warming for the first time in a clear overture to environmental activists who want the pipeline nixed. The pipeline would carry carbon-intensive oil from Canadian tar sands to the Texas Gulf Coast refineries and has sparked an intense partisan fight. Our national interest would be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution, Obama said. The White House indicated Obama was referring to overall, net emissions that take into account what would happen under alternative scenarios. A State Department report this year said other methods to transport the oil like rail, trucks and barges could yield even higher emissions. The standard the president set today should lead to speedy approval of the Keystone pipeline, said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Announcing he will allow more renewable energy projects on public lands, Obama set a goal to power the equivalent of 6 million homes by 2020 from sources like wind and solar, effectively doubling the current capacity. The set of actions also includes a new set of fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks, more aggressive efficiency targets for buildings and appliances, and $8 billion in federal loan guarantees to spur innovation. By far the most sweeping element and the one likely to cause the most consternation is new limits on carbon dioxide pollution from power plants. The administration has already proposed rules for new coal-fired plants, but they have been delayed amid industry concerns about the cost. A presidential memorandum Obama issued Tuesday directs the EPA to revise and reissue the new plant rules by September, then finalize them in a timely fashion. The key prize for environmental groups comes in Obamas instruction that the EPA propose rules for the nations existing plants by June 2014, then finalize them by June 2015 and implement them by June 2016 just as the presidential campaign to replace Obama will be in full swing. Rather than issue a specific, uniform standard that plants must meet, the EPA will work with states, power sector leaders and other parties to develop plans that meet the needs of individual states and also achieve the objective of reducing emissions.\THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\Credit: JOSH LEDERMAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"
76,"PRESIDENT Obama's plan to run roughshod over Republican opposition in the Senate thanks to having a super-majority of 60 Democrats has run into a small snag - 60 Democrats.\Not everyone in his own party is behind the president's massive cap-and-trade energy tax proposal. Sen. Robert C. Byrd is particularly unmoved by the House version, which passed by a scant seven votes, 219-212.\All three congressmen from West Virginia voted against the bill, including Republican Shelley Moore Capito.\""I cannot support the House bill in its present form. I continue to believe that clean coal can be a 'green' energy,"" Byrd said in a written statement.\""Those of us who understand coal's great potential in our quest for energy independence must continue to work diligently in shaping a climate bill that will ensure access to affordable energy for West Virginians.""\Democratic resistance to the cap-and-trade tax is a significant obstacle to its passage. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer reset her deadline for clearing the bill from early August to September.\The battle is far from over. Byrd's return to action after six weeks of hospitalization is a welcome development.\Not just coal jobs are at stake, but West Virginia's whole economy.\* n n\IN February, President Obama junked his campaign pledge to work with Republicans in the spirit of post-partisan cooperation, and pushed Democrats to pass a $787 billion stimulus package.\Without the stimulus, the president said, unemployment could reach 9 percent. With the stimulus, unemployment has reached 9.5 percent.\Now talk has begun of a second Obama stimulus. (There was one last year under President Bush.) Just eight of 51 economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal favored such a move.\It is too early to pass judgment on whether the first Obama stimulus worked. But economist Ram Bhagavatula of Combinatorics Capital said much of the stimulus money to taxpayers has gone into savings and paying down debt, and not into retail sales.\""There's no easy solution,"" he said. ""Every time the government gives money to consumers, it goes right into the bank. The consumer needs to rebuild savings, and that's a long, slow process.""\People also need to gain confidence in the eco-nomy. Yet another gigantic federal stimulus - even more deficit spending - would spook people rather than reassuring them.\* n n\WITH unemployment topping 9.5 percent nationally, it should be a buyer's market for employers.\But some employers are ignoring resumes from the unemployed in favor of poaching employees from their competitors, the Wall Street Journal reported.\Ralph Fargnoli, chief executive of a health-care management firm, said he looks first for people who still have jobs.\""If they're still employed, that means they have some significant value,"" Fargnoli said.\Apparently, loyalty means nothing to such poachers of personnel.\Then again, company officials hiring during a recession may know of what they speak."
77,"A bill from Sen. Shelley Moore Capito to invalidate the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to regulate carbon emissions from power plants advanced out of committee on Wednesday, just two days after the final plan was announced. The bill passed the Senate Environment and Public Works committee with exclusively Republican support after Democrats on the committee walked out to protest another bill rolling back environmental regulations.\Capito's bill, the ARENA Act, still faces long odds in the full Senate, where filibusters that require 60 votes to overcome have become usual for any controversial piece of legislation. Even if it does pass Congress, the bill faces a near-certain veto from President Obama.\The more serious challenge to Obama's proposal will come through the courts, where the coal industry and several states, led by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, have promised to sue to stop the EPA regulations.\Obama's Clean Power Plan requires each state to come up with a proposal to cut carbon emissions from their power plants through increased efficiency, use of cleaner-burning natural gas instead of coal, or more use of renewable energy sources. The administration hopes to use the proposal and other climate initiatives to spur other countries to take action to cut emissions and forestall the most severe effects of climate change.\Capito's bill would immediately stop the Clean Power Plan. It would also impose strict requirements that would have to be met before the EPA could implement any future regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.\The bill ""creates huge loopholes, making it nearly impossible to take any meaningful action to address climate change and reduce carbon pollution, said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the committee's ranking minority member.\Capito called the president's proposal a ""clean power grab and argued that it would raise energy prices and cost jobs. Her bill has 34 Republican co-sponsors, and one Democratic co-sponsor, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.\Committee debate was dominated by Democratic amendments, all of which failed by the same 11-9 party line vote.\Democratic senators from coastal states warned again and again of the worst impacts of climate change - ocean acidification, rising sea levels, droughts and severe storms - and how they were already having an effect on their states.\Capito insisted that these are issues that should be discussed by Congress, and not implemented by a regulatory agency.\Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who six years ago was a lead sponsor of an unsuccessful cap-and-trade bill that included nearly $200 billion in incentives for coal technology, was skeptical.\""What's your plan to cut carbon pollution? Markey asked the Republicans on the committee. ""When is it going to be out here? Who's going to make that plan on your side? This plan stays in place until you have a plan that accomplishes the very same goals to protect the public health in our country.\Many Republicans in Congress dispute the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is happening and is caused by humans.\Several northeastern senators attempted to rebut claims that greenhouse gas regulations would dampen the economy. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., talked about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade agreement among nine eastern states, including his own, that went into effect last year.\""The threat that this is going to be an economic harm, that it's going to cause poverty, runs exactly contrary to the experience we've had in the Northeast, Whitehouse said. ""The issue here isn't that it's difficult to do, the issue is that some states haven't even tried.\Reach David Gutman at david.gutman@wvgazette.com, 304-348-5119 or follow @davidlgutman on Twitter.\Credit: David Gutman Staff writer"
78,"A trio of witnesses testifying before a U.S. Senate clean air panel on Tuesday supported Sen. Shelley Moore Capito's attempt to block the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, but proponents of the controversial carbon regulations have once again said compliance is achievable even in coal-producing states like West Virginia. Speaking before a Capito-led Senate subcommittee on Tuesday, Joseph Martens, commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said nine Northeastern states that are part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative have been able to reduce emissions over the past decade without negatively affecting energy jobs or utility prices, something Capito and other Clean Power Plan opponents say is not possible.\""I recognize that each state faces different circumstances, but I think we have a successful model in reducing emissions, Martens said, adding that other states can comply with the Clean Power Plan by taking the initiative's model, a cap-and-trade cooperative, and tailoring it to fit their needs.\In her opening remarks, Capito wasn't optimistic the initiative's model could be copied in West Virginia where, it should be noted, the Legislature in January repealed then-Gov. Joe Manchin's Alternative and Renewable Energy Portfolio Act, colloquially referred to by state Republicans as a cap-and-trade bill.\Capito said West Virginia's energy needs are not comparable to the initiative's nine states, which consume five times more energy than they produce. She later added that West Virginia produces twice as much energy as those states do combined and that coal is critical to maintaining a national energy net positive. Coal-fired power plants produce 40 percent of the country's electricity, and more than 90 percent in West Virginia, but that number would decrease under the Clean Power Plan.\Capito, who introduced a bill last month that would not only block the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan but also make it nearly impossible for similar rules to be written without first meeting congressional requirements, said the regulations will have negative effects nationwide.\""It's going to impact the majority of states, and the families and businesses within them, she said. ""Often, the poorest and most vulnerable populations will bear the brunt of this increase.\Capito and other Clean Power Plan opponents claim regulations will shutter coal production, cause layoffs in the energy sector and lead to increased utility costs across the country. The EPA, however, says the combined climate and health benefits of the regulations will far outweigh the costs of the plan, which are estimated to come in at about $9 billion.\The Clean Power Plan, a 645-page emissions reduction proposal introduced last June, will set up the nation's first-ever limit on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. Under the rule, states will be required to cut emissions by 30 percent before 2030. States also must make meaningful progress within five years.\The plan, part of President Barack Obama's pledge to address climate change, has faced fierce political opposition from coal-producing and dependent states where officials claim its requirements are too severe to comply with.\A recent West Virginia University study, however, found that the state could reasonably meet the EPA guidelines if the Legislature lifted restrictions that hinder the state Department of Environmental Protection from developing a compliance plan and if power companies would use alternative energy sources and find ways for existing plants to use natural gas.\Those suggestions have been panned by industry leaders in West Virginia.\The hearing was the first time Capito's bill, called the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, was taken up by the subcommittee. Capito has said she is confident the bill will make it to the Senate floor after it is passed out of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, a panel she is part of and one chaired by Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., one of Washington's most prominent climate-change opponents.\Clean Power Plan regulations will go into effect later this summer when the plan is expected to be finalized.\Contact writer Samuel Speciale at sam.speciale@dailymailwv.com or 304-348-7939.

79,"Byrd, Rockefeller,\should stop the EPA\U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson announced that the agency has determined, based upon information provided by the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change, that carbon dioxide constitutes a threat to the environment - an endangerment finding - and therefore will be regulated under the Clean Air Act unless Congress enacts cap-and-trade legislation. \The Clean Air Act requires that an endangerment finding be based on sound scientific information that is accurate, clear, and unbiased and the most recent available.\However, the EPA discounted the findings, among others, of the Non-Governmental International Panel on Climate Change, which disputes the findings of the IPCC.\The EPA also ignored Dr. Alan Carlin, a 38-year EPA veteran, who was extremely critical of the endangerment finding. Carlin was advised that his comments did not help the legal or policy case in favor of the endangerment finding.\Furthermore, despite ever-mounting evidence disclosed within the last month that scientists upon whom the IPCC relies for its findings have manipulated or suppressed data to support manmade global warming (Climategate), the EPA is undeterred.\With their endangerment finding, the EPA is essentially blackmailing Congress into passing a cap-and-trade bill that would be devastating to the economy (and should be opposed in any form), but not as devastating as regulations enacted through the Clean Air Act.\Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she will file a resolution to stop EPA's regulation of carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act.\Will Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller embrace this resolution or just let the Obama EPA continue its abuse of power?\Let our senators know they should not only support this resolution, which is critical to our state's economic well-being, but should also use their influence to ensure this resolution is enacted.\John G.

80,"WASHINGTON - One thing that Tim Pawlenty, Jon Huntsman, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney have in common: These GOP presidential contenders all are running away from their past positions on global warming, driven by their party's loud doubters who question the science and disdain government solutions.\All four have stepped back from previous stances on the issue, either apologizing outright or softening what they said earlier. And those who haven't fully recanted are under pressure to do so.\The latest sign of that pressure came Thursday when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he was pulling his state out of a regional agreement to reduce greenhouse gases, saying it won't work. While Christie, a rising GOP star, has said he's not running for president, some in the party continue to recruit him.\It's an indicator of a shift on the issue among conservative Republicans, who have an outsized influence in the party's presidential primary elections. Over the last few years, Gallup polling has shown a decline in the share of Americans saying that global warming's effects have already begun - from a high of 61 percent in 2008 to 49 percent in March. The change is driven almost entirely by conservatives.\In 2008, 50 percent of conservatives said they believed global warming already is having effects; that figure dropped to 30 percent this year. By contrast, among liberals and moderates there's been relatively little movement, and broad majorities say warming is having an impact now.\Not all Republicans are happy with the trajectory the party is on when it comes to global warming. Former New York Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a 27-year veteran of Congress who was known as a staunch protector of the environment, said he has ""never been so disappointed all my life in the pretenders to the throne from my party.""\""Not one of them is being forthright in dealing with climate science,"" he said in an interview. ""They are either trying to finesse it, or change previous positions to accommodate the far right. They are denying something that is as plain as the nose on your face.""\But for some, opposing mandated solutions to climate change has become party orthodoxy.\""Republican presidential hopefuls can believe in man-made global warming as long as they never talk about it, and oppose all the so-called solutions,"" said Marc Morano, a former aide to Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, one of the most vocal climate skeptics in Congress.\Morano now runs a website called Climate Depot where he attacks anyone who buys into the scientific consensus on climate change. Enemy No. 1 for Morano these days is Gingrich, the former House speaker who in 2008 shared a couch with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a TV ad backed by climate change guru Al Gore.\In it Gingrich says, ""We do agree that our country must take action on climate change.""\Since that appearance, Gingrich, who once ran an environmental studies program at a Georgia college, has called for the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency. He's also spoken out against a Democratic bill that passed the House in 2009 that would have limited emissions of greenhouse gases and created a market for pollution permits to be bought and sold.\But that hasn't been enough to satisfy conservative critics. Gingrich went further in a recent interview when he said he doubted there was a connection between climate change and the burning of fossil fuels.\""The planet used to be dramatically warmer when we had dinosaurs and no people,"" Gingrich told The Macon (Ga.) Telegraph last week. ""To the best of my knowledge the dinosaurs weren't driving cars.""\Where Gingrich has waffled, other GOP contenders have conceded on the issue of climate. Romney, Pawlenty and Huntsman potentially come into the race with even more climate baggage, since each of them as governor supported a regional ""cap-and-trade"" program to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, like the one Christie bailed out of last week. All have since abandoned that stance.\It's a marked turnaround for a party that just three years ago gave its presidential nomination to Sen. John McCain, who long has supported cap and trade to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and who campaigned on the issue even though it put him on the same side as his opponent, Barack Obama.\In fact, the whole idea of a market to trade pollution credits came from the Republican Party. It emerged in the late 1980s under the administration of President George H.W. Bush as a free-market solution to the power plant pollution that was causing acid rain. It passed Congress nearly unanimously in 1990 as a way to control emissions of sulfur dioxide.\But now it has become synonymous with partisanship and political risk. Legislation to use the pollution credits approach to curb global warming passed the Democratic-controlled House in 2009, with the support of Obama. It died in the Senate after Republicans labeled it a ""cap-and-tax"" plan that would raise energy prices and after House Democrats who voted for it were attacked at town hall meetings back home.\Many of those Democrats lost their seats in last November's elections and with the House now under Republican control, Obama has said he no longer would pursue it.\The current field of Republican presidential hopefuls is working to shed what McCain's former environmental adviser calls the ""toxic political veneer"" of that policy.\The biggest reversal has come from Pawlenty, who a year after signing a law in Minnesota to cut greenhouse gas emissions was featured in a radio ad for the Environmental Defense Action Fund. Joined by then-Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, now a member of Obama's Cabinet, Pawlenty called on Congress to limit the pollution blamed for global warming. ""If we act now,"" he said in the spot, ""we can create thousands of new jobs in clean energy industries before our overseas competitors beat us to it.""\Two years later, he wrote Congress opposing the Democratic bill, saying it was ""overly bureaucratic, misguided and would be very burdensome on our economy."" In a South Carolina debate earlier this month, he apologized altogether for his climate past, calling it a clunker in his record. ""I don't duck it, bob it, weave it, try to explain it away,"" he said. ""I'm just telling you, I made a mistake.""\Huntsman doesn't go as far. Obama's former ambassador to China, the country that releases more greenhouse gas pollution than any other, tells Time magazine in an interview to be published this week that it's the timing that's off.\As governor of Utah, he appeared in a 2007 ad for an environmental advocacy group in which he said, ""Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse gas pollution."" He also signed an agreement with seven other Western states and four Canadian provinces to reduce greenhouse gases. Since then, other states have pulled their support.\""Much of this discussion happened before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until it comes back, this isn't the moment,"" he says now. When asked whether he believes the climate is changing, he acknowledges the scientific consensus.\""All I know is 90 percent of the scientists say climate change is occurring,"" he says. ""If 90 percent of the oncological community said something was causing cancer, we'd listen to them.""\Romney changed his mind less recently. As Massachusetts governor in 2005, he initially supported a regional pollution-reduction market, saying it would spur jobs and the economy. Weeks later, he refused to sign the pact when the other states would not agree to cap the price for pollution permits.\If anyone has a clean record on climate change in the potential GOP field, it's former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. While Palin set up a sub-Cabinet office to map out the state's response to global warming as governor, and sought federal dollars to help coastal communities threatened by erosion, she has been steadfast in saying human beings are not responsible for climate change and that proposals to limit pollution threaten the economy.\Associated Press deputy polling director Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.\Credit: Dina Cappiello The Associated Press"
81,"WASHINGTON - No matter who wins the 2012 election, the next president will take office as the United States faces vast new opportunities in energy production and profound challenges to environmental protection.\After decades of growing dependence on imported oil, the U.S. is moving to energy self-sufficiency, thanks to greater domestic supplies of oil and natural gas and reduced demand. Coal, which once fired most American power plants, is being edged out by natural gas, renewable energy and stricter efforts to cut pollution - a trend that has touched off bitter political fights.\At the same time, climate change has gone from distant threat to palpable reality, as ice caps shrink, winters shorten and drought spreads. Climatologists and policymakers warn that unless the United States and other industrialized nations move to rein in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by 2020, most aspects of life - from the food chain to the oceans to communicable disease - could be altered, largely for the worse.\With the stakes so high, President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney offer starkly divergent ideas on how to proceed. The split between the candidates on so many energy issues might be traced, in part, to a fundamental disagreement over the reality of climate change. Romney has said he is unsure of it. Obama has called it a ""threat to our children's future.""\Both tout an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy that would utilize everything from coal to wind, but the candidates emphasize different fuels. Romney embraces greater reliance on fossil fuels, including coal - the greatest contributors to climate change. Obama sees a future increasingly tied to renewable energy, like wind and solar.\The Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency has implemented rules to reduce air pollution that will further crimp coal usage. Romney has vowed to repeal those rules.\""The rhetoric of 'all of the above' is the same,"" said Michael A. Levi, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""But the vision is very different.""\Obama's record during the last four years reveals an agenda most analysts expect him to stick to if he gets a second term.\He failed to secure passage of sweeping legislation to address climate change, disappointing many supporters. Nonetheless, he has taken steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants.\The administration also funneled federal funds to renewable energy, helping to bring more alternative sources on line and making the country the leader in clean energy investment. But it has left itself open to political fallout from failures like Solyndra, a solar equipment maker that won $535 million in federal loan guarantees and then went bankrupt.\When Romney was governor of Massachusetts, from 2003 to 2007, he articulated an agenda similar to Obama's current one. Romney's staff included prominent environmentalists who developed a state climate action plan and a regional cap-and-trade system.\In his 2010 book ""No Apology: The Case for American Greatness,"" he wrote: ""I believe that climate change is occurring - the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor.""\But none of that hints at how Romney might govern as president, because he has retreated from those positions. Romney's website makes no mention of the environment or climate change, unlike Obama's. His ideas instead echo congressional Republicans whose narrative during the last four years is that environmental regulations kill jobs.\""Romney is where the Republican Party is,"" said Joshua Freed, head of the clean energy program at Third Way, a centrist Washington think tank.\Romney and Obama vary markedly about the fuels the country should rely on for electricity. Romney has pushed for coal, a cheap and abundant domestic fuel, and he has accused Obama of ""waging a war on coal.""\Obama's campaign rejects that notion, and it has run ads trumpeting the increase in recent years of coal production and jobs in swing states like Ohio. Domestic coal usage is in fact falling, driven mostly by cheaper natural gas prices.\Behind the pro-coal rhetoric, the Obama administration has passed or is considering regulations that would further cut coal use, including reductions in smokestack emissions of carbon dioxide, mercury and other pollutants and limits on mountaintop removal, a controversial mining method.\Romney has pledged to repeal or scale back many of those initiatives, particularly the reductions in carbon dioxide and mercury emissions. ""If Romney's elected, it's not so much what would happen as what wouldn't happen,"" Freed said. ""His plan seeks to cement the status quo at a time when the energy sector is in the midst of huge upheaval.""\The Romney approach would also bolster oil. For instance, Obama highlights significant increases in passenger vehicle fuel economy from 2012 to 2025, almost doubling gas mileage and sharply cutting greenhouse gases. Romney has said he would undo the 2017 to 2025 standards, which he characterizes as onerous and unrealistic. Increased gasoline consumption would help oil companies, but it would undo the progress the country has made toward energy self-sufficiency, analysts say.\Romney would also open more federal lands than Obama has to oil, gas and coal development. ""Under Romney, I have the full expectation that a lot more federal lands will be under production,"" said Jack Gerard, a Romney advisor and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, the main oil lobby.\Obama and Romney overlap in one area: the development of natural gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The domestic energy boom of the last several years stems from the widespread use of fracking to tap oil in North Dakota and gas in Texas, the mid-Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains.\Concerns have been raised about possible water contamination and air pollution from high-volume fracking, which involves injecting millions of gallons of water and sand laced with chemicals deep underground to crack shale formations and unlock oil and gas. So far, the Obama administration has introduced new fracking regulations that independent analysts say would not hinder production. The EPA is also conducting a study of possible environmental effects of fracking, due out after the election, whose findings might lead to new regulations if Obama wins a second term.\But industry has bridled at increased federal oversight of fracking. Romney has said he would hand greater regulatory authority over oil and gas development to the states, which could speed the permitting process but could also lead to lax oversight.\Fossil fuel interests have lined up with Romney. His top energy and economic advisers include the petroleum institute's Gerard; Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm, who is also a major donor; and Jim Talent, a former Missouri senator whose lobbying firm worked for Peabody Coal. Romney would do away with federal subsidies for renewable energy, such as the production tax credit. Obama would do away with long-standing tax breaks for oil and gas companies.\If Obama is re-elected, the question is whether he would take bolder steps to address climate change, such as the introduction of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions.\Conservatives who accept climate science, like former South Carolina Congressman Bob Inglis, think a ""carbon tax"" would be more acceptable to a wider range of people than a complex cap-and-trade system.\Now executive director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative, a Virginia think tank, Inglis sees some signs that Romney might circle back to acceptance of climate change and a willingness to act on it. Some top Romney economic advisers, like Greg Mankiw, have in the past backed a carbon tax. And Romney might have a better chance of getting such a tax passed than Obama: Democrats would probably back any sound climate initiative, while Republicans would probably thwart an Obama effort.\So far, the Romney campaign has given little indication that its approach to global warming might change after Election Day. Said Romney spokesman Ryan Williams, ""Gov. Romney opposes a carbon tax on emissions of carbon dioxide.""\Credit: Neela Banerjee Tribune Washington Bureau"
82,"As Congress continues to debate cap-and-trade, the clock will start ticking Wednesday on a measure aimed at energy and the environment in West Virginia. \Gov. Joe Manchin's proposal to boost alternative and renewable energy sources is among at least 20 legislative measures passed this year that become law July 1.\The plan sets 2025 as the deadline for tapping such sources as solar, wind, biomass and synthetic fuel for at least 25 percent of the electricity sold in the Mountain State.\But with 96 percent of West Virginia's power now derived from coal, the new law includes gasified, liquefied and waste forms of that fossil fuel under the alternative heading. That category also embraces natural gas, which is also found throughout the state but now accounts for less than 1 percent of the power it produces.\The measure shows West Virginians are ""continuing our march toward energy independence, while taking steps to better protect our environment,"" Manchin spokesman Matt Turner said.\The legislation had its critics, mostly minority Republicans in the House who questioned the need and the focus on non-coal sources. Some lawmakers had also sought to include nuclear energy in the mix, without success.\Another new law will change West Virginia's Promise college scholarship. Grappling with the successful program's explosive growth, lawmakers set a funding ""floor"" for the merit-based award at $4,750 annually.\Promise has covered tuition and fees at any of the state's public colleges and universities, or an equivalent amount at its private institutions, for up to four years. Around 9,300 West Virginians now rely on Promise to attend college, and the program's resulting price tag has surged from $10.2 million in 2002 to $42.3 million this year.\The legislation allows for larger future awards if program funding increases, while slightly increasing its share of lottery revenues. Students who land the scholarship by the end of this year are exempt from the new limit.\Several of the July 1 measures emerged from the public schools section of Manchin's 2009 agenda. One offers to help counties with after-school and summer programs aimed at third and eighth graders unable to meet critical skills standards. Another will exempt schools from state policies and rules when they win approval to become ""innovation zones"" designed to boost student achievement.\To lure computer server farms and related high-tech employers, West Virginia will begin offering such businesses breaks on property and consumer sales taxes. Another tax-related change arriving Wednesday offers a personal income tax credit worth up to $2,000 for those who install a solar energy system on their homes.\Credit: THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"
83,"Time is running out for Congress to set long-term plans for the national highway system this fall. In mid-August last year, I wrote about this problem. It seemed that Congress was going to appropriate $20 billion and extend the Highway Trust Fund for another 18 months, but that has not happened. \The proponents of a comprehensive six-year reform package that would include a fuel tax increase were not giving up, but they faced daunting odds. Now, under the leadership of Reps. James Oberstar, D-Minn., and Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., the House Transportation Committee has passed a bill that proposes far-reaching changes in the structure and management of the highway program. The highway reform ""Blueprint"" would spend $450 billion over six years or a 38 percent increase over the current program.\The Obama administration and the primary transportation committee in the Senate oppose this approach. Instead, they want an 18-month extension of the current highway program. The main reason for this tactic is a lack of political will to enact the fuel tax increase that, according to highway funding experts, would be necessary.\""This administration in these hard economic times, can ill afford to tell people we're going to raise the gasoline tax,"" according to the Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood who also stated, ""That's off the table for now.""\Two deadlines are driving this debate. First, the Highway Trust Fund, which pays the lion's share of highway expenditures and which is fed by federal fuel taxes, is going to be broke by mid-September. The second is that the Federal Highway Program itself expires at the end of September.\The Senate is working on a package of bills that would transfer $20 billion from general revenue to the trust fund to cover the shortfall and extend the current program for 18 months at current funding levels with no policy changes. The extension ""will send a message of certainty to all of our states and give us time to develop a transformational transportation bill with a stable, reliable funding source, a bill I have already named MAP-21, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st century,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calf., chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\Oberstar spearheaded the push for long-term reform and funding, stating there is no need to extend the current law. He called for a transfer of sufficient money to plug the gap in the trust fund, and passage of the long-term bill by the end of September. A major difficulty with that approach, in addition to the lack of political will, is that Congress has been focused on the oil spill in the Gulf, health-care reform and climate legislation and is not ready to move quickly on transportation.\Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has said the highway bill is important, but the main issue this summer has been the oil spill in the Gulf. Although Boxer's Environment and Public Works Committee has held hearings on highway issues, its focus has been on producing the Senate's version of a cap-and-trade bill for climate control.\So once again, Congress has left the trust fund dangling and in trouble of running out of needed funds. Now we have to wonder if Congress wants to run on highways that are falling apart and drive over bridges that might fall down around us. The question is where is the stimulus money that was promised to states for their shovel-ready projects?\McRae is owner of M&M Contractors and Specialized Carriers in Elkins."
84,"IF the first duty of a president is to get elected, then Barack Obama deserves an A-plus. While a source of ethnic pride, Obama was elected not because of the color of his skin, but because he offered a positive message of change. That resonated with most Americans. I did not vote for him because of his policies. For once, most West Virginians agreed with me. The turnoffs included his vacillation on gun control, his overly European worldview, his commitment to the redistribution of wealth, and a horrible energy policy. It does not help that his most notable act as a state legislator was to block a bill that would have required doctors to give medical assistance to babies who survive an abortion. Obama was for the D.C. ban on firearms until the Supreme Court ruled, in his election year, that it is unconstitutional. His call for America to defer more to the rest of the world is dangerous. Europe, weakened by socialism, needs an America that will stand up to evil. The biggest failing of President Bush is not his action in Iraq, but rather his failure to see Vladimir Putin for what he is, a menace. West Virginians are skeptical of Obamas promise to give tax cuts to 95 percent of the people. Thats snake oil. Obamas energy policy is particularly disturbing. He does not seem to get it. The press brushed it off as a gaffe when his running mate, Joe Biden, said: No coal plants here in America. Build them, if theyre going to build them, over there [in China]. Make them clean. Were not supporting clean coal. Team Obama rushed in and denied that was the plan. But it was not a gaffe. Biden told the truth. As the general public later learned, Obama told the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle in January: The only thing Ive said with respect to coal, I havent been some coal booster. What I have said is that for us to take coal off the table as (an) ideological matter as opposed to saying if technology allows us to use coal in a clean way, we should pursue it. So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can. Its just that it will bankrupt them. That is a clever but ultimately ridiculous statement. On the one hand, he seems to support clean coal technology, although he doubts its existence. On the other hand, he said his plan to cap and trade carbon credits would bankrupt any electric utility that tries to use it. I own no stock in the company, but it would be pretty bad for Don Surber if American Electric Power went out of business. I like electricity and do not wish to live without it. Such a bankruptcy would also be a bad thing for the town of Ravenswood. Cheap electricity makes its aluminum plant possible. There is an irony in the Democratic Partys call for a Manhattan Project to develop an alternative source of electricity. The original Manhattan Project did just that. But after 30 years, America decided to bankrupt any company that tried to build a new plant that used that new technology nuclear power. That will happen again. Look at bottled water. In the 1980s it became the rage as the glitterati declared bottled water to be better than tap water. It is not, but it went mainstream despite its $10 per gallon price. Ah. It is a good thing we dont run cars on bottled water. But finally it dawned on environmentalists that shipping bottled water from France uses oil. The plastic in the bottles comes from oil. Bottled water has been banned in San Francisco and Seattle. Who is to say that some president 30 years from now will call for bankrupting anyone who puts up a wind turbine or buys a solar panel? America needs cheap electricity. The world needs an America with cheap electricity. Far from helping the environment, a moratorium on new coal plants would ship even more industrial jobs to China, where they will be powered by coal under less stringent conditions. Taking coal plants off the table in the United States will be as harmful to the environment as banning offshore drilling. Instead of getting oil for our economy from environmentally friendly sources that the government regulates, most of our oil comes from nations that for the most part are negligent of their environmental duties. Parts of Nigeria are ruined so the Kennedy family can sail its boats without seeing an oil rig 20 miles away. West Virginians did not vote for Obama for many reasons. I hope we are wrong, but I fear we may have Obama pegged."
85,"Coal titan Don Blankenship didnt make it to Woodstock. He was too establishment natured to attend the muddy, drug-filled music festival of 40 summers ago that was to go down in the history books as the iconic hippie gathering. But the chairman and CEO of Massey Energy Co. is ending this summer with a 100,000-person Labor Day rally for American workers, some of whom may see themselves as part of a new counterculture. Not that Blankenship compares the two. For one, alcohol is not permitted at the Sept. 7 Friends of America rally he has helped organize. Second, people just arent that mad yet. The movement back then seemed to be more intense than what we have today, Blankenship said. I dont think people have it as difficult as they need to have it before they get riled up, but people are starting to get riled up. On Wednesday, organizers stopped giving out free tickets to the rally, citing the capacity of the restored mountaintop removal site in Mingo County where the event will be held. Blankenship said some of the 100,000 people who may attend are just coming to see singers Hank Williams Jr., Ted Nugent and John Rich. Others, though, are coming to make a statement at the rally, which is touted as a way to support the American worker. I think they feel abandoned by their political leaders, and they are confused by the union if they are looking in that direction and they dont understand why so many jobs have moved offshore, why so many of their neighbors have lost their jobs, Blankenship said. They are just wondering who is going to lose their job next. Blankenship blames corporate America and the government for the number of jobs lost in recent months. The government, he said, is overregulating. Companies, he said, are afraid to speak out and dont stand up for their workers like they should. He said the companies fear that if they do speak out, the government will come in and slap them with increased scrutiny. I think businesses are like water, they seek the path of least resistance, Blankenship said. When the U.S. government makes it hard for them to do business here, they just go to some other country and do good business. And not to let anyone off the hook the labor unions, he said, have overpriced their product. The union mistakenly believes that business is the enemy when in fact its their customer, Blankenship said. The Friends of America rally, which is sponsored by Massey, International Coal Group and others, is going head-to-head with the United Mine Workers of America Labor Day Celebration, which is in its 71st year. Its held each year in Racine, Boone County. But Blankenship doesnt expect his rally to actually change much, including the mind of President Barack Obama, who is pushing a plan to cap companies right to emit carbon dioxide and create a system to trade rights to emit the gas. I dont think this gathering will change it, he said. But I dont think it will hurt it, either. Many of the people at the rally also are likely to oppose the presidents plans to reform health care and bail out banks and other ailing companies. Blankenship called all these measures good deeds that are misplaced. On the other side of the fence, Blankenships positions have been labeled far less charitably by environmentalists who decry coal minings impact on valleys and streams and coal burnings impact on the climate. Earlier this week, two protestors descended from trees after nearly six days of trying to halt Massey surface mining in Raleigh County. Blankenship said the young protestors didnt have enough experience to have any idea what theyre doing. I think that kids climb trees and adults produce energy, he said. In late June, former secretary of state Ken Hechler, actress Daryl Hannah and leading climate scientist James Hansen all were arrested outside a Massey-owned prep plant for impeding the flow of traffic. That protest was aimed at the plants coal storage silo, which sits about 240 feet from Marsh Fork Elementary School, and a host of other issues, including surface mining, coal mining in general, the use of coal-fired power and global climate change. Blankenship said Hannah and others dont really understand the trade-offs that new environmental regulations would bring. The bottom line is that I believe that everything in life has a cost and a benefit and improving the environment has a cost and benefit; and mining has a cost and benefit; and you basically have to be constantly weighing the cost and benefit, Blankenship said. He said people would like to live in utopia. Youve got to either have energy or be willing to live in poverty and die young, Blankenship said. Blankenship does not believe in global climate change. That is despite the belief of many scientists that the earth is warming and the change is likely caused by man-made greenhouse gases like those emitted in the burning of the coal mined by Massey and its subsidiaries. Even if he did agree with that assessment, he said, the proposed cap-and-trade legislation isnt the way to protect the environment. If I believed in it and I was an environmentalist, I would realize that trying to deal with CO2 in this country would increase pollution of true toxics throughout the world, he said. Blankenship argues that new U.S. environmental regulations would force companies to locate operations in China, where labor and environmental standards are relatively lax. This, he said, would drive up the price of energy, cost America jobs and increase the amount of pollution going into the atmosphere. His long-term fear is that China or others unfriendly to the United States will use their economic growth to develop a superior military and we will no longer be able to defend our freedom. At the Friends of America rally, Blankenship says he will helicopter in and spend the day hanging out and relaxing, although he said there is quite a bit to be concerned about. The event is twice the size he and other organizers anticipated.\Contact writer Ry Rivard at ry.\Credit: DAILY MAIL CAPITOL REPORTER"

87,"Manchin is the only choice for Senate\Editor:\On Nov. 2, West Virginia voters will choose a candidate to replace Sen. Byrd. We must choose someone who will serve the people of West Virginia, someone who will put West Virginia workers ahead of corporate greed. \Fortunately, we have a perfect candidate for the job! That candidate is Gov. Joe Manchin. He has dedicated his entire life to serving West Virginia.\As governor, he has led our state through difficult times. During this recession most states have found themselves with huge deficits forcing them to lay off workers. At the same time, Gov. Manchin reorganized and restructured state agencies, balanced the budget, and now we enjoy a growing surplus.\As for coal mine health and safety, Joe Manchin has done more for West Virginia miners than any governor. When the Sago Disaster occurred, he didn't just send an aide. He personally went and stayed until all miners were accounted for and their families were notified. Afterward, he didn't wait for federal regulators to take action; he immediately pushed for safety laws that will save the lives of coal miners.\Joe Manchin has led the fight against ""cap and trade,"" against the ban on mountaintop removal, and works relentlessly to convince our country's leaders of the importance of coal for the future.\What's amazing about Joe Manchin's leadership is that he is the first governor in my lifetime who has satisfied both labor and business. He has the endorsement of the Chamber of Commerce, unions and the Coal Association, and the NRA. Wouldn't it be great if we had someone like that in Washington?\West Virginia needs someone who has a proven record and is a proven leader to work for all West Virginians.

Today I am so disappointed I am compelled to write this letter. Most of the people I talk to are as fed up with ""politics as usual"" as I am. Say anything, do anything to get elected. The truth does not matter!\One of the reasons that our governor is so popular is because he has been different. He calls a spade a spade. He tells the truth even if it hurts.\Now, in his campaign to become a U.S. senator, he has thrown his principles out the window it seems. His complete distortion of the ""Fair Tax"" in his TV ad is just exactly the same as the politicians in Washington are already doing every day, and why we want change. ""My opponent wants a 23 percent sales tax on everything, including groceries"" is only half of the story. The rest of the story goes like this. Eliminate the Income Tax, take home 100 percent of your pay. And the government also sends you a rebate check each month for the amount of tax you pay for necessities of life like utilities and groceries.\The fastest way to recovery for the economy is elimination of income taxes for everyone. Rich, poor, individuals and businesses. Give 100 percent of what we earn to us, and we'll spend more.\Trying to scare us is just more ""politics as usual.""\Say it ain't so Joe. You said you were going to be different.\Dave Dayfield\St Albans\Manchin is most qualified candidate\Editor:\Gov. Manchin has done an exemplary job of securing the people of West Virginia for six years. That is why I have no doubt he will do the same in the U.S. Senate.

We don't need their ""help.""\I will vote for Joe Manchin because he is experienced in government, has proven he is qualified and will get the job done for West Virginia in the U.S. Senate.\Mary Sue Woodson\Nitro\On Election Day, beware of extremists\Editor:\Many of the positions of some so-called ""tea party"" candidates are genuinely troubling.\The problem is that without an organized party core and platform, many of these ""tea party"" candidates feel no need to actually explain or defend their positions to their potential supporters.\No, I'm not judging the majority of ""tea party"" supporters who say they identify with the movement; nor do I equate them with the most vocal minority in that movement. After all, liberals have their share of nuts, too. The difference is that liberal nutjobs are still ""forced"" to operate within the Democratic Party, where their radical views will be brought to light and Democratic voters will know not to vote for them. These ""tea party"" candidates seem to be running solely on an Anti-Obama platform.\I'm scared to death that the prevalent dissatisfaction with the Obama administration is going to lead to a number of people with truly un-American ideas being elected to positions of power.\When I say un-American ideas, I'm not talking about things like taxes, health care, or Social Security. Those are issues that have been legitimately debated by conservatives and liberals for decades.\I'm talking about things like repealing the 17th Amendment, which gives voters the right to elect their own members of Congress. Joe Miller actually has the cajones to look Alaskan voters in the eye and ask them to elect him to the Senate so that he can take away their right to remove or replace him later.\I'm talking about Rand Paul wanting to repeal the 14th amendment, so that business owners can openly discriminate against, and deny service to, American citizens based upon race, gender, religion, or any other criteria that tickles their fancy.\I'm talking about Sharron Angle and Glen Urquhart, who publicly try to put a positive spin on rape to defend their ultra-hardline stance on abortion. Next to these folks, Sarah Palin looks like a moderate.\I strongly support all Americans' right to express dissatisfaction and dissent, but we must use great care not to allow those feelings to be used against us by opportunistic extremists.\Timothy Legg\Hurricane\John Raese has zero experience\Editor:\I am very worried that our state's representation in the U.S. Senate is going to be somebody like John Raese, a person with ZERO experience in public service.\Our nation is in the midst of one of the worst recessions since the Great Depression. Our national debt has grown to a point that is unsustainable. Our troops are still in battle, and many things still need to get done here in West Virginia. People must wake up. John Raese has ZERO experience with resolving the type of problems our nation still faces. Joe Manchin has the experience that our nation needs to assist our nation's leaders to dig out of the mess left by the previous administration. Joe Manchin's administration has laid the groundwork for a better West Virginia and will continue to build on this foundation in the U.S. Senate.\John Raese is not for the people of West Virginia as a business owner. How can he be for the people of West Virginia as U.S. Senator? Joe Manchin is the way to go and we must vote for him on today.\Kim Jobe\Charleston\Jesse Johnson is a problem solver\Editor:\Sept. 11 is in the past. True, many may wonder about the investigation for some time to come, but it is over. And I think that Jesse Johnson answered the question very well and honestly.\We all want a better West Virginia, with a healthy environment and a prosperous job environment. And yet you did not move into the present and ask Jesse questions that we are really concerned with. The media seems to have stooped to the same mudslinging tactics that Manchin and Raese have. Jesse is looking at the issues (and, boy, do we have them) and the positive answers for now, and down the road. Why not ask him those? And yet you choose to bring up 9/11? Was this to paint him in an unfavorable light? It is the only conclusion to this that I can come to.\I just went to a meet-the-candidates night and people are very tired of big government. They are tired of the widespread destruction of the mountaintop removal (and one lady is from a coal family). We are, and Jesse is, for deep mining. We are against mountaintop removal and the damaging, toxic water getting in our streams and causing pollution. Here we are looking at pollution that is causing global warming (part natural, part our fault). So we need to get behind the water polluting problems and move in a positive direction for solutions.\Jesse is a good man who is a problem solver. He is for West Virginia.\So, let's see some positive thoughts and ideas that Jesse has been working on. We need facts and options, not media opinions.\Nancy B. Lovell\Charleston\Maynard insults our intelligence\Editor:\Elliot ""Spike"" Maynard released an ad that illustrates the height at which character assassination has risen in this election cycle. In the commercial, a narrator states ""But who supports Rahall? One Rahall campaign contributor was Abdurahman Alamoudi, who is now in jail for financing terrorism. Money from a convicted terrorist? Does anyone know the real Rahall?""\These charges stem from a man named Abdurahman Alamoudi, who is now in jail for illegal dealings with Libya and other charges. Mr. Alamoudi made numerous political donations to people such as George W. Bush and groups that have endorsed Maynard, like the National Republican Congressional Committee. Mr. Rahall was the recipient of a donation by Alamoudi, but upon learning of the charges, donated the funds to the Memorial Baptist Church in Beckley.\After watching this ad, it's blatantly obvious that Maynard is still trying desperately to instill fear, paranoia, and racial/religious elements into the race. Congressman Rahall was born in West Virginia and (not that it matters) is a Presbyterian Christian. As a voter, it is disheartening that a candidate would resort to character assassination in its lowest possible form to influence voters. By avoiding the real issues that matter to the 3rd Congressional district, Maynard is insulting the intelligence of the very people who could possibly elect him.\David Ward\Cross Lanes"
88,"The Associated Press\CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - President Obama said Friday that opponents of his energy bill are disputing the evidence of global warming in a cynical ploy to undermine efforts to curb pollution and steer the nation to greener energy sources.\Obama said some opponents ""make cynical claims that contradict the overwhelming scientific evidence when it comes to climate change - claims whose only purpose is to defeat or delay the change that we know is necessary.""\He also appeared to be taking on chief critics like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers, though not by name.\""There are those who will suggest that moving toward clean energy will destroy our economy, when it's the system we currently have that endangers our prosperity and prevents us from creating millions of new jobs,"" Obama told his audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.'\Using familiar refrains from his campaign and his administration as Congress mulls its next move on the climate bill, the speech was designed as a nudge for lawmakers to act on a top priority of the president's.\Next week, the Senate environment committee will take up its version of a global warming bill. The legislation would cut greenhouse gases by about 80 percent by 2050 - as the president called for in his campaign - and require more domestic energy to come from renewable sources such as wind, solar and hydropower. The House passed a similar bill in June.\The two business groups to which Obama alluded oppose reducing emissions by allowing companies to buy and sell permits to pollute, a system known as cap and trade.\With work still to be done on health care and deep divisions in Congress over the best approach to climate change, the chances the Senate will pass a climate bill by the end of the year are slim. That means U.S. negotiators are likely to not have firm targets set before 192 nations gather in Copenhagen, Denmark, to hammer out a new treaty to slow global warming.\""This should not be a partisan issue,"" Obama said, urging bipartisan answers on a day largely devoted to raising campaign money for fellow Democrats.\""The closer we get, the harder the opposition will fight."""
89,"Here are two seemingly disparate points it seems we can all agree on:\1. Mountaintop-removal coal miners just want to make a decent living for themselves and their families. This is what we call the American Dream, and it's what most West Virginians want. \2. Coal has a limited and declining future as a fuel. The costs to the planet are too high, and America is not willing to pay those costs forever - to our health, planetary climate and a livable world for our coming generations. Coal's decline might be hastened by cap-and-trade or EPA regulation.\To quote Bob Dylan, ""You don't have to be a weatherman to tell which way the wind blows."" We can all read the handwriting on the wall - the coal era, like all those based on extraction of a limited nonrenewable resource, will be winding down, probably sooner rather than later.\This is what must keep conscientious mountaintop-removal miners awake at night, when they can't stop thoughts of the end of their ""way of life"" from chasing around and around in their minds. Are they afraid? I can only guess that the answer is yes - afraid that there is no future for them in the post-coal economy.\Who in our leadership positions - in Charleston and Washington, in government and industry - is taking the challenge of the future of mountaintop removal coal miners seriously and urgently?

91," Power plants in West Virginia emitted 3,948 pounds of mercury in 2003, the seventh-highest amount in the nation, a nonprofit advocacy group said Thursday. Putnam County, home to American Electric Powers John Amos plant, was ranked 21st among the nations counties with 902 pounds of mercury emitted, the Public Interest Research Group said in a report called Made in the USA: Power Plants and Mercury Pollution Across the Country. The Washington, D.C.-based group ranked the John Amos plant 15th in the nation for mercury emissions. Putnam County also had the highest power plant mercury emissions in West Virginia, followed by Mason County with 610 pounds and Monongalia County with 607 pounds. Mason County was ranked 41st among the nations counties and Monongalia County was ranked 42nd. The rankings were based on 2003 data from the Environmental Protection Agencys Toxics Release Inventory, which included emissions reported by power plants in 47 states and the District of Columbia. That study, released in May, showed that total toxic emissions into West Virginias air and water increased by almost 11 percent in 2003. Mercury settles in waterways and accumulates in fish. In humans who eat those fish, the metal can cause neurological and developmental problems, particularly in fetuses and children. The most protected environment for a child should be the womb, said Pamela S. Neal, president of the West Virginia Nurses Association. Mercury is putting the health of our unborn children at risk. Texas had the highest mercury emissions from power plants with 9,099 pounds. Idaho, Rhode Island and Vermont had no or virtually no emissions, the PIRG report said. In March, the Bush administration ordered power plants to cut mercury pollution from smokestacks by nearly half within 15 years but left an out for the worst polluters. The EPA set a nationwide cap on allowable pollution and then allocated a specific amount to each state and, in a few cases, Indian tribes that own power plants. The states then set limits on specific plants. Those that exceed the limit could buy pollution credits from plants emitting less pollution than theyre allowed. The cap-and-trade approach begins in 2010. EPA officials maintain that the agencys approach will reduce mercury pollution from power plants in half by 2020, from 48 tons a year now to 24.3 tons, and eventually by 70 percent. The Sierra Club, Environmental Defense and National Wildlife Federation, plus 14 states, have asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to rewrite the regulations to require that all plants install within the next three years the best available technology for cutting mercury pollution."
92,"WASHINGTON - Exelon, the nation's biggest operator of nuclear power plants, said Monday that it's quitting the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because of the business group's lobbying against climate and energy legislation.\Last week two other large energy companies, Pacific Gas and Electric and PNM Resources, also quit the Chamber over objections to its stance on climate change.\The Chamber lobbied vigorously against the climate bill that narrowly passed the House in June. The measure would set an annually declining cap on emissions and set up a system of tradable emissions allowances, and also included incentives for renewable energy and efficiency. Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., plan to unveil their draft of a Senate version Wednesday.\Exelon Chairman and Chief Executive John Rowe called for support for the legislation and announced the company's decision to leave the Chamber during a speech at a conference of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\The nuclear industry could benefit from legislation that raises fossil fuel costs, and the industry's interests are expected to be a key topic in the Senate debate. Roughly 50 percent of U.S. electric power is generated from burning coal, more than any other source.\""The carbon-based free lunch is over. But while we can't fix our climate problems for free, the price signal sent through a cap-and-trade system will drive low-carbon investments in the most inexpensive and efficient way possible,"" Rowe said.\The company said in a statement that its commitment to climate legislation was the reason it wasn't renewing its membership in the Chamber of Commerce.\The Chamber, the nation's largest business lobby, contends that the climate legislation would curtail energy from coal and other fossil fuels, creating energy scarcity that would increase prices. It has also argued that the legislation wouldn't result in a cut in greenhouse gases globally because the reduction would be outweighed by the growth of emissions from developing countries.\The proposed legislation would direct funds from the sale of allowances back to fossil fuel companies during a transition period, a plan aimed at preventing price spikes and shortages. It also provides incentives for the development of renewable energy.\""The bottom line is that there's rarely unanimous agreement among our membership on any given issue,"" said Chamber spokesman Eric Wohlschlegel, noting that the Chamber of Commerce represents more than 3 million companies.\Wohlschlegel also described the House climate bill as ""fundamentally flawed"" and said the Chamber was ""focused on trying to find sensible solutions to the challenges of climate change.""\William Kovacs, the Chamber's senior vice president for the environment, technology and regulatory affairs, said in August that that science of climate change should be put on trial, just as the 1925 Scopes trial helped decide whether evolution could be taught in schools.\John Scopes, a teacher in Dayton, Tenn., was convicted of violating a state law that banned the teaching of evolution.\Credit: McClatchy Newspapers"

94,"SYDNEY - Australia's government repealed a much-maligned carbon tax on the nation's worst greenhouse gas polluters on Thursday, ending years of contention over a measure that became political poison for the lawmakers who imposed it. The Senate voted 39 to 32 to axe the 24.15 Australian dollar ($22.60) tax per metric ton of carbon dioxide that was introduced by the center-left Labor government in July 2012. Conservative lawmakers burst into applause as the final tally was announced.\Prime Minister Tony Abbott's conservative coalition government rose to power last year on the promise of getting rid of the tax, assuring voters that removing it would reduce household electricity bills. He plans to replace the measure with a taxpayer-financed AU$2.55 billion fund to pay industry incentives to use cleaner energy.\""Today, the tax that you voted to get rid of is finally gone: a useless, destructive tax which damaged jobs, which hurt families' cost of living and which didn't actually help the environment, Abbott told reporters in Canberra.\Australia is one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters per capita, largely because of its heavy reliance on the nation's vast reserves of cheap coal for electricity.\Opposition leader Bill Shorten lashed out at Abbott after the vote, dubbing him an ""environmental vandal.\""Today, Tony Abbott has made Australia the first country in the world to reverse action on climate change, Shorten told reporters. ""History will judge Tony Abbott very harshly for refusing to believe in genuine action on climate change. Tony Abbott is sleepwalking Australia to an environmental and economic disaster.\The carbon tax, charged to about 350 of Australia's biggest carbon polluters, was controversial from the start. Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard had initially vowed not to introduce a tax on carbon emissions. But after her Labor party was elected in 2010, she needed the support of the minor Greens party to form a government - and the Greens wanted a carbon tax. Gillard agreed, infuriating a public that viewed the measure's imposition as a broken promise.\Labor's popularity plummeted, particularly when consumers saw their power bills soar. In reality, the tax accounted for a relatively small portion of that increase, but many blamed it for the hike nonetheless.\Desperate to improve its standing with the public, Labor replaced Gillard with previous Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who promised to get rid of the tax and transition it earlier than planned to a cap-and-trade scheme, which would have significantly lowered the per-ton carbon price.\But it proved too little, too late. Abbott's party swept to power in last year's elections by vowing to get rid of the tax for good.\The prime minister said families will be AU$550 a year better off now that the tax is gone.\Big businesses and industry groups across Australia rallied behind the tax's abolition, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which dubbed the levy a dead weight on the economy.\""It really did impact on the competitiveness of many Australian businesses and of course it put up the price of power, the group's CEO Kate Carnell said. ""So it's a good step forward for competitiveness and also for employment in Australia.\In a fiery speech ahead of Thursday's vote, Sen. Christine Milne, leader of the Greens, called it an ""appalling day for Australia.\""A vote for the abolition of the clean energy package is a vote for failure, she said. ""If this parliament votes to abandon the clean energy package, you are voting against the best interests of the nation.\Environmental groups called the tax's repeal an international embarrassment.\""It's a very sad day because it was working, this carbon price, said Australian Conservation Foundation CEO Kelly O'Shanassy. ""Our government has failed Australians and they need to go and look their kids and their grandkids in the eye and tell them why - why - they are unwinding laws that will protect people in this country from climate change.\Credit: Kristen Gelineau The Associated Press"

96,"Regulators must figure out if a common method of surface coal mining is damaging Appalachian watersheds, but may be unable to do so, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official said during congressional testimony Thursday. \The remarks by Randy Pomponio, regional EPA official in Philadelphia, came during a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works subcommittee hearing on the effect of mountaintop mining on Appalachian water quality. A Senate bill sponsored by subcommittee chair Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., would outlaw the practice, which involves blasting away mountaintops to expose multiple coal seams that typically could not be mined by other methods.\""We need to look at the cumulative impact,"" Pomponio said. ""I don't think we've done a good job of doing that.""\EPA, however, does not know whether watersheds would be resilient enough and have the capacity to withstand adding individual mines, he said.\The mountaintop mining debate centers on economics and the practice of filling valleys with material removed during mining. Mountaintop mines in the states where the practice is most used - West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee - produce nearly 130 million tons of coal each year, or about 14 percent of the coal that produces electricity in the U.S., and employ about 14,000 people.\University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences director Margaret Palmer testified that valley fills cause permanent damage to streams, which is felt throughout watersheds and far downstream, and can't be repaired.\""The impacts persist a very long time, even after mining has stopped,"" Palmer said. ""You really can't reverse that.""\West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Randy Huffman, however, testified that more recent practices such as shrinking the size of valley fills and replanting timber rather than nonnative plants should be studied to determine whether they are preventing damage.\""The nature of it is for science to continue to be the driver,"" Huffman said.\Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition organizer Maria Gunnoe, however, asked that mountaintop mining be banned.\""When you have a valley fill, what you have is not only polluted water,"" said Gunnoe, who lives near a southern West Virginia surface mine in Boone County.

97,"During his second stint in Congress, Bob Inglis said Tuesday, his concerns about climate change grew. \The South Carolina Republican visited Antarctica twice, as part of congressional delegations. Those trips, he said, played a central role in convincing him about the validity of scientific research that global warming poses increasingly major risks to humanity and all forms of life around the world.\Inglis served three U.S. House terms between 1993 and 1999, then lost a bid for the Senate. He served another three House terms starting in 2003, and served as the ranking Republican on the House Science and Technology Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Environment. But he lost his 2010 bid for re-election.\""I got tossed out of Congress because of my position on climate change,"" Inglis said during a visit to The Charleston Gazette newsroom on Tuesday. On Monday, he spoke at a West Virginia Boys State meeting at Jackson's Mill, near Weston.\During his unsuccessful 2010 re-election campaign, Inglis said, ""people asked me what I was doing by working with the enemy.""\Inglis is the director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative, founded last July at George Mason University. The institute aims to explore and promote conservative solutions to America's climate change and energy challenges.\Today, he travels around the country speaking about threats from climate change and how to reduce carbon emissions.\""Today, I don't do political work, since the Energy and Enterprise Initiative is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization. But I support free-enterprise solutions on energy and the climate,"" Inglis said. ""I spend most of my time visiting campuses where I talk to Republicans, energy clubs, business schools, federalist societies and on talk radio stations.""\Inglis believes carbon emissions will drop in part because ""renewable fuels are not used up, while fossil fuels are getting to be used up.""\""We have to find a way to produce power cleanly,"" he said. ""It is hard to figure it out.\""States like West Virginia are also moving into natural gas. But a lot of jobs at those companies are not filled by local workers,"" Inglis said.\Inglis also spoke about massive shifts in job opportunities, not only in energy industries, but in other economic sectors as well.\""South Carolina was a major producer of textiles and tobacco. But we went under the bus. We were lucky that BMW came in and created 6,000 direct jobs and 19,000 suppliers' jobs.""\The textile and clothing industries in North Carolina and other states, particularly in the South, have been devastated by cheap imports from countries like China.\Inglis believes free-market economics should be applied to cutting carbon emissions.\""I voted against cap-and-trade legislation. It is hopelessly complicated,"" Inglis said.\""You need to be accountable for all of your costs,"" Inglis said, referring to future costs, including environmental damage.\""We need to put an 'upstream tax' at the mines and at the pipelines to pay for the social costs of [producing and transporting] fuel. We can increase costs of production and cut some taxes.""\Inglis opposed drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and also voted against troop surges in the Iraq war.\But he said he remains a conservative.\He points to his recent voting records in Congress that won him ratings of 93 percent from the American Conservative Union, 100 percent from both the Christian Coalition and National Right to Life, and an ""A"" from the National Rifle Association.

It equals redistribution of wealth, which is getting money from the haves and giving it to the have-nots of the world.

99,"WASHINGTON - Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. \Well spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of Obamacare, financial reform and a near trillion-dollar stimulus that will significantly transform the country.\But spent nonetheless. There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural.\That's why, as I suggested last week, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next two and a half years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress next January.\Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda.\That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses.\It is still possible for the gaffe-happy Republicans to blow it.\When the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee publicly apologizes to the corporation that unleashed the worst oil spill in American history, you know the Republicans are capable of just about anything.\But assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-on reforms are dead.\Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring).\They could then vote for anything - including measures they today shun as the midterms approach and their seats are threatened - because they would have nothing to lose. They would be unemployed.\And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.\As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are already looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session.\Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes, and climate-change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.\Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden.\Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission, which conveniently reports by Dec. 1.\And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress - but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.\It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply.\To pass in a lame-duck session major legislation so unpopular that Democrats had no chance of passing it in regular session - after major Democratic losses signifying a withdrawal of the mandate implicitly granted in 2008 - would be an egregious violation of elementary democratic norms.\Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through a health-care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber - something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.\How then to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress?\Bring the issue up now - applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day.\Every current member should be publicly asked:\In the event you lose in November-a remote and deeply deplorable eventuality, but still not inconceivable - do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?\The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow.\Call me naive, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.\Krauthammer may be reached by e-mail at letters@ charleskrauthammer.com."

101,"SAN FRANCISCO - A California bill that would have required manufacturers to figure out how to keep the most common plastic junk out of state waterways died in the state Assembly without a vote Friday. Assembly Bill 521 was before the chamber's Appropriations Committee, and the panel failed to act on it, effectively killing the legislation for the session. \Once in the ocean, plastic takes ages to decompose. The manmade junk either collects into floating trash islands called ""garbage patches,"" or it breaks into smaller pieces that harm and kill sea creatures throughout the food chain. AB521 would have required manufacturers to figure out how to reduce 95 percent of plastic pollution along the state's coastline by 2024.\- The Associated Press\It carried financial penalties for companies that did not comply: up to $10,000 per day for the worst violations.\Assemblyman Eric Linder, R-Corona, said during Friday's Appropriations Committee meeting that he opposed the measure in part because it singled out one industry as the source of ocean pollution.\""I agree that cleaning up our oceans should be something that's very, very important to us, but this bill places the burden of compliance directly on the producers instead of the violators, the people who are littering,"" Linder said.\The regulation was just the latest California legislative attempt to address some of the world's toughest environmental problems, often at the expense of private business, critics say.\The state's large economy and population has already influenced automakers to produce cleaner burning cars, forced warning labels for toxic chemicals on a range of consumer products and put a price on heat-trapping carbon emissions from industrial sources.\""With nearly 40 million people in the state, what happens here matters whether it is cap-and-trade and renewable energy portfolio standards, solid waste reduction, water conservation,"" said Mark Gold, associate director of the University of California, Los Angeles Institute of the Environment and Sustainability.\""What happens in California matters both nationally and globally,"" he added.\Gold said legislation won't solve the plastic pollution problem, but could have a wide-ranging effect. The failed proposal could have been the first significant legislation in the U.S. to try to reduce the amount of plastic junk in the ocean that makes up trash formations such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, known as the world's largest landfill.\The plastic industry, California Chamber of Commerce and other business interests opposed the bill, saying they already fund recycling and other programs to reduce marine plastic pollution. Plus, they say, the bill asks manufacturers to develop new products or other ways to reduce trash, but it doesn't say how.\Extended producer responsibility laws have already taken root in more than two dozen European countries.\In France, nearly 90 percent of consumer products are part of the ""Green Dot"" program, requiring manufacturers to pay into a program that recovers and recycles packaging materials. It has successfully influenced manufacturers there to cut down on packaging or use alternative materials.\Stone's office said the assemblyman is unsure if he will reintroduce the bill next year. He is ""weighing his options for how to continue to work to address this problem in the future,"" Smith said.\---\Laura Olson contributed to this story from Sacramento.\---\Follow Jason Dearen on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/JHDearen\AP-WF-05-24-13 2247GMT"
102,"IT was a five-paragraph news brief that happened to make the paper last month:\""ST. LOUIS - Peabody Energy says its profits plunged 71 percent, with both Europe and the United States using much less coal-fired power in the recession."" \Then, matter-of-factly: ""The company is now moving aggressively into Australian mining to satisfy one customer that is still buying a lot of coal: China.""\Blah, blah, blah, and then ""The company has created a trading hub in Singapore during the quarter to get closer to clients in India and China.""\Which led to a Google search:\In October, the company announced that it had opened an office in Jakarta, Indonesia ""to serve India, China and other key Asian markets. The Pacific markets are driving global demand for coal and are expected to achieve 5 to 10 percent compound annual growth over the next five or more years.""\Also in October, the company announced plans to double exports from Queensland and New South Wales in Australia in the next five years ""to tap growing demand from Chinese and Indian steel mills and power stations.""\Peabody describes itself as the world's largest private-sector coal company with 2008 sales of 256 million tons. Its coal fuels 10 percent of U.S. electricity and 2 percent of worldwide electricity.\""Coal,"" the company said in a position paper, ""has been the fastest-growing fuel in the world for each of the last six years. The strongest economic growth engines of the world are in emerging Asia, and those engines are coal-fueled.""\Ouch, ouch and ouch. Where to begin?\The United States was buffaloed by former Vice President Al Gore into unquestioning acceptance of the proposition that man is causing ""global warming"" - lately renamed ""climate change"" because of an inconvenient cooling trend.\Now a green administration full of Chicago politicians, would also take charge of energy policy as well.\As policymakers in the United States dither over whether it would be better to accept enormously complicated federal cap-and-trade schemes because they would probably be less cuckoo than whatever the Environmental Protection Agency came up with, the world continues to make its own arrangements.\The lessons are clear:\* Other people are going to mine coal, use it, and make money by doing so.\The United States is going to demonize coal, discourage the use of it, and not make money.\* Asia has humming economic engines.\The United States is economically dead in the water.\* A coal-fueled Asia expects growth, and by inference, a higher standard of living.\The United States is now demonizing its least expensive, most abundant energy resource and assuring Americans of higher energy costs and slower economic growth.\Again, Peabody, on the Waxman-Markey bill passed by the House and awaiting action in the U.S. Senate:\""There is no question but that the House bill would inhibit economic growth; the only question is to what extent.\""The wealth transfer to other nations for offsets alone is estimated at billions of dollars in the first year. The bill could also outsource environmental protection by transferring industry to nations that don't regulate many emissions.\""The bill could also provide another exotic financial instrument for Wall Street traders to make billions at the expense of the American public. The bill could further raise consumer prices by taxing low-cost imports that are essential to so many Americans.""\And if other nations don't shoot themselves in their feet, the United States will have harmed Americans unnecessarily and failed to affect the global environment whatsoever.\Against this backdrop came a recent day's news from the Wall Street Journal:\""TOKYO - President Barack Obama has come halfway around the world to personally deliver the message to East Asia that the global economy can no longer count on the U.S. consumer to keep it afloat.""\You got that right.\Also from the Journal:\""The U.S. paid $19.51 billion for crude oil imports in September, up from $17.38 billion the month before ... The total U.S. bill for all types of energy-related imports rose to nearly $24.87 billion from $22.39 billion in August.""\New presidents deserve a little breathing room. It's an immensely complicated job.\But what we're watching, one pronouncement after another on one issue after another, seems increasingly a cover for unpreparedness and confusion.\The administration that seems so sure of itself doesn't know what it's doing - certainly on energy, but also on industrial policy or health care."
103,"My magic wand is on the fritz, otherwise we'd have a big, new federal program to free America from its dependence on oil. Like other environmentalists, I'm sad that the calamity in the Gulf of Mexico hasn't spurred Washington to more vigorously promote America's exit from this curse. \The fault might lie with President Obama's timidity, a public scared by major new government programs or fossil-fuel interests flashing their campaign dough. Probably it's all three, but the bottom line is this: An all-out effort to unchain America from hydrocarbons is essential to national security, a healthy environment and economic prosperity in the 21st century - but it's not politically possible.\So we must look at what's passable. Fortunately, there's one piece to the escape strategy that business leaders, military brass and the buying public all like - and would create jobs. Most importantly, it has bipartisan support in Congress.\We speak of electric cars, specifically the ""Electric Vehicle Deployment Act of 2010."" Sponsored by Sens. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the bill's goal is to electrify half of America's cars and trucks within 20 years. That, its backers say, would cut America's dependence on petroleum by a third. Similar legislation is before the House.\The Senate bill would name at least five communities to be models for electric-vehicle transportation. They would build stations where motorists could recharge their cars' batteries. Residents would be offered a $10,000 tax credit to buy electric cars - and the federal government would put $1.5 billion into research for improving electric-car technology.\Electric cars don't appear to be a very hard sell to those who would buy them. The first all-electric model, the Nissan Leaf, will hit the U.S. market at the end of the year. (The batteries will be made in Smyrna, Tenn.) You won't be able to just pick one up, though, because the year's production is already sold out. More than two-thirds of the 19,000 pre-orders are from the United States.\The Chevy Volt will reach showrooms around that time. Its battery range of 40 miles is considerably smaller than the Nissan Leaf's 100 miles, but the Volt has a small gasoline engine to keep the car going if a recharging station is not handy.\In any case, more than 75 percent of Americans commute 40 miles or less a day. That means most of them could plug in their Volts at the end of the day and drive off fully charged in the morning.\Being an environmentalist and a fan of high automotive performance can be awkward, but carmakers are learning to put zoom into their fuel-efficient models. The Ford Fusion Hybrid, for example, gets 41 miles-a-gallon in the city, but can pull away from a stoplight at a respectable pace. ""Sustainable mobility solutions"" need not be as boring as they sound.\What about the source of the electric power? Although an all-electric vehicle puts out zero emissions, that is probably not true of the plant that provides the electricity. While California has moved its mix of electricity sources toward clean, renewable energy, other parts of America are still highly dependent on dirty, coal-powered plants.\However, electric cars cut global warming pollution even where coal supplies the power, according to a study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. That's because cars plugged in overnight employ unused capacity in the current electric system.\So let the brawl over cap-and-trade proceed. Outside of the oil business, most everyone seems enthusiastic about accelerating a move toward electric cars. Nothing should stop Congress from revving up the process. Right?\Harrop is a columnist for the Providence Journal."
104,"Nixon's character flaw was downfall\Editor:\As the 35th anniversary of Richard Nixon's resignation approaches, I am reminded of the David Frost Nixon movie shown briefly in this area last winter. One of its characters said Nixon had an anti-democratic personality. There is justice in that. Dwight Eisenhower may have had no more sympathy for ""the revolution of rising expectations"" than Nixon did, but who can imagine ""Ike"" ever tolerating or countenancing what Nixon did? Indeed, in a tape released just before his resignation, Nixon showed his contempt for his former boss by saying that Eisenhower wanted to be sure that his associates were clean, but that he, Nixon, did not see things that way. Instead, Nixon and his people would protect those around them if they could. \The late Richard L. Strout, of the New Republic, asked, ""How does an undesirable like Nixon get to be president in the first place?""\In 1968, Nixon had opposition to his right as well as his left when he ran for President. And give Nixon his due here; he gave people a sense of themselves other than hate. One could back Nixon without feeling a sense of shame, guilt, embarrassment or revulsion. One could not do that with George Wallace, a far more genuine rightist than Nixon ever was, but whose shameful, disgraceful exploitation of racism, bigotry, and prejudice was too much for decent Americans with any moral sense whatsoever to swallow.\Finally, Nixon, in his characteristic self-pitying manner, once complained that, ""if I had bugged out of Vietnam and had been a liberal by their standards, Watergate would have been a blip."" There has to be at least some truth to that belief. We have to doubt that Watergate would have occurred without the Vietnam War, or alternatively, if South Vietnam had been a true nation with a stable government. Though I think of Nixon as an opportunist, he evidently saw himself as a devout patriot only doing what he thought was best for the country and as seeking solutions as he saw them. He had such an absolute faith in his own judgment and so little faith in anyone else's that he was bound to get into trouble sooner or later.\William R. Brown\South Charleston\War on coal attacks Appalachia\Editor:\I am writing to express my fear, anger and disgust regarding cap and trade and its effects on our state.\It seems in the name of political self-righteousness folks like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others among the cultural elite have declared war on West Virginia's most vital industry. Claims that carbon emissions spewed by the coal industry and the effects of mountaintop removal are devastating seem vacuous when one begins to ponder what may be their true intentions.\If coal were to become the ""go to"" fuel source in the United States, would that empower the people of Appalachia like never before? Would it position Appalachian people in such a manner to benefit from a broad, deep tax base that would sever our reliance on the federal government?\I wonder if coal were so vital to the economies of Massachusetts and other areas that already have a vast private sector economy if carbon emissions would be on their radar. I call on all West Virginians to wake up and realize that opposition to coal production has little to do with preserving our environment. To the contrary, those waging war on coal are waging war on our way of life. It is about preventing Appalachians from getting power so they might preserve their own.\Christine Myers\Grafton\Power line reducing our property rights\Editor:\My letter is about the high voltage power service line that is going through many areas of our state and forcing its way through privately owned property. I understand the need for electricity services but what about our rights as private citizens and our own property which we have to pay taxes on to begin with and ordinances which make us take care of the upkeep?\I think there should be a way to get compensation for the damage this power line does going through our private property, decreasing the value from this ugly destructive passage that is being cut through our state.\And as for safety concerns, I do think there should be open inspections of safety measures taken concerning this matter with periodic updates on these safety measures and compensation for any proven health ailments such as the case with asbestos related illnesses.\Personally I myself do not know much about what we as private citizens can do concerning this matter but I do think we need to write our congressmen and senators and elected representatives whom we've elected to represent us in our legislatures.\Leonard C.

105,"WASHINGTON - The Obama administration took a major step Monday toward imposing the first federal limits on climate-changing pollution from cars, power plants and factories, declaring there was compelling scientific evidence that global warming from manmade greenhouse gases endangers Americans' health.\The announcement by the Environmental Protection Agency was clearly timed to build momentum toward an agreement at the international conference on climate change that opened Monday in Copenhagen, Denmark. It signaled the administration was prepared to push ahead for significant controls in the U.S. if Congress doesn't act first on its own.\The price could be steep for both industry and consumers. The EPA finding clears the way for rules that eventually could force the sale of more fuel-efficient vehicles and require plants to install costly new equipment - at a cost of billions or even tens of billions of dollars - or shift to other forms of energy.\Energy prices for many Americans probably would rise, too - though Monday's finding will have no immediate impact since regulations have yet to be written. Supporters of separate legislation in Congress argue they could craft measures that would mitigate some of those costs.\Environmentalists hailed the EPA announcement as a clear indication the United States will take steps to attack climate change even if Congress fails to act. They welcomed the timing of the declaration, saying it will help the Obama administration convince delegates at the international climate talks that the U.S. is serious about addressing the problem. Obama will address the conference next week.\Business groups said regulating carbon emissions through the EPA under existing clean air law would put new economic burdens on manufacturers, cost jobs and drive up energy prices.\""It will choke off growth by adding new mandates to virtually every major construction and renovation project,"" declared Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which in recent months has been particularly critical of the EPA's attempt to address climate change.\The EPA signaled last April that it was inclined to view heat-trapping pollution as a threat to public health and welfare and began to take public comments for formal rulemaking. That marked a reversal from the Bush administration, which had refused to issue the finding, despite a conclusion by EPA scientists that it was warranted.\EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday, ""There are no more excuses for delaying,"" adding that the so-called endangerment analysis from global warming had been under consideration at the agency for three years. After the official finding, she said the agency is now ""obligated to make reasonable efforts to reduce greenhouse pollutants under the Clean Air Act.""\White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Obama ""still believes the best way to move forward is through the legislative process"" - something Obama has expressed on a number of occasions as he has pressed Congress to shift the nation's energy priorities away from fossil fuels and to reduce climate-changing pollution.\The EPA said scientific evidence clearly shows that greenhouse gases ""threaten the public health and welfare of the American people"" and that the pollutants - mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels - should be reduced, if not by Congress then by the agency responsible for enforcing air pollution.\""These long-overdue findings cement 2009's place in history as the year when the United States government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse-gas pollution,"" said Jackson.\She rejected claims by climate skeptics that the science of global warming remains in doubt, an argument given additional attention in recent weeks with the disclosure through intercepted e-mails that a British scientist had privately discussed ways to shield certain climate data from public scrutiny.\""The vast body of evidence not only remains unassailable, it has grown even stronger,"" said Jackson.\Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a lead author of a climate bill before the Senate, said of the finding: ""This is a clear message to Copenhagen of the Obama administration's commitments to address global climate change. ... The message to Congress is crystal clear: Get moving.""\Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., also a co-author, said, ""The Senate has a duty to act.""\Business groups have strongly argued against tackling global warming through the Clean Air Act, saying it is less flexible and more costly than the cap-and-trade legislation being considered by Congress. Any regulations from the EPA are certain to spawn lawsuits and a lengthy legal fights.\""Such regulations would be intrusive, inefficient and excessively costly, chill job growth and delay business expansion,"" argued Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which also has been critical of the climate legislation before Congress.\""The Clean Air Act can complement legislation,"" said Jackson. In fact, if Congress were to cap greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA probably would be given the responsibility of implementing the law.\The EPA's involvement in reducing climate-changing pollution, stems from a 2007 Supreme Court decision that declared that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The court said the EPA would have to determine if these pollutants pose a danger to public health and welfare before it could regulate them.\On the Net:\Environmental Protection Agency: www.epa.gov\Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson makes an announcement concluding that climate-changing pollution threatens the public health and the environment, during a news conference in Washington on Monday.\Credit: The Associated Press"
106," WASHINGTON - Al Gore made an emotional return to Congress Wednesday to plead with lawmakers to fight global warming with moral courage while revealing nothing about whether he'll join the 2008 presidential race.\ The former vice president is a Democratic favorite for the presidential nomination even though he says he's not running. Fresh off a triumphant Hollywood appearance in which his climate-change documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" won two Oscars, Gore drew overflow crowds as he testified before House and Senate panels about a ""true planetary emergency.""\ He said the issue should not be partisan or political, but Gore faced skeptical Republicans who questioned his personal commitment to reducing energy usage and the science behind his film.\ ""You're not just off a little, you're totally wrong,"" said Texas Rep. Joe Barton, the leading Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as he challenged Gore's conclusion that carbon dioxide emissions cause rising global temperatures. Barton and Gore's exchange grew testy at one point - Barton demanding that Gore get to the point and Gore responding that he would like time to answer without being interrupted.\ ""Global warming science is uneven and evolving,"" Barton said.\ Gore insisted that the link is beyond dispute and is the source of broad agreement in the scientific community.\ ""The planet has a fever,"" Gore said. ""If your baby has a fever, you go to the doctor. If the doctor says you need to intervene here, you don't say, 'Well, I read a science fiction novel that told me it's not a problem.' If the crib's on fire, you don't speculate that the baby is flame retardant. You take action.""\ Gore's congressional testimony marked the first time he had been to Capitol Hill since January 2001, when he was the defeated Democratic presidential nominee still presiding over the Senate in his role as vice president. It comes 20 years after Gore, then a congressman from Tennessee, held the first hearings in Congress on global warming.\ It also brought him face-to-face with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who could have her front-runner status threatened if Gore decided to challenge her for the party nomination. But there was no political fireworks between them at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing.\ Clinton said she found some of Gore's ideas ""extremely intriguing"" and asked for more details on proposals such as a carbon- based tax, a cap-and-trade system and a carbon neutral mortgage association.\ In a day of testimony, Gore first appeared before a joint hearing by two House committees, with his wife, Tipper, sitting behind him and a stack of boxes beside him containing hundreds of thousands of messages asking Congress to act on global warming. Later, he testified before the Senate panel where partisan bickering grew even louder.\ Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has labeled global warming a hoax, complained that the Democratic leadership gave Gore extra time and advantages not afforded typical witnesses. Inhofe then grilled Gore about his personal energy use at his Tennessee mansion and showed the final frame of Gore's film that read, ""Are you ready to change the way you live?""\ When Gore tried to respond at length, Inhofe cut him off.\ Democratic Chairwoman Barbara Boxer kept trying to bring order to the hearing. She told Inhofe he can't control things anymore now that Republicans have lost their majority. ""Elections have consequences, so I make the rules,"" she said, holding up her gavel to cheers from the audience.\ Gore sighed heavily and proposed that he and Inhofe have breakfast and privately discuss it away from the cameras.\ Gore said he hopes whoever is elected president in 2008 ""can use his or her political chips"" to lead the world toward a new global climate treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto protocol that requires 35 industrial nations to cut greenhouse gases. The Bush administration argues Kyoto would hurt the U.S. economy and objects that high- polluting developing nations like China and India are not required to reduce emissions.\ ""I fully understand that Kyoto, as a brand if you will, has been demonized,"" Gore said.\ Gore was warmly welcomed back by some of his critics, such as Rep. Ralph Hall, R-Texas, who remembered serving with Gore's father and bantered with Gore about an evening boat ride they took together. ""You're dear to us, but I just don't agree with you on this,"" Hall said.\ Gore advised lawmakers to cut carbon dioxide and other warming gases 90 percent by 2050 to avoid a crisis. Doing that, he said, will require a ban on any new coal-burning power plants - a major source of industrial carbon dioxide - that lack state-of-the-art controls to capture the gases.\ He said he foresees a revolution in small-scale electricity producers for replacing coal, likening the development to what the Internet has done for the exchange of information.\ ""There is a sense of hope in this country that this United States Congress will rise to the occasion and present meaningful solutions to this crisis,"" Gore said. ""Our world faces a true planetary emergency. I know the phrase sounds shrill, and I know it's a challenge to the moral imagination.""\ On the Net:\ http://www.algore.com\ Credit: The Associated Press"

108,"Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent. \Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate.""\By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.\So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.\The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating.\Remember diplomat George Kennan's axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table? The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.\The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised.""\The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of Copenhagen conference.\There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, two stubborn facts - the two most populous nations.\On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth - together they account for 26 percent of emissions - jointly agreed:\They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades. Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them.\But do not really embrace them.\Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog-producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel.\When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""\In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago.\Then intelligent people agreed (see above) that global cooling threatened human survival. It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average.""\Some scientists proposed radical measures to cause global warming - for example, covering the Arctic ice cap with black soot that would absorb heat and cause melting.\Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change.\For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement - people eating locally grown foods from small farms - actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research show\ing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.\Although the political and media drumbeat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:\They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!""\In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes.\As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed - half the average of the last 50 years - and none have hit the United States."
109,"WASHINGTON - Last week, a draft memo surfaced from the Homeland Security Department suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency.\Most disturbing was the stated rationale. This was being proposed ""in the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform.""\In other words, because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, they will legislate it themselves.\Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate.\Administrators administer the law, they don't change it.\That's the legislators' job.\When questioned, the White House downplayed the toxic memo, leaving the impression that it was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland Security.\But the administration is engaged in an even more significant power play elsewhere.\A 2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they threaten human health and the environment.\The Obama EPA made precisely that finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The Washington Post, sending ""a message to Congress.""\It was not a terribly subtle message: Enact cap-and-trade legislation - taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based energy - or the EPA will do so unilaterally.\As Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch noted, such a finding ""is likely to help light a fire under Congress to get moving.""\Well, Congress didn't. Despite the ""regulatory cudgel"" (to again quote the Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly refused to acquiesce.\Good for the Senate.\But what to do when the executive is passively aggressive rather than actively so?\Take border security. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., reports that President Obama told him about pressure from his political left and its concern that if the border is secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform (i.e., amnesty).\Indeed, Homeland Security's abandonment of the ""virtual fence"" on the southern border, combined with its lack of interest in completing the real fence that today covers only one-third of the border, gives the distinct impression that serious border enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican quid pro quo on comprehensive reform.\But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for legislative favors.\It is, as the administration vociferously argued in court in the Arizona case, the federal executive's constitutional responsibility.\Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. Non-execution is a dereliction of duty.\This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal government or to Democrats.\In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has just issued a ruling allowing police to ask about one's immigration status when stopped for some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment.\Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect.\If police latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to be expanded, that's an issue for the legislature, not the executive.\How did we get here?\I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.)\The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned the heads of the country's nine largest banks and informed them that henceforth the federal government was their business partner.\The banks were under no legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal government, when crossed, to cause you trouble, endless trouble. They complied.\So did BP when the president summoned its top executives to the White House to demand a $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages. Existing law capped damages at $75 million.\BP, like the banks, understood the power of the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was.\Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was), and still be troubled by how we got there.\Everyone wants energy in the executive (as Alexander Hamilton called it). But not lawlessness.\In the modern welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That's bad enough.\But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the separation of powers...\Such constraints on your life must first be approved by both houses of Congress.\That's called the consent of the governed.\The constitutional order is meant to subject you to the will of the people's representatives, not to the whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking bureaucrat.\Krauthammer may be reached by e-mail at letters@charleskrauthammer.com."
110,"BY now, everyone no doubt realizes that I am not a fan of the pace at which the federal government has worked to contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. \Federal officials were slow to act and overly bureaucratic. They have never really understood the urgency of the situation down here.\I'm not raising a question of motive; it's simply a function of the federal government being a slow-moving albatross. The only way to attack a crisis like this is with the urgency of a military mind-set.\Even after the well is finally capped, the damage done to our environment; to the Gulf of Mexico; and to our marshes, wetlands and beaches will take years to repair.\There is another type of damage from this spill, too - its human impact. Thousands of lives, businesses and families are reeling.\Against this backdrop, the federal government unwisely chose to add insult to injury by decreeing a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf.\This ill-advised and ill-considered moratorium, which a federal judge called ""arbitrary"" and ""capricious,"" creates a second disaster for our economy, throwing thousands of hardworking folks out of their jobs and causing real damage to many families.\Now this federal policy risks killing 20,000 more jobs and will result in a loss of $65 million to $135 million in wages each month.\To ensure that such a disaster does not happen again, should the federal government increase oversight, or require additional and better equipment or on-site federal inspectors, or even temporarily pause drilling at specific rigs for additional reviews?\Of course.\Could it? Of course.\But by simply stopping all deepwater drilling, federal officials appear more interested in ideology and scoring political points - as they have done with the misguided cap-and-trade legislation - at the expense of Americans who derive their livelihood from the energy industry.\Let's be clear: This moratorium will do nothing to clean up the Gulf of Mexico, and it is already doing great harm to many hardworking citizens.\The effects will extend well beyond Louisiana. Since the moratorium was announced, America has already lost two rigs to foreign countries. More drilling companies are negotiating right now to work elsewhere.\Every time we decrease our level of production, we make America more dependent on foreign sources of energy.\On those few occasions when our country suffers a commercial airline tragedy, we do not respond by stopping all air travel for six months. Rather, we get to work figuring out the root cause and set about trying to make air travel safer.\We don't grind everything to a halt and put tens of thousands of people out of work, jeopardizing our economy.\So, my state joined a lawsuit against the moratorium. We pointed out that a majority of the experts the federal government consulted before the ban, including representatives from the National Academy of Engineering, have stated publicly that they do not agree with the six-month blanket moratorium.\The court sided with the people of Louisiana in this matter.\Consider the judge's statements: that the federal moratorium would result in the loss of jobs and livelihoods, that the government's action ""does not seem to be fact-specific,"" and that the ""government's hair-splitting explanation abuses reason and common sense.""\One might assume that the federal government would back down, lift the moratorium, and get on with the business of ensuring that nothing like this ever happens again in federal waters.\Nope.\Our federal government chose to fight on in court, and lost a second time.\Surely now, many of us thought, the federal government would stop its efforts to halt all drilling and instead get serious about more rigorous oversight and inspections.\Nope.\Instead, the federal government drafted a new moratorium.\This seems to be a cynical ploy. It will take time to again take federal officials to court. If Washington loses, officials can issue a third moratorium and play this game out as long as they want.\Such is the power of the federal government.\Louisianans, of all people, don't want to see another drop of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. It is our land and our way of life that are being harmed.\Yet the administration tells our people to simply file a claim with BP or file for unemployment. Our people want to work, not collect unemployment checks.\We don't want to see the federal government create a second disaster, an economic disaster, for the people of our state thanks to its ""capricious"" and ""arbitrary"" actions.\The bottom line is this: Thousands of Louisianans shouldn't have to lose their jobs just because the federal government can't do its job.\Jindal, a Republican, is governor of Louisiana."
111,"Congressman Alan Mollohan, who had no opposition from the GOP in eight of his 14 election bids, could have more than a half dozen Republicans vying to unseat him in 2010. \So far, at least seven Republicans have expressed interest in Mollohan's seat in the first congressional district. That's as many as have opposed Mollohan in all his elections since he won the seat in 1982, according to records from the Secretary of State's office.\Four Republicans have filed pre-candidacy forms. They include Cindy Hall, Randy Smith, Thomas Stark and Daniel Scott Swisher.\State Sen. Clark Barnes, R-Randolph, announced earlier this fall he plans to enter the race.\Add to the list two more.\David McKinley, a former state lawmaker and GOP chairman, said he is considering a run against Mollohan.\Mac Warner, a Morgantown landowner and developer who had a 23-year career in the military, said he would spend Thanksgiving finalizing a decision about whether to run.\McKinley said the feeling among conservatives is that Mollohan has ""distanced himself from his district.\""It pains me some because he's been a friend, but I just think 27 years may be enough,"" McKinley said.\Mollohan was hunting Monday and unavailable to comment on the Republican field, but a spokesman said he is planning to run for re-election.\""Mr. Mollohan will announce his intention to stand for re-election, yes,"" spokesman David Herring said Monday in an e-mail.\Last year, Mollohan ran unopposed. In 2006, he beat Republican Chris Wakim with 64 percent of the vote.\David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for The Cook Political Report, said Mollohan has never run for re-election when a Democratic president has been as unpopular in his district as Barack Obama is now.\President Bill Clinton, who was in the White House when Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994, won West Virginia in 1992 and then in 1996. Obama, on the other hand, did not carry the state last year.\""I think smart Republicans are realizing this is a good year to run,"" Wasserman said ""The best recruiter for Republicans in the House is not Pete Sessions or Kevin McCarthy, or any of the leaders who are beating the bushes for candidates. It's the overall environment.""\Reps. Sessions and McCarthy recruit Republican candidates for Congress.\Republicans are going after Democrats on multiple issues, including spending, health care reform and what they called a ""failed"" economic stimulus package.\Wasserman said Mollohan is still an overwhelming favorite for re-election at this point, but the congressman also has to raise more money than he now has and ""has to prove that he is actively opposing the Obama administration when he believes it is the district's best interest.""\It's also ""too early to tell"" the impact of a federal ethics investigation Mollohan may be facing, Wasserman said.\""Mollohan has to defend health care reform and at the same time tell constituents how his work has benefited the local economy in a way that has not benefited himself or his own family,"" he said.\McKinley, the president of a Wheeling-based architecture and engineering firm, said there is a process going on to evaluate who can bring the organization it would take to challenge Mollohan, who is holding a seat once held by his father.\For 14 years, McKinley represented Ohio County in the House of Delegates. He served as chief of the state GOP for four of those years. He said he wants to return to President Clinton's idea that the era of big government is over.\""I'm enormously frustrated when I look at the fact that I'm not hearing Alan talk about the fundamentals, the economy and jobs,"" he said. ""I don't want to talk in cliches, but that's what it's all about.""\He also mentioned a ""government-run health care plan,"" political advocacy group ACORN and coal as likely issues in 2010.\Mollohan was notably absent from a recent meeting of state politicians and businessman about mountaintop mining. Mollohan was one of only of two members of the state's five-member congressional delegation who didn't attend. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., sent a representative. Mollohan did not.\Herring, Mollohan's spokesman, said it was a matter of scheduling and that it ""would certainly be a mistake to construe his absence as anything more than a scheduling conflict.""\""Maybe there is a reason he couldn't be there,"" McKinley said. ""But coal is West Virginia, whether people like it or not.""\McKinley also took issue with what he called Mollohan's hesitation before voting against House cap-and-trade legislation earlier this summer.\""For someone to hesitate before they voted 'no' is wrong. We have to send a message to Pelosi and Reid and Obama that this war on coal has to stop,"" McKinley said, referring to the speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader. ""Coal is West Virginia.""\Contact writer Ry Rivard at ry.rivard@dailymail.com or 304-348-1796.\Credit: DAILY MAIL CAPITOL REPORTER"
112,"An appointed U.S. senator could be serving West Virginia by week's end, Gov. Joe Manchin said Monday.\The governor, a likely contender for the seat if it's on the ballot later this year, also gave a sneak preview of how he would vote in Washington in a Monday speech.\Manchin expects lawmakers to pass a bill this week that would put Robert Byrd's unexpired Senate term on the ballot in November. After the law is changed and he appoints a temporary senator, Manchin said he would announce whether he plans to run for the Senate seat. He is highly likely to do so.\There could be a primary election to select party candidates, perhaps in September. In the meantime, the senator appointed by Manchin will serve until the voters have chosen their candidate. Manchin said he would not appoint that person until the state's election law is set in stone. He hopes to announce his appointment by Sunday.\During a lunchtime speech at the Rotary Club of Charleston, Manchin gave area business and political leaders an idea of the sort of senator he would be.\Manchin continued to try to play to a centrist crowd. He quoted a political colleague who told him a zealot was ""someone who has lost their way but doubled their efforts.""\Manchin said he was someone who could ""respectfully"" disagree with President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat.\""I root for my president, whether they are Democrat or Republican - I root for that president to be the best president we've ever had,"" he said.\But Manchin began marking his territory Monday on state's rights, financial regulations, energy, the environment and education.\Manchin, freshly back from Boston where he was elected chairman of the National Governors Association, said governors were a ""fiercely independent"" bunch but one of the last groups of politicians who can work together regardless of party.\Manchin in part defended Arizona's Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. Arizona's strict new immigration law is being challenged by the Obama administration.\""Whether you agree or disagree, she is the governor of her state,"" he said.\On the Obama administration's approach to the financial markets, Manchin said he was upset by ""corporate greed"" but not enamored of the ""growing entitlement base.""\On cap-and-trade legislation, which could affect the state's coal industry, Manchin said, ""I don't think they are going to pass what they have.""\He also questioned new water quality standards being used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The standards, announced in April, apply only in a six-state Appalachian region and only to mining activity.\""They're telling me that's constitutionally sound?"" Manchin said.\He later added, ""Don't treat us like a stepchild.""\However, he agrees with the president on education.\Manchin is hoping to persuade the state Legislature to pass an education reform package in coming days in part to bring the state in line with Obama administration guidelines. Doing so could soon affect the flow of millions of dollars into the state's public school system.\""This is one of the areas where I and the president agree,"" he said.\Although he did not mention it Monday, Manchin also supported the Obama administration's health care reform efforts.\State lawmakers are expected to be back in town Thursday at Manchin's request.\If all goes according to plans and the Legislature is able to clean up the state's ambiguous election laws, Manchin said he has a short list of candidates to fill the job between now and the November election. A person could be chosen from that list ""very quickly,"" the governor said.\Manchin, along with Senate President Earl Ray Tomblin, has said state code needs to be rewritten to make clear the governor has the power to call a special Senate election. Right now, conflicting legal opinions leave any election called under the current law vulnerable to a court challenge.\""We've got to clarify to make sure - in his honor, our beloved senator's honor - that we do this right,"" Manchin said, referring to Byrd.\House Speaker Rick Thompson has been less enthusiastic about the special session but said he wants to make sure there is time to have 42 days of absentee voting before a primary and a general election, something that appears feasible even with the Nov. 2 election just 112 days away.\Lawmakers could have draft legislation Tuesday. Secretary of State Natalie Tennant has been working on legislative language. Manchin said Attorney General Darrell McGraw's office also was involved.\""We have been evaluating the legal requirements and timelines for various election scenarios and have been working with county clerks to ensure we can all administer a timely and fair election process once the Legislature has clarified the process,"" Tennant said Monday in a statement.\Manchin also said the special session he calls this week will not deal with the gubernatorial succession process, which has its own series of associated legal questions.\""It can't be convoluted,"" Manchin said of the Legislature's work on Senate succession law. ""It can't be thrown in with other concerns.""\BOB WOJCIESZAK/DAILY MAIL Gov. Joe Manchin visited the Rotary Club of Charleston on Monday, where he talked about several current issues in a way that indicated positions he might take as a U.S. Senate candidate.

113,"Aftermore than 80 years of being on the outside looking in, Republicans officially took control of the West Virginia Legislature on Wednesday, promising to bring prosperity to the state. During floor sessions that began at noon, Delegate Tim Armstead, R-Kanawha, was elected House speaker and Sen. Bill Cole, R-Mercer, was elected Senate president.\After being elected on a 19-15 vote, and a second ceremonial vote by acclamation, Cole said in a brief acceptance speech that it is time for the Senate to get to work to improve the state.\""To put it bluntly, he told the Senate in a call to action, ""the time for studies is over.\While noting that ""the voters of this state demanded a change in November, Cole reached out to Democrats, saying, ""I am confident we all want the same thing, and that is a brighter future for our state.\Armstead, who previously served as House minority leader, said Republicans stand ready to pass legislation to bring jobs to West Virginia and to change the state's educational and legal systems. Armstead won election to be House speaker by a 64-35 vote, with Delegate Rupert Phillips, D-Wyoming, abstaining.\""My sincere hope is we work together to lift up our future generations, Armstead said. ""It's time to work together to write a new chapter in West Virginia.\Republicans control 64 seats in the House, while Democrats have 36 seats, following the November election that knocked out many longtime Democratic House members.\""We are the ones who are closest to the people, in terms of their relationship with our state government, Armstead said. ""We're the ones who live in their communities, the ones who see them at the grocery store and at ball games. We're the ones who truly are their voice at the Capitol.\After November's election, the Senate was deadlocked 17-17 between Democrats and Republicans, but Sen. Daniel Hall, of Wyoming County, switched from Democrat to Republican, giving the GOP the edge.\Summing up his vision for the state, Cole said, ""It's time our children no longer call West Virginia the place they visit on special occasions, or the place where they're from. It's time to find every possible way to keep our kids home.\Cole, a Bluefield business owner, said his goals for the Legislature include creating a ""legal and regulatory environment that invites job-creating companies to call West Virginia home.\""We have a short window of time to accomplish these goals, he told the Senate, ""and I hope you share my sentiment: It's time to get to work.\Afterward, Cole reiterated his intent to get key bills passed early in the 60-day session, to ""put them on the governor's desk quickly.\To that end, many of the bills introduced in the Senate on Wednesday have single committee references, meaning they have to advance through only one committee before going to the full Senate. In the past, bills have had two or more committee assignments, usually including consideration by either the Finance or Judiciary committees, before advancing to the full Senate.\Among the single-referenced bills was the first bill introduced Wednesday, to repeal the state's Alternative and Renewable Energy Portfolio Act (SB1).\Passed in 2009 under then-Gov. Joe Manchin, the law sets benchmarks for state power plants to increase use of alternative energy sources. Although backed by the coal industry and criticized by environmentalists for counting multiple clean-coal technologies as alternative energy, Republicans have long decried the legislation as West Virginia's version of ""cap and trade.\Cole said he went over the Senate's legislative agenda Tuesday with Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, and said he's confident the Senate will be able to work cooperatively with the Tomblin administration.\""I believe we'll find more to agree on than disagree on, Cole said of the Governor's Office.\The 19-15 vote to elect Cole as Senate president went along party lines, with the exception of Sen. Robert Plymale, D-Wayne, who voted for Cole. Plymale would not talk with reporters after the vote.\Also Wednesday, the Senate elected Sen. Clark Barnes, R-Randolph, as Senate clerk. On an 18-16 party-line vote, the three-term senator ousted current Senate Clerk Joe Minard. Barnes immediately resigned his Senate seat, and the 11th Senatorial District Executive Committee nominated three potential replacements: Delegate Allen Evans, R-Grant; West Virginia Farm Bureau President Charles Wilfong; and Summersville engineer Gregory Boso. Tomblin will choose a replacement from those three. The governor's spokesman, Chris Stadelman, said to expect a choice by the end of the week.\Meanwhile, the Senate re-elected Sergeant-at-Arms Howard Wellman and Doorkeeper Tony Gallo, both by acclamation.\The House has 33 new members this year - a third of the total. Twenty-four new House members belong to the Republican Party, and nine new members are Democrats.\At 86 years of age, Delegate Frank Deem, R-Wood, is the oldest House member, while Berkeley Republican Saira Blair, 18, is the youngest - and the youngest House member in state history.\Nineteen women make up the House roster. Delegate Jill Upson, R-Jefferson is the first black woman from the GOP to serve in the House.\On Wednesday, House members bickered for nearly an hour over whether to change a rule and require that bills include statements about how the legislation would affect West Virginia's economy. Democrats wanted the analysis to take into account seniors, veterans and children.\Delegate Kelli Sobonya, R-Cabell, scolded House Democrats, saying they were spending too much time trying to add amendments to the proposed rule change, which later passed in its original form.\""The people of West Virginia have spoken, said Sobonya, referring to the Republican landslide in the November election.

114,"Last week, the White House issued a new and alarming edition of its national report on climate change. How did leading Republicans respond? Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the GOP's leader in the Senate, scoffed at President Obama for ""talking about the weather, dismissing the issue as a hobbyhorse of ""liberal elites who leave a giant carbon footprint and then lecture everybody else about low-flow toilets.\After pointing out that the president is ""not a meteorologist, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., argued that Obama's proposals to regulate carbon emissions ""would have a devastating effect on our economy without solving the problem.\And Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said the central issue wasn't climate change but cost-benefit analysis. Asked whether he thought global warming had been caused by human activity, Thune said: ""I'm not denying that. I'm simply saying that the debate ought to be: What are we going to do about it, and at what cost?\Perhaps this counts as progress. They weren't calling climate change a hoax, as many conservatives once did (and some still do). They're not even challenging the scientific consensus that human activity has contributed to the warming of the Earth (although some still contest that finding too).\Why the shift?\Polls have found that most Americans are worried about global warming, except for one group - tea party conservatives. A Pew Research Poll conducted last year found that only 25 percent of tea party adherents believe climate change is real, against 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans (and 84 percent of Democrats).\That puts the GOP in a bind, caught between its most zealous conservative supporters and the broader majorities it'll need to win elections.\More worrisome for the GOP, younger voters are even more convinced that climate change is a big problem - and they're going to be around longer than their grandparents.\And, remarkably, almost two-thirds of Americans, including about half of Republicans, favor stricter limits on emissions from power plants, the centerpiece of Obama's regulatory agenda.\""In the short term, it's politically smart for Republican politicians to express doubts about climate change because that responds to what their base wants, said Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate former GOP congressman from upstate New York who chaired the House Science and Technology Committee for six years until 2007. ""But public opinion is moving forward, and that won't be good for the deniers.\In the not-too-distant past, the Republican Party's platform actually listed global warming as a national problem and cited ""human activity among its causes. But that was 2008, when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was the nominee; even Sarah Palin, his running mate, agreed. ""It's real, she said then. ""We need to do something about it.\But that was before the tea party insurgency of 2010, and before Democratic proposals for cap-and-trade legislation made climate change a forbidden zone for most Republican politicians - including McCain, who abandoned his earlier positions and fell in line. Last year, when Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., proposed an amendment to ban any new federal regulation of greenhouse gases, only one Republican voted against it: Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.\Now only a few defiant Republican moderates still argue for policies to counter climate change, including former Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah and former Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. Except for Collins, they're all out of office.\Some current GOP members of Congress still deny that the problem exists, including Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who has called global warming ""a total fraud designed by ""liberals who & want to create global government.\Others agree that climate change is real but say they aren't certain that it's man-made - and, as a result, they feel no need to fix it.\""People like me who support hydrocarbon development don't deny that climate is changing, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said last year. ""If you're a believer in the Bible, one would have to say the great flood is an example of climate change, and that certainly isn't because mankind had overdeveloped hydrocarbon energy.\That argument has always struck me as odd: If climate change isn't man-made, does that mean there's no reason to try to counter its effects? Noah's flood wasn't man-made, but he still spent the money (or at least the timber) to build an ark.\But increasingly, the most popular argument among leading Republicans in Congress is a mix of all of the above - maybe it's a problem, maybe it isn't - plus a new talking point designed for tough economic times: Whatever the problem, it looks too expensive to fix.\""There has to be a cost-benefit analysis, Rubio said last year. ""The benefit, I think, is difficult to justify. Is there anything government can do about it that will actually make a difference?\It sounds, for a moment, as if Rubio is criticizing Obama for being too timid in his regulatory proposals. But it's really just another argument for doing nothing.\That position would carry more weight if Rubio and other Republicans had actually done the cost-benefit analysis they ask for, one that includes the costs of flooding in Miami and droughts in the Southwest as well as the price of regulating coal-burning power plants. But they haven't.\To borrow a word from a different public debate, the GOP appears to be evolving, but only in its rhetoric, not its policies. But evolution is a slow process, and if the environment changes as quickly as the scientists expect, some political species could soon become endangered.\Doyle McManus is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.\Credit: Doyle McManus"
115,"LOS ANGELES - Measure twice, cut once, they say. Unless you are trying to save the planet. In that case, measure and cut constantly.\Rising calls to create cleaner air and limit climate change are driving a surge in new technology for measuring air emissions and other pollutants - a data revolution that is opening new windows into the micro-mechanics of environmental damage.\The momentum for new monitoring tools is rooted in increasingly stringent regulations, including California's cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions, and newly tightened federal standards and programs to monitor drought and soil contamination.\A variety of clean-tech companies have arisen to help industries meet the new requirements, but the new tools and data are also being created by academics, tinkerers and concerned citizens - just ask Volkswagen, whose deceptive efforts to skirt emissions-testing standards were discovered with the help of a small university lab in West Virginia.\Taking it all into account, the Earth is coming under an unprecedented new level of scrutiny.\For more than a year, satellites launched by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been orbiting Earth to track the global flow of carbon emissions. In Colorado, workers are using infrared cameras to find methane leaking from natural gas wells. In Boston, researchers using new measuring devices have detected ""fugitive emissions"" in hundreds of places across the city, including the Massachusetts State House.\Los Gatos Research in Silicon Valley now makes portable equipment for measuring greenhouse gases and other pollution that has been used on airplanes and in national forests.\Piccaro, another California company, makes the machines that have been used to measure methane leaks in Boston and other cities. Other startups have created software that collects existing air quality data into apps that can advise asthmatics on areas to avoid and steer cyclists toward the least-polluted paths to work.\""There are a lot of companies picking up on this, but who is interested in the data - to me, that's also fascinating, said Colette Heald, an atmospheric chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""We're in this moment of a huge growth in curiosity - of people trying to understand their environment. That coincides with the technology to do something more.\The push is not limited to measuring air and emissions. Tools to sample soil, test seismic regions, monitor water quality, test ocean acidity and improve weather forecasting are all on the rise. Drought has prompted new efforts to map groundwater and stream flows across the West. In space, NASA recently began a global precipitation measurement program intended, in part, to more accurately predict extreme weather events and the availability of water.\The Obama administration has rolled out a series of regulatory changes intended either to reduce pollutants in the air people breathe or limit greenhouse gases - and sometimes both.\This month, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized new rules to reduce ozone and, for the first time, required so-called fenceline testing near oil refineries to track pollutants such as benzene that may be escaping - a task that requires sensitive monitoring equipment.\Industry groups often oppose new rules because complying costs money, but these rules can also drive technological development and new industries. While older emissions-monitoring devices may occupy the footprint of a living room, equipment is being developed that is portable and more sophisticated.\""Fifteen years ago we were talking about percent - the percentage of a particular species in a gas, said Chris Anthony, who oversees analytical products for the ABB Group, which has expanded its investments in air and gas monitoring in recent years, including buying Los Gatos Research in 2013. ""Five years ago, 10 years ago, we started talking about parts per million. In many areas now, we're measuring parts per billion, which is very, very low levels of trace gas in exhaust.\Chet Wayland, the director of the air quality assessment division within the EPA's office of air quality planning and standards, recalled a research conference the agency hosted a few years ago where he met a graduate student who showed him a hand-held, homemade device that measured air pollution.\The parts appeared to cost about $50.\""It wasn't great but it was not bad, Wayland recalled. ""I'm sitting there going, Oh, my gosh.' I'm used to working in the world where these devices are $30,000 and they're highly sophisticated, and here's somebody who built this in a lab basically by himself. That's when I realized that the world was changing.\Wayland and one of his colleagues, Dan Costa, who works on air and climate issues in the EPA's Office of Research and Development, said that as more companies and individuals make affordable equipment, they need to demonstrate that their products are accurate and reliable.\""That's one of the key issues we at the EPA are trying to focus on, Wayland said. ""When the technology is out there and everyone starts using it, the question is, how good is the data? If the data's not high enough quality, then we're not going to make regulatory decisions based on that.\He added, ""Where is this data going to reside in 10 years, when all these sensors are out there, and who's going to [manage] that information? Right now it's kind of organic so there's no centralized place where all of this information is going.\Two years ago, Heald, the professor at MIT, helped lead a group of students who created a campus air quality monitoring network. They launched a website where people can track gases such as ozone and carbon monoxide.\But the site also includes a disclaimer, warning that the numbers were not necessarily ""regulatory grade measurements. Costa said the EPA's long-term vision is ""this harmonization, a synthesis of the gold standard monitoring network [run by government] with the evolving sensor technology used by citizen groups and individuals.\Satellites are expected to play an increasing role in that goal. New equipment is being developed by NASA that will provide multiple daily readings of air pollutants from a geostationary satellite, and the agency's Orbiting Carbon Observatory, launched last year and run from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, is intended to help scientists study how carbon travels.\""To understand our impact on the atmosphere and temperature changes in the future, you've got to know how that stuff's going to move around - and we don't know that very well right now, said Annmarie Eldering, a NASA scientist who helps run the project.\Her colleague Riley Duren, who helps oversee the study of carbon emissions from large cities, noted that a satellite had helped spot methane hot spots over New Mexico's San Juan Basin and in the Central Valley, which were then tracked down more precisely with the help of aircraft and infrared cameras.\""We throw everything but the kitchen sink at this, Duren said.\Credit: William Yardley Los Angeles Times"
116,"BEIJING - At first, the numbers and company names flashing on a big board in Beijing's financial district suggest a booming market. A closer look indicates otherwise: The scrolling list rotates the same dozen or so trades, all from last year.\The lights from the Beijing Environment Exchange - one of seven pilot markets in China for trading carbon - raise questions for the country as it prepares for next year's roll-out of a nationwide system that could help the world's biggest emitter of heat-trapping carbon dioxide rein in its emissions.\A successful carbon offset, or ""cap-and-trade, market could play a big part in cutting China's emissions - and help the world tackle global warming.\Already launched in Europe, California and a few other spots, such carbon offset markets limit how much carbon can be emitted per year by factories and businesses. They then let those businesses that release less carbon than the cap sell to other companies permissions to emit whatever's left.\So far, the pilots have failed to make a noticeable dent in carbon emissions, with about 978 million yuan, or $158 million, traded since their launch in 2013, compared to the 7.2 billion euros, or about $8 billion, of carbon offsets that were traded in the European market in its first year of operation, 2006. Many companies required to buy carbon credits have waited until the last minute of compliance periods to make their trades, which has raised concerns about low liquidity in the market. Some observers question the reliability of data recording how much companies are emitting.\Chinese officials, however, say the pilot markets aren't meant to significantly cut the country's carbon profile yet. Instead, they say they are learning important lessons from their experiments and will use them in what will soon become the world's biggest carbon offset market.\""China is taking this step to accept its responsibility in stopping climate change, said Zhou Cheng, the Beijing exchange's vice president. ""This affects industry in a legal, scientific way, and it lets them form their business plans while looking at carbon emissions too.\If anything, the national plan heralds a strategy change for a country that's so far used its one-party system to order everything from factory closures to barbecue bans by giving companies a money-making incentive to cut their carbon emissions, said Jeff Swartz, international policy director at the Geneva-based nonprofit group the International Emissions Trading Association.\For some Chinese companies, selling excess carbon offset credits could bring in millions of dollars a year.\""China is using a number of different policies, both command-and-control but also market policies, Swartz said. ""(Emissions trading) will provide a fundamental solution to allow China to peak its emissions.\The past decade, however, has been a spotty one for carbon credit experiments in China.\Five years ago, European Union officials ended a carbon offset plan that paid Chinese companies to destroy the greenhouse gas HFC-23 after learning that the companies were producing the gas only to be paid to destroy it.\Kathy Kong, CEO of Beijing-based trading firm Timing Carbon, said the pilot markets still have a lot of room to grow. For example, the markets still offer only spot trading with no futures markets, which greatly limits the potential market size.\Regulators must also step in to prop up falling carbon offset prices and keep prices at other times from reaching unsustainable highs.\""This is still a market created by policy, Kong said. ""The policy needs to follow the market at some time.\Starting in 2013, China set up the seven pilot markets in the country's largest cities - Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen - as well as the industrial provinces of Guangdong and Hubei. Since mid-April, the seven markets have traded a total of 31.2 million tons of carbon. The European market in its first year traded more than 10 times that amount of carbon.\By design, each market has set up its own rules, with an eye for testing approaches for a national market.\In Beijing, any company that emits more than 10,000 tons of carbon a year - equal to the household and vehicle emissions of more than 400 American households - must join the offset market, which means it receives a yearly cap on its emissions and must buy carbon credits if it wants to emit more carbon. Credit prices have generally run from $55 to $75 per ton, and the penalty for exceeding the limit can cost three-to-five times the usual credit price. Around 550 companies in Beijing now take part in the exchange.\Other markets use different methods to set emission targets and determine who has to participate. Five of the seven markets give away carbon credits every year and then let companies auction off their excess credits. Hubei is the country's biggest market by volume of carbon traded.\For state-owned firms such the Chinese capital's largest power utility, Beijing's pilot market has forced business plans to factor in carbon emissions, said Jeremy Guo, executive vice president of the utility's energy investment arm. One result is a higher investment in renewable energy such as solar and the capture and reuse of heat emitted during some industrial processes, he said.\""We want to make our role of carbon asset management a new standard for the group company, not just to buy and sell to get some profit, Guo said.\What comes next year will depend on how the seven pilot markets shape up. They could link up so that a company in Beijing in the north could trade with another in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. Chen said another idea would be to create separate offset markets around specific industries such as steel, cement energy or construction rather than connect the separate pilots operating according to different rules.\Antung Anthony Liu, an economics professor at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, said that if done right, the markets could turn China's epic climate change fight into an international investment opportunity.\""China goes through a process where it tries to experiment with a policy before rolling it out, Liu said. ""To my mind, the markets haven't the intended hopeful effect yet but capacity has been built. These markets clearly exist. And hopefully one of them will be chosen as the best one and the nation will go forward from that.\Credit: Jack Chang The Associated Press"
117,"WASHINGTON - When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, global warming was a slow-moving environmental problem that was easy to ignore. Now it is a ticking time bomb that President-elect Barack Obama can't avoid.\Since Clinton's inauguration, summer Arctic sea ice has lost the equivalent of Alaska, California and Texas. The 10 hottest years on record have occurred since Clinton's second inauguration. Global warming is accelerating. Time is close to running out, and Obama knows it.\""The time for delay is over; the time for denial is over,"" he said on Tuesday after meeting with former Vice President Al Gore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on global warming. ""We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now that this is a matter of urgency and national security and it has to be dealt with in a serious way.""\But there are powerful political and economic realities that must be quickly overcome for Obama to succeed. Despite the urgency he expresses, it's not at all clear that he and Congress will agree on an approach during a worldwide financial crisis in time to meet some of the more crucial deadlines.\Obama is pushing changes in the way Americans use energy, and produce greenhouse gases, as part of what will be a massive economic stimulus. He called it an opportunity ""to re-power America.""\After years of inaction on global warming, 2009 might be different. Obama replaces a president who opposed mandatory cuts of greenhouse gas pollution and it appears he will have a willing Congress. Also, next year, diplomats will try to agree on a major new international treaty to curb the gases that promote global warming.\""We need to start in January making significant changes,"" Gore said in a recent telephone interview with The Associated Press. ""This year coming up is the most important opportunity the world has ever had to make progress in really solving the climate crisis.""\Scientists are increasingly anxious, talking more often and more urgently about exceeding ""tipping points.""\""We're out of time,"" Stanford University biologist Terry Root said. ""Things are going extinct.""\U.S. emissions have increased by 20 percent since 1992. China has more than doubled its carbon dioxide pollution in that time. World carbon dioxide emissions have grown faster than scientists' worst-case scenarios. Methane, the next most potent greenhouse gas, suddenly is on the rise again and scientists fear that vast amounts of the trapped gas will escape from thawing Arctic permafrost.\The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has already pushed past what some scientists say is the safe level.\In the early 1990s, many scientists figured that the world was about a century away from a truly dangerous amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, said Mike MacCracken, who was a top climate scientist in the Clinton administration. But as they studied the greenhouse effect further, scientists realized that harmful changes kick in at far lower levels of carbon dioxide than they thought. Now some scientists, but not all, say the safe carbon dioxide level for Earth is about 10 percent below what it is now.\Gore called the situation ""the equivalent of a five-alarm fire that has to be addressed immediately.""\Scientists fear that what's happening with Arctic ice melt will be amplified so that ominous sea level rise will occur sooner than they expected. They predict Arctic waters could be ice-free in summers, perhaps by 2013, decades earlier than they thought only a few years ago.\In December 2009, diplomats are charged with forging a new treaty replacing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which set limits on greenhouse gases, and which the United States didn't ratify. This time European officials have high expectations for the United States to take the lead. But many experts don't see Congress passing a climate bill in time because of pressing economic and war issues.\""The reality is, it may take more than the first year to get it all done,"" Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said recently.\Complicating everything is the worldwide financial meltdown. Frank Maisano, a Washington energy specialist and spokesman who represents coal-fired utilities and refineries, sees the poor economy as ""a huge factor"" that could stop everything. That's because global warming efforts are aimed at restricting coal power, which is cheap. That would likely mean higher utility bills and more damage to ailing economies that depend on coal production, he said.\Obama is stacking his Cabinet and inner circle with advocates who have pushed for deep mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas pollution and even with government officials who have achieved results at the local level.\The president-elect has said that one of the first things he will do when he gets to Washington is grant California and other states permission to control car tailpipe emissions, something the Bush administration denied.\And though congressional action may take time, the incoming Congress will be more inclined to act on global warming. In the House, liberal California Democrat Henry Waxman's unseating of Michigan Rep. John Dingell - a staunch defender of Detroit automakers - as head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a sign that global warming will be on the fast track.\Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., vowed to push two global warming bills starting in January: One to promote energy efficiency as an economic stimulus and the other to create a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utilities. ""The time is now,"" she wrote in a Dec. 8 letter to Obama.\Mother Nature, of course, is oblivious to the federal government's machinations. Ironically, 2008 is on pace to be a slightly cooler year in a steadily rising temperature trend line. Experts say it's thanks to a La Ni a weather variation. While skeptics are already using it as evidence of some kind of cooling trend, it actually illustrates how fast the world is warming.\The average global temperature in 2008 is likely to wind up slightly under 57.9 degrees Fahrenheit, about a tenth of a degree cooler than last year. When Clinton was inaugurated, 57.9 easily would have been the warmest year on record. Now, that temperature would qualify as the ninth warmest year.\Associated Press writer Dina Cappiello contributed to this report.\Credit: The Associated Press"

119," WASHINGTON - When it comes to global warming, the Bush administration puts its faith in volunteerism and new energy technologies to scale back America's Everest of heat-trapping gases.\ But government studies say the results are at best uncertain.\ One thing is not: Each year, the mountain of ""greenhouse"" gases emitted by the United States grows bigger.\ While the rest of the developed world requires - but isn't always achieving - mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide and other emissions, the nation adding the most gases to the atmosphere is deadlocked in a debate over how to deal with it. Individual states, meanwhile, are taking the lead.\ Voluntary programs emphasized by President Bush since 2002 are claimed to be sparing the atmosphere 300 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, or 4 percent of U.S. emissions.\ But the government doesn't know - and often can't verify - whether the reductions reported by 230 U.S. companies are real.\ ""It's difficult to prove,"" said Paul McArdle, who manages the Energy Department's voluntary reporting system. ""It's my sense that some of these are real reductions.""\ What's more, McArdle acknowledged, companies can increase their emissions overall but still claim cutbacks - by counting as reductions such steps as replacing old lighting, using more efficient vehicles or planting trees.\ In a review last April, Congress' Government Accountability Office questioned Washington's ability to monitor these voluntary efforts. ""Determining the reductions attributable to each program will be challenging,"" it said.\ In one program with measurable results, it estimated companies have reduced emissions by no more than 0.5 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution. Total U.S. emissions - now more than 7 billion tons a year - still are projected to rise 14 percent from 2002 to 2012.\ Carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the biggest of the greenhouse gases, so called because they create a heat-trapping blanket when released into the atmosphere. Others are methane, nitrous oxide and synthetic gases. The atmosphere holds more carbon dioxide now than it has for hundreds of thousands of years, and the Earth's surface warmed an average 1 degree over the past century.\ As a first step, the White House talks of reducing the ""intensity"" of U.S. carbon pollution - not shrinking emissions overall, but reducing the carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic growth.\ ""Our objective is to significantly slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and, as the science justifies, stop it and then reverse it,"" said James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ""We're making good progress. It's reasonably ambitious, but it still provides for reasonable human welfare.""\ Shortly after taking office, President Bush rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which requires 36 industrial nations to cut global warming gases by 2012 by an average 5 percent below 1990 levels.\ He argued that cutting the U.S. share to below 6 billion tons a year, as the treaty would have required, would have cost 5 million U.S. jobs. He objected, too, that such high-polluting developing nations as China and India are not required to reduce emissions.\ Some members of Congress agree with the gradualist Bush approach, while others do not, Republicans among them.\ ""Everybody's talking about it. What the American people want is for somebody to start doing something about it,"" complained Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., House Science Committee chairman.\ ""If we can't make a relatively simple change in [automobile] mileage regulations - a change to an existing regulation that doesn't even require new technology and that would have numerous benefits aside from the climate implications - then what does that say about our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?"" Boehlert said. ""It certainly doesn't say anything good.""\ Instead, the United States is spending $3 billion each year researching technologies to cut global warming and $2 billion on climate research. In a program called the Asia-Pacific Partnership, Bush also is working with Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea - producers of half the world's greenhouse gases - to attract private money for cleaner energy technologies.\ Connaughton calls that joint effort a major breakthrough. Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, calls it an ""excuse for further delay.""\ Bush envisions using more hydrogen-powered vehicles, electricity from renewable energy sources and clean coal technology.\ The Energy Department's technology program has helped build 34,000 new energy-efficient homes and it plans to create ""bioenergy"" research centers and to advance research into hydrogen fuel and fusion energy. Its director, Stephen Eule, promises breakthroughs in the coming decades.\ Scientists say climate disruptions may occur before that, however, and critics in Congress and elsewhere say the government effort is too slow and needs refocusing.\ The plan ""appears stalled near the starting line,"" said Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who chairs a House subcommittee overseeing the program. A review in May by the Energy Department's own research lab in Oak Ridge, Tenn., said the program focuses too much on work that can lead to ""only incremental improvements."" It called for more emphasis on ""exploratory, out-of-the-box concepts.""\ A new government economic analysis sees markets in combination with research as the way to go.\ The Congressional Budget Office report last month said any cost- effective U.S. policy on global warming must put a price on carbon - via an emissions tax or a ""cap and trade"" system of buying and selling emissions allowances among companies, as in Europe.\ States aren't waiting for Washington.\ On Sept. 28, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed California legislation imposing a first-in-the-nation emissions cap on utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020.\ An earlier California law ordered 30 percent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. And Schwarzenegger and British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans this summer to work toward a possible joint emissions-trading market.\ Such a market pact is close to becoming reality among eight Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, which plan to impose caps on power plant emissions and encourage trading of allowances among utilities. Twenty-eight states in all have drawn up plans to combat warming, with some - notably Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico and North Carolina - also working toward possible mandatory limits on gases. Ten states plan to enact California's auto rule, if it survives a current court challenge.\ Credit: The Associated Press"

I was an advocate for the veterans, explaining and assisting them in filing for earned benefits Congress had made veterans eligible for.\If still working, after telling these veterans how grateful our country is for their sacrifice, I would be forced to tell them that Congress has not seen fit to pass a law that would make them eligible for such a pension like other combat veterans.\Making it more difficult would be trying to explain why civilians that Congress says ""provided military-related service"" have been made eligible for this same pension when these veterans are not eligible for one penny.\For a single veteran, the income would be supplemented by the Veterans Administration dollar for dollar, for a total income of $931 per month.\For the veteran with a dependent, it would be $1,220 per month, minus his and the dependent's other income.\It should be noted that the poverty level for one person is income of less than $866 per month, and with a dependent, $1,166.\No permanently and totally disabled combat veteran, in this great country that they defended, should have to ask for welfare or be forced to live in poverty.\Congress should pass this bill or explain why these combat veterans should not be eligible like other combat veterans for the V.A.N.S.C. pension.\John Jarrett Peters\Huntington\There is no future\for the United States\I have a question about Don Surber's column, ""Americans never had it so good,"" in the Feb. 16 Saturday Gazette-Mail.\When was the article written? The latest statistics quoted are from 2004.\As far as I know, the statistics from 2004 are good, but Americans do not have it so good and will not have it good in the future.\Surber, sitting in an air-conditioned office while other people work, is very much like the Saudi Arabian people in 1989. I do not see a future for the U.S.A.\The Saudi Arabians still have oil, which they sell us. That's why the low-level workers can sit and have other people do the work.\The U.S.A. does not have that much oil, as can be seen from the prices of gasoline today. However, Americans in the oil profession are doing very well today, along with the Saudi Arabians.\Surber has some things in his favor. Many of the middle class do not do much work for the money they produce. Looking to the future, that does not bode well for the welfare of the companies that hire them.\These companies will have to continue hiring people who do not have air conditioning or cars to get to work.\These people will not be your neighbors, without cars or other things that we take for granted, but they will work.\The Americans who work, and there are plenty of them, do not save their money.\They put their money in the larger houses and more cars so that they can spend more on gasoline.\This is what Surber called our middle class. They helped send our average credit card debt to $20,000 in 2008.\Sure, we lived well and hoped that our children would live as well, not better.\We see the problems with hoping that they live better - alcohol, drugs, cars and nothing to do but games.\We have become a society of consumers, not workers, and the problem is that we are consuming on credit.\Roger L. Lee\Henderson\Summers would be\a good magistrate\Harold Summers is running for magistrate again. He should have won last time; Kanawha County could sure use him.\I know people who dealt with Summers when he was a building inspector for the city of Charleston and as an investigator for the Kanawha County prosecutor.\He was always professional and treated everyone with respect.\I have known him for over 40 years and know that he will be fair and impartial.\He's a good family man and takes pride in everything he does. I know he will make an excellent magistrate and deserves your support.\Most folks have one or two favorites, but we are voting for 10. Make Summers one of your choices. You will never regret it.\Gary F. Fridley\Charleston\Choking off coal use\would hurt Americans\Sens. Joe Lieberman and John Warner co-sponsored America's Climate Security Act late last year. This piece of legislation seeks to curb U.S. carbon emissions and could be considered as early as this spring.\While taking steps to clean up our environment is appropriate and needed, the Lieberman-Warner bill goes too far by sacrificing economic prosperity and American jobs for goals that are frankly unattainable.\The bill would place a cap-and-trade emissions program on American energy plants without allocating financial resources to help further the development of clean coal technologies.\Since over 50 percent of our nation's energy is produced from coal plants, limiting their production as a cap on emissions may effectively cause the cost of electricity to skyrocket.\Worse yet, it could result in the loss of West Virginia jobs just as our economy looks poised to slide into a recession.\Climate change is an important issue, and finding the right balance between environmental protection and economic prosperity should be the goal.\Unfortunately, the Lieberman-Warner bill is not the solution.\Jason Webb\Cross Lanes"
122,"Republican U.S. Senate candidate John Raese compared anti-smoking signs in Monongalia County to a key part of the Holocaust, which killed millions of Jews. \The remarks, made at the Putnam County GOP's annual Lincoln Day Dinner a week earlier, set off a firestorm Thursday after national media outlets reported them.\National Jewish groups condemned Rease's words as inappropriate, insensitive and callous, but Raese defended his statements Thursday.\Raese, a Morgantown industrialist, spoke at the dinner about how he doesn't want government telling him what he can or can't do ""because I'm an American.""\""But in Monongalia County now, I have to put a huge sticker on my buildings to say this is a smoke-free environment,"" Raese said. ""This is brought to you by the government of Monongalia County. OK?\""Remember Hitler used to put Star of David on everybody's lapel, remember that?"" Raese said. ""Same thing.""\Nazi authorities began forcing Jews to wear yellow Star of David badges beginning in 1939 in Poland, a practice that soon spread and became a key part of the Holocaust.\The badges were a means of segregating and identifying Jews. Jews who did not wear the badges could be fined, imprisoned or shot, according to The International School for Holocaust Studies.\People who violate the Monongalia County smoking ordinance face fines of up to $1,000.\During the speech, Raese also referenced New Deal-era Blue Eagle decals that business owners in the 1930s were encouraged to display as an endorsement of Roosevelt's economic ideas.\Raese, a blustery free-market capitalist, did not back down from his remarks.\""I can't find anything in my statement and during my speech that wasn't true,"" Raese said in a telephone interview.\He later added, ""I'm not apologizing to anybody or any organization. It's my perfect right to make a speech about meaningful subject matters in this country.""\Raese sternly dismissed the firestorm and blamed it on U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, who Raese accused of playing ""gotcha."" Raese said a person with a camera was following him around, a tactic that campaigns in major races use to try to embarrass the other side.\Raese's remarks were posted on YouTube by the user ""Raese Flubs"" and first reported by Politico. Raese is aiming to beat Manchin, D-W.Va., this fall. A story about the remarks was the top story Thursday morning at The Huffington Post, a left-leaning news site.\""I am not going to be intimidated by a bunch of bullshit,"" Raese said.\Raese attempted to contrast his remarks, which he said raised concerns about government ""micromanagement"" of private property, with what he called Manchin's ""pabulum,"" a word that means bland and simplistic speech. Raese portrayed himself as trying to talk about bigger issues and instead ending up under siege for these particular remarks because of the ""gotcha"" game.\""You can split peas with anybody; the issues in West Virginia are not any concern with issues they are trying to band me around,"" Raese said.\Raese said his remarks in Putnam County were about government control and unchecked government power.\""It's government trying to micromanage our business; it's wrong as can be,"" Raese said.\Raese said the government forcing him to put a sign on his building and the Nazi decision to single out Jews with badges were similar.\""It is a very similar situation,"" Raese said. ""I resent it, and I don't put it on my particular office building.\""It might be smoking today, it might be Big Macs tomorrow, then Coca-Colas the next day, then Jack Daniels, then we're in trouble,"" he said.\Beginning about 1,300 years ago, other ethnic groups have sought to single out Jews by making them wear distinctive clothing, according to the online Encyclopaedia Judaica.\The Monongalia County health ordinance requires ""No Smoking"" signs to be prominently posted in buildings where smoking must be banned.\Jewish groups criticized the comparison as insensitive, painful and offensive.\""It's a very inappropriate comparison,"" said Nina Sundell, regional director for the Anti-Defamation League.\While she agreed that Raese does have the right to free speech, Sundell said that doesn't change the fact that what he said could be offensive and painful - especially for Holocaust survivors.\""It's a very inappropriate comparison,"" Sundell said. ""The further we get from this period of time in history, we feel there's a greater need to educate people as to what happened and why these flippant analogies are especially painful.""\Complicating the matter was the fact that Raese's defense of the statement Thursday coincided with the Jewish observance of Yom Hashoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day.\""Comparing smoking restrictions to the Holocaust is never acceptable on any day of the year,"" David Harris, president of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said in a statement.\""But for West Virginia Republican Senate candidate John Raese to apparently defend those comments on Holocaust Remembrance Day takes the insensitivity and callousness of his remarks to the next level.""\Officials with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, one of the largest international Jewish human rights organizations, said Raese's comment, ""demonstrates a callousness to the millions of Jews murdered by Hitler's Third Reich.""\""This inappropriate comparison betrays an ignorance of what really happened in Nazi Germany,"" Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center's associate dean, and government affairs director Mark Weitzman said in a joint statement. ""It compares signs that are meant to protect people's health with the yellow stars designed to dehumanize and degrade millions of Jews by a racist, genocidal regime.""\Cooper and Weitzman said the center has spoken out against the manipulation and distortion of the Holocaust for political purposes in the past by both the left and right. They said they hoped ""Mr. Raese's colleagues and fellow citizens in West Virginia will register their disgust at this inappropriate analogy.""\State Democratic Party Chairman Larry Puccio said Raese's remarks were shocking and diminished the memory of those killed in the Holocaust.\""John Raese's comments and his refusal to apologize shows no understanding of history and no respect,"" Puccio said in a statement. ""I feel certain that after Mr. Raese has time to think about it, he will apologize.""\Raese in the past has not shied away from making provocative remarks. He referred to Manchin as ""Gov. Soprano"" in an interview in 2010 when Manchin, an Italian, was still governor. Raese lost to Manchin in the 2010 Senate race, which was to fill the remainder of the term left vacant by the death of Sen. Robert Byrd.\Referring to Hispanic U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's name, Raese struggled in 2010, calling her ""Sarah Manor, Sarah Manorgan, Sarah Morgan.""\Also in 2010, Raese called U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu by at least two different apparently Asian-sounding last names.\Another flap affected Raese's 2010 Senate campaign, though its ties to him were less direct.\A brouhaha erupted after the revelation that a casting call for an anti-Manchin ad paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee called for actors who looked ""hicky"" to portray West Virginians. Raese didn't have anything to do with the ad, but the stir caused by it played into the Democrats' hands.\Bob Adams, one of the candidates vying to become chairman of the state Republican Party, recently touted Raese's endorsement of his candidacy.\Asked if Raese's comments affected Adams' view of Raese's backing, Adams brushed aside Raese's remarks.\""Personally, I don't smoke,"" Adams said. ""But I welcome John's endorsement of my candidacy. He's a great friend, and he'll be an even better U.S. senator. I'm just glad he doesn't shoot at trees.""\Adams was referring to a 2010 TV commercial in which Manchin shot a copy of the cap and trade bill, a piece of federal legislation designed to curb global climate change, that was attached to a tree.\Reporter Jared Hunt also contributed to this story.\Contact writer Ry Rivard at ry.rivard@dailymail.com or 304-348-1796.

123,"WASHINGTON - EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, the Obama administration's chief environmental watchdog, will step down after nearly four years marked by high-profile brawls over global warming, the Keystone XL oil pipeline, new controls on coal-fired plants and other hot-button issues that affect the nation's economy and people's health. \The news came as a welcome surprise to coal industry leaders and some state politicians, while environmental groups praised Jackson for her leadership on issues affecting the health of millions of Americans.\Jackson often found herself caught between administration pledges to solve thorny environmental problems and steady resistance from Republicans and industrial groups who complained EPA rules destroyed jobs and made it harder for American companies to compete internationally.\West Virginia Coal Association President Bill Raney said Jackson's resignation is good news for coal-producing states.\He said the EPA under Jackson's leadership seemed to hold a consistent ""negative attitude"" toward the industry. He said she failed to appreciate how vital it was to the region's economy.\He said ""the great hope"" is that Jackson's successor will have a different attitude.\""Clearly the leaders of agencies can certainly set the theme for what needs to be done,"" Raney said. ""The hopeful optimism is that you'll have someone who recognizes the importance of the coal industry to the energy generation and energy security of the country.""\Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, co-founder of the Congressional Coal Caucus, said she hopes Jackson's departure would provide the Obama administration an opportunity to get West Virginia involved in a more-balanced approach to energy policy.\""We need an all-of-the-above approach that utilizes our powerful homegrown natural resources, including coal and natural gas,"" said Capito, R-W.Va. ""The EPA should be a working partner in our shared goal of energy independence, job creation and environmental protection, not a punitive imperialistic hammer driven by ideological agenda.""\Capito, a vocal critic of Jackson and the EPA, said in an interview with The Hill last year that Jackson seemed ""hell-bent"" to regulate without considering the potential economic impact.\With Jackson now on the way out, Capito said, ""I thank Administrator Jackson for her service and wish her well.""\Environmental groups lauded Jackson's efforts to improve air and water quality standards.\""Notwithstanding the difficult economic and political challenges EPA faced, her agency was directly responsible for saving the lives of tens of thousands of Americans and improving the health of millions throughout the country,"" said S. William Becker of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. ""She will be sorely missed.""\Larry Schweiger, head of the National Wildlife Federation, cited her climate change work and efforts to reduce carbon pollution.\In a prepared statement, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said, ""there is no question"" he and Jackson often had their differences.\""But we were always able to have a respectful dialogue,"" Manchin said. ""I wish her well in her next endeavor ... and I look forward to working with anyone willing to help bring this commonsense West Virginia approach to the 113th Congress.""\The GOP chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, said last year that Jackson would need her own parking spot at the Capitol because he planned to bring her in so frequently for questioning. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called for her firing, a stance that had little downside during the GOP primary.\Jackson, 50, the agency's first black administrator and a chemical engineer, did not point to any particular reason for her departure. Historically, Cabinet members looking to move on will leave at the beginning of a president's second term.\Despite the opposition, which former EPA chiefs have said is the worst they have seen against the agency, Jackson still managed to take steps meant to improve air quality and begin to curb global warming.\""I will leave the EPA confident the ship is sailing in the right direction, and ready in my own life for new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference,"" she said in a statement.\Jackson will leave sometime after President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address, typically in late January.\In a separate statement, Obama said Jackson has been ""an important part of my team."" He thanked her for serving and praised her ""unwavering commitment"" to the public's health.\""Under her leadership, the EPA has taken sensible and important steps to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, including implementing the first national standard for harmful mercury pollution, taking important action to combat climate change under the Clean Air Act and playing a key role in establishing historic fuel economy standards that will save the average American family thousands of dollars at the pump, while also slashing carbon pollution,"" he said.\Environmental activist groups and other supporters lauded Jackson for the changes she was able to make, but industry representatives said some may have come at an economic cost. Groups also noted that she leaves a large, unfinished agenda.\""There has been no fiercer champion of our health and our environment than Lisa Jackson, and every American is better off today than when she took office nearly four years ago,"" said Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. But she noted that Jackson's successor will inherit an unfinished agenda, including the need to issue new health protections against carbon pollution from existing power plants.\Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on clean air, called Jackson's tenure a ""breath of fresh air"" and credited her for setting historic fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, and for finalizing clean air standards.\But Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, said Jackson presided over some of the most expensive environmental rules in EPA history.\""Agency rules have been used as blunt attempts to marginalize coal and other solid fossil fuels and to make motor fuels more costly at the expense of industrial jobs, energy security, and economic recovery,"" Segal said. ""The record of the agency over the same period in overestimating benefits to major rules has not assisted the public in determining whether these rules have been worth it.""\Coal industry leaders have blamed those expensive clean air and water regulations for the decline of the Appalachian coal industry.\Environmental groups had high expectations for the administration headed by Obama, a Democrat, after eight years of President George W. Bush, a Republican and Texas oilman who rebuffed agency scientists and refused to act on climate change. Jackson came into office promising a more active EPA.\But she soon learned that changes would not occur as quickly as she had hoped. Jackson watched as a Democratic-led effort to reduce global warming emissions passed the House in 2009 but was then abandoned by the Senate as economic concerns became the priority. The concept behind the bill, referred to as cap-and-trade, would have established a system where power companies bought and sold pollution rights.\""That's a revolutionary message for our country,"" Jackson said at a Paris conference shortly after taking the job.\Jackson experienced another big setback last year when the administration scrubbed a clean-air regulation aimed at reducing health-threatening smog. Republican lawmakers had been hammering the president over the proposed rule, accusing him of making it harder for companies to create jobs.\She also vowed to better control toxic coal ash after a massive spill in Tennessee, but that regulation has yet to be finalized more than four years after the spill.\Jackson had some victories, too. During her tenure, the administration finalized a new rule doubling fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. The requirements will be phased in over 13 years and eventually require all new vehicles to average 54.5 mpg, up from 28.6 mpg at the end of last year.\She shepherded another rule that forces power plants to control mercury and other toxic pollutants for the first time. Previously, the nation's coal- and oil-fired power plants had been allowed to run without addressing their full environmental and public health costs.\Jackson also helped persuade the administration to table the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have brought carbon-heavy tar sands oil from Canada to refineries in Texas.\House Republicans dedicated much of their time this past election year trying to rein in the EPA. They passed a bill seeking to thwart regulation of the coal industry and quash the stricter fuel efficiency standards. In the end, though, the bill made no headway in the Senate. It served mostly as election-year fodder that appeared to have little impact on the presidential race.\THE ASSOCIATED PRESS To the delight of the coal industry and some political leaders, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced Thursday that she will step down early next year.\THE ASSOCIATED PRESS While criticized by the coal industry, outgoing EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was lauded by environmental and health advocates for policies they say have helped protect the health of the American public.\Credit: FROM STAFF, WIRE REPORTS"
124,"PHILADELPHIA - Marvin Odum, president of Shell Oil, was attending a meeting of the parent company's executive committee in Singapore when word trickled in that an exploration well drilled in Alaska's Chukchi Sea - the crowning step in a multi-year $7 billion quest - was a dry hole. Maybe not bone dry. In a recent interview, Odum wouldn't say. But in the oil business glossary, a dry hole is one that can't pay off commercially, and Shell's hole definitely qualified. The parent company, Royal Dutch Shell, abruptly dropped any further drilling - a setback for the industry, though a relief for environmentalists.\For years, they had fought a vigorous, litigious and politically intense battle over the Chukchi. Meanwhile Shell, lured by potentially rich rewards, had overcome a couple of embarrassing rig mishaps at sea and patiently navigated the courts and the Obama administration's permitting process. Now, geology had rendered its verdict.\Odum, who subsequently announced that he would be retiring at the end of this month, said the news about the well didn't hit all at once, but that the drilling results and analysis came in small, painful drips over several days of the executive committee meeting.\Odum knows all too well the element of chance that drives the oil-drilling business. The mechanical engineer has spent his entire 34-year working life at Shell and has overseen successful exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. (About a third of Shell's capital spending goes to North America.) The tools of the trade have grown more sophisticated over time, with computer-aided seismic surveys that can give exploration companies detailed three-dimensional, multicolored maps of the subsurface. Still, at the end of the day, there is only one way to find out for certain whether oil or natural gas is lurking deep in the Earth.\""Through geology and seismic surveys, we had reduced the risk to where the only way to reduce it more was to put down a well, Odum said, adding that Shell put it ""where we thought there was the highest prospect of a discovery. If they had been correct, Odum said, the reward could have been fields as rich in oil as the Gulf of Mexico, which produces 1.6 million barrels a day worth $22 billion a year, even at today's depressed prices.\""The size of the prize was always big enough to take that next step and find out for sure, he said.\Odum took time to reflect during a recent visit to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Odum's departure has saddened many at Shell who see him as, well, a nice guy. He says now is a logical time to leave Shell, which hired him on the spot during the one and only job interview of his life. His father also did some work for Shell, devising a specially fitted type of steel pipe that made drilling easier - and which NASA later used, too.\But now, Royal Dutch Shell is undergoing a massive reorganization to gird itself for a more climate-conscious world, but one that Shell says will still need vast quantities of fossil fuels.\With the recent $52 billion acquisition of the British BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell is making liquefied natural gas a bigger part of its future. It also picked up alluring deepwater oil fields off Brazil. It has reorganized its lines of management by function, rather than geography. And it is planning to sell $30 billion in assets over the next three years, twice the normal rate.\That could include some items in North America.\To many analysts, it looked like Odum was pushed into leaving. ""He's a very competent guy. Very low key and sure of himself, said Fadel Gheit, oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. ""But unfortunately for him, the results were pretty bad. It's basically on his watch.\Gheit said the drilling rig mishaps at sea cost hundreds of millions of dollars and, back on the mainland, Shell had to write down the value of shale oil and gas properties. But, he added, these setbacks were ""not entirely his fault.\Odum says that while he's not rushing into anything, he plans to find new work in the oil business. He also plans to spend more time with his new grandson, his golf clubs, his cello (an eight-year-old Christmas present he's just learning) and his three motorcycles - a Harley-Davidson, a BMW and a Ducati. ""I love riding. It's the engineer in me, he said.\***\The night before Odum arrived at the University of Pennsylvania, students from the Penn Sustainability Review, an environmental publication, met to figure out how to pressure the university into selling the endowment's investments in fossil fuel companies.\Last year, 88 percent of Penn undergraduates who voted in a referendum favored divestment from fossil fuels. (A third of undergraduates voted.) Similar measures are sweeping across college campuses, efforts that in some ways resemble the anti-apartheid disinvestment campaigns aimed at South Africa.\Fossil Free Penn, which launched the referendum, has called for the university to stop new investments in the fossil-fuel industry, sell off holdings in the top 200 fossil-fuel companies within five years and reinvest a portion of the funds into renewable energy.\The group estimates that 4 percent of Penn's $9.6 billion endowment is invested in fossil-fuel companies.\Royal Dutch Shell is a big target not only because it produces oil and gas to satisfy global demand, but also because of its record in places such as Nigeria's Niger Delta, where thieves and local insurgents frequently siphon oil from pipelines, sometimes causing leaks or explosions. Community leaders and environmental groups have accused the company of ruining the environment; the company has been selling or reducing its troubled operations onshore and sticking to those offshore.\And in the United States, the push to drill in the Alaskan Arctic drew sharp opposition. Under Odum, ""the company consistently demonstrated a lack of preparedness and a willingness to push the limits of the law, technology and common sense, said Michael LeVine, a lawyer with Oceana, which opposes all offshore drilling. ""Shell's misadventures in the Arctic Ocean should serve as a cautionary tale for other oil companies considering investments in remote and dangerous places.\If ever the oil industry needed a human face, however, Odum has been it, representing Shell in a coalition that supported the Obama administration's cap-and-trade climate strategy back in 2009.\At Penn, he said the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan - which would favor gas over coal - was ""not perfect, but it's a good reasonable place to start and he was ""supportive. He said he would prefer an economy-wide carbon tax if it were ever politically feasible, even though it would raise retail prices of oil products.\""I intellectually understand it, he said during a class in which a student asked about the divestment movement. ""If your point is to divest from fossil fuel companies, just be very clear what you want to accomplish. If it's a symbolic move - we want to voice our position' - I say, fine.' I'd much rather say there is an opportunity here, particularly with companies like Shell, to co-create a solution with a company that deeply understands energy markets.\Odum said, ""The idea that you can turn fossil fuels off and other sources on and all will be well in 10 years, it's just wrong.\He said, therefore, that ""if you're going down that route [toward divestment], then I would ask you to look at differences between companies out there. I think we're trying to do the right things.\Shell has long basked in a bit of climate-sensitive sunshine because of Odum's revelation (at a Washington Post event) that the company factors in a $40-a-ton carbon price when it does the economic analysis on a new project, an adjustment that would penalize proposals that are the worst from a climate change point of view. Asked about the Paris climate accord, he said ""we will never get this transition going at the pace people want without a price on carbon.\A Penn professor had an astute question: Does Shell assign a carbon price only to the energy the company uses to extract oil or gas? Or does it apply the price to the end use on all oil and gas found?\Odum clarified that it applied only to the amount used in extraction - a tiny sliver of the overall climate impact of a project.\Odum deflected a question about whether Shell should use part of its huge annual capital budget, now about $33 billion after the BG merger, to promote renewable energy. He said that shareholders of a company like Shell might prefer if Shell stuck to what it knew - finding oil and gas - and let shareholders take other money and invest it in firms specializing in renewable energy.\Divestment is not the only hot-button issue at the University of Pennsylvania. When Odum arrived earlier in the day at the Wharton School's radio station to do an interview, the producer offered to screen out callers who were particularly irate about shale gas drilling, which has been a huge issue in Pennsylvania, where many residents say wells have contaminated drinking water.\Odum told her not to worry. And when the subject didn't come up, he brought it up himself.\""What's happened in the back yard here in Pennsylvania has changed the world, Odum said of the giant Marcellus gas reserve in the state that has lowered prices and made it possible to replace dirty burning coal-fired power plants with gas-fired ones. But he added, ""there is a right way to develop this gas and then there are the pollution hazards residents worry about. ""Those are not difficult problems to solve, he said. Shell is part of a group of companies cooperating with the Environmental Defense Fund to measure potent methane leaks that could negate climate benefits of burning gas instead of coal.\""I come out in favor of very clear, very strong regulations, Odum said. ""From the perspective of a company like us, it protects us because everybody then has to do it the right way.\***\But most of the students who saw him in a classroom, and later at an open event, zeroed in on business decisions steered by the price of oil, which has tumbled about 70 percent since July 2014. Shell has slashed capital spending to about $20 billion from about $35 billion, and it has shelved its planned Carmon Creek oil sands project in Canada. Instead of exploring for shale oil in two dozen basins, he said the company is down to six ""sweet spots.\""We're in a commodity business, and when you're in a down cycle, everything is difficult to decide, he said. ""You've got to keep your balance sheet strong. Not just to remain solvent but able to make strategic moves when everyone else is suffering.\When deciding on a project, he said, Shell looks at its economics, its ""resilience if economic conditions go bad, political factors, country risk and environmental issues. He said that before the steep price drop, Royal Dutch Shell had been weighing on six or seven big projects a year, but in the past year had signed off on only two.\""You don't make multibillion-dollar choices lightly, he said, when asked about his toughest decisions.\""I could pick an easy one: Alaska. We spent many billions of dollars exploring off Alaska, he said, ""but the final answer comes from the drill bit when the oil that we needed for it to be viable wasn't there.\Steven Mufson covers the White House.

125," CHAMPAIGN, Ill. - Did you enjoy $3-a-gallon gasoline last summer? Some members of Congress have plans for a carbon tax that will get you even higher prices.\ By taxing the carbon content of fuels, they hope to steer Americans toward smaller cars, mass transit and city living, and away from SUVs, highways and suburbs. This is an astonishingly bad idea, one that will harm the economy while hitting the poor the hardest. When you think about it, a tax on transportation is a tax on everything.\ A key reason for our economic success is that Americans have access to a broad market for the things we need and the products we make. The logistics revolution of the past 20 years - centered on innovations like ""just in time"" production - reduced manufacturers' costs and contributes to our prosperity.\ Because our food, clothes and the materials with which we build our homes are drawn from this national market, a tax on fuels is a tax on everything. Raising taxes on everything we buy is a quick way to sicken our economy.\ Of course, if carbon-tax supporters were proposing a national tax on everything, they'd be laughed out of town as soon as they opened their mouths. Every can of food, every book and every piece of clothing that you buy that wasn't raised next to the store where it was sold will cost more with a carbon tax. The only difference from an explicit ""tax on everything"" is that a carbon tax would be hidden, embedded in the price of everything you bought.\ There are three kinds of taxes: Progressive taxes, like our income tax's rising rates for higher incomes, take a larger proportional bite from the rich than from the poor. Flat taxes take the same proportion from everyone. Regressive taxes take a higher proportion of the income of the poor than of the rich. Tax experts debate the relative merits of flat and progressive taxes, but there is no case for regressive taxes.\ A carbon tax would be regressive because poorer people spend a higher proportion of their incomes on energy-related products. On average, families making between $10,000 and $30,000 a year spend 10 percent of their income on energy while families making more than $50,000 spend 3 percent. Taxing the poor more than the rich is not just economically dumb, it's morally wrong.\ And finally, Congress isn't smart enough to tax carbon. Carbon- tax proponents argue that people buy less of things that cost more. If carbon emissions harm the environment, tax enthusiasts reason that they can get people to emit less carbon by raising the price through a tax. Carbon-tax enthusiasts are vague about how much of a tax to impose. That detail matters a great deal.\ How much harm does releasing the carbon in a gallon of gasoline cause? No one knows and no one seriously believes an accurate assessment is possible. Set the tax too high and we'll use too little of carbon-based fuels; too low and we'll use too much.\ We've tried allowing politicians to set energy prices before. The energy price controls of the 1970s produced long lines at gasoline stations, natural gas shortages, and Jimmy Carter in a cardigan. We can't afford any of those experiences again.\ Carbon emissions may be bad for the environment. If they are, cutting carbon emissions is not something to be done on the backs of the poor through a regressive tax nor should it be done by sending the economy into a tailspin through a tax on everything."
126,"SYDNEY - Australia's government repealed a much-maligned carbon tax on the nation's worst greenhouse gas polluters on Thursday, ending years of contention over a measure that became political poison for the lawmakers who imposed it. The Senate voted 39 to 32 to axe the 24.15 Australian dollar ($22.60) tax per metric ton of carbon dioxide that was introduced by the center-left Labor government in July 2012. Conservative lawmakers burst into applause as the final tally was announced.\Prime Minister Tony Abbott's conservative coalition government rose to power last year on the promise of getting rid of the tax, assuring voters that removing it would reduce household electricity bills. He plans to replace the measure with a taxpayer-financed AU$2.55 billion fund to pay industry incentives to use cleaner energy.\""Today, the tax that you voted to get rid of is finally gone: a useless, destructive tax which damaged jobs, which hurt families' cost of living and which didn't actually help the environment, Abbott told reporters in Canberra.\Australia is one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters per capita, largely because of its heavy reliance on the nation's vast reserves of cheap coal for electricity.\Opposition leader Bill Shorten lashed out at Abbott after the vote, dubbing him an ""environmental vandal.\""Today, Tony Abbott has made Australia the first country in the world to reverse action on climate change, Shorten told reporters. ""History will judge Tony Abbott very harshly for refusing to believe in genuine action on climate change. Tony Abbott is sleepwalking Australia to an environmental and economic disaster.\The carbon tax, charged to about 350 of Australia's biggest carbon polluters, was controversial from the start. Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard had initially vowed not to introduce a tax on carbon emissions. But after her Labor party was elected in 2010, she needed the support of the minor Greens party to form a government - and the Greens wanted a carbon tax. Gillard agreed, infuriating a public that viewed the measure's imposition as a broken promise.\Labor's popularity plummeted, particularly when consumers saw their power bills soar. In reality, the tax accounted for a relatively small portion of that increase, but many blamed it for the hike nonetheless.\Desperate to improve its standing with the public, Labor replaced Gillard with previous Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who promised to get rid of the tax and transition it earlier than planned to a cap-and-trade scheme, which would have significantly lowered the per-ton carbon price.\But it proved too little, too late. Abbott's party swept to power in last year's elections by vowing to get rid of the tax for good.\The prime minister said families will be AU$550 a year better off now that the tax is gone.\Big businesses and industry groups across Australia rallied behind the tax's abolition, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which dubbed the levy a dead weight on the economy.\""It really did impact on the competitiveness of many Australian businesses and of course it put up the price of power, the group's CEO Kate Carnell said. ""So it's a good step forward for competitiveness and also for employment in Australia.\In a fiery speech ahead of Thursday's vote, Sen. Christine Milne, leader of the Greens, called it an ""appalling day for Australia.\""A vote for the abolition of the clean energy package is a vote for failure, she said. ""If this parliament votes to abandon the clean energy package, you are voting against the best interests of the nation.\Environmental groups called the tax's repeal an international embarrassment.\""It's a very sad day because it was working, this carbon price, said Australian Conservation Foundation CEO Kelly O'Shanassy. ""Our government has failed Australians and they need to go and look their kids and their grandkids in the eye and tell them why - why - they are unwinding laws that will protect people in this country from climate change.\Credit: Kristen Gelineau The Associated Press"
127,"Reprinted from the Parkersburg News and Sentinel\Among the punitive solutions bandied about by those seeking to ""address climate change as quickly as possible is the placement of a tax on carbon emissions. Our friends north of the border are giving us a chance to preview how that might work out for the United States.\Canada plans to implement a ""price on carbon dioxide pollution (a tax), that will reach a peak of $50 per metric ton by 2022. The Financial Post has done the math on what that will cost Canadians, and it is not pretty.\Households in British Columbia will pay an extra $603 (Canadian dollars) per year - the lowest, while those in Nova Scotia will pay $1,120 - the highest. The average Canadian household will be paying another $853 per year.\And that is just the beginning. Most ""experts contend the price must go even higher to lower carbon emissions to a level that will satisfy them (though, in truth, what they mean is to lower carbon emission levels to a degree that will counterbalance the enormous amounts of carbon that will continue to be released by China, India, and the developing world.)\In Canada, that might someday mean an additional ""price of $100 per metric ton, sending the household cost in a place like Nova Scotia to an astounding additional $2,240 per year.\So, if a $50 (American dollars) per ton tax was added in the United States, some households here in the Mid-Ohio Valley could absorb an extra $853 per year - though even for those folks, $2,240 would begin to be a bit painful. And, yes, we know there are a few households who would pay it gladly.\But the vast majority of us would have to make more sacrifices if we were to continue to afford electricity. Imagine what a blow that would be to households already financially crippled by the war on coal and affordable electricity. In Canada, by the way, 20 percent of households are already classified as being in ""energy poverty, where 10 percent of their household expenditures go to the electricity needed to power their homes and transportation. Their elected officials and the environmental lobby appear not to care.\Here in the U.S. there are plenty who are also eager to see traditionally sourced electricity priced out of reach for the majority. Affordable electricity is, in their minds, a bad thing; and they are willing to snuff it out without first providing an alternative that will not cost most people more than they can afford, and cost some people their jobs.\Let us hope our own politicians keep an eye on developments in Canada, and that the environmental lobby will shift its focus from policies that do harm to those that will be good for both the environment and ALL the people living in it.\Credit: By Reprinted from the Parkersburg News and Sentinel"
128,"Australia has repealed its carbon tax, leaving climate advocates in the U.S. and abroad feeling disheartened. While the repeal has long been anticipated - Prime Minister Tony Abbott campaigned to scrap the tax and has been gearing up to repeal it ever since he took office - it nonetheless strikes at the heart of supporters of a price on carbon. In a bit of irony, the conservative prime minister's opposition to the carbon tax has been so strident that he actually praised the Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency regulations - hotly opposed by conservatives in the United States - as ""sensible direct action steps Australia should follow.\However, this high-profile carbon tax defeat may not be what it appears. While Australia's carbon tax has become widely unpopular and controversial, British Columbia's carbon tax on the other hand is considered a popular success. What accounts for this difference?\The carbon tax rates for each region are similar, with British Columbia even edging out Australia at approximately $27.9 versus $22.6 (U.S. dollars per ton of carbon dioxide). British Columbia's tax is more broadly applied than Australia's, covering the purchase or use of all fuels within the province. Australia's carbon tax, in contrast, was applied only to the 348 highest carbon-emitting businesses, covering the electricity and mining sectors, but not gasoline use. By these measures, British Columbia has a seemingly more burdensome carbon tax.\Both regions have in recent years strongly supported climate policy, with 68 percent of the Australian public considering global warming a ""serious and pressing problem in 2006. That sentiment has all but disappeared in Australia. While there is plenty to say about the role of media and business interests in influencing Australian public opinion of the carbon tax, I think there are two crucial additional insights that explain the difference:\1. Australia did not have a similar shale gas boom as in North America. Regardless of whether you consider fracking a good or bad thing, electricity prices in North America have been depressed in part due to abundant shale gas, and in part to economic recession. Dramatically rising electricity prices in Australia - due in large part to electricity infrastructure upgrades and other factors independent of the tax, along with the tax - turned the Australian public forcefully against the carbon tax, in a dynamic that does not exist in British Columbia.\2. More importantly, British Columbia's carbon tax is revenue-neutral, and Australia's carbon tax was not. While wonky, the concept of revenue neutrality is perhaps the single most important factor for explaining British Columbia's success.\By law, British Columbia is required to return every dollar of carbon tax raised back to British Columbians by lowering other taxes. In essence, taxes are shifted away from what you might call ""prosperity taxes - like taxes on income and payroll - to taxes on carbon pollution. In practice, British Columbia's carbon tax has actually been revenue negative - cutting more prosperity taxes than raising pollution taxes - with the result that it now has the lowest personal income tax rate in Canada and one of the lowest corporate rates in North America. (As an aside, carbon tax shift opponents argue that it could never remain revenue neutral in practice; highly progressive British Columbia is a notable example to the contrary.)\Shifting taxes from prosperity to pollution has enabled British Columbia to reduce carbon emissions handsomely compared to the rest of Canada, while maintaining a stable economy following recession. The ""shift in ""carbon tax shift has also cemented this once unpopular tax as a public policy pillar in the province, garnering a commanding 64 percent of public support, according to a 2012 poll.\Although Australia's carbon tax included compensation schemes for electricity users to shield them from excessive costs - which many households benefited from - these schemes caused a lot of confusion. Compensation schemes are not as transparent as a tax shift, and do not naturally cultivate the low ""prosperity tax environment that has now taken hold in British Columbia.\For American climate advocates, this ""Tale of Two Carbon Taxes should be heeded when advocating for a price on carbon. Already many unlikely allies are aligned around a carbon tax shift, from activist James Hansen and Citizens Climate Lobby, to ExxonMobil and the free-market Heartland-spinoff R Street Institute. In practical terms, the repeal of Australia's carbon tax highlights the key role that revenue-neutrality will play in keeping together both the political coalition and public support for a carbon tax in the United States.\Brendon Steele is a senior stakeholder engagement manager at Future 500, a global nonprofit specializing in stakeholder engagement and building bridges between parties at odds to advance systemic solutions to urgent sustainability challenges.\Credit: Brendon Steele"
129,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) In 2007, Australians were ready to do something to combat climate change, even if it was expensive. More than two-thirds of them said so in a poll, and both major political parties vowed to make industries pay for greenhouse-gas emissions. The undoing of that perspective will likely be complete after a new Senate is sworn in today. It's expected to give Prime Minister Tony Abbott the votes he needs to repeal a 2-year-old tax charged to around 350 of Australia's biggest carbon polluters. Three top political leaders lost their jobs over the issue as support for climate-change measures plummeted.\A global recession, political miscalculations and failed negotiations only partially explain the dramatic change.\Opponents of the carbon tax implemented in 2012 had the media largely on their side. Electricity prices soared - not mainly because of the tax, but because power companies were spending billions on infrastructure. Most electricity users were compensated for the added cost of the tax, but many of them didn't know that. And rising gas prices fed the fury - even though the tax didn't apply to gasoline.\Australia's experience illustrates how easy it is to scuttle complicated environmental laws, and serves as a warning to President Barack Obama, whose recent proposal to force a 30 percent cut in power plants' carbon emissions is drawing anger from both sides of politics.\""One of the keys was the fact that we did lose bipartisan support for emissions trading as one of the solutions, said John Connor, CEO of the Sydney-based Climate Institute think tank. ""And that then threw this issue into the sort of political and cultural trench warfare that you see in the U.S., but not so much of elsewhere.\Australians' concerns about global warming peaked before elections in 2007. Prime Minister John Howard had grown unpopular for joining Washington in refusing to accept U.N. Kyoto Protocol targets for cutting carbon emissions. Both Australia and the U.S. are leading producers of coal, a major source of the pollution.\An annual poll by the Lowy Institute for International Policy shows the proportion of Australian voters who saw global warming as a serious problem that demanded immediate steps - even at significant cost - peaked at 68 percent in 2006. The telephone survey of 1,007 voters had a 3.1 percentage-point margin of error.\Facing defeat, Howard's conservative coalition back-flipped. Both sides advocated a cap-and-trade scheme in which free-market forces set the price of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide.\Kevin Rudd's center-left Labor Party won, but the Senate thwarted his efforts to introduce a cap-and-trade system. Some senators considered his plan too extreme, while others found it too weak. Meanwhile, the global economic crisis eclipsed the environment in Australian politics.\The government and the leader of Australia's conservative opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, were on the verge of a cap-and-trade deal in 2009. But Turnbull lost his leadership post to Abbott, then a senior opposition leader and a fierce opponent of the proposal.\Rudd shelved the plan. His popularity plummeted, and he lost his job in a Labor Party leadership vote to Julia Gillard.\The minor Greens party soon became pivotal. Rather than a cap-and-trade scheme, the Greens advocated a carbon tax in which government, not the market, set the price of pollution. After the 2010 election, Gillard needed the Greens' support to form a government. To get it, she agreed to a carbon tax, something she had vowed not to allow.\The tax, which went into effect in July 2012, charged major polluters a fixed price on carbon. It was to switch in mid-2015 to a cap-and-trade scheme, with a floating price set by market forces and linked to the European Union market.\Gillard and her government's popularity nose-dived. The 2012 Lowy poll showed support for costly steps to combat global warming hit bottom: 38 percent.\While Gillard's broken promise drove much of that anger, other forces were at work.\Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns 70 percent of Australia's newspapers, supported Rudd in 2007 but by 2010 was backing Abbott. The top talk radio hosts in every major Australian city pushed the climate skeptic line.\Within days of the tax taking effect, Australia's consumer watchdog cautioned two companies that sold solar panels for falsely claiming electricity prices under the tax would rise 400 percent by 2019. The managing director of a major bakery franchise resigned over a memo in which he urged store owners to raise prices and ""let the carbon tax take the blame. There were hundreds of complaints of misleading advertising and price-gouging.\It was easy to attribute higher electricity costs to the tax. Between 2006 and last year, the average Australian household power bill increased more than 85 percent, the Grattan Institute think tank reported.\But the government says the tax has accounted for only around 9 percent of the increase since July 2012. And most households were compensated through tax breaks or welfare.\Grattan said about half the rate hikes were related to expensive upgrades by Australian electricity providers. The companies can increase rates to recoup capital expenditures. Many critics accused them of ""gold plating their networks but industry officials said they were improving infrastructure to meet rising demand.\Opinion polls indicated Australians were overestimating the impact of the carbon tax.\A survey by the think tank Per Capita soon after the tax started found that most people blamed it for higher gasoline prices - even though the tax didn't apply at the pump.\Most estimated the tax increased their weekly cost of living by $19 or more, about twice the government's estimate. And while 90 percent of households received tax-related government compensation, half those surveyed said they hadn't received anything. The Per Capita online survey of 1,422 Australians did not publish a margin of error.\By 2013, six years after Howard's government was reeling over its failure to respond to climate change, the Labor Party was scrambling to undo its response.\Party lawmakers ousted Gillard and restored Rudd, who promised to ditch the tax and begin the cap-and-trade scheme earlier, greatly reducing the cost of a ton of carbon. Abbott's conservative coalition won the 2013 elections in a landslide, anyway.\Abbott promised to replace the tax with a AU$2.55 billion fund to help polluters convert to cleaner technologies. He also has said Australians will be able to keep the government compensation they began receiving to defray carbon-tax costs.\""The irony of all this is that Tony Abbott did describe the whole thing as socialism dressed up as environmentalism, and it's interesting that what he's taken away is the environmentalism, but keeping the tax shifts, or the socialism, if you like, said Connor, of the Climate Institute.\When new senators take their seats Monday, Abbott should have enough votes for repeal. Clive Palmer, a coal mining magnate and carbon tax critic who created the Palmer United Party, leads an influential voting bloc of four new senators.\In a bizarre twist June 25, climate change activist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore offered congratulations as Palmer announced his party would vote to repeal the tax. Palmer won Gore's praise by supporting a future cap-and-trade scheme and backing Australia's commitment to boost wind, solar and hydroelectric energy.\As Obama has sought support for the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed carbon rules, he has noted the political perils.\""If we're blithe about saying this is the defining issue of our time but we don't address people's legitimate economic concerns, then even if they are concerned about climate change they may not support efforts to do something about it, he told the League of Conservation Voters last month.\Australia's tax faces its demise as support for change appears to be rebounding. Forty-five percent of respondents in this year's Lowy poll see global warming as a ""serious and pressing problem, up 5 percentage points from 2013 - Australia's hottest year on record.\Meanwhile, Australians are limiting pollution themselves. Australia's power consumption declined for the first time in 2010, and has fallen every year since. Its greenhouse gas emissions dropped a record 0.8 percent from 2012 to 2013.\One reason for the change, according to an Australian Institute think tank report, was all the carbon tax attention. It made many Australians realize how much they were spending on electricity.\Credit: Rod McGuirk The Associated Press"
130,"E - The Environmental Magazine\Dear Earthtalk: Where do the leading Democratic candidates for president stand on environmental issues? - Leslie Mazur, Hauppauge, NY \President Obama, with his recent push to join the world in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, will be a tough act to follow on the environment. But each of the Democratic candidates has shown a willingness to continue fighting the green fight and working with industry and other nations to rein in emissions and promote sustainable development.\Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders stands out in terms of environmental commitment. He has been a vocal defender of the need for an international climate accord, initially championing U.S. participation in 2000's Kyoto Protocol, a climate pact that ultimately failed due to lack of participation by China and the U.S. Since then, he has remained one of the most outspoken advocates for climate action in Congress. His current platform includes instituting a nationwide carbon tax and using the funds to finance the development of renewable sources of energy. He would like to see the country move quickly toward ""fossil fuel independence and is advocating that at least 25 percent of U.S. energy come from renewable sources by 2025. He is against letting the Keystone XL pipeline cross the United States with Canadian tar sands oil. He would like to see the federal government cut subsidies to large animal ""factory farms and move that money toward stimulating the organic agriculture sector. And he backs efforts to require labeling for any products containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\Frontrunner Hillary Clinton is no slouch on the environment, either. Like Sanders, she supported U.S. participation in the Kyoto Protocol and has been outspoken about the need to address climate change ever since. She terms the effort to achieve carbon neutrality nationwide as our ""modern Apollo moon shot and would like the federal government to pledge $100 billion annually to mitigate the effects of climate change. She recently came out in opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, and shares Sanders' desire for achieving 25 percent clean energy nationally by 2025. She is also pushing for more research and development in the alternative energy sector paid for out of funds otherwise earmarked to subsidize Big Oil. Otherwise, Clinton generally supports efforts to conserve sensitive lands and protect endangered species, and has consistently backed efforts to beef up the Clean Air and the Clean Water acts.\The remaining candidates for the Democratic nomination also boast strong environmental track records. As Governor of Maryland, Martin O'Malley spearheaded a statewide effort to protect roughly a million acres of land around Chesapeake Bay to bolster waning blue crab and oyster populations. He supports helping the clean energy sector get off the ground to protect the environment and provide jobs, and wants to double the nation's energy efficiency in just 15 years and get the U.S, off of fossil fuels fully by 2050.\Environmental advocates have their fingers crossed that, regardless of the outcome of the 2016 elections, the U.S. can maintain the momentum of the Obama administration on climate and related issues.\CONTACTS: Bernie Sanders, bernie sanders.com; Hillary Clinton, www.hillaryclinton.com; Martin O'Malley, www.martinomalley.com.\EarthTalk"
131,"WASHINGTON - I am an optimist, both by temperament and observation. But I maintain my hopeful outlook partly because I know that less optimistic people will regularly see problems and challenges and sound the alarms - to which we will respond. Pope Francis has issued just such a warning with his encyclical on the environment. The document is eloquent and intelligent, especially in its handling of science. ""Most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity, it says. ""Concentrated in the atmosphere, these gases do not allow the warmth of the sun's rays reflected by the earth to be dispersed in space. That is as lucid a two-sentence description of the mechanism of global warming as I have read.\The encyclical is gloomy. But in fact, there are remarkable changes taking place that could put the planet on a much more sustainable path. You get a sense of them if you read another important report that was issued this week - to much less fanfare than the pope's missive - the International Energy Agency's special report on energy and climate change.\The report points out that in 2014, the global economy grew at 3 percent but energy-related carbon dioxide emissions stayed flat, the first time this has happened in 40 years. In that same year, renewables accounted for nearly half of all new power generation and the energy intensity of the global economy dropped by twice as much as it has on average annually over the past decade. With concerted action, we could actually push global emissions downward in the next few years.\How? Well, there is an ongoing revolution taking place in energy technology. Natural gas has replaced coal in many places. The cost of solar cells has plummeted, leading to their widespread use. Cars, buildings and machines are becoming much more energy efficient. And over the horizon, one can see progress in batteries, nuclear power and biofuels, which could collectively produce a new energy ecosystem.\But innovation alone isn't what is spurring progress, and it won't be enough. We need a revolution in public policy as well. Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defense Fund, points out that most of the improvements that have been made in technology and efficiency would not have happened without rules and laws. And a series of smart policies - that are not very costly or disruptive - could dramatically accelerate the shift to a cleaner economy.\First, stop doing harm. Even Bjorn Lomborg, the skeptic about many efforts to tackle global warming, argues for a reduction in the massive, market-distorting subsidies for fossil fuels. The IEA estimates that in 2014, these subsidies globally amounted to $510 billion, about four times those provided to renewable energy.\""We still have a long way to go on energy efficiency, Krupp notes. ""Buildings waste 30 percent of their energy. And a dollar spent in this area usually yields two to three dollars in energy savings in return. He argues that solar power could become far more widespread if governments were not as beholden to utility companies and their phalanx of lobbyists. ""There are lots of nonmarket barriers to renewables, placed at the behest of the established players, he said.\Natural gas is better than coal, but its production, transport and use release significant amounts of methane, which has much worse effects on the climate than carbon dioxide. The good news is that serious studies have found that these emissions could be reduced relatively cheaply with new regulations. President Obama has called for nearly halving oil and gas methane emissions from 2012 levels by 2025. Krupp points out that if the same is done globally, that would have the same impact on the climate over the next 20 years as would shutting down 1,000 coal-fired power plants.\The smartest new policy would be the simplest, and one supported by many die-hard free marketeers, like the Reaganite Republican, former Treasury Secretary George Shultz: a carbon tax - effectively putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions to encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies. This seems impossible to imagine - yet earlier this month, several major oil companies in Europe came out in favor of a price on carbon, whether through a tax or an emissions trading system as those used in California and Europe.\Technology and policy innovations are happening, just not on the scale that they need to. That's why the pope's warnings are so useful and important - even to an optimist like me.\Credit: Fareed Zakaria"

133," BRITAIN'S Economist magazine says it's obvious that much of the world - especially underdeveloped nations - will continue burning coal, so research must be rushed to reduce coal's dangerous side- effects.\ ""In poor countries, where inefficient power stations, sooty coal boilers and bad ventilation are the norm, air pollution is one of the leading preventable causes of death,"" the business journal says in a July 4 special report. Further, coal is the chief source of airborne carbon dioxide, the foremost ""greenhouse gas"" blamed for global warming.\ ""From Athens to Beijing, the impact of fine particles released by the combustion of fossil fuels, and especially coal, is among today's biggest public health concerns,"" it says.\ However, coal burning is sure to continue, because supplies are enormous. ""There is so much cheap coal, distributed all over the world, that poor countries are bound to burn it"" as they pursue industrial growth, it says.\ Therefore, the phrase ""clean coal"" must ""become more than just an amusing oxymoron,"" the magazine concludes. Better methods must be found to curb the soot and CO2 pollution.\ The Economist says CO2 can be ""scrubbed"" by passing coal fumes over chemicals that capture it. Then the gas must be ""sequestered"" - stored by dissolving it into seawater or pumping it into depleted underground natural gas chambers.\ Better, the magazine says, a process called ""steam reformation"" can change coal into a ""synthesis gas"" composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which produces cleaner energy. Moreover, the hydrogen eventually may be used in fuel cells, which make no pollution at all.\ ""The dream of cleaner energy will never be realized as long as the balance is tilted toward dirty technologies,"" The Economist says. Governments must end subsidies that encourage dirty burning of fossil fuels, and instead increase subsidies and other incentives to develop low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells.\ A ""carbon tax"" should be instituted, so the price of coal and other fossil fuels will more accurately reflect their environmental and health costs. ""The harm done to human health and the environment from burning fossil fuels is not reflected in the price of those fuels, especially coal, in most countries,"" it says.\ The Economist is hardly a radical magazine. And these are hardly radical ideas, although they may sound like it in West Virginia, where coal is still indisputably king, in political influence if not economic.\ But the facts are clear. Pollution from coal and other fossil fuels will cause worse health consequences as developing countries use more energy, and the threat of global warming looms over the planet. Catastrophic climate change could ruin food supplies, increase disease, make many parts of the globe uninhabitable and lead to increasingly severe hurricanes, tornadoes and other severe weather events.\ The move from dirty burning to cleaner energy won't happen as long as the price of oil, gas and coal remains artificially low. Unless the true costs are reflected in prices, old techniques will have an insurmountable advantage over new, developing energy technology.\ The world should take these suggestions seriously, and begin action to make clean coal ""more than just an amusing oxymoron."""
134,"E - The Environmental Magazine\Dear EarthTalk: Given that the presidential election is just around the corner, what can you tell me about each candidate's environmental track record and positions? - Jane Miller, Chicago, Ill. \Just because the environment is getting short shrift this election season due to our nation's lingering economic woes doesn't mean that candidates Obama and Romney can ignore the issue.\Environmentalists have cheered several of President Obama's moves during his first term, including: passage of the Recovery Act and its funding for environmental and habitat restoration and water quality improvements; passage of the first comprehensive National Policy for the Stewardship of the Ocean, the Coasts and the Great Lakes; and the signing of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, which expanded land protections and water conservation across two million acres of federal wilderness.\Obama also formed the Partnership for Sustainable Communities to bring together federal agencies to help communities nationwide improve access to affordable housing and increase low-cost transportation options while protecting the environment.\He also established new rules to reduce the negative impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining, set historic standards limiting greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, made substantial investments in clean energy, proposed the first-ever carbon pollution limits for new fossil-fuel-fired power plants, and reduced carbon emissions within the federal government.\On the downside, green leaders dismay Obama's lack of follow-through on a 2008 campaign promise to label genetically modified foods so that consumers know what they are getting when they buy corn, sugar or breakfast cereal. Also, a 2011 Obama decision to deregulate the planting of genetically modified alfalfa and sugar beets incensed organic farmers and environmental leaders.\Greens also worry about Obama's enthusiasm for an ""all-of-the-above"" energy policy that includes the practice of hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") to access natural gas in shale beds under wide swaths of the northeast and western U.S.\If re-elected, Obama would no doubt work to expand U.S. leadership on setting emissions limits in unison with other nations, and has pledged to continue to reduce our dependence on oil so as to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\Conservationists are also hopeful that Obama will set aside threatened lands for protection from development, as both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did soon before leaving the White House.\While Mitt Romney doesn't have much of an environmental track record from his days as Massachusetts' governor, he did get kudos for being open minded to both regulatory and market-based policy ideas.\He also supported a 2003 northeastern states agreement to reduce carbon emissions from power plants via a regional cap-and-trade emissions reduction plan. But in 2005 Romney abruptly pulled Massachusetts out of the plan, telling reporters that it didn't protect businesses and consumers from increased energy costs.\Romney is now pitching an energy plan that that embraces all the options, including fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewables. But he recently told ScienceDebate.org that he opposes any kind of carbon tax or cap-and-trade system ""that would handicap the American economy and drive manufacturing jobs away,"" adding that economic growth and technological innovation, ""not economy-suppressing regulation,"" are key to protecting the environment in the long run.\CONTACTS: Mitt Romney: Energy, www.mittromney.com/issues/energy; Barack Obama: Environment, www.barackobama.com/environment; ScienceDebate.org, www.sciencedebate.org."

Dr. Titley was the chief operating officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and is currently professor of meteorology at Penn State.\He went on to explain that warmer air carries more moisture, and that increases flooding - like the 1,000-year floods that decimated Clendenin, Rainelle, Richwood and White Sulphur Springs in June 2016.\And warmer oceans expand. Expanding oceans coupled with melting sea ice - Antarctica is losing 200 billion tons of ice a year - creates sea rise. Sea levels were once projected to rise 3 feet by the end of the century. Today's projection of the rise in sea level by the year 2099 is 4 to 8 feet.\There is near universal (98 percent) agreement by climate scientists that the cause for climate change is anthropogenic - that is to say it is man-made.\But as Charleston enters its second heat wave with temperatures above 95 degrees this month (yes two heat waves in June), it's less important to talk about the impact of climate change or the causes of climate change, and more important to talk about solutions.\Individuals and businesses can take inventory of their carbon and methane footprint and reduce it. For example, I've installed solar panels that generate virtually all of my electrical needs; drive a Prius that averages 44 miles to the gallon; and insulated my 80-year-old East End house so much that my natural gas bill runs $22 a month.\At the city level, I hope that the new city administration, whoever wins the November election, will promote carbon-free transportation by installing bike lanes throughout the city, making Charleston a healthier place and one that is more appealing to young adults. The new Charleston administration should also set a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 50 percent over the next six years.\On the state level, the Department of Environmental Protection should require natural gas producers to develop leak detection and repair measures to limit total emissions of methane to less than one percent from the production, processing and transmission of natural gas.\Natural gas claims to be the cleaner fossil fuel. Yet natural gas is a potent greenhouse gas - 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years. If natural gas is going to be promoted as a clean fuel, it cannot simultaneously be a major contributor to climate change.\Nationally, I am convinced that a carbon tax is the most effective means of mitigating the impact of climate change on people and the environment. A carbon tax should return most of the revenue to American families to lessen the impact of projected increases in fossil fuel prices and to subsidize the transition to cleaner energy.\This approach can actually provide a net economic benefit to low-income families who use less energy than more affluent households. But not everyone will be better off under a carbon tax. That's why I support using some of the carbon tax revenues to help coal producing communities and states like West Virginia that will be disproportionately impacted by a carbon tax.\Without addressing climate change, we will see more destructive floods like the one in June 2016; more destructive hurricanes like Harvey, Irma, and Maria; more destructive wild fires in the West; and raising sea levels that produce ""clear day flooding during high tides in Miami, Norfolk and other coastal areas.\As a country and globally, we face difficult choices. But the longer we delay taking action, the more significant our actions will need to be. And if we don't make meaningful changes soon, our children and their children will pay a heavy price for our inaction.\Credit: By Perry Bryant"
136," WASHINGTON - From No. 10 Downing Street in London to a U.N. conference in Nairobi to the Goddard Space Center outside of the nation's capital, the science on global warming has been analyzed and the prognosis for planet Earth is not good.\ The new Congress can help the United States and the Bush administration catch up with the rest of the world in stemming the damage that carbon emissions have done to our fragile atmosphere - and supercharge the national economy as well.\ Barbara Boxer, the incoming chair of the Senate's Environmental and Public Works Committee, hails from a state that has largely adopted the greenhouse gas emission limits ratified by the Kyoto Protocol.\ That treaty, of course, was roundly rejected by the Bush administration and ridiculed by Boxer's predecessor as chairman, the wildly anti-environmental James Inhofe, R-Okla., who persists in calling man-made global warming a hoax.\ Boxer is correct when she recently stated that time is running out on global warming and that the federal government must initiate the same steps that states such as California have taken to curb carbon-dioxide emissions and provide incentives for alternate and environmentally safe energy sources.\ Unfortunately, even the modest steps advocated by Boxer may not be enough to prevent the Earth from changing into what Gus Speth, the dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, foresees as a ""ruined world"" if something is not done quickly to repair the ecological damage already done.\ More than 1,000 scientists who recently gathered at the Beijing Conference on Global Environment Change warned that carbon-dioxide emissions have increased four times faster than during the last decade - an alarming development that calls for urgent and drastic action on the part of the world's ""greatest carbon polluter"" - the United States.\ Ironically, our country also ranks at the bottom of the list of countries named by Climate Action Network-Europe as doing the least about global warming - 53rd out of 56 among industrialized nations. Only China, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia are rated worse.\ The European Union, led by France, has responded responsibly to the threat to the planet's environmental health by adopting a carbon- emission tax, a move that should be copied by Congress.\ The French government is imposing a 10 percent tax on coal and industrial and air transport polluters to fund alternative energy programs. The French may include a tax on imports of industrial goods on countries that refuse to adopt the Kyoto Protocol (read the United States) greenhouse gas emission restrictions after 2012.\ Congress should take action to impose a carbon tax on the major polluters: the oil, gas and coal industries; electric utilities; and the manufacturers of gas-guzzling cars, SUVs and trucks.\ The new Democratic leadership also should ensure that the new carbon tax is not passed on to consumers by mandating that price and rate controls limit the huge profits rolled up by the energy industry in recent years. Only a bite in profits will force Big Oil, Big Gas, Big Coal and Big Auto to change their ways.\ A tax on carbon emissions may cause some economic suffering at first, but that pain will quickly abate as the new tax revenues pour into the Treasury to help subsidize job-producing ethanol filling stations, offshore wind farms, huge solar power complexes and other eco-friendly energy sources.\ While Democrats have been timid about passing tax increases in the past, they should not shy away from this desperately needed levy even if they can't prevent it from being passed on to consumers. It is one that the environmentally concerned Americans who constitute the new majority will be happy to pay to save their beleaguered planet."
137,"THANKS to coal-fired power, West Virginians pay some of the lowest prices in the nation for electricity. Still, many of Appalachian Power's customers are having a hard time paying their bills.\That promises to get harder still, for two reasons:\First, the Public Service Commission just gave the company permission to recover some of its costs with an 8.1 percent rate increase. Residents who use 1,000 kilowatts a month will see their bills rise by almost $6.\Second, President Obama and key Democrats in the U.S. Senate reaffirmed this week their determination to pass a rate increase of their own.\Unable to convince Republicans and moderate Democrats to impose a carbon tax on the entire American economy, Sens John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., ""signaled their openness to a smaller carbon cap that would be placed only on the utility sector,"" wrote John Voorhees and Robin Bravender of Greenwire.\No further proof is needed of liberal Democrats' arrogance, or of how out of touch they are with the world their constituents live in.\A tax on coal-fired utilities is a tax on their customers. Do senators really think the public is too dumb to figure that out?\The nation is mired in what some call the Great Recession, which may slide into a second swoon. Joblessness remains very high.\Many Americans share West Virginians' dependence on coal-fired power. If Democrats pass a tax on coal-fired utilities, millions of Americans will be gouged.\Utilities have no source of income other than ratepayers. Do senators really think they can hide a huge tax on consumers by saying it will fall on ""utilities?""\Apparently.\""The president told the senators that he still believes the best way for us to transition to a clean energy economy is with a bill that makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for American businesses by putting a price on pollution - because when companies pollute, they should be responsible for the costs to the environment and their contribution to climate change,"" the White House said in a statement.\The administration would engage in a gigantic market manipulation. Democratic politicians would artificially make a reliable, affordable ""fossil fuel"" - coal - painfully more expensive, thereby deterring investment in it, so as to steer capital to inefficient, unreliable ""green energy"" technology like wind farms and solar panels.\Over the coming long weekend, senators should ask their constituents about their electric bills.\Even for liberals, not considering such factors is out-of-the ballpark arrogant."
138,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is speeding up Canada's planned elimination of traditional coal-fired power plants, doubling down on green pledges as its top trading partner moves in the opposite direction. Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said Monday the country would phase out traditional coal power by 2030, an acceleration of existing measures that the government says affects four facilities in Canada not already facing retrofit or shutdown by then. They include two facilities in Nova Scotia owned Nova Scotia Power, an Emera Inc. subsidiary, and one each in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick owned by provincial crown corporations.\Canada, which already draws 80 percent of its electricity from nonemitting sources, is pressing ahead with plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions amid warnings from Trudeau's political opponents that doing so will create a competitive imbalance with the neighboring U.S., where President-elect Donald Trump wants to back out of climate pledges and boost coal production.\""Phasing out coal-fired electricity and expanding clean power sources will create new jobs and opportunities, McKenna said Monday, speaking to reporters in Ottawa. Eliminating smog caused by coal power generation will also reduce health impacts, she said.\Trudeau has unveiled a series of environmental measures in recent months, including a minimum price on carbon and expanded funding for marine protection. His centrist Liberal Party is trying to balance demands of environmental advocates with spurring Canada's sluggish economic growth. Trudeau faces deadlines to decide on three pipeline projects over the next month.\The change essentially requires coal plants to meet a tougher emissions standard - 420 metric tons of carbon dioxide per gigawatt hour - more quickly than previously scheduled, unless they adopt carbon-capture technology to cut emissions. If they convert to natural gas, they need only meet a 550 metric ton standard until 2045, when the tougher standard kicks in. McKenna also said she'd work with provinces on equivalency agreements, leaving the door open to keep coal plants running if emissions cuts are found elsewhere.\The move will see Canada generate 90 percent of electricity from non-emitting sources by 2030, McKenna said. It will also cut emissions by 5 metric megatons, the equivalent of taking 1.3 million cars off the road, according to government estimates.\Coal power represents about 8 percent of Canadian greenhouse gas emissions, the government said. It accounts for about 11 percent of the country's electricity, concentrated mostly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and also in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, according to a report issued Monday by the Pembina Institute, an environmental think-tank.\Alberta and Saskatchewan are major oil producers reeling from the impacts of a commodities slump. Alberta has already pledged its own coal phase-out, while Saskatchewan is balking at Trudeau's earlier announcement of a minimum carbon price.\Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall criticized Trudeau for again preempting a December meeting with provincial leaders, where a pan-Canadian climate strategy is due to be discussed.\""These actions have severely undermined the December meeting and have exposed the Prime Minister's disingenuous commitment to federal-provincial collaboration, Wall said in a statement. ""We will continue to strongly oppose any attempt to impose a federal carbon tax on Saskatchewan and will not support any agreement at the December meeting unless the proposed federal carbon tax is withdrawn.\Ontario - Canada's most populous province - phased out coal over the past decade. Air quality has improved while electricity rates in the province have roughly doubled. McKenna said the government was ""working to ensure the coal phase-out in other provinces does not increase rates and provided no further details.\The federal government didn't announce new funding for provinces to shut down coal power. Earlier this month, however, it announced billions in new funding for unspecified green infrastructure, as well as the creation of an infrastructure bank.\Credit: Josh Wingrove Bloomberg"
139," PARIS - Forty-five nations answered France's call Saturday for a new environmental body to slow inevitable global warming and protect the planet, perhaps with policing powers to punish violators.\ Absent were the world's heavyweight polluter, the United States, and booming nations on the same path as the U.S. - China and India.\ The charge led by French President Jacques Chirac came a day after the release of an authoritative - and disturbingly grim - scientific report in Paris that said global warming is ""very likely"" caused by mankind and that climate change will continue for centuries even if heat-trapping gases are reduced. It was the strongest language ever used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose last report was issued in 2001.\ The document, a collaboration of hundreds of scientists and government officials, was approved by 113 nations, including the United States.\ Despite the report's dire outlook, most scientists say the worst disasters - huge sea level rises and the most catastrophic storms and droughts - may be avoided if strong action is taken soon.\ In his call to action at a French-sponsored environment conference on Saturday, Chirac said, ""It is our responsibility. The future of humanity demands it.""\ Without naming the United States - producer of about one-quarter of the world's greenhouse gases - Chirac expressed frustration that ""some large, rich countries still must be convinced."" They are ""refusing to accept the consequences of their acts,"" he said.\ So far, it is mostly European nations that agreed to pursue plans for the new organization, and to hold their first meeting in Morocco this spring.\ Chirac, 74, is seeking to leave his mark on international affairs before he leaves office, likely in May, though his own environmental record over 12 years as France's president is spotty.\ Former Vice President Al Gore, whose Oscar-nominated documentary on the perils of global warming has garnered worldwide attention, cheered Chirac's efforts.\ ""We are at a tipping point,"" Gore told the conference by videophone. ""We must act, and act swiftly ... Such action requires international cooperation.""\ The world's scientists and other international leaders also said now that the science is so well-documented, action is clearly the next step.\ ""It is time now to hear from the world's policy-makers,"" Tim Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation, said Friday. ""The so-called and long-overstated 'debate' about global warming is now over.""\ Granger Morgan, an energy expert at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States predicted the new climate report ""will kick a few more folks to get on board.""\ And Jason Grumet, head of U.S. bipartisan advocacy group, the National Commission on Energy Policy, said: ""The debate has clearly shifted from a battle over the science to fighting over the scope and design of the solution.""\ However, many questions remain about Chirac's proposed new environmental body, including whether it would have the power to enforce global climate accords.\ Chirac's appeal says only that the group should ""evaluate ecological damage"" and ""support the implementation of environmental decisions.""\ Many countries have failed to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions laid out in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The United States has never ratified the pact. And on Friday, the Bush administration reiterated its rejection of imposed cuts on greenhouse gases.\ Earlier this week, Chirac warned in a published interview that the United States could face a carbon tax on its exports if it does not sign global climate accords.\ The European Union, which agreed to the Kyoto Protocol curbing emissions, has committed to a 20 percent reduction in carbon pollution by 2020, said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. And if others join them, they could even try for 60 percent cuts by 2050, he said.\ The United Nations also is considering a summit of world leaders to tackle global warming, and de Boer said he would expect the United States to send high-ranking officials to it.\ Despite White House resistance to carbon-cutting measures with teeth, de Boer and Carnegie Mellon professor Morgan said they see movement in the United States anyway.\ ""We are certainly building critical mass among opinion leaders and nontechnical folks,"" Morgan said from Pittsburgh, citing recent calls to action by corporate CEOs, even in the energy industry. ""We are at the point over the next three to five years where the U.S. is going to get quite serious about it.""\ And in May, the same international panel that wrote Friday's report will wrap up a new document spelling out the benefits and costs of slowing global warming, setting up a buffet of choices for policy-makers.\ For now, scientists are energized that the world is finally listening to them.\ Kevin Trenberth, an American co-author of the new climate report, marveled at the overflow crowd of more than 400 reporters on hand for the document's release on Friday. It was more reporters than he'd seen in decades of climate conferences. He took out a small camera, smiled and took a picture of the media.\ Credit: and Seth Borenstein; The Associated Press"
140," Dear EarthTalk: Which countries that signed onto the Kyoto Protocol, which set goals for reducing global warming emissions, are fulfilling or surpassing their commitments? - Dan S., via e-mail\ As of the end of last year, 169 countries had signed on. The agreement called for a 5.2 percent reduction overall in the release of six pollutants - carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) - by 2012 in relation to 1990 levels.\ Though the agreement was hammered out 10 years ago, its emissions- reduction standards did not take effect until two years ago. As such, signatory countries have only barely begun to make changes, and no one has yet conducted a comprehensive study of progress toward reaching targets.\ United Nations research does show, however, that a majority of the 36 European countries that signed on are not on track to meet their goals by 2012.\ The 27-member-nation European Union, which as a block is one of the largest global-warming polluters, is likely to meet its collective goal. This is due in large part to Eastern European states having shut down or modernized heavy-polluting Soviet-era industries during the 1990s. Also helping the EU effort is the United Kingdom, which is on track to meet its goals, thanks mostly to a switch from coal-fired power plants to cleaner burning natural gas.\ Germany and France also hope to meet their Kyoto commitments, largely through a program of subsidies for the development of non- polluting energy sources. And Sweden expects to overachieve on its Kyoto targets thanks to the imposition of a hefty carbon tax on polluting industries and big investments in alternative energy sources.\ Topping the list of Kyoto slackers is Canada, which last year became the first signatory country to announce that it would not meet its Kyoto target of a 6 percent emissions cut by 2012.\ New oil production in the tar sands of Alberta has instead forced Canada's greenhouse gas emissions up significantly, as the government has chosen to pursue economic growth as a priority over meeting its Kyoto commitments.\ Japan is also lagging behind. If no additional measures are taken, the United Nations forecasts that Japan's emissions will instead grow 6 percent by 2012. But Japan's environment ministry says that implementation of some market-based incentives in 2008 should help Japan meet its goal.\ Regrettably, the United States and Australia don't have to worry about meeting any commitments, as neither country agreed to sign - even though together they account for 30 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.\ Got an environmental question?

141,"I am an 82-year-old grandfather of five but also as an engineer with more than 50 years of experience in dealing with air pollution problems, and CEO of a company dedicated to acceping challenges and financial opportunities by doing our part to mitigate climate change. I feel I have to speak to legislators as a grandfather who must admonish his children and stop them from running out in the road to be run over by the climate change truck that is roaring down upon us.\Climate change is real, and it is serious. It is man-made, and we men, and women, can stop it if we have the guts and stop pandering the very small minority of greed-driven polluters.\To be specific, we must stop burning coal and fossil fuels and as quickly as technically possible switch to renewable energy sources. Coal does not have a role in addressing the climate change crisis. Coal is the primary source of greenhouse gases. Carbon capture and sequestration is neither technically nor economically feasible, as any independent and knowledgeable engineer will tell you.\The sun delivers enough energy in one day to power the earth for years, and the source is infinite.\I do not offer that as hearsay or speculation. I personally was involved in the design of nine concentrated solar power plants for Southern California Edison in the Mohave Desert in the 1980s. The naysaouldill never pay for themselves until oil gets to be $14 a barrel.\$14 a barrel. Did you hear what I said?\Those nine concentrated solar power plants have been stuffing money in the pockets of Southern California Edison for 30 years, at zero fuel expense. Solar power works. It is cheaper than coal-fired power. It is creating jobs all over the world, while coal is laying people off.\Florida Power & Light has been advertising a concentrated solar power/natural gas backed up plant. That is an excellent interim solution that ought to be embraced in West Virginia.\And if you don't like my statement that coal fired power is too expensive, then I suggest you look very carefully at the Province of Ontario, Canada.\Ontario studied why they were experiencing very excessive health-care costs in the air shadows of the coal-fired power plants. After two years of study, they determined that if they shut those plants down and replaced them with renewable energy systems, they would save money in the provincial budget, lowering the costs of electric power and health care, and increasing the health of the local people.\Ontario determined in 2005 that renewable energy is less costly than coal-fired power, so they completed their transition to shutting down all coal-fired power plants last year.\Legislators should visit with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change (How's that for a cabinet level title?). While there, I could arrange to see a remarkable development in concentrated photovoltaic cells that has brought the price of electric power from solar energy down to 5 cents per KWH. Currently John Amos, I am told by AEP executives, is running at 6 cents per KWH. This same company, Morgan Solar, has a next generation of CPV cells that will generate at 3 cents per KWH.\They have supplied their breakthrough and disruptive solar systems to power plants in California, India and elsewhere. The largest public utility in Spain just committed a multi-million dollar job creating investment in Morgan Solar, while we are trying to save a Neanderthal dying industry.\If you want an additional case to study then I suggest you look at why the province of Quebec, in the 1960s, determined that detrimental societal damage from a major mining industry were not worth it when they realized that the health care and environmental costs that using it, mining it, transporting it and putting it into all sorts of products was costing them.\As a result, that mining industry of Quebec died a natural economic death and was replaced by a diverse economy that is very robust today, with clean, less costly alternatives.\In Quebec it was asbestos. Millions of tons of it were left in the ground, and Quebec moved on, and today is the world's third-largest concentration of aerospace manufacturing industries.\Just like West Virginia, 50 years ago a huge percentage of Quebec's revenue came from asbestos mining severance taxes. But the environmental and health costs exceeded the value of those taxes, so the asbestos industry died a natural death.\I suggest that the coal industry case today is similar to the asbestos industry case in the 1960s.\Even United Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts recently cited the huge discrepancy in the price of coal between Appalachia and the Western mine sites. West Virginia coal cannot even compete with its Western competitors, and no amount of legislation can save them from the hard economic facts of life.\A recent op-ed response from the West Virginia Coal Association's Chris Hamilton was full of spin and distortions, not caring at all about the miners' safety and health as they seek to back off the miners' protections, increase their ability to pollute our air and water, or raise the risks to the health of West Virginia children, seniors or anyone, just to protect coal company profits at the expense of the mother ship we all are riding upon, Planet Earth.\If I may leave you with a positive recommendation, West Virginia should be increasing all the incentives possible to encourage entrepreneurs and renewable energy economic forces to follow in the footsteps of Germany, Ontario, California, even China, in accelerating the transition away from poisoning the earth.\Level the playing field. Pass a carbon tax. British Columbia did in 2005. Another mountainous province of Canada with huge extractive industries, they have seen a significant economic job stimulation by enacting a carbon tax. It is yet another case that we should learn from and adopt.\Even though I am 82, I am the founder and very active CEO of an aerospace manufacturing company that is building a system to go on every Boeing and Airbus aircraft to reduce their carbon footprint. We have been welcomed and embraced by the market.\Make no mistake, we are challenged by seeking to build from scratch a manufacturing business. But my colleagues and I have planned an operation that will indeed profitably operate with a zero carbon footprint as we enter a global market. That is clearly the future.\Entrepreneurs like us see opportunities in addressing climate change, and we are investing in them.\The financial markets are abandoning the coal industry. Insurance companies now are preparing for their climate change risk and are strong advocates for accelerating the transition away from coal fired power.\West Virginia must stop clinging to the Neanderthal past. Embrace the future. Create clean, safe jobs for retrained miners in the rapidly growing renewable energy fields. Help us all, show leadership, and save this planet for our children and grandchildren.\Allan Tweddle is a graduate engineer, CEO of Composite Transport Technologies Inc., and a resident of Charleston with his wife Barbara Braun.\Credit: Allan Tweddle"
142,"SYDNEY - Australia will force its 500 worst polluters to pay $25 for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit, with the government promising to compensate households hit with higher power bills under a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions unveiled Sunday. \Prime Minister Julia Gillard sought to reassure wary Australians that the deeply unpopular carbon tax will only cause a minority of households to pay more and insisted it is critical to helping the country lower its massive carbon emissions. Australia is one of the world's worst greenhouse gas polluters, due to its heavy reliance on coal for electricity.\""We generate more carbon pollution per head than any other country in the developed world,"" Gillard told reporters in Canberra as she released details of the tax, which will go into effect on July 1, 2012.\The government hopes businesses affected by the tax will seek out clean energy alternatives to reduce their bills. The affected companies will have to pay $25 per metric ton of carbon, with the price rising 2.5 percent a year until 2015, when the plan will move to a market-based emissions trading scheme.\The carbon tax is the government's main tool in meeting its pledge to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020 to at least 5 percent below 2000 levels. By then, the tax will have helped reduce carbon pollution by 160 million metric tons - the equivalent of taking 45 million cars off the road, Gillard said.\Critics of the plan say Australian households will be unfairly burdened by higher costs passed onto them by the big polluters. To help compensate for the higher bills, nine out of 10 households will receive some kind of assistance in the form of income tax cuts and payments. Two-thirds of all households will receive enough assistance to cover the entire financial impact of the tax, Gillard said.\Industries affected by the change will get $9.9 billion in compensation over the next three years, with the worst-hit businesses expected to be steel and aluminum manufacturers.\The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the tax would weaken the economy and do little to help the environment.\""Economically, the tax is a harsh blow to import and export competing businesses, especially small and medium businesses,"" the group's CEO Peter Anderson said in a statement. ""Our international competitors get a free kick, of our own making.""\Environmental groups were cautiously optimistic about the scheme.\""This package is not perfect, but it is absolutely essential Australia gets started,"" Australian Conservation Foundation executive director Don Henry said in a statement.\Greenpeace said the package was a good start but believes the price per ton of carbon should be higher.\""The fact that we have any price at all is testament to all Australians who demanded the government take action on climate change,"" Greenpeace Australia Pacific CEO Linda Selvey said in a statement. ""But equally, the fact it is such a low price, with such limited coverage is testament to the power of the big polluters to dominate Australia's political leadership.""\Scientists say carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases emitted by industry, transportation and agriculture are driving global temperatures higher.\Without dramatic reductions in emissions, scientists have warned that melting polar ice caps will inundate islands and coastal areas, certain plant and animal species risk extinction and extreme weather conditions will increase.\Credit: KRISTEN GELINEAU THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"
143,"For all Donald Trumps efforts to revive coal, market forces and some of his own supporters are vying to write their own version of Americas energy future. Divisions persist among the presidents supporters and even within his own Cabinet about whether to continue subsidies for wind and solar power, enact a carbon tax, remain party to the Paris climate accord and plenty of other issues that will shape the U.S. energy landscape.\Seventy-five percent of Trump supporters like renewables and want to advance renewables, Debbie Dooley, a tea party organizer and solar energy activist, said at a Bloomberg New Energy Finance conference in New York on Monday. The conversation has changed. You have to have the right message. Talk about energy freedom and choice. The light bulb will go off.\Trump may be resolutely committed to fossil fuels, but the economic reality is renewables are now among the cheapest sources of electricity. Wind and solar were the biggest sources of power added to U.S. grids three years running, becoming key sources of jobs in rural America. Thats created clean-energy constituencies in North Carolina, Texas and other parts of the country that supported Trump in November.\Still, there are enough members of Trumps Cabinet who deny the basic science of global warming that there is little, if any, chance the administration will enthusiastically support clean energy. Instead, the debate is likely to hinge on whether the president will try to actively reverse market forces allowing wind and solar to flourish.\That tug-of-war will play out in the weeks to come at the White House, in corporate board rooms and at economic summits in Italy and Germany. Today, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry will shed light on the debate at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance gathering, which also will feature Myron Ebell, an avowed climate-change denier who headed Trumps Environmental Protection Agency transition team.\Ebell said global warming and the advantages of clean power are largely a myth perpetuated over the last half century by financiers and scientists he dubbed the climate industrial complex.\President Eisenhower in his farewell address not only talked about the military industrial complex, but he talked about the technological scientific complex as a problem as well, Ebell, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institutes Center for Energy and Environment, said at the conference.\In many ways little has changed in Americas energy markets since Trump took office. States including California, New York and Massachusetts continue to move forward with aggressive policies to cut carbon emissions. Anheuser-Busch InBev, Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.s Google and other companies continue to power facilities with wind and solar energy.\Even so, federal policy matters.\Despite the presidents executive orders, much of his energy blueprint remains a work in progress. That includes his position on tax credits for wind and solar, how energy fits into a federal infrastructure plan and how, if at all, the administration plans to keep uneconomical coal plants open.\So investors will listen closely as Perry who oversaw record expansions of wind power as Texas governor steps to the microphone at this weeks conference.\There are a lot of blanks to be filled in, Ethan Zindler, an analyst with New Energy Finance in Washington, said in an interview.\Perhaps no issue engenders more debate within the Trump administration than the Paris accord. The president famously vowed to cancel the landmark agreement during the campaign. Afterward, he said hed keep an open mind about it.\Two key events next month are likely to force him to make a decision. Leaders from the Group of Seven nations meet for an economic summit in Italy on May 26 and have indicated they will push Trump to sign off on a joint statement supporting efforts to fight climate change. And envoys hashing out details of the Paris accord will gather in Germany for two weeks of discussions concluding May 18.\Meanwhile, Trumps advisers have staked out their positions. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Stephen Bannon are among those pushing to scrap the Paris deal, brokered in 2015 by almost 200 nations. Opposite them stand Trumps daughter, Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others.\Pressure is coming from outside the White House on both sides of the debate. Coal baron Robert E. Murray has pushed Trump to scrap the deal. Other energy companies have endorsed the accord, including ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and liquefied natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy.\Domestic energy companies are better positioned to compete globally if the United States remains a party to the Paris agreement, Cheniere Chief Commercial Officer Anatol Feygin wrote in an April 17 letter to George David Banks, a White House energy adviser.\Outside the beltway, Trump backers are split over energy policy, too. The president received strong support from coal-rich regions of West Virginia, Wyoming and Kentucky. Yet recent polls have indicated Trump voters also back renewables, especially in windy states like Iowa and Texas.\While wind and solar were the province of liberal environmentalists, conservatives have increasingly begun to see clean energy as way to weaken the power of monopolistic utility companies and bolster Americas energy independence. It doesnt hurt that wind and solar employ almost 475,000 people in the U.S., almost three times as many as coal.\These are conservative values: jobs, energy freedom, choice, personal liberty, Dooley said. There is really a green revolution going on within the Republican party.\Ebell doesnt buy it.

This is a back door into the Obama administration's way to help in his and Sen. Harry Reid's idea of paying for social programs that can get him and his fellow members re-elected. This is a way that billions of dollars are to be raised for people who subscribe to these transfer of wealth ideas.\The cost of producing electricity via coal-fired power plants is approximately six cents per kilowatt-hour. Any other form of energy besides hydroelectric is 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. Please tell me, during the most challenging economic times that most of us have ever been a party to, how in God's creation can we as a country allow this asinine approach to go forward? Please imagine the devastation that will be created when the cost of electricity will increase by 50 percent for industry and all of the domestic users.

145,"As the current GE ad on TV says: ""New ideas are the natural born enemy of the way things are!"" To me, in change, there is hope.\The realities of change are often daunting, disruptive and threatening. Yet eventually we must accept its irreversible course and adapt - either reluctantly or with an embracing enthusiasm.\We are facing such a time in West Virginia. It's 2015, not 1955! That said, I am cautiously optimistic.\To his credit, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin announced at his Energy Conference that his administration would probably put together a plan to comply with the Clean Power Plan that the EPA has issued. His recent op-ed rightfully talks about attracting gas dependent industry.\To his credit, Cecil Roberts of the UMW has also recognized that the future jobs for miners are permanently declining in coal.\To his credit, Appalachian Power's President Charles Patton was forthright in his realistic statement that the era of coal fired power is coming to an end.\The Gazette-Mail recently reported that the National Survey on Energy and the Environment has found that 70 percent of ""Americans indicate that there is solid evidence of global warming."" That's encouraging. The general populace is catching up with the world's scientists who are observing and measuring a dangerous level of anthropogenic climate change and are warning us to fix it or suffer serious consequences.\Nonetheless, we keep reading the repeated mantra that coal-fired power is cheap and dependable while none of the alternatives are either. What poppycock! The deniers continue to rant about bringing back the good old days of unregulated coal-fired power, ignoring the life threatening crisis of climate change.\The scientific evidence of what some are now calling ""Climate Disruption is clear. It is, among the world's independent scientists, at 97 percent, as high a confidence level as any scientific consensus in man's history, even higher than the scientific consensus on what causes, to our obvious benefit, gravity. We now call it ""The Law of Gravity.\I suggest that we now must embrace ""The Laws of Climate Change. Everyone, from Prince Charles, to the Pope, to NASA's Dr. James Hansen, and here at the Clay Center, Bill Nye the ""Science Guy, to the young emerging entrepreneurs, scientists and engineers who are not shackled with entrenched interests, and now our leadership, recognize that the future of the planet is at stake.\Exxon scientists, who had engaged is serious research about climate change due to fossil fuel-sourced greenhouse gas emissions, reported to their top management in the 1970s that we were at serious risk of overheating the planet Earth. We now know that Exxon management suppressed the reports and mounted a well-funded PR program to deny the science, just as the tobacco companies did telling us smoking was good for your health when they knew the opposite was true.\As reported in ""Carbon Majors, a scientific study revealed that two-thirds of the carbon dioxide emitted during the Industrial Revolution can be traced back to just 90 oil, coal and gas producers. Researcher Rick Heede spent eight years combing through the publicly available data at the heart of the analysis and has just published his findings in the journal Climatic Change.\All that said, I am optimistic that we West Virginians, natives and immigrants like me, can and will embrace the future and move to climate change solutions by transitioning to ""clean and green energy that will benefit all of our communities and citizens.\We must. It is imperative - for the lives of our children, even political deniers' and miners' children and grandchildren - that we accelerate the transition to clean energy.\It will take bold, thoughtful leadership and vision. Yet, some of our politicians still cling to the past and the fantasy that the coal industry can be brought back to its heyday by defunding and/or suing the EPA. What foolishness. What a waste of tax payer dollars that could be spent on progress and job-creating actions instead.\Sen. Joe Manchin recognizes that there are no technically feasible or economical systems commercially available to get to ""clean coal."" Yet, he and other delegates refuse to accept the seriousness of the climate disruption that coal-fired plants and other fossil fuels are causing. They are trying to save a dying industry that is no longer economically competitive, environmentally ethical or morally responsive.\Natural gas is eating coal's lunch and is just as reliable. The legacy external costs of health and environmental damage due to coal are real, and when added to the price of coal, make it clearly too expensive compared to the alternatives, including wind and solar energy.\We must, with an open mind, examine what others are doing and then examine what they are doing that would work here.\It has been widely reported that the solar cell manufacturing and installation industries are one of the fastest growing manufacturing sectors in the world, faster than even cell phone industries! Germany now generates 30 percent of their electricity from renewables, has created 400,000 jobs in the clean energy sector, and has a thousand local cooperatives that ensure community control over energy.\Closer to home, in 2005, the Canadian province of Ontario (formerly one of Arch Coal's largest customers) implemented a program to retire all their coal-fired plants, and completed it in 2014, replacing them with renewable and geothermal systems. Now, all of Canada is free of coal-fired power.\The provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia have joined in a partnership with California to charge a carbon tax to accelerate the transition to clean renewable energy.\British Columbia has the best history of economic growth in all of the provinces of Canada that economists directly attribute to the revenue-neutral carbon tax they introduced in 2008. Today, some of the major and heavily subsidized fossil fuel industries are calling for a carbon tax.\This offering is not ""anti-coal."" It is ""pro-future."" Embracing the transition to renewable energy is a job creating and investment opportunity.\It is undoubtedly going to take a groundswell of citizens to bring our legislators to their economic senses. Like semi-conductors revolutionized the northern California peninsula, let us get aggressive about making the Ohio Valley a center of renewable energy manufacturing industries and create the jobs to embrace the future.\For example, the silicon that is mined and refined here in West Virginia is shipped out of the state to make semiconductors in California and for medical products. Why are we not capturing those manufacturing jobs in West Virginia?\Silicon is just one of several raw materials employed to manufacture solar cells!\So how can an individual citizen step up? Start with checking into WVSUN, wvsun.org, a co-op that is modeled after a nationwide organization successful in arranging excellent pricing for solar installations on homes, churches, commercial buildings and factories. Join and support any of the many organizations, like 350.org or locally, the Citizens Climate Change Lobby, that are offering a unique approach to press for action on carbon emissions.\Let the certainty of change be our economic growth engine, and stop hiding our heads in the coal tipples.\Credit: Allan Tweddle"
146,"WASHINGTON - No matter who wins the 2012 election, the next president will take office as the United States faces vast new opportunities in energy production and profound challenges to environmental protection.\After decades of growing dependence on imported oil, the U.S. is moving to energy self-sufficiency, thanks to greater domestic supplies of oil and natural gas and reduced demand. Coal, which once fired most American power plants, is being edged out by natural gas, renewable energy and stricter efforts to cut pollution - a trend that has touched off bitter political fights.\At the same time, climate change has gone from distant threat to palpable reality, as ice caps shrink, winters shorten and drought spreads. Climatologists and policymakers warn that unless the United States and other industrialized nations move to rein in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by 2020, most aspects of life - from the food chain to the oceans to communicable disease - could be altered, largely for the worse.\With the stakes so high, President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney offer starkly divergent ideas on how to proceed. The split between the candidates on so many energy issues might be traced, in part, to a fundamental disagreement over the reality of climate change. Romney has said he is unsure of it. Obama has called it a ""threat to our children's future.""\Both tout an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy that would utilize everything from coal to wind, but the candidates emphasize different fuels. Romney embraces greater reliance on fossil fuels, including coal - the greatest contributors to climate change. Obama sees a future increasingly tied to renewable energy, like wind and solar.\The Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency has implemented rules to reduce air pollution that will further crimp coal usage. Romney has vowed to repeal those rules.\""The rhetoric of 'all of the above' is the same,"" said Michael A. Levi, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""But the vision is very different.""\Obama's record during the last four years reveals an agenda most analysts expect him to stick to if he gets a second term.\He failed to secure passage of sweeping legislation to address climate change, disappointing many supporters. Nonetheless, he has taken steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants.\The administration also funneled federal funds to renewable energy, helping to bring more alternative sources on line and making the country the leader in clean energy investment. But it has left itself open to political fallout from failures like Solyndra, a solar equipment maker that won $535 million in federal loan guarantees and then went bankrupt.\When Romney was governor of Massachusetts, from 2003 to 2007, he articulated an agenda similar to Obama's current one. Romney's staff included prominent environmentalists who developed a state climate action plan and a regional cap-and-trade system.\In his 2010 book ""No Apology: The Case for American Greatness,"" he wrote: ""I believe that climate change is occurring - the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor.""\But none of that hints at how Romney might govern as president, because he has retreated from those positions. Romney's website makes no mention of the environment or climate change, unlike Obama's. His ideas instead echo congressional Republicans whose narrative during the last four years is that environmental regulations kill jobs.\""Romney is where the Republican Party is,"" said Joshua Freed, head of the clean energy program at Third Way, a centrist Washington think tank.\Romney and Obama vary markedly about the fuels the country should rely on for electricity. Romney has pushed for coal, a cheap and abundant domestic fuel, and he has accused Obama of ""waging a war on coal.""\Obama's campaign rejects that notion, and it has run ads trumpeting the increase in recent years of coal production and jobs in swing states like Ohio. Domestic coal usage is in fact falling, driven mostly by cheaper natural gas prices.\Behind the pro-coal rhetoric, the Obama administration has passed or is considering regulations that would further cut coal use, including reductions in smokestack emissions of carbon dioxide, mercury and other pollutants and limits on mountaintop removal, a controversial mining method.\Romney has pledged to repeal or scale back many of those initiatives, particularly the reductions in carbon dioxide and mercury emissions. ""If Romney's elected, it's not so much what would happen as what wouldn't happen,"" Freed said. ""His plan seeks to cement the status quo at a time when the energy sector is in the midst of huge upheaval.""\The Romney approach would also bolster oil. For instance, Obama highlights significant increases in passenger vehicle fuel economy from 2012 to 2025, almost doubling gas mileage and sharply cutting greenhouse gases. Romney has said he would undo the 2017 to 2025 standards, which he characterizes as onerous and unrealistic. Increased gasoline consumption would help oil companies, but it would undo the progress the country has made toward energy self-sufficiency, analysts say.\Romney would also open more federal lands than Obama has to oil, gas and coal development. ""Under Romney, I have the full expectation that a lot more federal lands will be under production,"" said Jack Gerard, a Romney advisor and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, the main oil lobby.\Obama and Romney overlap in one area: the development of natural gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The domestic energy boom of the last several years stems from the widespread use of fracking to tap oil in North Dakota and gas in Texas, the mid-Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains.\Concerns have been raised about possible water contamination and air pollution from high-volume fracking, which involves injecting millions of gallons of water and sand laced with chemicals deep underground to crack shale formations and unlock oil and gas. So far, the Obama administration has introduced new fracking regulations that independent analysts say would not hinder production. The EPA is also conducting a study of possible environmental effects of fracking, due out after the election, whose findings might lead to new regulations if Obama wins a second term.\But industry has bridled at increased federal oversight of fracking. Romney has said he would hand greater regulatory authority over oil and gas development to the states, which could speed the permitting process but could also lead to lax oversight.\Fossil fuel interests have lined up with Romney. His top energy and economic advisers include the petroleum institute's Gerard; Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm, who is also a major donor; and Jim Talent, a former Missouri senator whose lobbying firm worked for Peabody Coal. Romney would do away with federal subsidies for renewable energy, such as the production tax credit. Obama would do away with long-standing tax breaks for oil and gas companies.\If Obama is re-elected, the question is whether he would take bolder steps to address climate change, such as the introduction of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions.\Conservatives who accept climate science, like former South Carolina Congressman Bob Inglis, think a ""carbon tax"" would be more acceptable to a wider range of people than a complex cap-and-trade system.\Now executive director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative, a Virginia think tank, Inglis sees some signs that Romney might circle back to acceptance of climate change and a willingness to act on it. Some top Romney economic advisers, like Greg Mankiw, have in the past backed a carbon tax. And Romney might have a better chance of getting such a tax passed than Obama: Democrats would probably back any sound climate initiative, while Republicans would probably thwart an Obama effort.\So far, the Romney campaign has given little indication that its approach to global warming might change after Election Day. Said Romney spokesman Ryan Williams, ""Gov. Romney opposes a carbon tax on emissions of carbon dioxide.""\Credit: Neela Banerjee Tribune Washington Bureau"
147,"Editor:\Appalachian Powers decision to use more renewable energy and stop building new coal-fired plants is hard-nosed and forward-looking. As a businessman concerned with his companys profitability and with serving his customers and attracting new ones, Appalachians President Beam sees coal use inexorably decreasing and renewable energy inevitably increasing. He recognizes West Virginias potential for wind and solar energy, which promise job growth and economic benefits. Of course, the climate, environment and public health would benefit, as well.\With the changeable regulatory environment in Washington, congressional action could simplify long-range planning, not only for the electric-power industry, but for the public sector generally. Fortunately, the energy/climate issue is becoming nonpartisan. The bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus has grown to 38 members. One climate solution that would be predictable, simple, fair and compatible with each partys political philosophy is a revenue-neutral carbon tax. A group of influential conservatives recently presented a strong case for one such tax, and several other similar proposals are afloat.\Energy policy also is becoming uncoupled from politics in West Virginia. Democratic Gov. Jim Justice is personally heavily invested in coal and wants the state to burn more of it whereas, according to Beam, the House speaker and Senate president, both Republicans, are willing to consider any suggestions that would bring much-needed jobs to the state.\The Trump administrations promises and policies notwithstanding, West Virginias coal miners will continue to lose jobs. They can and should be retrained for permanent, well-paying, safer and healthier jobs in renewable energy and related industries. That is where the future lies.\Carol Steinhart\Madison, Wis."
148,"The conservative poet and thinker Peter Viereck came up with the best working definition of reality that I've found so far. In a poem called ""Hex,"" he defined it thus:\""It's what, when you don't believe in it, won't go away.""\It's becoming clearer that global climate change might fall into that category.\The Powers That Be in West Virginia, and I'm not referring to the elected ones, have a vested interest in denying or minimizing the reality of it and limiting or delaying actions taken to counter it. The coal that keeps the lights on produces a lot of CO2.\But as powerful as those interests are here, they don't control the whole world or even the whole country. Sooner or later, we're probably going to be looking at significant national legislation to deal with climate change.\It's the reality thing.\Rather than wishing it away, places like West Virginia would be better served if we started thinking and talking now about policy options that would do the least harm to the state, its people and its economy while also limiting the amount of overall damage caused by climate change.\The damage done to the public and environment by carbon emissions is a classical example of what economists call an externality-i.e. a social cost that doesn't show up on the buyer's or seller's bottom line. At their best, markets ""tell the truth"" about prices and costs. But when costs get shifted to others or to the world as a whole, this doesn't happen. It's a common form of market failure.\I know the idea that markets can sometimes fail is a shock for true believers in the cult of the market god, but these things happen. It's the reality thing again.\A likely scenario is that at some point, the United States will get serious about dealing with it, either by imposing a carbon tax or by a cap and trade system, which would limit greenhouse gas outputs and allow companies to exchange carbon emission allowances. If these are well designed, they can ease the impact of these changes on ordinary people and the public.\If we go the cap and trade route, it's important that carbon emission allowances be auctioned off by the federal government rather than simply given away as windfall profits to corporations and that the revenues generated by this be used responsibly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a cap and trade system could generate $50 to $300 billion a year in revenue.\Robert Greenstein and other researchers at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities have done some groundbreaking research on how these resources could be used to strengthen the economic well-being of the country as a whole.\For starters, they recommend that 15 percent of the revenue from a cap and trade auction should be dedicated to compensating energy companies for losses under the new system. That figure is derived from CBO estimates\The people who will be hit the hardest by rising energy costs, however, are low-income Americans. If Congress eventually adopts a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent, energy costs for these families could rise by $750-$950 per year, including home energy, gasoline and other kinds of consumption. But by setting aside as little as 14 percent of the revenues generated by a good climate change policy, these families could receive an energy rebate along the lines of the popular Earned Income Tax Credit.\This would leave around 70 percent of cap and trade revenue for other important purposes, including assisting communities and workers in places like West Virginia affected by these changes. Other potential uses include investing in research and development of alternative energies, providing energy cost assistance to middle-income families and offsetting rising energy costs to federal, state and local budgets.\The old saw that we have to choose between economic well-being and the environment is getting lamer and lamer. As you may have noticed, both are taking a dive right now.\With luck and effort, we can have some of both - or a whole lot of neither."
149," SAM drives a huge SUV, Pierre drives a tiny Citroen. Both agree that for the sake of the environment they must reduce their combined fuel consumption. But who should bear the burden? You might expect Pierre to demand that Sam do most of the adjusting. All that Sam has to do is switch to a smaller but still comfortable car; Pierre's car can't get much smaller. You certainly wouldn't expect to find Sam trying to wriggle out of the bargain, insisting that he be allowed to adopt a tree instead.\ But that, more or less, is why efforts to curb global warming collapsed last week. There's plenty of blame to go around, but the essential problem was that Europeans got fed up with America's unwillingness to reduce its emission of greenhouse gases, even though it is the world's prime source of such gases.\ Why is the United States such a big emitter? Energy use tends to be more or less proportional to gross domestic product, and we have the biggest economy. But that's not the whole story: We release about twice as much carbon dioxide per capita as other advanced countries, even though we don't have anywhere near twice their per capita GDP. The main reason for that disparity is that we have much lower taxes on fuel, especially gasoline. The image of the American filling up his living room on wheels with dollar-a-gallon gasoline while his European counterpart carefully spoons precious petrol into his mini is a caricature, but gets at an essential truth.\ This comparison suggests that it should actually be much easier for the United States to reduce its energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions than it is for Europe. High taxes on fuel have already induced Europeans to do the easy conservation steps; in America, where gasoline is literally cheaper than (bottled) water, we haven't even tried.\ Now it turns out that there are some complicating factors. Some estimates suggest that the cost of meeting international targets for emission reduction would actually be larger for the United States than for Europe, mainly because our economy grows faster, and faster growth increases the demand for energy. Still, one can easily understand European fury at America's refusal to make any serious effort to reduce the amount of carbon it burns.\ But don't blame our negotiators, or for that matter the administration they work for. They had to respect domestic political realities. And what could the United States actually do to reduce its emission of greenhouse gases?\ Any Econ 101 textbook can tell you the answer. If carbon dioxide is deemed to inflict damage on the environment, then the efficient way to resolve the problem is to provide market incentives to burn less carbon. The most straightforward policy would be an across-the- board carbon tax that . . .\ I can't see any point in finishing that sentence. Never mind that even free-market economists favor ""effluent taxes""; never mind that we're not talking about an overall tax increase, that any new tax on carbon could and should be offset by tax cuts elsewhere. In America's current political universe there are too many people who believe that the only good tax is a dead tax for any such proposal to be accepted. Such people aren't a majority, but they do control at least one house of Congress, and it just isn't going to happen.\ In other words, the ultimate reason that the climate talks failed, that global warming will go unchecked, is the power of America's vitriolic anti-tax right.\ Is there any way out of this trap? A decisive political defeat for the rabid right might open a path; but that didn't happen in this election.\ The only alternative would be a Nixon-goes-to-China scenario. It's nice to fantasize that if George W. Bush ends up in the White House he might try to heal the wounds of his dubious triumph by, among other things, taking on his own party over environmental issues. But quite aside from his oil-industry connections and his dismal environmental record in Texas, Bush has said he is not convinced that the scientific evidence for global warming warrants policy action. And somehow I don't expect further evidence to change his mind.\ Maybe future retirees won't have to move to Florida to find warm weather. It's looking like a long, hot century.\ Credit: New York Times"
150,"WASHINGTON - I am an optimist, both by temperament and observation. But I maintain my hopeful outlook partly because I know that less optimistic people will regularly see problems and challenges and sound the alarms - to which we will respond. Pope Francis has issued just such a warning with his encyclical on the environment. The document is eloquent and intelligent, especially in its handling of science. ""Most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity, it says. ""Concentrated in the atmosphere, these gases do not allow the warmth of the sun's rays reflected by the earth to be dispersed in space. That is as lucid a two-sentence description of the mechanism of global warming as I have read.\The encyclical is gloomy. But in fact, there are remarkable changes taking place that could put the planet on a much more sustainable path. You get a sense of them if you read another important report that was issued this week - to much less fanfare than the pope's missive - the International Energy Agency's special report on energy and climate change.\The report points out that in 2014, the global economy grew at 3 percent, but energy-related carbon dioxide emissions stayed flat, the first time this has happened in 40 years. In that same year, renewables accounted for nearly half of all new power generation, and the energy intensity of the global economy dropped by twice as much as it has on average annually over the past decade. With concerted action, we could actually push global emissions downward in the next few years.\How? Well, there is an ongoing revolution taking place in energy technology. Natural gas has replaced coal in many places. The cost of solar cells has plummeted, leading to their widespread use. Cars, buildings and machines are becoming much more energy efficient. And over the horizon, one can see progress in batteries, nuclear power and biofuels, which could collectively produce a new energy ecosystem.\But innovation alone isn't what is spurring progress, and it won't be enough. We need a revolution in public policy as well. Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defense Fund, points out that most of the improvements that have been made in technology and efficiency would not have happened without rules and laws. And a series of smart policies - that are not very costly or disruptive - could dramatically accelerate the shift to a cleaner economy.\First, stop doing harm. Even Bjorn Lomborg, the skeptic about many efforts to tackle global warming, argues for a reduction in the massive, market-distorting subsidies for fossil fuels. The IEA estimates that in 2014, these subsidies globally amounted to $510 billion, about four times those provided to renewable energy.\""We still have a long way to go on energy efficiency, Krupp notes. ""Buildings waste 30 percent of their energy. And a dollar spent in this area usually yields two to three dollars in energy savings in return. He argues that solar power could become far more widespread if governments were not as beholden to utility companies and their phalanx of lobbyists. ""There are lots of nonmarket barriers to renewables, placed at the behest of the established players, he said.\Natural gas is better than coal, but its production, transport and use release significant amounts of methane, which has much worse effects on the climate than carbon dioxide. The good news is that serious studies have found that these emissions could be reduced relatively cheaply with new regulations. President Obama has called for nearly halving oil and gas methane emissions from 2012 levels by 2025. Krupp points out that if the same is done globally, that would have the same impact on the climate over the next 20 years as would shutting down 1,000 coal-fired power plants.\The smartest new policy would be the simplest, and one supported by many die-hard free marketeers, like the Reaganite Republican, former Treasury Secretary George Shultz: a carbon tax - effectively putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions to encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies. This seems impossible to imagine - yet earlier this month, several major oil companies in Europe came out in favor of a price on carbon, whether through a tax or an emissions trading system as those used in California and Europe.\Technology and policy innovations are happening, just not on the scale that they need to. That's why the pope's warnings are so useful and important - even to an optimist like me.\Credit: Fareed Zakaria"
151," KYOTO, Japan - The Kyoto global warming pact went into force today, seven years after it was negotiated, imposing limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases scientists blame for rising world temperatures, melting glaciers and rising oceans.\ The landmark agreement, negotiated in Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto in 1997 and ratified by 140 nations, targets carbon dioxide and five other gases that can trap heat in the atmosphere, and are believed to be behind rising global temperatures that many scientists say are disrupting weather patterns.\ The United States, the world's largest emitter of such gases, has refused to ratify the agreement, saying it would harm the economy and is flawed by the lack of restrictions on emissions by emerging economies China and India.\ ""We have been calling on the United States to join. But the country that is the world's biggest emitter has not joined yet, and that is regrettable,"" Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda, told reporters.\ Environmental officials, gathered in the convention hall where the accord was adopted, hailed the protocol as a historic first step in the battle against global warming and urged the world to further strengthen safeguards against greenhouse gases.\ ""Today is a day of celebration and also a day to renew our resolve ... to combat global warming,"" said Hiroshi Ohki, former Japanese environment minister and president of the conference that negotiated the protocol.\ Australia, the only other developed nation besides the United States not to join, defended that decision, with Environment Minister Ian Campbell saying the country was nonetheless on track to cut emissions by 30 percent.\ ""Until such time as the major polluters of the world including the United States and China are made part of the Kyoto regime, it is next to useless and indeed harmful for a country such as Australia to sign up,"" Australian Prime Minister John Howard said in Canberra.\ The Kyoto agreement was delayed by the requirement that countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions must ratify it. That goal was reached last year - nearly seven years after the pact was negotiated - with Russia's approval.\ In Japan, a tireless supporter of the pact, the enactment was being met with a mixture of pride and worry that the world's second- largest economy is unprepared to meet its emissions reduction targets.\ Japan planned to celebrate the enactment today at the convention hall where the accord was negotiated in December 1997, with speeches and a panel discussion among environmental experts and activists.\ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan planned to send a message. The Kyoto pact is an adjunct to the 1992 U.N. treaty on climate change.\ The Kyoto targets vary by region: The European Union is committed to cutting emissions to 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012; the United States agreed to a 7 percent reduction before President Bush denounced the pact in 2001.\ That proposal was opposed by the U.S. Senate so adamantly that the protocol was never submitted for ratification by then-President Bill Clinton. Bush then pulled the United States out of the pact in March 2001, less than three months after taking office, saying the Kyoto pact would have cost far too much and exacerbated an already bothersome energy problem for the world's largest consumer of energy from fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum.\ White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Tuesday that ""we are still learning"" about the science of climate change. In the meantime, McClellan said, ""We have made an unprecedented commitment to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions in a way that continues to grow our economy.""\ The Bush administration's stance has since drawn fire from environmental experts, who say it is ignoring scientific consensus about global warming, and that government reports have been censoring views not in line with its politics.\ Japan is struggling to find ways to meet its obligations. A report this month by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed that 11 of 30 top Japanese industries - steel and power among them - risked failing to reach targets unless they take drastic steps.\ Officials made solemn pledges Tuesday to fulfill Japan's treaty requirement to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by 6 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.\ The Cabinet will draw up concrete plans by May, Environment Minister Yuriko Koike said.\ Some officials are pondering a ""carbon tax"" to punish polluters - a move opposed by business - while others favor expansion of nuclear power and promotion of energy-saving technologies.\ Japan also has been especially active in carbon trading - a system under which governments have allocated carbon dioxide quotas to industrial facilities. Those which emit less gas can sell the ""credit"" to other companies who emit too much.\ Makoto Katagiri, whose Natsource Japan is acting as a credit broker between Japanese and foreign companies, estimated in a study for the World Bank that Japan bought 41 percent of the carbon credits on the international market last year.\ ""From this figure, you can imagine how serious the Japanese companies (are),"" Katagiri said.\ ---\ On the Net:\ U.N.

152,"WASHINGTON - When the Senate takes up legislation next month to confront global warming, environmental groups will have some fervent new allies: evangelicals and other Christian activists.\Concerned about what they see as a moral and biblical issue, religious groups from the right are joining with environmental organizations from the left in supporting strong measures to fight global warming.\Some Christian leaders are using the clout they have built up in Republican circles to lobby conservatives in Congress to support regulations on greenhouse-gas emissions.\""When evangelicals speak, Republicans listen,"" said Richard Cizik, vice president of government affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals. ""And Republicans, frankly, are listening to what we're saying.""\For many religious groups, global warming isn't a political or environmental issue. It's a threat to God's creation.\""It's not a blue state, red state, scientific, or even a green issue,"" said Cizik, whose organization represents 45,000 churches. ""It's a spiritual issue. And that, above all else, is why evangelical Christians should be concerned.""\The once-tiny Christian environmental movement began quickly accelerating in 2006, when 85 prominent evangelical leaders signed on to the Evangelical Climate Initiative calling for action on global warming. That number has since climbed to more than 100.\""It's a bit out of the ordinary for evangelicals to be involved with this issue,"" said Jim Jewell, chief operating officer of the Evangelical Environmental Network, a group that educates and mobilizes Christians on environmental issues. ""The evangelical involvement with climate has kind of shaken the political landscape a bit.""\In March, dozens of prominent Southern Baptist leaders called on followers to acknowledge human contributions to global warming and demanded bold action to address climate change.\They said the church's cautious approach was ""too timid"" in promoting stewardship of God's creation.\""To abandon these issues to the secular world is to shirk from our responsibility ..."" they declared. ""The time for timidity regarding God's creation is no more.""\Jonathan Merritt, the 25-year-old seminary student from Atlanta who organized the Baptist environmental declaration, said younger Baptists in particular were relieved to see church leaders take a bold public stance.\Young religious voters aren't abandoning opposition to abortion and gay marriage - issues usually associated with the religious right - but seem more willing than their parents to look at a broader spectrum of political positions, Merritt said.\""Younger Christians are finding it more pressing to live a life that is consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ ... rather than toe a party line,"" Merritt said.\The Rev. Larry Rice, director of the New Life Evangelistic Center in St. Louis, has been an outspoken advocate for global-warming legislation. The left-leaning minister said Missouri is ""in the dark age when it comes to renewable energy"" and has argued for years that Christians have an obligation to protect the environment.\""There's an ethical principle that runs the whole thread of Christianity here,"" Rice said. ""You can't just say that you love your neighbors as yourself and yet be totally indifferent to how your use of fossil fuels is directly contributing to global warming around the world.""\Evangelicals will join an army of lobbyists and lawmakers now suiting up for battle over the most sweeping environmental legislation in years, which the Senate intends to debate early in June.\The bill, sponsored by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman, I-Conn., and John W. Warner, R-Va., would create a program known as ""cap-and-trade"" to limit harmful carbon dioxide emissions.\Under the bill, companies, individuals and government agencies would see their greenhouse-gas emissions capped at an annually decreasing level, with the goal of setting emissions in 2050 at 30 percent of their 2005 levels.\Entities that come in below their cap could sell their remaining credits to others that pollute beyond their limit. The effect is a sort of carbon tax that encourages pollution reduction.\The bill is already the subject of intense political gamesmanship. Some business lobbyists fear the costs of complying with pollution caps and the penalties for exceeding them. Some environmental groups say the standards are too weak.\Backers of the bill hope support from the religious right will help pressure some Republicans to support the legislation.\""There's a good deal of interaction with folks at traditionally religious organizations, who have joined with environmental organizations to begin work on this,"" said David Sandretti, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental interest group.\As the action unfolds on Capitol Hill, Missouri's two Senators are likely to play important roles.\Sen. Kit Bond, a Republican, has for years been one of the loudest critics of the science behind global warming and is a key opponent of the Lieberman-Warner bill.\The Environmental Defense Fund identified Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., as one of 10 ""Senators to watch."" McCaskill is undecided on the cap-and-trade bill, saying she favors the concept but worried about how it might affect utility costs for poor people.\McCaskill's staff has discussed cap-and-trade with religious leaders urging her to support the initiative.\""We're paying special attention to Senator McCaskill,"" said the Rev. Jim Ball, a national spokesman for the Evangelical Climate Initiative.\McCaskill's staff has also talked about the issue with religious leaders working with the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, a broad coalition of religious groups that includes Catholic, Jewish and other organizations.\""This is far and away the single highest environmental priority for the American religious community,"" said Paul Gorman, the Partnership's executive director. ""There's isn't a single state in the union where people of faith and religious leaders aren't communicating their support for this bill.""\Credit: St. Louis Post-Dispatch"

He believes the merits of his argument combined with the force of his personality can ultimately bring skeptics and opponents over to his way of thinking. \MoJo is West Virginia's salesman-in-chief.\Thursday, he took his pitch for coal to the White House. He and governors from a dozen other energy states met behind closed doors with President Obama, Vice President Biden and top members of his administration to talk about the nation's energy strategy.\Manchin's pitch: Coal is crucial to the long-term energy needs of the country. Cap-and-trade will be ruinous for West Virginia's economy. West Virginia needs the EPA to be clearer about rules for mountaintop removal mining.\""It was the most honest, frank, respectful dialogue I've ever had at that level,"" Manchin told me on Metronews Talkline a day after the meeting.\Manchin appeared hopeful Obama and his people had heard him.\But did they?\The president came out of the meeting with a commitment to clean coal technology and the construction of five to 10 carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects by 2016.\That sounds like a small carrot, which is attached to a considerably larger stick.\That stick is cap-and-trade legislation; Pass cap-and-trade or a carbon tax and there will be a few billion for clean coal.\The same day Manchin and the other governors were meeting with President Obama, Carol Browner, the administration's ""Climate Czar"" was touting carbon taxes to representatives of renewable energy companies.\The message is clear: Tax carbon-based fuels such as coal and oil and use the money to prop up green energy firms.\The New York Times reports that Browner used the words ""cap"" and ""price signal"" several times, and told the group that President Obama is not backing away from his commitment to a carbon trading system.\Browner said carbon caps would reduce ""dangerous pollutants that contribute to global warming"" and create jobs in a new green economy.\Not in West Virginia, however.\A study by the WVU Bureau of Business and Economic Research released last month found that the House of Representatives' version of cap-and-trade would cost the state almost 23,000 jobs and $1.8 billion in gross domestic product by 2030.\Browner wasn't alone.\The Times reported that Undersecretary of Energy Kristina Johnson told conferees: ""Let's not give up the fight"" for a ""comprehensive energy and climate bill.""\I'm not sure exactly what Manchin was told by President Obama and others in the administration during their meeting, but we do know what the people in charge of the president's environment and energy policies are saying when they're not locked in a room of coal state governors.\Their views should be enough to dampen even Gov.

156,"New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood sued ExxonMobil on Wednesday, accusing the oil giant of defrauding investors about the financial risks of climate change and lying about how it was calculating potential carbon costs.\Unlike other lawsuits against big oil companies alleging the concealment of scientific studies confirming climate change, the New York lawsuit accuses ExxonMobil of assuring its investors that it was using a theoretical price for carbon in evaluating projects when in fact it often used a different price or none at all.\The lawsuit said that ""this fraud reached the highest levels of the company, including former Exxon chief executive and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who the lawsuit said knew for years that the company ""was deviating from public statements and was using two sets of calculations about future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.\""The attorney general is effectively charging them with keeping two sets of books - one for internal purposes one for external, said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis, which does research on energy and the environment. ""The result is a distortion of the value of the company.\ExxonMobil spokesman Scott J. Silvestri called the lawsuit meritless. ""The New York attorney general's office doubled down on its tainted, meritless investigation by filing a complaint against ExxonMobil, he said. ""These baseless allegations are a product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing.\The lawsuit says that ExxonMobil's dual accounting calculations had a huge impact on the purported value of the company. It says that the company's failure to apply proxy costs to 14 of its oil sands projects in Alberta, Canada, resulted in undercounting future greenhouse gas expenses by more than $25 billion over the lifetime of the project. It also said that the oil giant did not apply any proxy costs to the company's reserves at Cold Lake, a major oil sands asset in Alberta, resulting in an overestimation of its projected economic life by 28 years.\Earlier lawsuits against big oil companies alleged that they had concealed internal and private studies confirming climate change and human contributions to it., but lawsuits seeking damages have been thrown out of court.\ExxonMobil has also taken small steps on climate change. It recently contributed $100 million to a fund that provides money to new technologies that would slash greenhouse gases. And it gave $1 million to a prestigious group of economists and former public officials that backs a carbon tax starting at $40 a ton.\The New York attorney general's suit zeros in on the company's financial reporting.\""Exxon told investors that it accounted for the risk of governmental regulation of climate change by applying a proxy cost' of carbon, the attorney general's office said in a statement. ""Exxon told its investors that it used that proxy cost in its investment decisions, corporate planning, estimations of company oil and gas reserves, evaluations of whether its long-term assets remain viable, and estimations of future demand for oil and gas.\Yet, the complaint alleges, ""Exxon frequently did not apply the proxy costs as represented in its business activities. Instead, in many cases Exxon applied much lower proxy costs or no proxy cost at all.\The lawsuit seeks an order prohibiting Exxon from misrepresenting its climate calculations and requiring it to correct its misrepresentations, ""in other words, to tell investors the truth.\The suit also asks the court to award damages and restitution associated with the alleged fraud.\Credit: By Steven Mufson The Washington Post"
157," DAILY MAIL STAFF\ A forum to examine West Virginia's role in addressing the nation's energy problems evolved into a shouting match today when a local activist protested that environmentalists had been left off the panel.\ Environmental activist Julian Martin stood up in the audience at the Riverside High School Auditorium to demand time on the program after he heard comments he took to be insulting to environmentalists from Nick Carter, chairman of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce.\ ""Those who fail to offer constructive and realistic ideas . . . should be left behind,"" Carter said. ""Get real, get involved or get out of the way.""\ Martin called Carter's remarks ""a diatribe"" and asked Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., ""Do we get to speak or do we just get to listen to these insults?""\ When Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, suggested that Martin should sit down and let the program proceed. Martin replied, ""I'm not talking to you. Go back to Texas.""\ Barton then threatened to call the sheriff and have Martin removed from the building.\ Martin replied, ""Go ahead and call the sheriff.""\ Capito, who hosted the forum, urged Martin to be patient.\ ""We have a lot of really respected people who have a lot to say,"" she said.\ But a woman from the audience yelled, ""This, we feel, is a whitewash.""\ Capito then agreed to permit Martin to speak at the end of the program. When he got his turn, Martin said he had just returned from Booger Hollow where many people's homes were destroyed by last week's flood.\ ""Nobody has mentioned the flood,"" he said. ""It's like the gorilla that's sitting here.""\ Martin blamed mountaintop removal mining for causing much of the flooding and said that mining method has already destroyed 400,000 acres of mountaintops in West Virginia.\ ""I am not an out-of-state environmental extremists,"" he said. ""It's much more environmentally extreme to take the tops of mountains off.""\ The West Virginia Energy Forum was scheduled for the same day that the Bush administration is holding forums on energy policy across the nation and Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to hold a town meeting in Pittsburgh.\ Barton, who described himself as a good friend of President George W. Bush, predicted that an energy bill would pass the House of Representatives by the end of the month.\ ""I think this is going to be the energy Congress,"" he said.\ United Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts said Barton and Capito should get some credit for holding the forum near the coalfields and not in Washington, D.C., where there would be less access for the public. But he was disappointed that fewer than 100 people had shown up for the forum and suggested that more public notice should have been issued.\ Roberts said the nation needs an energy policy because it depends too much on oil from the Middle East, which he called an unstable region of the world.\ ""We have not had an energy policy at all since Jimmy Carter left the White House,"" he said. ""If we have had one, I'm not aware of what it was.""\ Roberts said he was also concerned about carbon taxes, which the Economic Policy Institute and the Center for Sustainable Economy are proposing as a means to reduce pollution from coal and other carbon- based fuels.\ ""If a carbon tax is passed, coal miners are finished,"" he said.\ The union issued a written statement saying carbon taxes ""would virtually eliminate employment in the coal-mining industry.""\ Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, agreed with Roberts that the nation has lacked an energy policy since the Carter administration but said Bush would change that.\ ""This president has an energy plan that protects people's jobs,"" he said. ""Coal is no longer a four-letter word in Washington.""\ Pat Esposito, chairman of Gov. Bob Wise's energy task force, said Wise wants the task force to put together a 20-year plan to move West Virginia into the forefront of the nation's energy policy.\ ""We can have good paying jobs and a clean environment, but it will take investment in technology and research,"" he said.\ Writer Jim Wallace can be reached at 348-4819 or by e-mail at jimw@dailymail.com."
158,"Thousands of Chinese are fleeing to the United States. We are not talking about impoverished peasants hiding in cargo containers. We're talking about millionaires flying first class and buying condos in the choicest ZIP codes. A big reason for this relocation, real estate agents say, is a desire for America's clean air, as opposed to China's suffocating smog. \Welcome to the new world of environmental immigration. These are not the ""huddled masses"" immortalized on the Statue of Liberty's poem, but they are - quite literally - ""yearning to breathe free.""\One can see the point of leaving China if you have the resources. Rust-colored toxic wastes choke its rivers. Sooty air makes eyes itch. And public health crises in some industrial towns have reached the level that they're being called ""cancer villages."" Who wants to expose the family to that if you can live under Boston's blue skies and in close proximity to the select U.S. universities you want your kids to attend anyway.\About a quarter of recent buyers for Boston's top luxury condos have been foreign investors, especially from China and other parts of Asia. A local entrepreneur, Patty Chen, runs a soup-to-nuts relocation service, American Asia Business Tour Group-Boston, helping out with immigration visas, real estate services, and advice on schools and neighborhoods.\Manhattan has experienced a similar rush of Chinese buyers. Michael Chen at the brokerage firm Bond New York cites their preference for New York's fresh air and ""better family and work/life balance."" Guess it's all relative.\How bad is the pollution back in China? A recent study published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found that Chinese living in their country's heavily industrial north die on average five years earlier than those living in the south. Reliance on coal-fired heating and factories is largely to blame.\China has been the world's third-most popular tourist destination, after France and the United States. But the number of visitors there fell 5 percent this year. The China National Tourism Administration cites the smog as a big factor keeping people away. Beijing saw a steeper, 15 percent, drop in foreign travelers. More and more businesspeople are reportedly trying to get moved out of Beijing for health reasons.\For decades, corrupt Communist Party leaders have squandered their natural heritage in their push to create jobs - and stay in power. The policy has also enriched their families and cronies feasting off the big, dirty industrial machine. But now environmental squalor is beginning to be bad for business - as well as stirring social unrest, which is about time.\The government has started sponsoring studies on ways to lessen pollution, both the noxious type you breathe and the invisible planet-warming gases from the same sources. Proposals include a carbon tax on fossil fuels and a national carbon credit market. Sound familiar?\Environmental segregation is not unknown in the United States. Affluent precincts in this country maintain pristine surroundings, while poorer ones often get the smokestacks, waste facilities and lax regulations.\But Americans never let things reach the point that their rich citizens immigrated in massive numbers to cleaner countries. And to their credit, Americans have accepted the loss of some competitive advantage in global manufacturing as a necessary price to pay for protecting our natural surroundings.\The alarm is sounding for China's elite to also address the trade-off between explosive economic growth and environmental degradation. Jobs versus early death should be a topic for national debate.\You wonder whether China's environment would have been allowed to get so putrid if rich Chinese had to gasp the same air as the toilers.

159,"Sen. Joe Manchin is joining with one of the Senate's strongest advocates for action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution to seek what Manchin calls ""common ground solutions to address climate change, but also protect West Virginia's coal industry. On Wednesday, Manchin, D-W.Va., staged a floor discussion with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., to push their effort and promote the notion that, while climate change is happening, the nation is also likely to continue relying on fossil fuels for much of its energy for decades to come.\""We're going to fix this together, Manchin said during the discussion, known in the Senate as a ""colloquy.\Whitehouse, who has delivered 72 straight weekly Senate floor speeches urging strong action on global warming, told Manchin and a C-SPAN audience, ""Our generation will be judged by whether we were responsible in dealing with climate change, whether we listened and whether we led.\The Manchin-Whitehouse effort comes three weeks after the Obama administration announced its latest major effort to fight climate change: a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal to require electric power plants to cut emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide by 30 percent.\At the time, Whitehouse praised EPA for proposing ""smart, sensible limits that will put our nation on a better path, economically and on a better path environmentally. Manchin criticized the agency proposal, saying it ""does little to address the global problem with global solutions.\During their discussion on Wednesday, neither mentioned the EPA proposal. Instead, they highlighted their agreement on the fact that the climate is changing, and offered examples from their home states to prove it.\Whitehouse explained that temperature measurements show Narragansett Bay is getting warmer, and that sea levels along Rhode Island's coast are rising. Manchin said West Virginia data shows ""substantial climate changes, with recent years continuing to be warmer and wetter.\During the discussion, Manchin depicted climate change as a problem driven more by the world's large population than by the reliance on fossil energy that drove the industrial revolution in Europe and the United States or on society's continuing choices about energy.\""There's no doubt that 7 billion people have impacted our world's climate, Manchin said. ""Those who deny that, I believe, are wrong.\Manchin also argued that fossil fuels - especially coal - are destined to remain ""a vital part of our energy mix for decades to come, and Whitehouse agreed fossil fuels ""will be part of America's fuel mix for decades.\Also, Manchin highlighted the fact that China is responsible for roughly half of the 8 billion tons of coal burned globally every year, saying other nations plan to continue to use ever-larger amounts of coal and that the U.S. needs to be a leading developer of technologies to capture the carbon dioxide emissions from plants here and across the world.\Echoing industry lobby group themes, Manchin argued coal provided the bulk of the increased power needed during severe storms last winter. Whitehouse responded with data that showed that power outages caused by climate change-related severe weather events are already on the rise and costing the economy billions of dollars. ""Addressing climate change is also important in protecting grid reliability, Whitehouse said.\Manchin touted West Virginia's alternative energy portfolio requirement for utilities, without mentioning that the legislation - passed when he was governor - allows power companies to meet state mandates even if they use only coal.\Praising alternative energy sources, Manchin noted the development of wind energy in West Virginia. Whitehouse called for Congress to continue tax credits that help promote wind energy, a move that Manchin has said he opposes.\Whitehouse said he favors creation of a ""carbon tax that would force the nation's economy to take the impacts of greenhouse emissions into account. Manchin said he ""adamantly opposes that idea, but said he wants the tax code to be used to help industry develop carbon capture and storage, or CCS, technologies.\The only specific policy proposal appeared to be Manchin's call for the U.S. Department of Energy to follow through on plans for loan guarantees for coal-related projects that advance CCS efforts. Whitehouse agreed that he would work with Manchin to convince the Obama administration to accelerate those programs.\Manchin agreed that he would visit Rhode Island to see the impacts of climate change on the environment and on the state's commercial fishing industry. Whitehouse said he would come to West Virginia to tour a power plant and talk to coal miners.\""We believe we could both learn more about those different perspectives, Whitehouse said.\Reach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.com or 304-348-1702.\Credit: Ken Ward Jr. Staff writer"
160,"Rick Wilson's op-ed ""More leadership, less posturing on Sunday (Aug. 31) is right on. He raises good questions. I have a few more. There is a total lack of leadership in West Virginia dedicated to the reality that a coal dominated future will not return and not be there for West Virginians much longer. None of the leadership is contemplating, let alone planning for, a diverse energy economy in which retrained miners can have safe clean jobs.\1. Why not? As coal declines, due as Rick and so many others have clearly documented, to economic forces, coal's total cost is uncompetitive with all the cleaner alternatives.\2. Is there really a ""War on Coal? Ranting about the EPA, (whose mandate was confirmed by the Roberts' U.S. Supreme Court, stating it has the legal authority and it is the obligation of the EPA to address climate change), is disingenuous at best.\3. Why sue the EPA when they are backed by the Supreme Court? Sen. Byrd recognized the trends before he left us, and Sen. Manchin is showing some minimal signs of accepting the fact that the true economics of cleaner safer alternatives to coal are certain to continue to drive it down on a death spiral. It did for asbestos in the last century.\4. Can we not learn from that parallel example? Coal and its added legacy costs of health care, documented higher cancer and premature death rates near MTR operations, and the horrific environmental damages like the MCHM spill, and multiple coal waste spills, to say nothing of poisoning the planet with greenhouse gases make coal-fired power too costly in reality.\5. Is your health and mine, and that of our children, our grandchildren and the planet not more important than the coal company's profits? Solar energy is now being generated at $0.05/KW elsewhere in the world, while we are paying $0.09 /KW here in ""low cost energy West Virginia.\6. Why are we so opposed to solar energy, especially when one of the basic raw materials for PV Cells is silicon mined and refined right here in West Virginia?\But the transition to renewables is happening in jurisdictions that have a clear vision of a brighter day with clean renewable energy. Germany has less available sun than West Virginia, but has shown leadership in creating incentives for citizens to embrace and install renewable energy. As a result, it has created 135,000 new jobs by doing so. Last year, it has been recorded that on several days they generated 70 percent of their energy by renewables and are on track to achieve a consistent annual average of 50 percent by 2020.\7. Why is the West Virginia leadership ignoring these global trends and economic opportunities?\Germany originally had hoped to achieve a 20 percent level by 2040, but by offering citizens incentives and choice, their progress has surpassed their modest plans.\8. Would West Virginians not embrace such incentives?\Revenue neutral carbon taxes are also proving their value. British Columbia, a mountainous mineral rich mining province of Canada has had an economic boom that is now documented and directly attributed to implementing a carbon tax.\9. Why is the leadership opposed to proven economic policies that create jobs and clean up our environment.?\West Virginia leadership, including the Legislature, have denied, even removed a pilot program of incentives called net metering.\I have a friend in Arizona who has a ZERO cost of electricity in that hot climate because he has a 20-year lease with a solar installation company who paid for the installation on his house. It sells the excess power back to the utility, and will grant him title to the solar array at the end of the lease. There was no money up front. His lease mirrors his pre-installation electric bill, and is now frozen at that rate for 20 years.\10. How many would like such a deal?\Well, it's not yet available in West Virginia thanks to the leadership and Legislature.\Protecting coal company profits and their political funds is all the current leadership is doing. They are not thinking about planning for the future by retraining displaced miners, or giving people a choice for better health, only preserving their political jobs.\Ask them during this election cycle, ""Where is their vision for beyond coal?\Tweddle is an engineer in Charleston.\Credit: Allan Tweddle"
161,"WASHINGTON - How is it possible that BP chief executive Tony Hayward hasn't been fired? At this point, how can anyone believe a word the man says? If he told me my mother loves me, I'd want a second source. \Hayward has apologized for his one lapse of candor - the now-famous whine last Sunday that ""I'd like my life back."" It must be a nice life indeed: According to Forbes, Hayward's total compensation from BP in 2009 was about $4.6 million. The Louisiana fishermen who've been put out of work by the oil spill are accustomed to getting by on considerably less. In a Facebook posting, Hayward said his callous words ""don't represent how I feel about this tragedy, and certainly don't represent the hearts of the people of BP.""\Within hours, though, Hayward's foot was firmly lodged in his mouth yet again. The effort to contain the oil and keep it away from the Gulf Coast has been ""very successful,"" he told the Financial Times. ""Considering how big this has been, very little has got away from us.""\This sunny assessment came as television networks broadcast images of oil-soaked Louisiana marshes, where hazmat-suited workers - who said they were under orders from BP not to talk to the media, on pain of getting fired - were trying to sop up the mess with what looked like rags, as if this were a gargantuan kitchen mishap. Meanwhile, mousse-like clumps of ""weathered"" oil were being washed onto beaches in Alabama, and authorities in Florida were watching the approach of a menacing, oily sheen. Scientists have not even begun to assess the potential long-term effects of the oil spill on human health, marine life and coastal ecology. Carol Browner, the president's chief adviser on energy and the environment, said that the Deepwater Horizon incident is already the worst environmental disaster in United States history.\Give yourself another pat on the back, Tony.\Adm. Thad Allen, who is directing the response effort, is a nice guy - in terms of his public handling of BP, too nice. On Thursday, as BP proceeded with its latest attempt to cap the flow, Allen praised the company for providing several different camera views of the action on the sea floor. But for weeks, BP refused to make public any television images of the oil leak, and relented only under pressure from U.S. officials.\Hayward's statements about the effort to plug the well have been consistently unreliable, and it hardly matters whether he's being deliberately misleading or just overly optimistic. The giant containment dome was going to work; it didn't. The second, much smaller containment dome would do the job; it was never even deployed. The ""top kill"" procedure was surely going to stop the flow, and early indications, according to Hayward, showed it was succeeding. Yet oil industry veterans such as T. Boone Pickens said the top kill was a long shot at best, and they were right.\And as for those giant underwater oil plumes that scientists and journalists keep discovering? Hayward denies they exist. His position is that of a philanderer caught in the act by an irate spouse: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?""\Since the explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig six weeks ago, BP's stock has lost more than a third of its value. Two ratings firms, Fitch and Moody's, have downgraded the company's long-term debt, and estimates of what it will finally cost BP to stop the leak and clean up its mess range from $3 billion to $30 billion. All this happened on Hayward's watch.\Somebody, please, give the man his life back.\But once that's done, let's turn our ire on the real villains. This exercise will require a mirror.\An accident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout was bound to happen sooner or later. There are nearly 4,000 oil rigs off the Gulf Coast, and those pumping most of the crude are in deep waters - where, as we now know, state-of-the-art safety procedures are inadequate. President Obama's moratorium on deep-water drilling will last only long enough for some sort of technological band-aid to be devised. Then we'll crank up the drills once again.\We know that our dependence on oil is ultimately ruinous, yet we refuse to take measures - a meaningful carbon tax, for example - to ease it. Long after Tony Hayward answers for his sins, we'll be paying for our own.\Robinson is a columnist for The Washington Post."
162,"Coal will continue to be a major energy source for the next 30 years or more as the nation and world transition to the energy of the future, and leaders must find a balance between the economy and the environment, Gov. Joe Manchin said Monday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event. \Coal-producing states such as West Virginia have been essential in building the nation over the past hundred years, Manchin said, and he also acknowledged that they have contributed to pollution at the same time.\""We always say we've done the heavy lifting and we haven't complained,"" Manchin said during his keynote speech at the chamber's Institute for 21st Century Energy luncheon in Washington, D.C. His speech was broadcast live on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Web site.\""We probably, in the mining and the burning of coal to provide the energy this nation needs, have probably polluted more than most other states.""\However, ""we built the greatest nation the world has ever known,"" Manchin added.\While Manchin said that does not defend the right to pollute, he said fixing the problem should include finding value in waste products such as carbon dioxide, a major byproduct in the burning of coal.\West Virginia already has made strides toward cleaner air, including through capturing and neutralizing sulfur dioxide from smoke stacks to form gypsum, a material used in wallboard, Manchin said.\""Who would have ever thought we would have found value for a waste product?"" he said.\But more needs to be done, he said.\He questioned the credit system proposed in the cap-and-trade portion of national climate change legislation working its way through Congress that would limit the amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. The proposed cap-and-trade policy would allow companies to trade or sell allowances for such emissions.\Cap-and-trade costs could increase coal prices tremendously, Manchin said, adding that money collected through cap and trade or carbon tax should be directed toward new research.\""Why not identify credits right and fix the problem?"" Manchin said. ""Unless you just need the money.""\The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce also was fighting for more balance regarding climate change legislation, said Amanda Pasdon, director of business development and investment. Pasdon attended the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's event Monday.\""With the current legislation it would drive down our industrial jobs because it would increase the cost of electricity,"" Pasdon said.\West Virginia chamber officials have estimated that the proposed climate change bill could cost as many as 3 million production jobs in the United States, she said.\Meanwhile, Manchin questioned what would happen if green jobs fail to follow because the cost of energy is so great that companies producing windmills and solar panels, for example, locate off shore or in other countries with more competitive costs, such as China.\""I got a double whammy,"" Manchin said.\""You've not only lost the good jobs that we did have,"" he said during an interview after the speech. ""We haven't attracted the new green jobs that we hoped that we would because of the high cost of energy.""\West Virginia should be on the forefront in finding a valued use for carbon dioxide, Manchin said.\He mentioned a dedication earlier this month for a pilot plant at Dow Chemical in South Charleston that will collect carbon dioxide from a coal and natural gas-fueled boiler through a joint effort with Alstom Power.\Manchin also noted the state's first commercial demonstration of carbon capture planned for late October at American Electric Power's Mountaineer Plant in New Haven.\""We are moving forward and we're still very, very aggressive in our approach to how we find that balance,"" Manchin said.\Manchin said he has been invited along with some bipartisan governors to talk about climate change at the White House later this year.\""The president and this administration has had a very open door policy,"" Manchin said.\Crossing party lines to quickly find the best results is important when working with other governors, Manchin said.\""I'm CEO of a company called West Virginia,"" Manchin said during his speech. ""If I find another CEO that's had some success, whether it be in education or health care, I call them - I don't really look if it was an R (Republican) or a D (Democrat).""\He also praised President Obama for his efforts to address education challenges, and Manchin talked about his own push for year-round schools and more concentrated subject matter.\""Most of this country is still educating on an agrarian calendar,"" Manchin said. ""I always ask parents, 'Do kids help you do all the planting? Did they help tend to the crops? Did they do the harvesting ... canning and curing the meat?' That's the cycle of education we're still in.\""When is the last time you got a three-month vacation?"" Manchin added.\He recalled that as a student he had a parent with him all the time during summer break.\""That doesn't happen today,"" Manchin said. ""Families have changed.""\Because of the long summer break teachers must spend a lot of time in the fall reviewing what students forgot when they went home, he said.\""We seem to be scared of trying anything different,"" Manchin said after the speech. ""And we're going to watch the whole world pass us by.""\Contact writer Michelle Saxton at michelle.saxton@dailymail.com or 304-348-4843.\Credit: DAILY MAIL CAPITOL REPORTER"
163," TOKYO - Two centuries after the dawn of the industrial age, the world today took its first concerted step to roll back the emission of ""greenhouse gases"" believed linked to climate change with the enactment of the Kyoto global warming pact.\ The agreement, negotiated in Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto in 1997 and ratified by 140 nations, calls on 35 industrialized countries to rein in the release of carbon dioxide and five other gases from the burning of oil and coal and other processes.\ Its impact, however, will be limited by the absence of the United States, the world's leader in greenhouse gas emissions.\ Proponents say the stakes are high: the gases are believed to trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to rising global temperatures that are melting glaciers, raising ocean levels and threatening dramatic and potentially damaging climate change in the future.\ ""The tools for keeping climate change under control, such as renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, are developed and ready to use,"" said Greenpeace International official Stephanie Tunmore. ""There is now a price on climate pollution and penalties for polluters. The switch to a carbon economy begins here.""\ Implementation of the agreement was delayed by a struggle to meet the requirement that countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions ratify it. That goal was reached last year - nearly seven years after the pact had been negotiated - with Russia's approval.\ The Clinton administration signed the protocol in 1997, but the U.S. Senate refused to ratify it, citing potential damage to the U.S. economy and insisting that it also cover countries with fast- growing economies such as China and India.\ ""We have been calling on the United States to join. But the country that is the world's biggest emitter has not joined yet, and that is regrettable,"" Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda, told reporters.\ In Japan, the host to the 1997 conference and a tireless supporter of the pact, the enactment was being met with a mixture of pride and mounting worry that the world's second-largest economy is unprepared to meet its emission reduction targets.\ Under Kyoto, the targets vary by region: The European Union is committed to cutting emissions to 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012; the United States agreed to a 7 percent reduction before President Bush denounced the pact in 2001.\ The White House has contended that complying with the treaty's requirement could cost millions of jobs, many of them to places like India and China, both signers of Kyoto but exempted from any limits on greenhouse gases.\ ""We are still learning about the science of climate change,"" White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Tuesday. In the meantime, McClellan said, ""We have made an unprecedented commitment to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions in a way that continues to grow our economy.""\ Elsewhere, officials made solemn pledges Tuesday to fulfill Japan's requirement under the treaty to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases by 6 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.\ ""Although the hurdle is high, we ask the Japanese people, including industries, for their cooperation,"" said Environment Minister Yuriko Koike.\ The concerns are many. The Japanese government says many industries will need quick action to meet the goals, studies show much of the country is behind on implementation, and critics say Japan lacks a coherent climate-change policy.\ Japan had an elaborate celebration planned for the enactment of the agreement today at the convention hall where it was negotiated in December 1997.\ A series of speeches and a panel discussion was planned with environmental officials, experts and activists, as well as 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai of Kenya. The festivities were featuring messages from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and environmental officials around the world.\ As the agreement comes into force, Japan is scrambling to put together a strategy to make sure it meets its obligations. Some officials are pondering a ""carbon tax"" to punish polluters - a move opposed by business - while others favor expansion of nuclear power and promotion of energy-saving technologies.\ One area where Japan has been especially active is carbon trading - a system under which governments have allocated carbon dioxide quotas to industrial facilities. Those which emit less gas than allowed can sell the ""credit"" to other companies who emit too much.\ Makoto Katagiri, whose Natsource Japan is acting as a credit broker between Japanese and foreign companies, estimated in a study for the World Bank that Japan bought 41 percent of the carbon credits on the international market last year.\ ""From this figure, you can imagine how serious the Japanese companies [are],"" Katagiri said.\ Credit: The Associated Press"
164,"The Democrats who want to replace Rep. Alex Mooney as congressman in West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District are not impressed with the job Mooney has done in Congress. ""Alex Mooney is an absent congressman, Mark Hunt, a lawyer and former state delegate said. ""His office is in my building, 405 Capitol St.; I've never seen him.\""Actually, it's a little worse than that, said Tom Payne, a Martinsburg patent examiner. ""As a representative of this state, he's incompetent.\""I think he's an ideologue. He's tied to the far-right wing of the House, said Cory Simpson, a U.S. Army lawyer. ""He's used West Virginia to promote his own personal ideologies.\""I don't think we've got good representation right now in the district, Harvey Peyton, a Nitro lawyer, said as he ticked off local events and issues he said Mooney had been silent on.\Only Robin Wilson, a retired teacher from Roane County, abstained from the criticism.\The five Democratic candidates met with Gazette-Mail editors on Monday. Mooney, and his Republican primary challenger, have been invited to a similar meeting set for Wednesday.\All five Democrats agreed that the recent international agreement on climate change, signed in Paris, is a good development, but they differed in tone and on what the next step should be.\""We need to do much more, said Wilson, who called for a carbon tax as a ""incentive for people to make the transition.\Peyton called the Paris deal a ""good first step, but he said America owes West Virginia for decades of supplying affordable energy now that coal is on the decline.\""It's almost, to my mind, at the stage of reparations, Peyton said. ""Don't leave us just hanging out here to dry.\Simpson said ""leading by example is the best thing we can do in this area and mentioned legislation intended to aid coalfield communities as the energy industry shifts away from coal.\""We need a plan to transition from coal to other jobs, Payne said, also calling for better technology to burn coal more cleanly.\Hunt said he supports the Paris agreement but is the most bullish on a possible coal comeback that industry analysts consider unlikely.\""I'm not ready to give up on coal, he said. ""The new administration that comes into Washington is going to be more favorable than this administration.\Payne, Simpson and Hunt said federal regulations are a significant problem.\""The bureaucracy is out of control, Payne said.\""The federal regulatory state is one of the reasons I wanted to run for Congress, Simpson said. ""[It's] strangling the entrepreneurship of America.\Hunt pointed specifically to the Environmental Protection Agency, which he called ""overreaching and said is not ""what the Founding Fathers intended.\Peyton objected to criticism of ""regulation in general and said each issue should be dealt with individually.\""It's easy to say that there's too many regulations, he said. ""Tell me which one. Tell me which regulation you say is choking or throttling a particular business, and then let's deal with it.\Wilson said regulations are important for crafting a healthy business environment and mentioned the 2014 Elk River chemical spill as a catastrophe that might have been averted with stronger regulations.\""Some people believe they can maximize profit by minimizing regulations, he said, ""and I think that's a false premise.\Wilson, who said he is a pacifist, called ""the expansion of militarism our biggest foreign policy problem.\""If the only thing you have is a hammer, he said, ""all the problems look like nails.\Payne and Peyton pointed to China as the biggest longterm foreign-policy issue.\Payne said the United States needs to do something about the technological gap between it and China, which he said is rapidly closing.\Hunt said Americans need to defend ourselves, but ""we're draining the economy by fighting wars in these two countries [Afghanistan and Iraq].\Simpson said the United States can be too quick to use military force because too many people are disconnected from the military.\He called the national debt the ""greatest threat to our national security.\Others disagreed.\""The economics of deficit spending are actually positive for the United States, within limits, Hunt said. ""If we go to a balanced budget in the United States immediately, it's going to cause a great depression.\Peyton said he saw little evidence that the debt is a pressing issue, noting that borrowing rates for the federal government are at or near historic lows.\""The national debt's always been with us. It's not what your debt is, it's what you buy with it, he said. ""You can buy roads and bridges in Iraq and Afghanistan, but you don't get much good for it.\Payne also said it isn't a big problem and called for greater investments in the workforce.\He called for lifting the limit on payroll taxes that fund Social Security, which would bring in more tax revenue from the wealthy. Currently, wages are taxed only up to $118,500, with all wages above that level exempt from Social Security taxes.\Peyton agreed.\Hunt did not and said the United States should look at a flat tax, where everybody pays the same tax rate, he proposed 10 percent. Currently, income tax rates are progressive, with wealthier people paying a higher rate.\Simpson called income inequality a ""huge issue and said, ""We need to start reallocating money from the very wealthy and reallocating it back down to the working class.\Wilson noted that the much higher tax rates of the 1950s, '60s and '70s also largely coincided with a growing economy.\Wilson is the only candidate who said he supports Vermont Sen.

165,"STOCKHOLM - Just a day after a United Nations panel called for urgent action on climate change, the Nobel Prize in economics was awarded Monday to one American researcher for his work on the economics of a warming planet and to another whose study of innovation raises hopes that people can do something about it.\The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the $1 million prize Monday to William Nordhaus of Yale University and to Paul Romer of New York University.\Nordhaus, 77, who has been called ""the father of climate-change economics, developed models that suggest how governments can combat global warming. He has endorsed a universal tax on carbon, which would require polluters to pay for the costs that their emissions impose on society.\Romer, 62, who has studied why some economies grow faster than others, has produced research that shows how governments can advance innovation. At a news conference Monday at NYU, Romer said his research left him optimistic that society can solve even a threat as challenging as the warming of the planet.\""Many people think that dealing with protecting the environment will be so costly and so hard that they just want to ignore the problem, Romer said. ""I hope the prize today could help everyone see that humans are capable of amazing accomplishments when we set about trying to do something.\At a separate news conference at Yale, Nordhaus suggested that there was ""pretty widespread acceptance of climate change science outside the United States, and he expressed optimism that the United States would come around.\Referring to the Trump administration's resistance, Nordhaus said: ""I think we just need to get through what is a difficult period. But I'm extremely confident it will happen.\Sunday's report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared that managing climate change could prove a matter of life and death. It argued that failing to prevent just one extra degree of heat could expose countless people and ecosystems to life-threatening conditions over the next few decades.\Unlike Romer and Nordhaus, the panel of scientists who produced the U.N. report expressed little hope that the world will rise to the challenge. Still, in a 782-page document that explicitly cited Nordhaus' work, the U.N. organization spelled out the difference that a single extra degree of heat could make on this fast-warming planet.\If world leaders could agree on ways to limit future human-caused warming to just 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit (a half degree Celsius), instead of the globally agreed-upon goal of 1.8 degrees F (1 degree C), the Earth's weather, health and ecosystems would be in far better shape.\Half as many people would lack water. Fewer people would die or get sick from heat, smog and infectious diseases. Seas would rise nearly 4 inches (0.1 meters) less. There would be fewer heat waves, downpours and droughts.\In the 1970s, Nordhaus, already alarmed by the threat of global warming, began working on potential solutions. Gradually, he developed models to guide policymakers in balancing the economic costs and the societal benefits of combating carbon emissions. Nordhaus concluded that the most efficient approach was to deploy carbon taxes, applied uniformly to different countries.\By using a tax rather than government edicts to slash emissions, the policy encourages companies to find innovative ways to reduce pollution - and their tax burden. Versions of a carbon tax have been used in Europe but have yet to be adopted in the United States.\Many economists have since endorsed the taxing of carbon. But adopting the regulatory frameworks on a global scale has proven problematic, and the world's political leaders are failing to meet it, the head of the United Nations said last month.\Far from developing policies to reduce climate change, President Donald Trump has argued that the threat of human-produced climate change is a hoax concocted by China to hurt the American economy. Many Republicans in Congress have also expressed skepticism about whether or how much human beings are contributing to global warming and whether the U.S. government ought to take steps to address it.\The research of Nordhaus and Romer is united by an interest in what drives economic growth and how to respond when unregulated market forces fail to deliver desired results. David Warsh, a blogger who follows economic research and has written a book on Romer's work, said he thought it was no coincidence that the Nobel committee decided to honor Nordhaus and Romer at a time of escalating alarm over climate change.\""Darn right they were sending a message, Warsh said.\In studying the relationship of innovation and growth, Romer discovered that unregulated economies generally failed to encourage enough research and development to support lasting growth. Government policies, he found, are vital. Examples include subsidies for research and development, and patent policies that strike a balance between letting inventors profit from their breakthroughs and allowing others to put those innovations to work.\One of Romer's insights was that ideas differ from other goods or services. Once you eat a Swedish meatball, for instance, it's gone, noted Per Krusell, a Nobel committee member who is an economist at Sweden's Institute for International Studies.\But an idea - say, a recipe for Swedish meatballs - can be shared and used over and over again, delivering continual economic benefits.\The economics prize is the last of the Nobels to be announced this year.\Credit: By Paul Wiseman and David Keyton The Associated Press"
166,"Facing a loss of high-profile corporate sponsors, a conservative state-level policy group - the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) - threatened action in recent weeks against activist groups that accuse it of denying climate change. Attorneys for ALEC sent letters to Common Cause and the League of Conservation Voters asking them to immediately ""cease making false statements and ""remove all false or misleading material suggesting that ALEC does not believe in global warming.\The activist groups refused the request, saying ALEC's advocacy of legislation on climate issues and its public discussion of the topic support their claims.\The legal demands from ALEC follow an exodus of some of its best known corporate members, including Google, British Petroleum, Facebook, Yahoo and Northrop Grumman. Activist groups had pressured these corporate sponsors in recent years to abandon their support for organizations that they believe oppose action to stem climate change. Google publicly connected its decision to stop funding ALEC to the climate change issue.\The legal spat is an escalation of the conflict and suggests ALEC is feeling the heat of the activist groups' efforts. It also suggests a new risk to organizations that rely on the donations from companies that do not want to be associated with organizations accused of denying that human activity is warming the atmosphere at an alarming rate.\The dispute comes at a time when conservative states and lawmakers and some energy sectors - especially coal interests - are also amping up their battle against the Obama administration's push to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants, a move that will shift the nation toward more use of natural gas and renewable energy.\In a separate example that echoes ALEC's plight, Southern Co., the country's fourth-largest electric utility, recently decided to quietly drop its funding for controversial scientist Wei-Hock ""Willie Soon, a solar physicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory who has challenged the consensus view that links recent climate change to man-made greenhouse gases. Some of Soon's research came under question following revelations that he did not disclose that this work was paid for by fossil-fuel interests, including Southern, which operates coal-fired utility plants.\The company had been underwriting Soon's research through a grant to the Smithsonian-affiliated laboratory where the scientist works, but the company has decided to end the relationship later this year, a spokesman confirmed. Soon declined a request to comment.\Lobbyists for the industry say they no longer focus on questioning scientific consensus.\""The science issue just isn't as salient as it once was, said Scott Segal, who represents energy interests at Bracewell & Giuliani. Debate over climate science was ""all the rage in the past, he said. ""But today, the key issue is whether proposed regulations cost too much, weaken reliability or are illegal.\ALEC officials insist that their nonprofit state-level policy organization does not deny climate change and that they have been overhauling their organization to be more transparent and more welcoming to divergent views. ALEC's attorneys cite the organization's model legislation, distributed to state lawmakers, acknowledging that ""human activity has and will continue to alter the atmosphere of the planet, which ""may lead to demonstrable changes in climate.\Environmental groups, however, have been increasingly worried about the role played by ALEC, which is made up of several thousand mostly GOP state legislators and financed by several hundred corporate and foundation members. The group has a successful track record of designing and passing state level legislation on issues such as gun rights, criminal justice and voting rights.\In a letter last week, attorneys for Common Cause cited the model legislation as evidence that its complaints about ALEC are ""entirely consistent with how ALEC has discussed, characterized, and approached the issue of climate change.\In 2013, ALEC offered the ""model legislation, still available on its Web site, to state legislators saying that the science was uncertain about the role of human activity in changing the atmosphere. The model resolution noted that ""such activity may lead to deleterious, neutral or possibly beneficial climatic changes. Further, a great deal of scientific uncertainty surrounds the nature of these prospective changes, and the cost of regulation to inhibit such changes may lead to great economic dislocation.\""We don't think ALEC or organizations like it are done attacking progress on climate change, said Kert Davies, a longtime environmental activist who now leads a small non-profit called the Climate Investigations Center, which has distributed documents showing that industry funding has flowed to scientists who publicly dispute climate change. ""It is hard to imagine these organizations turning a corner and suddenly being open to an honest discussion of real environmental policy.\Along with Common Cause, the League of Conservation Voters has repeatedly criticized ALEC for pushing legislation to undercut renewable energy, such as solar and wind power. A 2014 campaign sought the defeat of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a former ALEC board member who said during a debate last year that they he does not believe climate change ""is a fact.\Common Cause and LCV officials said the legal demands from ALEC would not alter their position.\""We don't appreciate the attempt to silence LCV just because we disagree with ALEC's positions, said David Willett, LCV's senior vice president for communications. ""Usually if someone wants to get serious about tackling climate change, they ask about working with us, they don't threaten to sue us.\In addition to the model legislation, environmental groups point to ALEC's national meetings. At ALEC's December meeting in Washington, for example, two speakers led a seminar emphasizing the ways in which carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere provide benefits to the environment and the economy over time. One of the speakers, Craig Idso, said he does not deny climate change but disagrees with the dire consensus view of international scientists convened by the United Nations.\""We all think carbon dioxide has an impact on climate, it's a question of how much of an impact, said Idso, former director of environmental science at Peabody Energy, the coal company. He currently chairs a small climate science think tank.\ALEC officials don't dispute that skeptical presentations have occurred at meetings in the past, sometimes under sponsorship from energy interests. But they insist that ALEC, under new leadership, welcomes debate, including new members who support renewable energy, a carbon tax and other measures to curb global warming.\ALEC's efforts comes at the same time as a number of major corporations - including some in the fossil-fuels industry - are seeking to avoid taking positions on climate change that are at odds with mainstream science.\ALEC came in to the public eye following the shooting a few years ago of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. The organization backed model gun rights bills similar to the controversial ""Stand Your Ground law first passed in Florida.\Since then, corporate funders have been pressured to leave as Common Cause and other organizations complained it is little more than a lobbying shop for corporate interests, a charge ALEC has long denied.\Last year, ALEC refashioned itself, naming a new chief executive, Lisa B. Nelson, and announcing it would drop gun rights and other controversial social issues from its portfolio to concentrate on issues of economic liberty.\Nelson and her team also vowed to make the secretive organization more transparent.\""There is a new ALEC now that is interested in dialogue and discussion. It is a big sandbox, and there is room for a lot of ideas, says Bill Meierling, ALEC's vice president for public affairs. But, he said. ALEC won't tolerate guilt by association. That is why lawyers at the Washington firm representing ALEC - Webster, Chamberlain & Bean - sent letters demanding immediate retraction of statements suggesting ALEC denied climate change.\Credit: TOM HAMBURGER, JOBY WARRICK and CHRIS MOONEY The Washington Post"
167,"WASHINGTON - The Trump administration finalized its biggest climate policy rollback Wednesday, requiring the U.S. power sector to cut its 2030 carbon emissions 35 percent over 2005 levels - less than half of what experts calculate is needed to avert catastrophic warming of the planet.\The Affordable Clean Energy rule, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, demands much smaller carbon dioxide reductions than the industry is already on track to achieve, even without any federal regulation. As of last year, the U.S. power sector had cut its greenhouse gas emissions 27 percent, compared with 2005.\Addressing an audience of supporters, including coal miners from Pennsylvania and West Virginia, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the new policy will overturn a climate policy that would have imposed higher costs on low- and middle-income Americans.\""That means cleaner and more affordable energy for the American public, he said.\The new rule comes as many companies and dozens of states wrestle with how to curb greenhouse gas emissions, despite President Donald Trump's rejection of the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is already triggering major climate effects, including increased droughts, wildfires and intense storms. It reverses the Barack Obama administration's 2015 Clean Power Plan, which was forcing the power sector to switch from coal-fired generation to lower-carbon fuels, such as natural gas, solar and wind.\Several of the industry's biggest players have pledged to cut emissions anywhere between 40 percent and 60 percent by 2030, including American Electric Power, DTE, Duke Energy and the Southern Company.\""It's just not relevant, said BloombergNEF analyst Ethan Zindler, whose firm projects that U.S. utilities will reduce their carbon output 55 percent by 2030 due to market forces alone.\But Zindler added that it will be difficult for these same companies to make much deeper cuts after 2030, since they already will have retired their dirtiest coal-fired plants and many of the aging nuclear plants providing the United States with carbon-free electricity will be taken offline.\Making steeper reductions would be required to meet the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a pledge the United States and most of the world's other nations first made in 1992 and have reaffirmed each year, including in the 2015 Paris agreement.\The U.S. electricity sector needs to cut its emissions 74 percent over 2005 levels by 2030 to avoid hitting the 2-degree mark, according to the International Energy Agency. Overall, the country must slash greenhouse gas emissions 48 percent by 2030, according to the IEA's Brent Wanner, with the deepest cuts coming from the power sector because cheap alternatives to coal are readily available.\""We expect it to be very much in the vanguard of any decarbonization strategy, Wanner, a top analyst at IEA's World Energy Outlook team, said.\Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, said his group had found that more aggressive action by U.S. officials, such as a nationwide carbon tax of $50 per ton, could cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent over the next decade.\""Market forces don't do that by themselves, Bordoff said. ""You need regulations.\But current and former Trump administration officials said the new rule represents a more restrained approach that would allow state regulators, rather than Washington bureaucrats, to determine the right energy mix for their region. It requires utilities to make efficiency improvements and curb the amount of carbon dioxide released from power plants, but does not dictate specific emissions targets the way the Obama administration did in the Clean Power Plan.\Twenty-eight states and a host of energy companies had challenged the Obama rule, which would have cut the power sector's emissions 32 percent by 2030. They argued that the EPA had exceeded its authority by allowing state regulators to reach their climate target by compelling emissions cuts beyond a utility's physical plant, such as through energy efficiency measures or the deployment of renewable power. The Supreme Court stayed the rule in 2016 in a 5-4 decision but did not rule on the merits of the case, which is still pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\Mandy Gunasekara, who served as principal deputy assistant administrator for EPA's air and radiation office until February and now runs a pro-Trump advocacy group called Energy45, said the agency was adhering to the confines of the Clean Air Act.\""We're well on our way to paring back the offensive overreaches of the last administration's climate policies, she said. ""The role of [the] EPA is not to turn a coal plant into a wind farm or a solar field. It's to look at a coal plant and look at how to make it more efficient or environmentally friendly, however you want to look at it.\Critics, though, say it could keep some coal plants in business and make it harder for companies to pass on the cost of carbon-free investments to consumers.\A paper published earlier this year by researchers at Harvard, Boston University and Syracuse University, as well as Resources for the Future, said the agency's new rule might increase efficiency at individual coal plants, but then they might end up operating more frequently and for a longer period of time.\The researchers found that as many as 28 percent of the plants affected could actually produce higher overall emissions in 2030 than if there was no federal policy in place. They also estimate that emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide could rise in nearly two-dozen states by 2030, compared with having no new federal regulation.\Some state regulators might not be willing to allow power companies to pass on the cost of investing in renewable projects to customers if there's no federal mandate to cut emissions, said Josh Price, a senior analyst at Height Capital Markets' energy and utilities team. He noted that, last year, the Texas Public Utility Commission rejected American Electric Power's proposed $4.5 billion Wind Catcher project, after questioning whether the benefits justified its cost.\John McManus, AEP's senior vice president for environmental services, said the company is working to build multiple wind projects ""on a smaller scale to take the place of Wind Catcher.\""We still believe renewables make economic sense for our customers, and we're still pursuing them, said McManus, whose company has already cut its carbon emissions 53 percent, compared with 2005 levels. ""Will this make it harder for them to get approved? I don't know.\DTE Chairman and CEO Gerry Anderson, whose Detroit-based utility has pledged to cut its carbon output 50 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2040, said the new regulation won't affect his company's decision to shutter 14 of its 18 coal-fired units by the end of the decade,\""The industry's in motion, and it's got its own life, Anderson said in an interview. ""That's certainly true for DTE. We're moving on, and the rest of the industry is, in a similar direction.\Some segments of the electricity sector haven't moved as swiftly.\Members of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association cut their carbon output 12 percent between 2005 and 2017, according to the group.\The association's chief executive, Jim Matheson, praised the new rule Wednesday, saying in a statement that it ""represents a more flexible path forward that will minimize the cost to consumers and preserve the reliability of the electric grid as electric co-ops work to promote a healthy environment and vibrant rural communities.\Environmentalists are already threatening to challenge the administration in court on the grounds that it cannot defend such a radical about-face by the EPA.\""It can't be justified from the standpoint of the public interest, said Andres Restrepo, a staff attorney at the Sierra Club's Environmental Law Program. ""It is really a dereliction of duty - moral, ethical, but also legal.\But Jeff Holmstead, a partner at Bracewell LLP who headed the EPA's air office under President George W. Bush, said there is little chance that environmentalists will succeed.\""Some rules coming out of the Trump administration may be legally vulnerable, but the ACE rule is on very solid ground, Holmstead said in an email. ""I think there's very little chance of it getting overturned in court.\Credit: Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis The Washington Post"

My husband, Todd, and I decided it would be something fun to do, so we set out to find the hidden treasures in the city I have lived in my entire life. I've seen these statues often, but never really looked at them. \After finding the 10 downtown statues, we headed to the Capitol with our son and daughter, my husband's parents, and another friend and her children. The 11 of us split into groups to see who could find them all first.\When the 10 at the Capitol had been located, my husband and I were finished. We had located all 20 statues and, by process of elimination, appropriately matched each with its name. Next, my in-laws and our friend were curious about the others downtown. They too matched the statues to their names and submitted their completed forms to the Sunday Gazette-Mail.\We had a fun time with family and friends. I hope this won't be the last article of its kind in the Sunday Gazette-Mail.

Here's a newsflash: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler didn't cause the health-care crisis, the financial crisis or the resulting credit freeze. Since potential car buyers can't obtain financing, the automakers can't sell cars.\General Motors employs as many Americans as all foreign automakers combined, with Ford close behind. As millions of Americans depend upon the Detroit automakers for their livelihood, failure isn't an option. In 2007, America had a $138.3 billion trade deficit in autos and parts, mostly with Japan (a sweetheart deal for Toyota and Honda, who don't pay any corporate taxes). If we had supported our American automakers all along, they wouldn't need a bailout today.\General Motors competes by offering more models that achieve 30 mpg or better, and more hybrid models, than any other automaker. They frequently win quality awards. The Chevrolet Volt plug-in electric hybrid is ready for production, easily outclassing the Toyota Prius.\American automakers devoted a century to building our nation's economy and helped us win World War II.

This year at Bridge Day, our members gathered signatures on petitions asking Gov. Manchin and President-elect Barack Obama to stop the mountaintop removal on Gauley Mountain.

169,"PHILADELPHIA - Marvin Odum, president of Shell Oil, was attending a meeting of the parent company's executive committee in Singapore when word trickled in that an exploration well drilled in Alaska's Chukchi Sea - the crowning step in a multi-year $7 billion quest - was a dry hole. Maybe not bone dry. In a recent interview, Odum wouldn't say. But in the oil business glossary, a dry hole is one that can't pay off commercially, and Shell's hole definitely qualified. The parent company, Royal Dutch Shell, abruptly dropped any further drilling - a setback for the industry, though a relief for environmentalists.\For years, they had fought a vigorous, litigious and politically intense battle over the Chukchi. Meanwhile Shell, lured by potentially rich rewards, had overcome a couple of embarrassing rig mishaps at sea and patiently navigated the courts and the Obama administration's permitting process. Now, geology had rendered its verdict.\Odum, who subsequently announced that he would be retiring at the end of this month, said the news about the well didn't hit all at once, but that the drilling results and analysis came in small, painful drips over several days of the executive committee meeting.\Odum knows all too well the element of chance that drives the oil-drilling business. The mechanical engineer has spent his entire 34-year working life at Shell and has overseen successful exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. (About a third of Shell's capital spending goes to North America.) The tools of the trade have grown more sophisticated over time, with computer-aided seismic surveys that can give exploration companies detailed three-dimensional, multicolored maps of the subsurface. Still, at the end of the day, there is only one way to find out for certain whether oil or natural gas is lurking deep in the Earth.\""Through geology and seismic surveys, we had reduced the risk to where the only way to reduce it more was to put down a well, Odum said, adding that Shell put it ""where we thought there was the highest prospect of a discovery. If they had been correct, Odum said, the reward could have been fields as rich in oil as the Gulf of Mexico, which produces 1.6 million barrels a day worth $22 billion a year, even at today's depressed prices.\""The size of the prize was always big enough to take that next step and find out for sure, he said.\Odum took time to reflect during a recent visit to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Odum's departure has saddened many at Shell who see him as, well, a nice guy. He says now is a logical time to leave Shell, which hired him on the spot during the one and only job interview of his life. His father also did some work for Shell, devising a specially fitted type of steel pipe that made drilling easier - and which NASA later used, too.\But now, Royal Dutch Shell is undergoing a massive reorganization to gird itself for a more climate-conscious world, but one that Shell says will still need vast quantities of fossil fuels.\With the recent $52 billion acquisition of the British BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell is making liquefied natural gas a bigger part of its future. It also picked up alluring deepwater oil fields off Brazil. It has reorganized its lines of management by function, rather than geography. And it is planning to sell $30 billion in assets over the next three years, twice the normal rate.\That could include some items in North America.\To many analysts, it looked like Odum was pushed into leaving. ""He's a very competent guy. Very low key and sure of himself, said Fadel Gheit, oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. ""But unfortunately for him, the results were pretty bad. It's basically on his watch.\Gheit said the drilling rig mishaps at sea cost hundreds of millions of dollars and, back on the mainland, Shell had to write down the value of shale oil and gas properties. But, he added, these setbacks were ""not entirely his fault.\Odum says that while he's not rushing into anything, he plans to find new work in the oil business. He also plans to spend more time with his new grandson, his golf clubs, his cello (an eight-year-old Christmas present he's just learning) and his three motorcycles - a Harley-Davidson, a BMW and a Ducati. ""I love riding. It's the engineer in me, he said.\***\The night before Odum arrived at the University of Pennsylvania, students from the Penn Sustainability Review, an environmental publication, met to figure out how to pressure the university into selling the endowment's investments in fossil fuel companies.\Last year, 88 percent of Penn undergraduates who voted in a referendum favored divestment from fossil fuels. (A third of undergraduates voted.) Similar measures are sweeping across college campuses, efforts that in some ways resemble the anti-apartheid disinvestment campaigns aimed at South Africa.\Fossil Free Penn, which launched the referendum, has called for the university to stop new investments in the fossil-fuel industry, sell off holdings in the top 200 fossil-fuel companies within five years and reinvest a portion of the funds into renewable energy.\The group estimates that 4 percent of Penn's $9.6 billion endowment is invested in fossil-fuel companies.\Royal Dutch Shell is a big target not only because it produces oil and gas to satisfy global demand, but also because of its record in places such as Nigeria's Niger Delta, where thieves and local insurgents frequently siphon oil from pipelines, sometimes causing leaks or explosions. Community leaders and environmental groups have accused the company of ruining the environment; the company has been selling or reducing its troubled operations onshore and sticking to those offshore.\And in the United States, the push to drill in the Alaskan Arctic drew sharp opposition. Under Odum, ""the company consistently demonstrated a lack of preparedness and a willingness to push the limits of the law, technology and common sense, said Michael LeVine, a lawyer with Oceana, which opposes all offshore drilling. ""Shell's misadventures in the Arctic Ocean should serve as a cautionary tale for other oil companies considering investments in remote and dangerous places.\If ever the oil industry needed a human face, however, Odum has been it, representing Shell in a coalition that supported the Obama administration's cap-and-trade climate strategy back in 2009.\At Penn, he said the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan - which would favor gas over coal - was ""not perfect, but it's a good reasonable place to start and he was ""supportive. He said he would prefer an economy-wide carbon tax if it were ever politically feasible, even though it would raise retail prices of oil products.\""I intellectually understand it, he said during a class in which a student asked about the divestment movement. ""If your point is to divest from fossil fuel companies, just be very clear what you want to accomplish. If it's a symbolic move - we want to voice our position' - I say, fine.' I'd much rather say there is an opportunity here, particularly with companies like Shell, to co-create a solution with a company that deeply understands energy markets.\Odum said, ""The idea that you can turn fossil fuels off and other sources on and all will be well in 10 years, it's just wrong.\He said, therefore, that ""if you're going down that route [toward divestment], then I would ask you to look at differences between companies out there. I think we're trying to do the right things.\Shell has long basked in a bit of climate-sensitive sunshine because of Odum's revelation (at a Washington Post event) that the company factors in a $40-a-ton carbon price when it does the economic analysis on a new project, an adjustment that would penalize proposals that are the worst from a climate change point of view. Asked about the Paris climate accord, he said ""we will never get this transition going at the pace people want without a price on carbon.\A Penn professor had an astute question: Does Shell assign a carbon price only to the energy the company uses to extract oil or gas? Or does it apply the price to the end use on all oil and gas found?\Odum clarified that it applied only to the amount used in extraction - a tiny sliver of the overall climate impact of a project.\Odum deflected a question about whether Shell should use part of its huge annual capital budget, now about $33 billion after the BG merger, to promote renewable energy. He said that shareholders of a company like Shell might prefer if Shell stuck to what it knew - finding oil and gas - and let shareholders take other money and invest it in firms specializing in renewable energy.\Divestment is not the only hot-button issue at the University of Pennsylvania. When Odum arrived earlier in the day at the Wharton School's radio station to do an interview, the producer offered to screen out callers who were particularly irate about shale gas drilling, which has been a huge issue in Pennsylvania, where many residents say wells have contaminated drinking water.\Odum told her not to worry. And when the subject didn't come up, he brought it up himself.\""What's happened in the back yard here in Pennsylvania has changed the world, Odum said of the giant Marcellus gas reserve in the state that has lowered prices and made it possible to replace dirty burning coal-fired power plants with gas-fired ones. But he added, ""there is a right way to develop this gas and then there are the pollution hazards residents worry about. ""Those are not difficult problems to solve, he said. Shell is part of a group of companies cooperating with the Environmental Defense Fund to measure potent methane leaks that could negate climate benefits of burning gas instead of coal.\""I come out in favor of very clear, very strong regulations, Odum said. ""From the perspective of a company like us, it protects us because everybody then has to do it the right way.\***\But most of the students who saw him in a classroom, and later at an open event, zeroed in on business decisions steered by the price of oil, which has tumbled about 70 percent since July 2014. Shell has slashed capital spending to about $20 billion from about $35 billion, and it has shelved its planned Carmon Creek oil sands project in Canada. Instead of exploring for shale oil in two dozen basins, he said the company is down to six ""sweet spots.\""We're in a commodity business, and when you're in a down cycle, everything is difficult to decide, he said. ""You've got to keep your balance sheet strong. Not just to remain solvent but able to make strategic moves when everyone else is suffering.\When deciding on a project, he said, Shell looks at its economics, its ""resilience if economic conditions go bad, political factors, country risk and environmental issues. He said that before the steep price drop, Royal Dutch Shell had been weighing on six or seven big projects a year, but in the past year had signed off on only two.\""You don't make multibillion-dollar choices lightly, he said, when asked about his toughest decisions.\""I could pick an easy one: Alaska. We spent many billions of dollars exploring off Alaska, he said, ""but the final answer comes from the drill bit when the oil that we needed for it to be viable wasn't there.\Steven Mufson covers the White House.

170," ENERGY prices and the conflict in the Middle East, combined with growing concern over the progress of global warming, have jump- started a long-overdue national conversation about the direction of America's energy policy. The public is clamoring for solutions and, in this generation, there has never been deeper support for increasing the amount of power we get from renewable energy.\ America is the most technologically and economically advanced nation in the world, blessed with vast natural and intellectual resources and a skilled work force. Our nation has a track record of responding to major challenges and achieving unthinkable goals. If any nation in the world is capable of creating an energy system that can fuel our economy while preserving our environment and our long- term security, it is ours.\ But right now, America is failing to take advantage of our almost unlimited potential to generate electricity from renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power.\ The United States has historically been a leader in the deployment of renewable-energy technologies. As recently as the mid- 1990s, we were the world's leaders in solar-power capacity and No. 2 in wind. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. By 2004, Japan had three times the solar photovoltaic capacity of the United States, while Germany had more than double the capacity. The United States is now third in installed wind-power capacity behind Germany and Spain.\ Currently, Germany employs more than 40,000 workers in its wind- energy industry and Denmark another 20,000. Both of these countries have wind resources that are only a fraction of those in our nation's windiest states. In Germany, the wind-energy industry is the second-largest consumer of steel next to the automotive industry.\ Fortunately, an expanding number of communities are pressing the nation toward cleaner renewable energy. State and local officials are increasingly seeing the local economic development benefits of renewable energy. Farmers and ranchers recognize the benefits renewable energy provides for agricultural interests and rural economies. Workers and businesses are also beginning to understand that renewable-energy technologies have the potential to create high- quality jobs that will drive our nation into the 21st century.\ By creating guaranteed markets for renewable energy, these policies have helped to jump-start new statewide energy economies and we are seeing evidence of the economic benefits.\ For example, Pennsylvania's clean-energy standard has spurred investment by Gamesa, a large Spanish manufacturer of wind turbines, in four plants outside Philadelphia to assemble wind-energy equipment for use in the United States. One thousand Americans have already gone back to work on the site of a former U.S. Steel mill outside of Fairless, Pa. And this is but one of many examples of the boom in investments in clean-energy jobs we are seeing across the country.\ Developing our renewable-energy resources will create jobs, save consumers money and bolster rural economies. A recent study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that the national Renewable Electricity Standard which passed the House of Representatives this year requiring 15 percent of electric generation from renewable- energy sources by the year 2020 would save West Virginia consumers up to $150 million on their electricity and natural gas bills in 2020 and that electricity bills would be lower in every state. In regard to job creation, a recent report by the Renewable Energy Policy Project for the United Steelworkers demonstrated that a national investment in renewable-energy development could bring 3,599 new manufacturing jobs to West Virginia.\ In addition, by shifting away from fossil fuels, we can diversify and secure our energy supply while reducing global warming pollution. The Union of Concerned Scientists analysis, based on assumptions of the Energy Information Administration, indicates the House standard requiring 15 percent renewable electricity by 2020 would cut global warming pollution by 126 million metric tons by 2020, the equivalent of taking 20 million cars off the road.\ The House recently voted in favor of an energy bill that included a renewable-electricity standard of at least 15 percent by 2020 and a fuel economy standard of 35 mpg by 2020. Unfortunately, a minority of senators blocked forward progress on energy and the bill failed to reach the 60-vote hurdle in the Senate.\ We applaud Sen. Jay Rockefeller for his support of a final energy bill that includes these critical standards, but are disappointed that Sen. Robert C. Byrd voted to block progress. It will take Sen. Rockefeller's vigilance as well as Sen. Byrd's support of these important provisions to deliver this new energy future. We hope the Senate will act again quickly to pass these critical energy policies."
171,"John Wells holds a box of common light bulbs in his arms, knowing that the box represents an expensive past and a very bright and thrifty future. \His company, Wells Home Furnishings, changed 872 spotlight-type bulbs over a period of four months last spring - and saw the electricity bill go from $3,400 to $1,630 per month just from that energy-saving measure.\Now he's moving on to changing the bulbs in 150 lamps for even more savings.\What motivated this change? According to Jeri Matheny, spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, there's a push from the energy company to encourage businesses and homeowners to save energy. And APCO is willing to help defray the cost of replacing high-energy users to more-efficient choices.\""We're doing an energy-efficiency/demand-side management initiative. There are many companies taking advantage of it,"" Matheny said.\""We've always encouraged customers to conserve energy, both residential and commercial,"" Matheny explained. ""We know energy costs are a big part of running a business, and if we can help our customers to save money, it's a good thing.\""Also, of course, if we conserve enough energy, we can delay when we have to add more generating capability, which is a huge investment, and then we don't have to pass that huge cost on to customers.""\Wells considered alternative light bulbs for his halogen fixtures for a while.\""I had been looking at the bulbs for three years, but I was not happy with the output,"" he said, pointing out the importance of lighting to his furniture showroom's appearance.\""Lighting is everything in my business,"" he said. He chose Ultra LED 120-volt, 15-watt narrow floods by Sylvania. LED stands for light-emitting diode.\He said his power use, just replacing the spotlights, went from 204,000 kilowatt-hours per year to under 40,000. They had been using 75-watt halogen bulbs.\Each LED bulb cost $39, but through the power company rebate program, the store got back $15 per bulb.\""But we'll save so much energy it's unbelievable,"" Wells said. ""We got $13,000 back. With all of the savings on energy, heating and with the rebate, we will get a total return in less than two years.""\The new LED bulbs last about 10 years, so Wells knows he will see another bottom-line saving in labor costs. He's also looking at savings on air conditioning this summer because the new bulbs burn much cooler than the halogens they replaced.\Switching the lamps in the showroom from incandescent to fluorescent won't be as costly as the halogen-to-LED spotlight switch.\""Those bulbs have come down in price so much in the past few years, and the quality of the light has improved. While I'll probably pay 99 cents for a 13-watt fluorescent bulb instead of 30 to 40 cents for an old 40-watt bulb, it's still a lot less than it was a few years ago when the new bulbs first came out. Like everything else, once everyone starts to use it, the cost goes down,"" Wells said.\Small store, big changes\John D. Anderson owns Center Hardware in the Gateway Shopping Center in St. Albans. A stream of loyal customers comes through the door every day.\Recently one of those regulars asked Anderson if he had remodeled the store. Anderson explained that the noticeable difference was a result of new, cost-efficient lighting.\""People thought we remodeled! It was so much brighter, which is good for our business,"" Anderson said. He had an electrician switch the ceiling-covering network of more than 100 large, T12 fluorescent tubes to smaller, more-efficient T8 bulbs.\""We just changed the ends on the fixtures, the ballasts and the bulbs. We went from magnetic to electronic ballasts,"" Anderson explained. ""They are much cooler - and they last longer.""\Customers noticed the change - and asked how they could do the same thing at home. Does Center sell the ballasts for the switch?\""We do now!"" Anderson said enthusiastically.\He participated in the power company rebate program, and the reward was as easy to see as the now brightly lit aisles in his shop.\""We got a couple of nice little checks back from APCO. It covered a quarter of the cost of the changes. When do you get a check back from your power company?"" He shows visitors two checks from Appalachian Power totaling $980. It took about a week for all of the ballasts and bulbs to be switched.\Anderson said the store is gradually switching from incandescents to LEDs in the spotlights over the paint counter and in other areas.\He now sells those bulbs as well.\Toyota sees the light\Energy-efficient cars are a top priority at Toyota Motor Manufacturing. Energy-efficient lighting is the priority for George Vickers, a specialist in environmental engineering for the Buffalo plant.\The West Virginia native has led the charge to replace the metal halide fixtures (similar to halogen) that have been in the plant since it started in 1996.\""There's nothing special about the new lights,"" Vickers insists, as he shows visitors the bright fluorescent fixtures that dot the ceiling of the vast plant. The fixtures are fairly old school: basic six-bulb fluorescent units. The modern twist involves more-efficient T8 bulbs and motion sensors.\""The original fixtures in the plant used a lot of energy, 440 watts,"" Vickers said. ""Also, they had a 'strike time.' If you turned off the light, you couldn't turn it back on for a while."" So between shifts, they had to leave the lights on. Now the new fixtures are on motion sensors, turning themselves off when there's no one around to need them, saving thousands of dollars in energy costs.\The T8 fluorescent tubes use 220 watts, or basically half the energy of the old metal halide fixtures.\It cost about $400,000 to change the lighting, but Vickers said he would see a full payback in less than two years from the energy cost savings and the rebate. Sun Control Inc. of Hurricane helped plan the lighting conversion.\American Electric Power is rebating $95 per light ($90 per fixture and $5 for the motion sensors). The rebate is formulated for each customer depending on the type of old lighting, new lights and other factors. Toyota will receive nearly $200,000 from AEP.\Toyota has electric meters, similar to the ones on the outside of a residence, on each line in the factory. Teams are challenged to meet energy savings goals with targets on each line.\""Not to get too philosophical, but at Toyota, we build it right the first time,"" Vickers said. ""That's the team's opportunity to get it right and to save energy by not having to redo things.""\Vickers is aware that fluorescents have mercury in them, a hazard to the environment, but he said the newer bulbs have a lower level of the element in them.\""And for home use, places like Home Depot will recycle old compact fluorescent bulbs,"" he added.\The process at Toyota started a year ago, and they have changed 2,000 fixtures, with 90 to go.\""The old lights are still in the places that are hardest to get to,"" Vickers pointed out, over the busiest and most intricate parts of the production line. As he walked through a part of the plant that was on break, the motion sensors detected his movement and lights came on to light his way. He noted that to use motion sensors, fluorescent fixtures have to have rapid-start ballasts. The sensors in the plant are programmed to turn off the lights after 20 minutes if there is no movement in the area.\Automation abounds and efficiency is key at the plant. Vickers noted that there are 450 working minutes in a day, and on that particular day they would produce 877 engines.\And it all takes place under 2,090 new light fixtures.\lawrence pierce | Sunday Gazette-Mail As owner of Wells Home Furnishings, John Wells researched new light bulbs for several years before selecting the Sylvania Ultra LED to use in his spotlights.

172,"NEW YORK - A first for ""10 Questions"". A request.\""Go ask the other coaches and players if they'd rather play in the Coliseum or in Charleston or Wheeling?"" West Virginia University Coach Gale Catlett said.\Little did he know during Wednesday's Big East Conference basketball media day that such an inquiry had been spread. Ten representatives from the league - the eight coaches who will play WVU in the Mountain State this year and two players who also will spread their geographical sights - were asked what their reaction was to missing a trip to the often-rowdy and loud Coliseum.\So in a format change, here are 10 answers to one question.\1. Kevin Bannon, Rutgers coach, March 4 at Wheeling: ""I think you do what you have to do. It's unfortunate, but it also makes it interesting. I can't speak from Gale's perspective. Maybe this will make it more difficult (for visiting teams). They're all tough on the road. What am I going to say?""\2. Ryan Blackwell, Syracuse senior forward, Jan. 11 at Charleston: ""(Morgantown's) a fun place to go. I'm not sure how it will affect them. When you have a crowd that gets in the game and taunts your players, it makes it a good atmosphere.""\3. Mario Bland, Miami (Fla.) senior center, Feb. 22 at Charleston: ""I think it will be a lot better for us. It's very hard when the fan base gets on you. We can be better focused in the game.""\4. Jim Boeheim, Syracuse coach, Jan. 11 at Charleston: ""(Morgantown) was a tough place to play. I don't know anything about Charleston. I'm just worried about what's out there. We still have to play West Virginia and it still will be a tough game. It's a good- sized arena, not one of those small places. But you just never know about things until you get there.""\5. Craig Esherick, Georgetown coach, Jan. 26 at Charleston: ""I'm not sure there's anything bad about this (for his team). If I was Coach Catlett, I wouldn't be too happy. It's certainly a greater (traveling) distance for us. But the West Virginia Coliseum, I played there. That is a tough place to play. I'm sure they'll bring that guy with the gun. Maybe he's the one who loosened up that asbestos.""\6. Leonard Hamilton, Miami coach, Feb. 22 at Charleston: ""I just wanted to make sure where we were playing. Whether we could get in and out as easy as possible. I felt like I had a lot of adversity at Miami. I'm sure Coach Catlett would not have wanted this. I have a little sympathy. But adversity like that has a tendency to bring you closer as a team.""\7. Ben Howland, Pittsburgh coach, Feb. 10 at Charleston: ""I've never been there. I think that's tough for West Virginia. Obviously, they are not going to be able to practice at the same facility. Still, it's 10 feet high and the same length. It won't make it any easier for us. I've heard they have great fans at West Virginia. They have the rowdiest fans in the league or some of the best.""\8. Mike Jarvis, St. John's coach, Jan. 8 at Wheeling: ""To be honest, I forgot where it was being played. I've never played in Wheeling. Sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don't know. By time the game gets there, we might wish we were back at the Coliseum. We finally got a win last year. Sometimes these things help bring teams together.""\9. Al Skinner, Boston College coach, Feb. 19 at Wheeling: ""I've always said the West Virginia Coliseum offers one of the best college environments you can play in. Those guys play extremely well at home. I've always been extremely pleased every time we won there. You kind of miss that. That's what college basketball is all about. Going out into these environments and trying to come out with a win. It was a great place to play (Skinner did so in 1974 as past of Massachusetts' team). That's all part of the experience.""\10. Tim Welsh, Providence coach, Jan. 30 at Wheeling: ""Obviously the Coliseum is one of the toughest places to play in the league. It would be like us going to Hartford every night to play a home game. Or Boston. Or New Hampshire.""\Writer Mike Cherry can be reached at 348-5170."
173," MORGANTOWN - Who really knows what Rich Rodriguez's early- scripted play selection was on Thursday night? It seemed something like this:\ Let's check out the ""Fridge,"" and pop open a running back.\ Steve Slaton, the back upon whom Maryland Coach Ralph Friedgen turned his back, turned the Terrapins inside-out at Mountaineer Field.\ By the time the ACC visitors corralled the West Virginia sophomore, it was 28-0, and he was dancing in Heisman Trophy voters heads as well as through would-be Terp tacklers.\ ""It wasn't the greatest way to start off,"" Friedgen said.\ It wasn't the greatest way to finish for the fifth-ranked Mountaineers, but against a rival that has been a tough out for WVU, even in defeat, Rodriguez will take a 45-24 victory.\ Scouts from 16 NFL teams watched this one, as did reps from the Orange and Fiesta bowls, but it's doubtful anyone was smiling more than Big East Conference Commissioner Mike Tranghese, watching the previously pirating ACC get turtle-waxed.\ Yes, the Mountaineers do not have a defense that can win a game, but right now, that WVU unit is kind of like former starting quarterback Rasheed Marshall was as a sophomore and junior in Coach Rodriguez's program:\ He wasn't being asked to win the game, just don't lose it. Ditto a defense that still needs to mature.\ The offense has more than plenty of firepower.\ In the last six home dates, WVU has scored 46, 45, 45, 42, 52 and 45 points. That's not just productivity; it's consistency.\ Slaton was headed for his third 200-yard rushing game - Amos Zereoue career record for the program - in the last four outings when he went backward to 195.\ It didn't matter, because WVU (3-0) has enough to complement him - and that means more than quarterback Patrick White.\ ""We lost to a very good football team, in a very tough environment,"" said Friedgen of the sellout crowd of 60,513 under the lights and before ESPN cameras. ""It's on national television ... it's embarrassing.""\ Slaton danced, dodged and darted through and around the Terps, so this might be a good time to go deeper than the well-reported fact that Friedgen admits he made a mistake in withdrawing a grant-in- aid offer to the once-committed running back who has hung his star here.\ Maybe that wasn't Friedgen's only huge recruiting mistake. In his first three Maryland seasons, his teams went a combined 31-8, with Orange, Peach and Gator (over WVU) bowls.\ He won mostly with ditched Coach Ron Vanderlinden's players. In the years since, while the Fridge's recruits have filled the two- deep, it's been a comparative deep-freeze, including 12 losses in the last 21 games.\ Friedgen's Maryland beat Rodriguez's Mountaineers in their first four meetings (2001-03) because the Terps were bigger and physically tougher. WVU has won the last three because the 'Eers have used their scheme and speed to unravel their rivals.\ The Terps' resiliency over the final three quarters after finding themselves down four touchdowns didn't faze Rodriguez.\ In the past against Maryland, it would have, but the proverbial worm turned in the fourth quarter at Byrd Stadium a year ago.\ Maryland couldn't afford to help the Mountaineers, and it did, especially on special teams, with two turnovers and allowing a 96- yard kickoff return TD by Darius Reynaud.\ The Terps' five turnovers were the first WVU has gained in three games, and plenty. When West Virginia wins the turnovers, it's 30-1 since the start of the 2002 season (the exception a 45-20 win at Central Florida in 2004).\ ""We gave up some things we shouldn't have given up,"" said WVU senior linebacker Jay Henry, who had his first career interception.\ ""We hit with a couple of blitzes, but we still need to get better pressure on the passer. We did get after it more than we did in the past two games.""\ At this point, however, Henry and his unit know WVU's best defense is the Mountaineers' good offense.\ After three home romps, the Mountaineers play only once at home (Syracuse, Oct. 14) in the next five games.\ Now, can they do it on the road?\ Contact Sports Editor Jack Bogaczyk at jackb@dailymail.com or 348- 7949.\ Credit: Daily Mail Sports Editor"
174," DAILY MAIL STAFF\ Despite the lack of home runs and RBIs, more than a thousand fans could still feel the power at Charlestons baseball park. But only if they were loyal West Virginia University Mountaineers. Pigskin fans sporting the blue and gold funneled into Appalachian Power Park, of all places, which showed the WVU football squads season opening victory over the Syracuse Orangemen on the jumbo screen Sunday. The event offered an alternative to Regatta a tailgating environment where youngsters played football in deep right field while beer- swilling adults sprawled out on blankets and lawn chairs. Admission was even free for this gridiron party, courtesy of the West Virginia Power and WVU. They oughta do this for every televised game, said Ray Thomlinson, 26, a WVU alum. They could even charge a couple of bucks to get in and make some money. Thomlinson ventured to the ballpark from his hometown, Huntington, with some friends to watch the game. He, like several other fans in attendance, cheered on the Eers as they came ahead 15-7 over their Big East rivals. According to the WVU Alumni Association, there are 11,350 Mountaineer alumni living in the Kanawha Valley. But not everyone at the ballpark was necessarily rooting for Coach Rich Rodriguezs team. Rod Toastman Blackstone, a Syracuse alumnus and assistant to Charleston Mayor Danny Jones, played his usual evil heckler role at the stadium. This time it was at a football game and against the home crowd. He even got soaked quite a few times in the dunk tank for his efforts, which ironically helped raise about $200 for the WVU Alumni Association. Its fun heckling people, said Blackstone, sans burnt toast. I had to be, Cmon. Lets see what you Mountaineer fans have. Blackstone, who was instrumental in the development of the new ballpark, said Sundays gathering showed that the stadium can be used for non- baseball events. Just look at the Blue and Gold, Blackstone said. This is marvelous. The ballpark is the center of the community where people can gather and have fun. Even Blackstones colleague, City Manager David Molgaard, a WVU alumnus, tried dunking him. He missed, but Molgaards son didnt. Molgaard believes the ballpark should host televised games until the weather turns nasty. Its a great use of the field considering the baseball seasons over, he said. The first 1,000 fans through the gates received a special rally rag giveaway. Fans also had a shot at other prizes throughout the day, including football game tickets. Folks lined up at the ballpark concessions all day for hot dogs and beverages, and the Kids Zone stayed open for youngsters. The WVU Pep Band even played some tunes to rally the crowd. It was almost like being in Morgantown, except there wasnt a massive couch burning in centerfield. Contact writer Jake Stump at jakestump@dailymail.com or 348-4842."
175," BLACKSBURG, Va. - Rich Rodriguez said his surprising football team ""had matured throughout the year.""\ He's right, but what occurred on Wednesday night in a college football environment in which most visitors melt was really about more than one team in one game during one season.\ It was Rodriguez's West Virginia program that grew up at noisy Lane Stadium. If the young head coach is to take WVU to the top, it is this night that many 'Eers will remember as the first significant step in that climb.\ Not satisfied just to complete the longest pass of the 21-game Rodriguez era, the Mountaineers ran through - and then stuffed - 13th-ranked and sliding Virginia Tech, 21-18.\ It was more than a rivalry rekindled. It was in prime time, on national TV. It wasn't the only game in town. It was the only game period, unless you count the Preseason NIT.\ If you were watching the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on CBS, then you missed the Mountaineers parading down the runway into national consciousness. Suddenly, this WVU season is about more than going from 3-8 to 8-3.\ ""It's too early to call this a statement game for our program,"" Rodriguez said.\ Pul-leeeeze. That's rich.\ Until two weeks ago, naysayers said WVU's turnaround was, well, see-through lingerie. WVU hadn't beaten a team with a winning record.\ ""People were looking at us like we were bums,"" star running back Avon Cobourne said. ""I mean, bums.""\ Then, WVU handled Boston College, which had won at Notre Dame. A solid victory.\ This one, however, was on the road, as an eight-point underdog, against a program in a 10th straight bowl season, against a team that was ranked - OK, over-ranked - at No. 3 in early November.\ Twenty seasons ago, WVU went to ninth-ranked Oklahoma and pulled off a 41-27 shocker - the signature triumph early in the Don Nehlen years.\ That September 1982 game was the last time an unranked West Virginia team won on the road against a ranked team, until BeamerBall was thwarted by an impressive goal-line stand, then something that has made a difference all year for WVU.\ A turnover. Tech's only one. Figuring how WVU has clinched at least third place in the Big East is a big easy. The Mountaineers have a 17-2 takeaway bulge in five league wins.\ Where this puts Rodriguez's team is seemingly headed for the Insight Bowl in Phoenix on Dec. 26, against the No. 4 selection in a wild Pacific 10 scramble. UCLA? The Oregon-Oregon State winner? Arizona State in its own neighborhood?\ And as if the annual Pitt game needs added fervor, it's floating up the Monongahela River right now. If Pittsburgh loses at Miami tonight, the Mountaineers and Panthers could be playing Nov. 30 at Heinz Field for a Gator Bowl bid.\ The only way West Virginia wouldn't go Gator by beating Pitt is if the Jacksonville game chooses Maryland on the ACC side. A Terps- Mountaineers rematch won't happen.\ Still, WVU should be ranked Sunday for the first time since October 1998. Even as recently as October 2002, who would have thought that?"
176," DAILY MAIL SPORTS EDITOR\ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The Big East has embraced its newest basketball exposure. It's going to take hoops from the largest Division I conference into markets where it hasn't played previously.\ The SEC/Big East Invitational made its doubleheader debut Wednesday night before 10,481 at the 16,802-seat Birmingham- Jefferson Civic Center.\ Tonight, it plays a twinbill at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia.\ Where next?\ That's a good question.\ About the only certainty for the Big East is that the four teams scheduled into the inaugural two-night event - Georgetown, West Virginia, Villanova and Providence - won't play again during the four-year SEC/Big East arrangement.\ ""We're close and, hopefully, will have something on next season by the first of the year,"" said Dan Gavitt, the Big East associate commissioner for basketball operations, before Wednesday's tipoff. ""Really, it's like putting together a big puzzle.""\ That involves teams from both conferences, arenas that will be neutral sites for all, ESPN telecast windows and even exam schedules at some schools that could affect who plays and when.\ ESPN owns the event and Gavitt said the network brought up the possibility of a challenge series during negotiations with the conference on a new, six-year basketball telecast contract that began this season.\ The network was looking for quality hoops matchups to fill an early December void between the end of college football season and the start of the bowl schedule.\ ""I think the SEC already had been looking around at the possibility of a challenge series when ESPN brought it to us,"" Gavitt said. ""They'd already talked a bit with the Big 12 and Pac- 10 (leagues that since have gotten together on their own non- conference series).""\ Big East athletic directors at the eight football members also like the new basketball series because the stronger relationship could foster inroads in football scheduling with the SEC.\ Each conference will have a ""home site"" in its regional footprint annually. Every Big East team will play once in the series. Four members in the 12-team SEC will receive a second appearance to complete the contract.\ ""You want to have quality matchups and games that make sense,"" said Pete Derzis, senior vice president and general manager of ESPN Regional Television.\ ""You want teams that are attractive because some are from the region (where games are played) and others are top programs.""\ Besides the 2007 debut location, arena cities under consideration as ""SEC sites"" are Tampa, Atlanta, Memphis and Nashville.\ The ""Big East sites"" up for discussion after Philly include Chicago, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and the New York metropolitan area, where Madison Square Garden, the new Prudential Center in Newark, Continental Airlines Arena (Meadowlands) and a new building in Brooklyn could be used.\ Providence meets South Carolina and LSU faces Villanova tonight in Philadelphia.\ * n n\ HOW GOOD have the Big East and SEC been in basketball in recent history? A team from one of those two leagues has won the national championship four of the past five years and seven of the past 12.\ * n n\ GEORGETOWN started the first SEC/Big East show by pulling away in the final minutes for a 70-60 victory over Alabama. The Hoyas (6-0) used a 16-rebound advantage to pull-away after the early going was played at a much quicker pace than Georgetown likes.\ ""There's no other way to articulate that our defense just wasn't good,"" Hoyas Coach John Thompson III said. ""Alabama kept getting edges and open shots. You have to give them credit.\ ""We gave up 35 points in the first half and that's significantly more than we have been giving up all year. I think we were a little more attentive, communicated a little better and mixed things up in the second half.""\ The Crimson Tide (4-2) was only 8-of-24 from the field in the final 20 minutes.\ * n n\ THE SERIES inaugural brought out a who's who of basketball and college athletics. Sitting court-side were NBA scouting legend Marty Blake and Memphis Grizzlies' General Manager - and Buckhannon native - Chris Wallace.\ Also on hand were retired former Kentucky Athletic Director and Vanderbilt and Alabama Coach C.M. Newton, who is a past president of USA Basketball; and retired Coach Sonny Smith, who led programs at East Tennessee State, Auburn and Virginia Commonwealth.\ SEC Commissioner Mike Slive, this year's Bowl Championship Series coordinator, also made the short walk from the conference office to the downtown arena for the doubleheader.\ * n n\ POOR AUBURN had played just once in its first five games at home, including curious contests at Alabama State and Charleston (S.C.) Southern. The SEC-Big East Invitational was supposed to provide a friendlier environment.\ It did not.\ Much of the Alabama student section that watched the Crimson Tide lose to Georgetown in the night's first game stayed just to jeer rival Auburn in the second game.\ By the time WVU pushed its lead to 20 points in the middle of the first half, they were cheering for the Mountaineers. It didn't change must the rest of the game and that coupled with a smattering of gold-clad WVU fans gave the visiting team an edge.\ ""I knew they'd be cheering against Auburn,"" Alex Ruoff said. ""I didn't expect them to support us as much as they did.""\ * n n\ ONE STUDENT had a large dry-erase board on which he scribbled various messages throughout the game and showed them off to taunt Auburn.\ A sampling:\ ""Who invited Auburn?""\ ""This isn't even fair! 53-29? Go 'Eers!""\ ""We were in our game.""\ When WVU left the floor at halftime and headed to its locker room, the team passed the students. The student held a sign that read, ""Y'all are sick!""\ Once the game got really out of hand, he raised a sign to show the score.\ ""Ruoff 28, Auburn 43.""\ * n n\ IT WASN'T the best offensive night for senior point guard Darris Nichols, who missed five of his seven shots. Perhaps, his introduction was a sign of things to come. The Radford, Va., native was announced as being from Scott Depot, hometown of walk-on Josh Sowards.\ * n n\ REDSHIRT FRESHMAN Cam Thoroughman made his season debut with 4:55 remaining. Thoroughman, a 6-foot-7 forward from Portsmouth, Ohio, partially tore his left medial collateral ligament and dislocated his kneecap in early September.\ He didn't need surgery, but still was slowed at the start of practice.\ He missed his only shot against the Tigers, but managed one highlight. As Auburn tried to grab a loose ball under WVU's basket, Thoroughman dived in with his team ahead by 35 points, got the ball and fired it to Will Thomas, who slipped a pass to Joe Mazzulla for a layup.\ Sportswriter Mike Casazza contributed to this report."
177,"At LSU, at night, the Tigers are a different animal.\If it's not a tough enough assignment for West Virginia when it becomes the first team in Big East history to play at Tiger Stadium, the No. 22 Mountaineers get a 15th-ranked LSU team in a 9 p.m. kickoff (EDT) Saturday.\Prepared for playing in front of what figures to be a capacity crowd - or near it - of 92,400?\Well, last Saturday, a sellout crowd of 60,122 at Mountaineer Field was repeatedly given credit for its ""12th Man"" effort during a 31-17 WVU victory over Maryland by the home team's players and Coach Bill Stewart.\""Since 2007 (when WVU was playing its way toward a national title bid, in the running with LSU as well, before crashing against Pitt), this was the loudest it's been,"" West Virginia senior defensive lineman Scooter Berry said. ""That played really big in the game ... and that's why they have crowd favorites in video games.""\However, Mountaineer Field in the noonday sun isn't Tiger Stadium under the lights, as will be evident in Saturday's ESPN2 telecast of unbeatens. Two Mountaineers who grew up as Alabamans in SEC Country know that.\""Those people down there live and die with football,"" said WVU senior special teamer Trippe Hale, whose Mobile, Ala., roots include life with a father, Steve, who is president and CEO of the Senior Bowl. ""Playing at LSU is a lot to look forward to.\""I've been to quite a few games there. My best friend played for LSU. They try to intimidate you. It's serious stuff. For us, we have to try and be ready for the environment, and have fun with it. You don't play in many atmospheres like that.\""You just can't let it get to you.""\Hale remarked how the loud crowd last Saturday in Morgantown contributed to Terps' jitters early, as well as numerous false start and delay of game penalties. He said the LSU crowd will try and do the same to the Mountaineers.\WVU sophomore receiver Coley White, of Daphne, Ala. (the Mobile outskirts) also experienced Tiger Stadium first-hand when he went to Baton Rouge with his older brother, Pat, on one of the latter's visits during the recruiting process.\""They're good fans, and it's very, very loud,"" White said of what awaits the Mountaineers. ""It's loud here, like it was (against Maryland), but they have more than 20,000 more fans there.\""People hype it because it's SEC football, and football is really big down there. We've been to other SEC stadiums, like Auburn and Mississippi State, so some of us know what it might be like. But you just have to go play the way you know how.""\This season, the SEC's average crowd is larger than 76,000. Seven of the 12 SEC stadiums seat more than 80,000.\Stewart's 2009 club visited Auburn, where the Mountaineers played before a prime-time crowd of 87,451 - the third largest attendance for a game in WVU history.\West Virginia committed five turnovers and lost 41-30 - the only time in 61 games since 2000 that the 'Eers have scored 30 or more and lost. The game at LSU - the Tigers return to Morgantown in 2011 - marks the sixth straight year WVU has played an SEC team.\West Virginia topped Georgia in the Sugar Bowl to end the 2005 season, then played home-and-homes with Mississippi State and Auburn - and now LSU.\* n n\IF THE Tigers reach or closely approach capacity Saturday, WVU will play before the second-largest crowd to witness a game in 199 seasons of Mountaineer football history.\However, if that history is an indicator, that's not good news.\West Virginia has lost every time before the top 17 crowds it has seen.\Those numbers include seven games at Penn State, four Gator Bowls, two games at Notre Dame, one each at Ohio State, Auburn and Wisconsin, and the Jan. 1, 1994 Sugar Bowl loss to Florida at the Superdome.\The largest crowd to see a WVU victory was 75,008 at Oklahoma's Owen Field, for a Sept. 11, 1982 triumph over the No. 9 Sooners that put coach Don Nehlen's WVU program on the national map.\The largest crowd for a WVU game was 96,445 at Beaver Stadium in 1991, the last home game for Penn State in its long rivalry with WVU - a 51-6 Nittany Lion romp. Next is 88,272 for a 24-3 Buckeyes' win at the Horseshoe in 1987.\Looking ahead to large venues, WVU is scheduled to visit Doak Campbell Stadium (82,300) at Florida State in 2012, and go to Michigan State's Spartan Stadium (75,005) in 2015.\* n n\WEST VIRGINIA'S visit to Baton Rouge is a Big East first in the conference's 20 seasons of football.\The only Big East team to play LSU, period, in those two decades was Virginia Tech, which downed the Tigers 26-8 in a 2002 season-opening Black Coaches Classic at Lane Stadium.\Even when pre-Big East football days are considered, there have been few dates with the Tigers for any of the 12 schools that have played in the league. WVU, Pitt, Temple, Louisville, Cincinnati, Connecticut and USF haven't met the Bayou Bengals.\Syracuse played LSU in two bowls (1964 Sugar, 1989 Hall of Fame). LSU visited Rutgers way back in 1922. The Hokies had the 2002 home date. Boston College had a home-and-home with LSU in 1946 and '53.\Miami (Fla.) had 12 games with the Tigers - 11 before Big East play and once since the Hurricanes moved to the ACC - a 2005 Peach Bowl highlighted by a fight in a Georgia Dome tunnel.\* n n\FINALLY, THE Big East has made it into a huge weekend for the conference's football reputation in 2010 thanks to the performance in the first three weeks of the season.\It started with Pitt's date at Heinz Field on Thursday night (that one finished after Mountaineer Gameday was put to bed). The Big East also has nationally ranked foes in WVU's trip to LSU and with Oklahoma against Cincinnati at Paul Brown Stadium.\North Carolina's game at Rutgers is no Scarlet Knight picnic, either.\Pitt entered the Miami game with the Big East only 1-6 against Bowl Championship Series conference teams - West Virginia over Maryland the lone win.\The eight-team league is a paltry 3-3 against sub-BCS major conference teams - losses to Utah, Fresno State and erstwhile Big East member Temple, and wins over Marshall, Akron and Florida International.

178,"John Wells holds a box of common light bulbs in his arms, knowing that the box represents an expensive past and a very bright and thrifty future. \His company, Wells Home Furnishings, changed 872 spotlight-type bulbs over a period of four months last spring - and saw the electricity bill go from $3,400 to $1,630 per month just from that energy-saving measure.\Now he's moving on to changing the bulbs in 150 lamps for even more savings.\What motivated this change? According to Jeri Matheny, spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, there's a push from the energy company to encourage businesses and homeowners to save energy. And APCO is willing to help defray the cost of replacing high-energy users to more-efficient choices.\""We're doing an energy-efficiency/demand-side management initiative. There are many companies taking advantage of it,"" Matheny said.\""We've always encouraged customers to conserve energy, both residential and commercial,"" Matheny explained. ""We know energy costs are a big part of running a business, and if we can help our customers to save money, it's a good thing.\""Also, of course, if we conserve enough energy, we can delay when we have to add more generating capability, which is a huge investment, and then we don't have to pass that huge cost on to customers.""\Wells considered alternative light bulbs for his halogen fixtures for a while.\""I had been looking at the bulbs for three years, but I was not happy with the output,"" he said, pointing out the importance of lighting to his furniture showroom's appearance.\""Lighting is everything in my business,"" he said. He chose Ultra LED 120-volt, 15-watt narrow floods by Sylvania. LED stands for light-emitting diode.\He said his power use, just replacing the spotlights, went from 204,000 kilowatt-hours per year to under 40,000. They had been using 75-watt halogen bulbs.\Each LED bulb cost $39, but through the power company rebate program, the store got back $15 per bulb.\""But we'll save so much energy it's unbelievable,"" Wells said. ""We got $13,000 back. With all of the savings on energy, heating and with the rebate, we will get a total return in less than two years.""\The new LED bulbs last about 10 years, so Wells knows he will see another bottom-line saving in labor costs. He's also looking at savings on air conditioning this summer because the new bulbs burn much cooler than the halogens they replaced.\Switching the lamps in the showroom from incandescent to fluorescent won't be as costly as the halogen-to-LED spotlight switch.\""Those bulbs have come down in price so much in the past few years, and the quality of the light has improved. While I'll probably pay 99 cents for a 13-watt fluorescent bulb instead of 30 to 40 cents for an old 40-watt bulb, it's still a lot less than it was a few years ago when the new bulbs first came out. Like everything else, once everyone starts to use it, the cost goes down,"" Wells said.\Small store, big changes\John D. Anderson owns Center Hardware in the Gateway Shopping Center in St. Albans. A stream of loyal customers comes through the door every day.\Recently one of those regulars asked Anderson if he had remodeled the store. Anderson explained that the noticeable difference was a result of new, cost-efficient lighting.\""People thought we remodeled! It was so much brighter, which is good for our business,"" Anderson said. He had an electrician switch the ceiling-covering network of more than 100 large, T12 fluorescent tubes to smaller, more-efficient T8 bulbs.\""We just changed the ends on the fixtures, the ballasts and the bulbs. We went from magnetic to electronic ballasts,"" Anderson explained. ""They are much cooler - and they last longer.""\Customers noticed the change - and asked how they could do the same thing at home. Does Center sell the ballasts for the switch?\""We do now!"" Anderson said enthusiastically.\He participated in the power company rebate program, and the reward was as easy to see as the now brightly lit aisles in his shop.\""We got a couple of nice little checks back from APCO. It covered a quarter of the cost of the changes. When do you get a check back from your power company?"" He shows visitors two checks from Appalachian Power totaling $980. It took about a week for all of the ballasts and bulbs to be switched.\Anderson said the store is gradually switching from incandescents to LEDs in the spotlights over the paint counter and in other areas.\He now sells those bulbs as well.\Toyota sees the light\Energy-efficient cars are a top priority at Toyota Motor Manufacturing. Energy-efficient lighting is the priority for George Vickers, a specialist in environmental engineering for the Buffalo plant.\The West Virginia native has led the charge to replace the metal halide fixtures (similar to halogen) that have been in the plant since it started in 1996.\""There's nothing special about the new lights,"" Vickers insists, as he shows visitors the bright fluorescent fixtures that dot the ceiling of the vast plant. The fixtures are fairly old school: basic six-bulb fluorescent units. The modern twist involves more-efficient T8 bulbs and motion sensors.\""The original fixtures in the plant used a lot of energy, 440 watts,"" Vickers said. ""Also, they had a 'strike time.' If you turned off the light, you couldn't turn it back on for a while."" So between shifts, they had to leave the lights on. Now the new fixtures are on motion sensors, turning themselves off when there's no one around to need them, saving thousands of dollars in energy costs.\The T8 fluorescent tubes use 220 watts, or basically half the energy of the old metal halide fixtures.\It cost about $400,000 to change the lighting, but Vickers said he would see a full payback in less than two years from the energy cost savings and the rebate. Sun Control Inc. of Hurricane helped plan the lighting conversion.\American Electric Power is rebating $95 per light ($90 per fixture and $5 for the motion sensors). The rebate is formulated for each customer depending on the type of old lighting, new lights and other factors. Toyota will receive nearly $200,000 from AEP.\Toyota has electric meters, similar to the ones on the outside of a residence, on each line in the factory. Teams are challenged to meet energy savings goals with targets on each line.\""Not to get too philosophical, but at Toyota, we build it right the first time,"" Vickers said. ""That's the team's opportunity to get it right and to save energy by not having to redo things.""\Vickers is aware that fluorescents have mercury in them, a hazard to the environment, but he said the newer bulbs have a lower level of the element in them.\""And for home use, places like Home Depot will recycle old compact fluorescent bulbs,"" he added.\The process at Toyota started a year ago, and they have changed 2,000 fixtures, with 90 to go.\""The old lights are still in the places that are hardest to get to,"" Vickers pointed out, over the busiest and most intricate parts of the production line. As he walked through a part of the plant that was on break, the motion sensors detected his movement and lights came on to light his way. He noted that to use motion sensors, fluorescent fixtures have to have rapid-start ballasts. The sensors in the plant are programmed to turn off the lights after 20 minutes if there is no movement in the area.\Automation abounds and efficiency is key at the plant. Vickers noted that there are 450 working minutes in a day, and on that particular day they would produce 877 engines.\And it all takes place under 2,090 new light fixtures.\lawrence pierce | Sunday Gazette-Mail As owner of Wells Home Furnishings, John Wells researched new light bulbs for several years before selecting the Sylvania Ultra LED to use in his spotlights. Hes seeing thousands of dollars in savings from the new bulbs lower energy usage.\chris dorst | Sunday Gazette-Mail ABOVE: George Vickers, environmental engineering specialist for Toyota Motor Manufacturing in Buffalo, holds one of 2,090 new fluorescent lights that are being installed in the plant.

179,"NEW YORK - A first for ""10 Questions"". A request.\""Go ask the other coaches and players if they'd rather play in the Coliseum or in Charleston or Wheeling?"" West Virginia University Coach Gale Catlett said.\Little did he know during Wednesday's Big East Conference basketball media day that such an inquiry had been spread. Ten representatives from the league - the eight coaches who will play WVU in the Mountain State this year and two players who also will spread their geographical sights - were asked what their reaction was to missing a trip to the often-rowdy and loud Coliseum.\So in a format change, here are 10 answers to one question.\1. Kevin Bannon, Rutgers coach, March 4 at Wheeling: ""I think you do what you have to do. It's unfortunate, but it also makes it interesting. I can't speak from Gale's perspective. Maybe this will make it more difficult (for visiting teams). They're all tough on the road. What am I going to say?""\2. Ryan Blackwell, Syracuse senior forward, Jan. 11 at Charleston: ""(Morgantown's) a fun place to go. I'm not sure how it will affect them. When you have a crowd that gets in the game and taunts your players, it makes it a good atmosphere.""\3. Mario Bland, Miami (Fla.) senior center, Feb. 22 at Charleston: ""I think it will be a lot better for us. It's very hard when the fan base gets on you. We can be better focused in the game.""\4. Jim Boeheim, Syracuse coach, Jan. 11 at Charleston: ""(Morgantown) was a tough place to play. I don't know anything about Charleston. I'm just worried about what's out there. We still have to play West Virginia and it still will be a tough game. It's a good- sized arena, not one of those small places. But you just never know about things until you get there.""\5. Craig Esherick, Georgetown coach, Jan. 26 at Charleston: ""I'm not sure there's anything bad about this (for his team). If I was Coach Catlett, I wouldn't be too happy. It's certainly a greater (traveling) distance for us. But the West Virginia Coliseum, I played there. That is a tough place to play. I'm sure they'll bring that guy with the gun. Maybe he's the one who loosened up that asbestos.""\6. Leonard Hamilton, Miami coach, Feb. 22 at Charleston: ""I just wanted to make sure where we were playing. Whether we could get in and out as easy as possible. I felt like I had a lot of adversity at Miami. I'm sure Coach Catlett would not have wanted this. I have a little sympathy. But adversity like that has a tendency to bring you closer as a team.""\7. Ben Howland, Pittsburgh coach, Feb. 10 at Charleston: ""I've never been there. I think that's tough for West Virginia. Obviously, they are not going to be able to practice at the same facility. Still, it's 10 feet high and the same length. It won't make it any easier for us. I've heard they have great fans at West Virginia. They have the rowdiest fans in the league or some of the best.""\8. Mike Jarvis, St. John's coach, Jan. 8 at Wheeling: ""To be honest, I forgot where it was being played. I've never played in Wheeling. Sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don't know. By time the game gets there, we might wish we were back at the Coliseum. We finally got a win last year. Sometimes these things help bring teams together.""\9. Al Skinner, Boston College coach, Feb. 19 at Wheeling: ""I've always said the West Virginia Coliseum offers one of the best college environments you can play in. Those guys play extremely well at home. I've always been extremely pleased every time we won there. You kind of miss that. That's what college basketball is all about. Going out into these environments and trying to come out with a win. It was a great place to play (Skinner did so in 1974 as past of Massachusetts' team). That's all part of the experience.""\10. Tim Welsh, Providence coach, Jan. 30 at Wheeling: ""Obviously the Coliseum is one of the toughest places to play in the league. It would be like us going to Hartford every night to play a home game. Or Boston. Or New Hampshire.""\Writer Mike Cherry can be reached at 348-5170."
180," MORGANTOWN - Who really knows what Rich Rodriguez's early- scripted play selection was on Thursday night? It seemed something like this:\ Let's check out the ""Fridge,"" and pop open a running back.\ Steve Slaton, the back upon whom Maryland Coach Ralph Friedgen turned his back, turned the Terrapins inside-out at Mountaineer Field.\ By the time the ACC visitors corralled the West Virginia sophomore, it was 28-0, and he was dancing in Heisman Trophy voters heads as well as through would-be Terp tacklers.\ ""It wasn't the greatest way to start off,"" Friedgen said.\ It wasn't the greatest way to finish for the fifth-ranked Mountaineers, but against a rival that has been a tough out for WVU, even in defeat, Rodriguez will take a 45-24 victory.\ Scouts from 16 NFL teams watched this one, as did reps from the Orange and Fiesta bowls, but it's doubtful anyone was smiling more than Big East Conference Commissioner Mike Tranghese, watching the previously pirating ACC get turtle-waxed.\ Yes, the Mountaineers do not have a defense that can win a game, but right now, that WVU unit is kind of like former starting quarterback Rasheed Marshall was as a sophomore and junior in Coach Rodriguez's program:\ He wasn't being asked to win the game, just don't lose it. Ditto a defense that still needs to mature.\ The offense has more than plenty of firepower.\ In the last six home dates, WVU has scored 46, 45, 45, 42, 52 and 45 points. That's not just productivity; it's consistency.\ Slaton was headed for his third 200-yard rushing game - Amos Zereoue career record for the program - in the last four outings when he went backward to 195.\ It didn't matter, because WVU (3-0) has enough to complement him - and that means more than quarterback Patrick White.\ ""We lost to a very good football team, in a very tough environment,"" said Friedgen of the sellout crowd of 60,513 under the lights and before ESPN cameras. ""It's on national television ... it's embarrassing.""\ Slaton danced, dodged and darted through and around the Terps, so this might be a good time to go deeper than the well-reported fact that Friedgen admits he made a mistake in withdrawing a grant-in- aid offer to the once-committed running back who has hung his star here.\ Maybe that wasn't Friedgen's only huge recruiting mistake. In his first three Maryland seasons, his teams went a combined 31-8, with Orange, Peach and Gator (over WVU) bowls.\ He won mostly with ditched Coach Ron Vanderlinden's players. In the years since, while the Fridge's recruits have filled the two- deep, it's been a comparative deep-freeze, including 12 losses in the last 21 games.\ Friedgen's Maryland beat Rodriguez's Mountaineers in their first four meetings (2001-03) because the Terps were bigger and physically tougher. WVU has won the last three because the 'Eers have used their scheme and speed to unravel their rivals.\ The Terps' resiliency over the final three quarters after finding themselves down four touchdowns didn't faze Rodriguez.\ In the past against Maryland, it would have, but the proverbial worm turned in the fourth quarter at Byrd Stadium a year ago.\ Maryland couldn't afford to help the Mountaineers, and it did, especially on special teams, with two turnovers and allowing a 96- yard kickoff return TD by Darius Reynaud.\ The Terps' five turnovers were the first WVU has gained in three games, and plenty. When West Virginia wins the turnovers, it's 30-1 since the start of the 2002 season (the exception a 45-20 win at Central Florida in 2004).\ ""We gave up some things we shouldn't have given up,"" said WVU senior linebacker Jay Henry, who had his first career interception.\ ""We hit with a couple of blitzes, but we still need to get better pressure on the passer. We did get after it more than we did in the past two games.""\ At this point, however, Henry and his unit know WVU's best defense is the Mountaineers' good offense.\ After three home romps, the Mountaineers play only once at home (Syracuse, Oct. 14) in the next five games.\ Now, can they do it on the road?\ Contact Sports Editor Jack Bogaczyk at jackb@dailymail.com or 348- 7949.\ Credit: Daily Mail Sports Editor"
181," DAILY MAIL STAFF\ Despite the lack of home runs and RBIs, more than a thousand fans could still feel the power at Charlestons baseball park. But only if they were loyal West Virginia University Mountaineers. Pigskin fans sporting the blue and gold funneled into Appalachian Power Park, of all places, which showed the WVU football squads season opening victory over the Syracuse Orangemen on the jumbo screen Sunday. The event offered an alternative to Regatta a tailgating environment where youngsters played football in deep right field while beer- swilling adults sprawled out on blankets and lawn chairs. Admission was even free for this gridiron party, courtesy of the West Virginia Power and WVU. They oughta do this for every televised game, said Ray Thomlinson, 26, a WVU alum. They could even charge a couple of bucks to get in and make some money. Thomlinson ventured to the ballpark from his hometown, Huntington, with some friends to watch the game. He, like several other fans in attendance, cheered on the Eers as they came ahead 15-7 over their Big East rivals. According to the WVU Alumni Association, there are 11,350 Mountaineer alumni living in the Kanawha Valley. But not everyone at the ballpark was necessarily rooting for Coach Rich Rodriguezs team. Rod Toastman Blackstone, a Syracuse alumnus and assistant to Charleston Mayor Danny Jones, played his usual evil heckler role at the stadium. This time it was at a football game and against the home crowd. He even got soaked quite a few times in the dunk tank for his efforts, which ironically helped raise about $200 for the WVU Alumni Association. Its fun heckling people, said Blackstone, sans burnt toast. I had to be, Cmon. Lets see what you Mountaineer fans have. Blackstone, who was instrumental in the development of the new ballpark, said Sundays gathering showed that the stadium can be used for non- baseball events. Just look at the Blue and Gold, Blackstone said. This is marvelous. The ballpark is the center of the community where people can gather and have fun. Even Blackstones colleague, City Manager David Molgaard, a WVU alumnus, tried dunking him. He missed, but Molgaards son didnt. Molgaard believes the ballpark should host televised games until the weather turns nasty. Its a great use of the field considering the baseball seasons over, he said. The first 1,000 fans through the gates received a special rally rag giveaway. Fans also had a shot at other prizes throughout the day, including football game tickets. Folks lined up at the ballpark concessions all day for hot dogs and beverages, and the Kids Zone stayed open for youngsters. The WVU Pep Band even played some tunes to rally the crowd. It was almost like being in Morgantown, except there wasnt a massive couch burning in centerfield. Contact writer Jake Stump at jakestump@dailymail.com or 348-4842."
182," BLACKSBURG, Va. - Rich Rodriguez said his surprising football team ""had matured throughout the year.""\ He's right, but what occurred on Wednesday night in a college football environment in which most visitors melt was really about more than one team in one game during one season.\ It was Rodriguez's West Virginia program that grew up at noisy Lane Stadium. If the young head coach is to take WVU to the top, it is this night that many 'Eers will remember as the first significant step in that climb.\ Not satisfied just to complete the longest pass of the 21-game Rodriguez era, the Mountaineers ran through - and then stuffed - 13th-ranked and sliding Virginia Tech, 21-18.\ It was more than a rivalry rekindled. It was in prime time, on national TV. It wasn't the only game in town. It was the only game period, unless you count the Preseason NIT.\ If you were watching the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on CBS, then you missed the Mountaineers parading down the runway into national consciousness. Suddenly, this WVU season is about more than going from 3-8 to 8-3.\ ""It's too early to call this a statement game for our program,"" Rodriguez said.\ Pul-leeeeze. That's rich.\ Until two weeks ago, naysayers said WVU's turnaround was, well, see-through lingerie. WVU hadn't beaten a team with a winning record.\ ""People were looking at us like we were bums,"" star running back Avon Cobourne said. ""I mean, bums.""\ Then, WVU handled Boston College, which had won at Notre Dame. A solid victory.\ This one, however, was on the road, as an eight-point underdog, against a program in a 10th straight bowl season, against a team that was ranked - OK, over-ranked - at No. 3 in early November.\ Twenty seasons ago, WVU went to ninth-ranked Oklahoma and pulled off a 41-27 shocker - the signature triumph early in the Don Nehlen years.\ That September 1982 game was the last time an unranked West Virginia team won on the road against a ranked team, until BeamerBall was thwarted by an impressive goal-line stand, then something that has made a difference all year for WVU.\ A turnover. Tech's only one. Figuring how WVU has clinched at least third place in the Big East is a big easy. The Mountaineers have a 17-2 takeaway bulge in five league wins.\ Where this puts Rodriguez's team is seemingly headed for the Insight Bowl in Phoenix on Dec. 26, against the No. 4 selection in a wild Pacific 10 scramble. UCLA? The Oregon-Oregon State winner? Arizona State in its own neighborhood?\ And as if the annual Pitt game needs added fervor, it's floating up the Monongahela River right now. If Pittsburgh loses at Miami tonight, the Mountaineers and Panthers could be playing Nov. 30 at Heinz Field for a Gator Bowl bid.\ The only way West Virginia wouldn't go Gator by beating Pitt is if the Jacksonville game chooses Maryland on the ACC side. A Terps- Mountaineers rematch won't happen.\ Still, WVU should be ranked Sunday for the first time since October 1998. Even as recently as October 2002, who would have thought that?"
183," DAILY MAIL SPORTS EDITOR\ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The Big East has embraced its newest basketball exposure. It's going to take hoops from the largest Division I conference into markets where it hasn't played previously.\ The SEC/Big East Invitational made its doubleheader debut Wednesday night before 10,481 at the 16,802-seat Birmingham- Jefferson Civic Center.\ Tonight, it plays a twinbill at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia.\ Where next?\ That's a good question.\ About the only certainty for the Big East is that the four teams scheduled into the inaugural two-night event - Georgetown, West Virginia, Villanova and Providence - won't play again during the four-year SEC/Big East arrangement.\ ""We're close and, hopefully, will have something on next season by the first of the year,"" said Dan Gavitt, the Big East associate commissioner for basketball operations, before Wednesday's tipoff. ""Really, it's like putting together a big puzzle.""\ That involves teams from both conferences, arenas that will be neutral sites for all, ESPN telecast windows and even exam schedules at some schools that could affect who plays and when.\ ESPN owns the event and Gavitt said the network brought up the possibility of a challenge series during negotiations with the conference on a new, six-year basketball telecast contract that began this season.\ The network was looking for quality hoops matchups to fill an early December void between the end of college football season and the start of the bowl schedule.\ ""I think the SEC already had been looking around at the possibility of a challenge series when ESPN brought it to us,"" Gavitt said. ""They'd already talked a bit with the Big 12 and Pac- 10 (leagues that since have gotten together on their own non- conference series).""\ Big East athletic directors at the eight football members also like the new basketball series because the stronger relationship could foster inroads in football scheduling with the SEC.\ Each conference will have a ""home site"" in its regional footprint annually. Every Big East team will play once in the series. Four members in the 12-team SEC will receive a second appearance to complete the contract.\ ""You want to have quality matchups and games that make sense,"" said Pete Derzis, senior vice president and general manager of ESPN Regional Television.\ ""You want teams that are attractive because some are from the region (where games are played) and others are top programs.""\ Besides the 2007 debut location, arena cities under consideration as ""SEC sites"" are Tampa, Atlanta, Memphis and Nashville.\ The ""Big East sites"" up for discussion after Philly include Chicago, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and the New York metropolitan area, where Madison Square Garden, the new Prudential Center in Newark, Continental Airlines Arena (Meadowlands) and a new building in Brooklyn could be used.\ Providence meets South Carolina and LSU faces Villanova tonight in Philadelphia.\ * n n\ HOW GOOD have the Big East and SEC been in basketball in recent history? A team from one of those two leagues has won the national championship four of the past five years and seven of the past 12.\ * n n\ GEORGETOWN started the first SEC/Big East show by pulling away in the final minutes for a 70-60 victory over Alabama. The Hoyas (6-0) used a 16-rebound advantage to pull-away after the early going was played at a much quicker pace than Georgetown likes.\ ""There's no other way to articulate that our defense just wasn't good,"" Hoyas Coach John Thompson III said. ""Alabama kept getting edges and open shots. You have to give them credit.\ ""We gave up 35 points in the first half and that's significantly more than we have been giving up all year. I think we were a little more attentive, communicated a little better and mixed things up in the second half.""\ The Crimson Tide (4-2) was only 8-of-24 from the field in the final 20 minutes.\ * n n\ THE SERIES inaugural brought out a who's who of basketball and college athletics. Sitting court-side were NBA scouting legend Marty Blake and Memphis Grizzlies' General Manager - and Buckhannon native - Chris Wallace.\ Also on hand were retired former Kentucky Athletic Director and Vanderbilt and Alabama Coach C.M. Newton, who is a past president of USA Basketball; and retired Coach Sonny Smith, who led programs at East Tennessee State, Auburn and Virginia Commonwealth.\ SEC Commissioner Mike Slive, this year's Bowl Championship Series coordinator, also made the short walk from the conference office to the downtown arena for the doubleheader.\ * n n\ POOR AUBURN had played just once in its first five games at home, including curious contests at Alabama State and Charleston (S.C.) Southern. The SEC-Big East Invitational was supposed to provide a friendlier environment.\ It did not.\ Much of the Alabama student section that watched the Crimson Tide lose to Georgetown in the night's first game stayed just to jeer rival Auburn in the second game.\ By the time WVU pushed its lead to 20 points in the middle of the first half, they were cheering for the Mountaineers. It didn't change must the rest of the game and that coupled with a smattering of gold-clad WVU fans gave the visiting team an edge.\ ""I knew they'd be cheering against Auburn,"" Alex Ruoff said. ""I didn't expect them to support us as much as they did.""\ * n n\ ONE STUDENT had a large dry-erase board on which he scribbled various messages throughout the game and showed them off to taunt Auburn.\ A sampling:\ ""Who invited Auburn?""\ ""This isn't even fair! 53-29? Go 'Eers!""\ ""We were in our game.""\ When WVU left the floor at halftime and headed to its locker room, the team passed the students. The student held a sign that read, ""Y'all are sick!""\ Once the game got really out of hand, he raised a sign to show the score.\ ""Ruoff 28, Auburn 43.""\ * n n\ IT WASN'T the best offensive night for senior point guard Darris Nichols, who missed five of his seven shots. Perhaps, his introduction was a sign of things to come. The Radford, Va., native was announced as being from Scott Depot, hometown of walk-on Josh Sowards.\ * n n\ REDSHIRT FRESHMAN Cam Thoroughman made his season debut with 4:55 remaining. Thoroughman, a 6-foot-7 forward from Portsmouth, Ohio, partially tore his left medial collateral ligament and dislocated his kneecap in early September.\ He didn't need surgery, but still was slowed at the start of practice.\ He missed his only shot against the Tigers, but managed one highlight. As Auburn tried to grab a loose ball under WVU's basket, Thoroughman dived in with his team ahead by 35 points, got the ball and fired it to Will Thomas, who slipped a pass to Joe Mazzulla for a layup.\ Sportswriter Mike Casazza contributed to this report."
184,"At LSU, at night, the Tigers are a different animal.\If it's not a tough enough assignment for West Virginia when it becomes the first team in Big East history to play at Tiger Stadium, the No. 22 Mountaineers get a 15th-ranked LSU team in a 9 p.m. kickoff (EDT) Saturday.\Prepared for playing in front of what figures to be a capacity crowd - or near it - of 92,400?\Well, last Saturday, a sellout crowd of 60,122 at Mountaineer Field was repeatedly given credit for its ""12th Man"" effort during a 31-17 WVU victory over Maryland by the home team's players and Coach Bill Stewart.\""Since 2007 (when WVU was playing its way toward a national title bid, in the running with LSU as well, before crashing against Pitt), this was the loudest it's been,"" West Virginia senior defensive lineman Scooter Berry said. ""That played really big in the game ... and that's why they have crowd favorites in video games.""\However, Mountaineer Field in the noonday sun isn't Tiger Stadium under the lights, as will be evident in Saturday's ESPN2 telecast of unbeatens. Two Mountaineers who grew up as Alabamans in SEC Country know that.\""Those people down there live and die with football,"" said WVU senior special teamer Trippe Hale, whose Mobile, Ala., roots include life with a father, Steve, who is president and CEO of the Senior Bowl. ""Playing at LSU is a lot to look forward to.\""I've been to quite a few games there. My best friend played for LSU. They try to intimidate you. It's serious stuff. For us, we have to try and be ready for the environment, and have fun with it. You don't play in many atmospheres like that.\""You just can't let it get to you.""\Hale remarked how the loud crowd last Saturday in Morgantown contributed to Terps' jitters early, as well as numerous false start and delay of game penalties. He said the LSU crowd will try and do the same to the Mountaineers.\WVU sophomore receiver Coley White, of Daphne, Ala. (the Mobile outskirts) also experienced Tiger Stadium first-hand when he went to Baton Rouge with his older brother, Pat, on one of the latter's visits during the recruiting process.\""They're good fans, and it's very, very loud,"" White said of what awaits the Mountaineers. ""It's loud here, like it was (against Maryland), but they have more than 20,000 more fans there.\""People hype it because it's SEC football, and football is really big down there. We've been to other SEC stadiums, like Auburn and Mississippi State, so some of us know what it might be like. But you just have to go play the way you know how.""\This season, the SEC's average crowd is larger than 76,000. Seven of the 12 SEC stadiums seat more than 80,000.\Stewart's 2009 club visited Auburn, where the Mountaineers played before a prime-time crowd of 87,451 - the third largest attendance for a game in WVU history.\West Virginia committed five turnovers and lost 41-30 - the only time in 61 games since 2000 that the 'Eers have scored 30 or more and lost. The game at LSU - the Tigers return to Morgantown in 2011 - marks the sixth straight year WVU has played an SEC team.\West Virginia topped Georgia in the Sugar Bowl to end the 2005 season, then played home-and-homes with Mississippi State and Auburn - and now LSU.\* n n\IF THE Tigers reach or closely approach capacity Saturday, WVU will play before the second-largest crowd to witness a game in 199 seasons of Mountaineer football history.\However, if that history is an indicator, that's not good news.\West Virginia has lost every time before the top 17 crowds it has seen.\Those numbers include seven games at Penn State, four Gator Bowls, two games at Notre Dame, one each at Ohio State, Auburn and Wisconsin, and the Jan. 1, 1994 Sugar Bowl loss to Florida at the Superdome.\The largest crowd to see a WVU victory was 75,008 at Oklahoma's Owen Field, for a Sept. 11, 1982 triumph over the No. 9 Sooners that put coach Don Nehlen's WVU program on the national map.\The largest crowd for a WVU game was 96,445 at Beaver Stadium in 1991, the last home game for Penn State in its long rivalry with WVU - a 51-6 Nittany Lion romp. Next is 88,272 for a 24-3 Buckeyes' win at the Horseshoe in 1987.\Looking ahead to large venues, WVU is scheduled to visit Doak Campbell Stadium (82,300) at Florida State in 2012, and go to Michigan State's Spartan Stadium (75,005) in 2015.\* n n\WEST VIRGINIA'S visit to Baton Rouge is a Big East first in the conference's 20 seasons of football.\The only Big East team to play LSU, period, in those two decades was Virginia Tech, which downed the Tigers 26-8 in a 2002 season-opening Black Coaches Classic at Lane Stadium.\Even when pre-Big East football days are considered, there have been few dates with the Tigers for any of the 12 schools that have played in the league. WVU, Pitt, Temple, Louisville, Cincinnati, Connecticut and USF haven't met the Bayou Bengals.\Syracuse played LSU in two bowls (1964 Sugar, 1989 Hall of Fame). LSU visited Rutgers way back in 1922. The Hokies had the 2002 home date. Boston College had a home-and-home with LSU in 1946 and '53.\Miami (Fla.) had 12 games with the Tigers - 11 before Big East play and once since the Hurricanes moved to the ACC - a 2005 Peach Bowl highlighted by a fight in a Georgia Dome tunnel.\* n n\FINALLY, THE Big East has made it into a huge weekend for the conference's football reputation in 2010 thanks to the performance in the first three weeks of the season.\It started with Pitt's date at Heinz Field on Thursday night (that one finished after Mountaineer Gameday was put to bed).

185," WASHINGTON - When it comes to global warming, the Bush administration puts its faith in volunteerism and new energy technologies to scale back America's Everest of heat-trapping gases.\ But government studies say the results are at best uncertain.\ One thing is not: Each year, the mountain of ""greenhouse"" gases emitted by the United States grows bigger.\ While the rest of the developed world requires - but isn't always achieving - mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide and other emissions, the nation adding the most gases to the atmosphere is deadlocked in a debate over how to deal with it. Individual states, meanwhile, are taking the lead.\ Voluntary programs emphasized by President Bush since 2002 are claimed to be sparing the atmosphere 300 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, or 4 percent of U.S. emissions.\ But the government doesn't know - and often can't verify - whether the reductions reported by 230 U.S. companies are real.\ ""It's difficult to prove,"" said Paul McArdle, who manages the Energy Department's voluntary reporting system. ""It's my sense that some of these are real reductions.""\ What's more, McArdle acknowledged, companies can increase their emissions overall but still claim cutbacks - by counting as reductions such steps as replacing old lighting, using more efficient vehicles or planting trees.\ In a review last April, Congress' Government Accountability Office questioned Washington's ability to monitor these voluntary efforts. ""Determining the reductions attributable to each program will be challenging,"" it said.\ In one program with measurable results, it estimated companies have reduced emissions by no more than 0.5 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution. Total U.S. emissions - now more than 7 billion tons a year - still are projected to rise 14 percent from 2002 to 2012.\ Carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the biggest of the greenhouse gases, so called because they create a heat-trapping blanket when released into the atmosphere. Others are methane, nitrous oxide and synthetic gases. The atmosphere holds more carbon dioxide now than it has for hundreds of thousands of years, and the Earth's surface warmed an average 1 degree over the past century.\ As a first step, the White House talks of reducing the ""intensity"" of U.S. carbon pollution - not shrinking emissions overall, but reducing the carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic growth.\ ""Our objective is to significantly slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and, as the science justifies, stop it and then reverse it,"" said James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ""We're making good progress. It's reasonably ambitious, but it still provides for reasonable human welfare.""\ Shortly after taking office, President Bush rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which requires 36 industrial nations to cut global warming gases by 2012 by an average 5 percent below 1990 levels.\ He argued that cutting the U.S. share to below 6 billion tons a year, as the treaty would have required, would have cost 5 million U.S. jobs. He objected, too, that such high-polluting developing nations as China and India are not required to reduce emissions.\ Some members of Congress agree with the gradualist Bush approach, while others do not, Republicans among them.\ ""Everybody's talking about it. What the American people want is for somebody to start doing something about it,"" complained Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., House Science Committee chairman.\ ""If we can't make a relatively simple change in [automobile] mileage regulations - a change to an existing regulation that doesn't even require new technology and that would have numerous benefits aside from the climate implications - then what does that say about our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?"" Boehlert said. ""It certainly doesn't say anything good.""\ Instead, the United States is spending $3 billion each year researching technologies to cut global warming and $2 billion on climate research. In a program called the Asia-Pacific Partnership, Bush also is working with Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea - producers of half the world's greenhouse gases - to attract private money for cleaner energy technologies.\ Connaughton calls that joint effort a major breakthrough. Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, calls it an ""excuse for further delay.""\ Bush envisions using more hydrogen-powered vehicles, electricity from renewable energy sources and clean coal technology.\ The Energy Department's technology program has helped build 34,000 new energy-efficient homes and it plans to create ""bioenergy"" research centers and to advance research into hydrogen fuel and fusion energy. Its director, Stephen Eule, promises breakthroughs in the coming decades.\ Scientists say climate disruptions may occur before that, however, and critics in Congress and elsewhere say the government effort is too slow and needs refocusing.\ The plan ""appears stalled near the starting line,"" said Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who chairs a House subcommittee overseeing the program. A review in May by the Energy Department's own research lab in Oak Ridge, Tenn., said the program focuses too much on work that can lead to ""only incremental improvements."" It called for more emphasis on ""exploratory, out-of-the-box concepts.""\ A new government economic analysis sees markets in combination with research as the way to go.\ The Congressional Budget Office report last month said any cost- effective U.S. policy on global warming must put a price on carbon - via an emissions tax or a ""cap and trade"" system of buying and selling emissions allowances among companies, as in Europe.\ States aren't waiting for Washington.\ On Sept. 28, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed California legislation imposing a first-in-the-nation emissions cap on utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020.\ An earlier California law ordered 30 percent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. And Schwarzenegger and British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans this summer to work toward a possible joint emissions-trading market.\ Such a market pact is close to becoming reality among eight Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, which plan to impose caps on power plant emissions and encourage trading of allowances among utilities. Twenty-eight states in all have drawn up plans to combat warming, with some - notably Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico and North Carolina - also working toward possible mandatory limits on gases. Ten states plan to enact California's auto rule, if it survives a current court challenge.\ Credit: The Associated Press"
186,"The Building Conference is a simply named yet broadly targeted event coming to Morgantown. It will speak to anyone who works or lives in, designs or redesigns, or fixes or owns buildings that are old, new or yet to be built in West Virginia.\In short, just about everybody who has a stake in the quality of the places where we spend so much time, says Sarah Halstead of the nonprofit group WV GreenWorks, one of the sponsors of the Jan. 31-Feb. 2 event at the Waterfront Place Hotel.\After all, the state's ""built environment,"" as she sums it up, is shorthand for the homes, buildings, offices and spaces where people live, work and spend most of their daily existence.\""It's our big chance to really accelerate the general public's understanding of energy efficiency and healthy building concepts. And it's certainly a chance for all the players in the state to get on the same page so we can work better together for better results,"" she said.\WV GreenWorks brought together West Virginia University, West Virginia State University and the state chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council to advance the cause of what she calls ""sustainable building.""\The conference (more details and online registration at thebuildingconfer ence.com) has attracted a mix of heavy hitters. These include both international design and housing figures, policy-makers and people working across the state on affordable housing, downtown revival and healthier, more efficient buildings.\One keynote speaker is Cameron Sinclair, co-founder of Architecture for Humanity and author of the book ""Design Like You Give a Damn,"" who emphasizes the significance of neighborhood and community in design decisions.\Another speaker, Scott Horst, is a senior vice president of the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED program, an influential and ever-evolving voluntary green and sustainable building standard.\""LEED, version 4, is his baby,"" Halstead noted.\The conference's four concurrent tracks - Residential Performance, Commercial Innovation, Education and Facilities and Sustainable Communities - illustrate that no building or community structure really falls outside the event's scope, Halstead said.\""A concentration on fixing what we've got is a serious theme in this conference,"" she said. ""A lot of time people will ask contractors: 'What can I do with this building?' The contractor will often say 'you can't do much with these old buildings, they weren't built to be energy efficient.' That's not always true.""\If a building can't be retrofitted to healthier, more sustainable standards, it can be responsibly 'deconstructed', recycling valuable materials, dumping less waste into landfills and offering owners tax write-offs.\WV GreenWorks has partnered with the national nonprofit group ReUse People of America, whose founder, Ted Reiff, is another keynote speaker. His group has pioneered an approach for deconstructing old buildings, work they showcased a couple years ago with a Putnam County building.\""We've talked for about a year about how to help all these communities that have dilapidated buildings,"" Halstead said. ""What's the business model for helping these people out? There's never a budget; property values are driven down. Think about a model at this conference that will work for everyone all over West Virginia.""\A sampling of conference topics (see sidebar) also reveals how some topics specifically address building owners, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) workers, the building supply industry and anyone involved in retrofitting or building healthier, more contemporary structures.\Or, for that matter, teachers and others looking ahead to West Virginia's future, said Halstead. ""We'd love to get teachers and HVAC people - they've got special love at this conference.""\Appalachian Power, another event sponsor, is offering 10 scholarships to building industry workers to cover conference registration, available to general contractors and HVAC and insulation pros.\In line with this hands-on approach, WV GreenWorks, partnering with Think Green Midwest and Advanced Energy's Quality-Assured Professional for HVAC program, offers a Jan. 30 pre-conference training to certify more HVAC contractors to assist with the latest Energy Star V3 qualification for single and multi-family homes.\Such certification is a practical consideration in West Virginia, since Habitat for Humanity and affordable housing folks who handle federal funds require HVAC professionals with this certification.\And an Energy Star-certified home will hold appeal to anyone wary of rising utility costs, Halstead said.\""Everybody thinks of the Energy Star logo on an appliance. You know there's some kind of energy efficiency standard it has passed. It's the same for a house. An Energy Star home is pretty much certified to save between 15 and 30 percent ... on utilities.""\There are also DIY (do it yourself) Genius Sessions, featuring people who've built modern, yet low-cost or no-cost energy efficient, off-the-grid homes, said Halstead.\""They're coming out to tell how they've done it. You're going to get the most honest scoop about straw bale, geo-thermal, solar, wind. These are people who have been there and done that.""\Halstead acknowledges the conference has taken on a lot. But that's because the places where people live and work are essential to productivity, happiness and the overall health and attractiveness of a community.\""It looks like we're covering so much. That's because everything is connected. It's time that we looked holistically at how our environment performs and how we are interacting with our environment.\She acknowledges that some in the building trades ""do not want to be associated with talking about green standards.\""But the health, comfort and productivity of your occupant is of primary importance. I would not like to find out they've lowered the bill using materials that off-gas and made my work force sick.\""We think this is an unprecedented time to move past the rhetoric, past all the kind of talk that keeps people from coming together. We think this conference offers a chance for real, civil dialogue.""\In session\Here's a sampling of some sessions pulled from the schedule of The Building Conference, set for Jan. 31-Feb. 2 at The Waterfront Hotel in Morgantown.

187,"WASHINGTON - The new Republican-controlled Congress is facing an old problem: where to find the money for highway and transit programs. With gasoline prices at their lowest in years when the new Congress convened, there had been talk that it might be time to raise federal gas and diesel taxes, which haven't budged in more than 20 years.\But already, GOP leaders are tamping down expectations, leaving no clear solution to the funding problem.\""I don't know of any support for a gas tax increase in Congress, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the No. 2 Senate GOP leader, said flatly. Explained Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.: ""They don't want to vote for a tax increase.\House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, while not closing the door entirely, said there aren't enough votes in the House for a gas tax increase. Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman, was equally dampening.\""The president has ruled out a gas tax. I don't think there's a will in Congress, and the American people don't want it, Shuster recently told The Associated Press.\The gas tax, now 18.4 cents a gallon, and the diesel fuel tax, now 24.4 cents a gallon, were last increased in 1993. In the meantime, Americans are driving less per capita, cars are more fuel efficient and construction costs have gone up. Fuel taxes bring in about $34 billion a year to the federal Highway Trust Fund, but the government spends about $50 billion a year. The trust fund has been the main source of federal transportation aid to states for more than 60 years.\In that environment, two key GOP senators - Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah and Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe of Oklahoma - had raised the hopes of transportation advocates by saying raising fuel taxes should be considered, using the more politically palatable term ""user fees. But the idea appears to be a longshot at best.\Congress has kept transportation programs teetering on the edge of insolvency since 2008 by repeatedly transferring just enough funds from the general treasury - and making corresponding spending cuts elsewhere in the federal budget - to meet obligations for a few more months or, in one case, as long as two years. Finding acceptable spending cuts to offset the transfers gets more difficult each time.\The latest funding patch cleared Congress last August only about three hours before the Transportation Department said it would begin cutting back aid payments to states. That fix is only expected to last through May, when Congress will be back where it started unless lawmakers act sooner.\""The political support for increasing taxes to pay for transportation appears to be very limited, said Joshua Schank, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a think tank.\A majority of Americans think the economic benefits of good transportation outweigh the cost, but they can't agree on how to pay for new highways or repairs of old ones. An Associated Press-GfKpoll last summer, before the plunge in gas prices, showed 58 percent opposed raising federal gasoline taxes to pay for repair, replacement or expansion of roads and bridges. Only 14 percent supported an increase.\President Barack Obama has previously rejected a gas tax increase, instead proposing to close corporate tax loopholes and use the revenue to pay for infrastructure. His plan would boost highway spending 22 percent and transit spending 70 percent over four years.\Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told a transportation conference this week that's still the administration's preferred option, but he also expressed ""openness to ideas that emerge from Congress.\Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., the No. 3 Senate GOP leader, who helped raise speculation that a fuel tax increase might be possible when he said all possible funding options should be considered, including a gas tax increase, this week described such a possibility as ""unlikely.\""I can't see a scenario for some sort of user fee increase that you'd have to offset with tax relief in some other area, he told reporters. ""Nobody is going to vote for a gas tax increase.\Instead, Thune said, closing tax loopholes, especially those that encourage corporations to move overseas, and using the money to pay for infrastructure is his ""preferred option. But he also observed that ""tax increases are always hard, and there's a perception that we ought to be able to find savings in other areas to fund infrastructure.\A person gets fuel after gas prices dropped below $2 a gallon at the Quick Mart in High Point, N.C., Wednesday.\Credit: JOAN LOWY The Associated Press"
188," WASHINGTON - House Transportation Committee leaders are thinking about increasing the federal gas tax to sustain the nation's deteriorating highways, but others in the House say that's unlikely with gas prices at near-record highs.\ Transportation Committee Chairman Don Young, R-Alaska, and top Democratic member James Oberstar of Minnesota say they need $375 billion over the next six years just to maintain and make some improvements to the highway system.\ They have asked for $50 billion for the 2004 budget year for highway and transit programs, compared with the $36.5 billion President Bush proposed.\ ""The economy cannot continue to grow without a transportation system that moves people and goods efficiently,"" Young told the House Budget Committee this week. He added that there is no longer a choice between raising or not raising more revenues. ""Rather, our choice is between different methods of adjusting them.""\ One method being mulled is indexing the gas tax for inflation, retroactive to the last change in 1993. That would boost the federal tax, currently 18.4 cents a gallon, by about 5.4 cents. State gas taxes average an additional 22 cents per gallon.\ Other possibilities are raising the tax two cents a year through 2009, taxing ethanol at the same rate as gasoline or stopping the practice of transferring interest from the highway trust fund - money from the gas tax dedicated to highway programs - to the general Treasury fund.\ The current six-year highway program, which expires this year, was funded at $218 billion, but lawmakers say that spending level falls far short of current. needs.etter to the Budget Committee signed by 74 of the 75 Transportation Committee members cited a Transportation Department report estimating it would require $53 billion a year just to keep highways and transit systems in their current conditions. About $75 billion a year would be needed to improve highway safety and reduce congestion.\ The only member not to sign was Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. An aide to DeMint, who plans a Senate race next year, said the congressman opposed a tax increase to pay for the jump in spending.\ Oberstar, in promoting more highway spending to the Budget Committee, said traffic congestion costs the nation close to $100 billion a year. He also said there are now 750,000 unemployed construction workers, up 42 percent from two years ago, and that every $1 billion of federal highway spending creates 47,500 jobs.\ But Republican leadership aides said the idea of a gas tax increase was not going to fly in a GOP-led Congress trying to cut taxes and in an environment where fuel prices are soaring. The Energy Department predicted Thursday that pump prices would reach a record national high of $1.76 a gallon in April.\ Wayne Brough, chief economist for the conservative Citizens for a Sound Economy, said talk of a gas tax hike ""is ill-timed at best.""\ ""A new gas tax does nothing to renew fiscal discipline,"" he said in a statement. ""Rather, it encourages the status quo by ignoring the need to establish new priorities with respect to federal spending.""\ Brough noted that President Franklin Roosevelt signed the gas tax into law as a temporary measure to boost flagging tax revenues during the Depression.\ Renewing the highway program is likely to be one of the tougher tasks Congress has this year.\ The Bush administration, trying to steer a massive tax cut plan through Congress while paying for a possible war with Iraq, is expected to recommend a spending figure far less than the $375 billion over six years sought by Young and Oberstar. Many Republicans, while behind the president's tax cuts, see greater highway spending as key to serving their constituents.\ On the Net: Transportation Committee: www.house.gov/ transportation"
189,"A tax on virtue or a matter of fairness? The question ripples through states trying to prop up their ever-shrinking highway funds while eyeing the ""free ride enjoyed by green vehicle owners. The fast-growing cohort of people who drive zero- and low-emission cars and trucks can take satisfaction in their lower environmental footprint. But there's a downside, at least for states and the federal government: When cars gas up at the pump less often, governments collect fewer fuel tax dollars for highway needs. The lost revenue is just a part of the well-documented decline in highway funds as the federal gas tax remains static, auto fleets achieve ever-higher fuel efficiency and new technology enables alternative fuels.\Enter the notion of recouping at least some lost revenue by charging special fees to alternative vehicles - notwithstanding ongoing efforts by Washington and many states to instead encourage these vehicles through income tax credits, lower registration fees and even free parking spaces. The fees are meeting sporadic success, rankling many drivers and environmentalists.\Lawmakers in Virginia touched a nerve last year with a new $64 annual tax on the state's 91,000 hybrid owners, 90 percent of them from the northern part of the state near Washington, D.C. Objections, immediate and loud, spurred a petition that garnered more than 7,700 signatures.\Hybrid owners felt singled out for a double whammy, because hybrids using both gas and electric power are still subject to gas taxes when they fill up. Additionally, some bigger hybrids use more gas - paying more fuel tax - than new, highly efficient, gas-powered cars that were not covered by the new fee, said Democratic state Del. Scott Surovell, who spearheaded the repeal petition. It was akin to charging nonsmokers for not paying their fair share of tobacco taxes - taxing people for doing the right thing, he said. The legislature repealed the tax this year.\""The takeaway is: Don't start taxing energy efficient behavior that you are trying to encourage, said Surovell. He said governments instead should figure out how to subsidize clean vehicles until they are widely affordable.\Virginia, however, did retain its annual tax on vehicles using solely electric power, raising the previous $50 fee to $64.\The notion of a fair-share tax resonates with many people for electric-power cars. North Carolina and Colorado this year joined Washington and Nebraska in charging electric-vehicle owners annual fees - $50 in Colorado, $75 in Nebraska and $100 in North Carolina and Washington. Drivers of hybrids so far have been spared in those states.\""Having EV drivers contribute a modest fee is a reasonable and common-sense approach to maintaining our roads and highways, said Tom Turrentine, director of the Plug-in Hybrid Electric and Vehicle Research Center at the University of California-Davis.\It only hurts the political cause of obtaining government incentives for alternative-fuel vehicles if EV drivers balk at paying such ""fair share taxes, Turrentine said.\Government incentives for green vehicles have helped narrow the price gap between EVs and gas-powered models. That includes the popular leasing market, where companies can receive rebates and incorporate them into leasing fees, Turrentine said. The growth in gas-electric hybrid sales makes them no longer eligible for federal rebates.\While a few states have raised taxes on gasoline, anti-tax politics often work in favor of EV drivers facing special-fee proposals, said Democratic state Sen. Steve Farley of Arizona. Farley has argued against ""economic injustice in seeking a 1-cent per mile tax on electric vehicles, or $120 a year for an average 12,000 miles on the odometer. But he has not persuaded fellow lawmakers, despite Arizona's sinking highway revenues and its 18-cent gas tax, unchanged since 1992.\""Electric cars are one of the reasons the gas tax is dying. While they may be a small percent of the market right now, they are going to get bigger and bigger. Anyone driving an electric car is getting out of paying anything for the roads they are driving, Farley said. With too few electric vehicles to generate anything close to needed highway revenues anyway, he is now pushing for a task force to come up with long-term highway funding options.\U.S. sales of electric and hybrid vehicles more than doubled between 2010 and 2013, to nearly 600,000, but still comprise just 4.8 percent of the overall light-vehicle market, according to WardsAuto, a professional information services company that tracks the auto industry. Of those, 83 percent are non-plug-in hybrids.\Incentives in at least 39 states and the District of Columbia encourage EV and hybrid use, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Among many examples cited by NCSL:\* Use of HOV lanes with only one person in the car is a popular incentive for EVs and/or hybrids in many states.\* EV or alternative-fuel vehicle registration fees or license taxes are reduced in Illinois, Arizona and Iowa.\* Salt Lake City and California cities of Sacramento, San Jose, Hermosa Beach and Santa Monica, and the state of Hawaii offer free parking spaces for EVs. Hawaii requires parking lots bigger than 100 spaces to have at least one EV parking space and a charging station. Some cities offer free parking for hybrids and alternative-fuel vehicles.\* New Jersey exempts EVs from state sales and use tax.\* State rebates or tax credits range from $1,000 in Maryland to $6,000 in Colorado.\* At the federal level, a tax credit of up to $7,500 brings down the price of owning or leasing a plug-in EV.\* Colorado has a new $50 tax for plug-in electric vehicles and uses the revenue not just for highway maintenance but to further encourage EV usage. Twenty dollars of the $50 goes to electric charging station infrastructure. At the same time the state extended its tax credit of up to $6,000 for EV and hybrid purchases through 2021.\* In Washington state, electric vehicles are exempted from the new-car sales tax, but subject to an extra $100 registration renewal fee. The state has some 5,400 registered all-electric vehicles, but they don't pay that registration fee in the first year of ownership. Since launching the fee in early 2013, the state has realized $252,600 in revenue.\Critics worry that the special fees could dampen enthusiasm for the clean vehicle market, especially while sticker prices outpace the price tags of comparable conventional models.\""It's the kind of disincentive that those who oppose clean vehicles want. They want you to think twice before switching from gas-powered engines, said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, which fights global warming. The modest revenue anticipated from such fees still doesn't provide a way out of the highway funding crisis, Becker noted, nor should alternative-fuel motorists be responsible for the failure of that funding system.\North Carolina's new $100-a-year tax will tap only the 1,600 EV vehicles currently registered in the state. ""It penalizes them for doing their part to reduce our dependence on oil, said Elizabeth Ouzts, state director of Environment North Carolina.\But state Sen. Neal Hunt, a Republican sponsor of North Carolina's fee, called it ""a matter of equitable treatment, adding, ""Electric vehicles use these roads so they should help pay maintenance and construction costs.\Nebraska's $75-a-year fee applies to any car powered entirely by an alternative fuel that's not already taxed. Bill Moore, publisher of the online publication EV World, considers it fair but said if the goal is to replace fuel-tax revenue, it should approach $150 a year. Even at that level, Moore said, the fee is merely a Band-Aid en route to a new, sustainable system for highway construction and maintenance.\The debate comes against the backdrop of looming insolvency for the national highway fund, which could come as soon as August, barring congressional action. The Federal Highway Trust Fund currently collects about $38 billion a year in fuel taxes, nearly all to fund state and local government surface transportation.\In a February report based on 2010 data, the Transportation Department estimated that all levels of government would need to spend as much as $145 billion a year to properly maintain the nation's roads and bridges. To dig out of the hole, officials and experts have widely discussed fundamental reform based on delinking taxes from fuel consumption.\A number of states have been exploring vehicle-miles-traveled, or VMT, systems. Among the states where lawmakers have introduced bills for VMT feasibility studies is California, the nation's biggest auto market with the highest gas tax. (Gas was $4.26 a gallon in mid-April, including 56.8 cents in taxes and fees.) More than half a million hybrids and 125,000 electric vehicles are registered in California.\In Oregon, the idea will get an unprecedented tryout next year when 5,000 volunteers agree to pay 1.5 cents per mile driven in lieu of the tax at the pump.\Republican state Sen. Bruce Starr, a leading proponent of the plan, said he doesn't criticize other states that seek fairness by taxing clean vehicles. But he added, ""From my perspective, it doesn't get to the point. People ought to pay for the roads they use in a way that's fair, so no matter what you use to make your car move down the road, you're going to pay basically the same amount.\Credit: Rita Beamish Stateline.org"
190,"DETROIT - General Motors Co. CEO Dan Akerson wants the federal gas tax boosted as much as $1 a gallon to nudge consumers toward more fuel-efficient cars, and he's confident the government will soon shed its remaining 26 percent stake in the once-bankrupt automaker. \""I actually think the government will be out this year - within the next 12 months, hopefully within the next six months,"" Akerson said in a two-hour interview with The Detroit News.\He is grateful for the government's rescue of GM - ""I have nothing but good things to say about them"" - but Akerson said the time for that relationship to end is coming because it's wearing on GM.\""It's kind of like your in-laws: It was a nice long weekend. We didn't say a week,"" Akerson said with a laugh.\And while he is eager to say goodbye to the government as a part owner of GM, Akerson would like to see it step up to the challenge of setting a higher gas tax, as part of a comprehensive energy policy.\A government-imposed tax hike, Akerson believes, will prompt more people to buy small cars and do more good for the environment than forcing automakers to comply with higher gas-mileage standards.\""There ought to be a discussion on the cost versus the benefits,"" he said. ""What we are going to do is tax production here, and that will cost us jobs.""\For the years 2017-25, federal officials are considering 3 percent to 6 percent annual fuel efficiency increases, or 47 mpg to 62 mpg. That could boost the cost of vehicles by up to $3,500.\""You know what I'd rather have them do - this will make my Republican friends puke - as gas is going to go down here now, we ought to just slap a 50-cent or a dollar tax on a gallon of gas,"" Akerson said.\""People will start buying more Cruzes and they will start buying less Suburbans.""\Call for tax hikes\In his interview with The News, Akerson also weighed in on the nation's debt ceiling, saying Congress should raise it from its current $14.3 trillion mark. The government could default on its debt on Aug. 2.\""We're too good a nation to let ourselves be a banana republic,"" Akerson said, warning that a default would be ""unimaginable"" and could hurt auto sales.\But he agrees with those who say the country has been spending money it can't afford.\""Now, we need practical decisions,"" Akerson said. ""I think you need to cut the hell out of the budget and you've got to increase taxes ... on everybody - including the middle class and the rich people.""\Akerson, who describes himself as ""a Colin Powell Republican - not a Sarah Palin Republican,"" said President Barack Obama has ""done a pretty good job on the economy.""\""I don't think he can fix it in four years, and I think we just have to stay the course,"" he said.\He noted the bipartisan spirit of GM's rescue and the rest of the U.S. auto industry.\""If we had gone down,"" he said, ""the supply chain would have gone down. ... And Ford was hanging on by its fingernails, too.""\Stock boost sought\Akerson believes the Treasury's continued ownership stake in GM - 500 million shares - is dragging down its stock price, which has fallen 23 percent this year, and closed Monday at $28.56. That's well below the $33 per share it fetched in November's $23 billion initial public stock offering.\""I think that it is an overhang - to have 500 million shares sitting out there - it's a problem,"" Akerson said, adding that unrest in the Middle East and oil prices also are depressing GM's share price. ""They don't know when (the Treasury is) going to come out. Investors hate uncertainty.""\David Whiston, an auto analyst at Morningstar, agrees that government ownership is impacting investors' interest in GM.\""There are a lot of money managers that are waiting for the government to exit before jumping in,"" Whiston said.\The Treasury, which rescued GM with a $49.5 billion bailout and once held a 61 percent majority stake, ""will likely look at another (stock) sale in August, after second-quarter earnings are announced, Akerson said.\The Obama administration has made clear it is eager to exit GM - but hasn't laid out a precise timetable.\Asked if GM is considering buying back its stock, Akerson paused for eight seconds before declining to answer directly. ""But we have a lot of cash,"" he added.\At the current stock price, U.S. taxpayers would be out more than $12 billion on GM's bailout. Still, Akerson believes that, in the end, taxpayers will see the government made the right call in saving the automaker, as well as crosstown rival Chrysler.\""We are in the midst of transforming an iconic American company so, 20 and 30 years from now, (taxpayers) will look at this company and they'll say, 'Absolutely it was the right thing to do,'"" Akerson said. ""And it shouldn't be measured on, 'Did it sell for $43 or $53 (a share) or did they lose a couple billion dollars?'""\GM was saved, he said, because of the extreme generosity of Americans - a spirit that helped restore Europe and Japan after World War II and rebuild cities such as New Orleans after natural disasters.\""We're the most generous country, even in terrible times,"" Akerson said. ""We don't walk to the disaster as a nation. ... We can't wait to help.""\Things are looking up for GM's image, he said. Pollster Peter Hart, conducting research for GM, found 16 percent had a positive view of GM before the bailout. But that had risen to 65 percent early this year, Akerson said.\""I couldn't believe the press we got on the IPO - it was like a $100 million gift,"" Akerson said.\GM's rebound, he believes, was a ""proxy"" for the United States.\""OK, we took the blow as a nation, we weathered the worst, and my God, we're back,"" Akerson said. ""It's why I came here. It was a story of an underdog that tripped as we all have in our lives - it was a good feel-good story.""\THE ASSOCIATED PRESS General Motors Co.

191,"WASHINGTON - In an election all about change, environmental groups are doing the usual - endorsing the Democratic presidential candidate.\The League of Conservation Voters will become the latest green group to back Democrat Barack Obama in five separate events across the country Monday. Its pick shouldn't be a surprise. Its scorecard of votes on environmental issues for the first session of the current Congress gave Obama a score of 67 and Republican John McCain a zero. The Arizona senator did not show up for any of the votes the group scored.\""When you look specifically at the twin challenges of cutting global warming pollution and moving toward a clean energy future, on those issues Barack Obama has the most comprehensive plan we have ever seen for a presidential nominee,"" said league president Gene Karpinsky. The league has endorsed presidential candidates since the early 1980s, but not once has it selected a Republican.\Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club announced their support for Obama earlier this year, citing McCain's support for more offshore drilling, expanding nuclear power and a gas tax holiday. Neither group has ever backed a Republican presidential candidate, although in 1988 Sierra Club made no choice because both Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis would have been good stewards of the environment, said spokesman Josh Dorner.\Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund, which has yet to announce its endorsement, said McCain's renegade image as a Republican crusader on global warming doesn't square with his record.\""McCain's campaign record notwithstanding, his record on the environment is decidely mixed compared to Barack Obama's,"" said William Lutz, a senior director with the group.\Credit: The Associated Press"
192,"WASHINGTON - Driving onto an Interstate highway? Crossing a bridge on the way into work? Taking a tunnel under a river or bay? Get ready to pay.\With Congress unwilling to contemplate an increase in the federal gas tax, motorists are likely to be paying ever more tolls as the government searches for ways to repair and expand the nation's congested highways.\Tolling is less efficient and sometimes can seem less fair than the main alternative, gasoline taxes. It can increase traffic on side roads as motorists seek to evade paying. Some tolling authorities - often quasi-governmental agencies operating outside the public eye - have been plagued by mismanagement. And some public-private partnerships to build toll roads have drowned in debt because of too-rosy revenue predictions.\Tolls are hardly a perfect solution. But to many states and communities, they're the best option available.\""It's very hard in this environment for states to add capacity without charging a toll because they can't afford to do it,"" said Joshua Schank, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington think tank. ""They're barely able to maintain what they've got, and there is an urgent need for capacity.""\Some changes already are under way\In addition to the tolls allowed on Interstates in 15 states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, the U.S. has agreed to pilot toll projects on Interstate 95 in Virginia and North Carolina and on Interstate 70 in Missouri.\A commission created by Congress to recommend ways to pay for upkeep of the nation's transportation system predicted in 2009 that the U.S. will face nightmarish congestion unless it spends more. The commission estimated all levels of government were spending a cumulative $137 billion less each year than is necessary to maintain and expand the current system. Without action, there will be a $2 trillion-plus backlog by 2035, it said.\It's been nearly two decades since Congress last increased the federal gas and diesel taxes that have historically paid for highways. Meanwhile, the cost of road and bridge construction has gone up and the purchasing power of fuel taxes has declined by more than a third. Revenue is also down because people have been driving less due to the uncertain economy and because cars are becoming more fuel-efficient.\Federal and state fuel tax revenues peaked in 2007 at $72.4 billion, then dropped to $68.6 billion in 2010, the most recent year for which data are available. Meanwhile, state toll collections rose from $4.9 billion in 2000 to $8.9 billion in 2010, and locally administered tolls rose from $1.6 billion in 2000 to $2.5 billion in 2009.\The trust fund that pays for federal highway programs is forecast to go broke sometime next year, though the House and Senate are trying to negotiate a bill to shore up the funding and overhaul transportation programs. It's unclear whether they'll reach a deal, but if they do, it's likely to contain only a short-term financial fix. That means lawmakers will be back again, scratching for more.\Tolling is the easiest near-term way to pay the bills, says Robert Atkinson, who chaired the financing commission. ""If you could allow modest tolling on Interstates, you could raise a lot of money,"" he said.\Fifteen states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, that had turnpikes before the 1956 advent of the Interstate system have grandfathered permission to collect tolls on 2,900 miles of the 47,000-mile system. But federal restrictions prevent other states from placing tolls on federal-aid highways except in limited circumstances.\States want Congress to increase their ability to charge tolls and to allow them to use the money for a variety of transportation needs - not just upkeep of the roads where tolls are collected, said Eugene Conti, North Carolina's transportation secretary, at a Senate hearing last month.\But states also have a history of slapping tolls on roads traveled by a large share of out-of-state motorists. When Pennsylvania applied to put tolls on Interstate 80, a route favored by truckers, the federal government rejected the plan partly because some of the money raised would have gone to support public transit in Philadelphia, even though the highway doesn't touch the city's metro area. In 2004, Chicago leased its Skyway, an eight-mile road and bridge, to a private toll operator for 99 years in exchange for $1.8 billion that was used to pay off city debt. The resulting toll increases fell heavily on Indiana commuters who use the road to get to jobs in Chicago.\Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has introduced a bill to give the secretary of transportation oversight of tolling practices. The financing commission made a similar recommendation.\What to do about tolling isn't addressed in the highway bill now before Congress because of a standoff earlier this year between senators who favor and oppose easing tolling on Interstate highways. The issue is expected to be revived next year after the retirement of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has led the opposition to greater tolling.\One concern is that the Interstate system is aging, which means money must be found to repair and replace the roads.\""The roads are out there and we've paid off the mortgage, but that doesn't mean the system is paid for. ... Now the roads are crumbling and we have to upgrade them,"" said Patrick Jones, executive director of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, which represents toll facilities.\Some relaxation of the ban is in the works. The Transportation Department has selected the three states - Virginia, North Carolina and Missouri - for pilot toll projects.\Under another program, a $2 billion project now under way would add High Occupancy Toll lanes on Interstate 495 in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. The state can't afford to build the lanes on its own, but money raised by a private investment partnership and a $586 million federal loan made the project possible.\Motorists who buy an E-ZPass that can be read electronically will be able use the lanes. Toll prices will fluctuate depending on traffic density. If toll lanes are crowded, prices will keep rising until enough motorists decide to remain in the slower lanes. The aim is to give motorists a way to travel quickly, but only if they are willing to pay for it - an idea that has stirred controversy. Cars with three or more passengers will be able to use the lanes without paying.\The administrative costs of tolling are far greater than the gas tax, even when using electronic tolling, said Phineas Baxandall, a senior analyst with the private, consumer-oriented U.S. PIRG.\Some tolling agencies could also use ""a dose of sunshine,"" Baxandall said. Because many are quasi-governmental, public disclosure, open meeting and other transparency rules don't always apply, he said. As a result, they frequently operate out of public sight, creating opportunities for corruption or manipulation by industry, he said.\A report by the New Jersey comptroller in March said cronyism and mismanagement at the Delaware River Port Authority had wasted millions of dollars. The authority operates four bridges, a ferry and a rail line across the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey recently raised cash fares on six Interstate bridges and tunnels to $12 for cars. By 2015, it will cost a five-axle truck paying cash $105 to cross between New York and New Jersey, three times as much as for any other bridge or tunnel in the country, according to the American Trucking Association. Bill Baroni, the authority's deputy executive director, told a Senate hearing the fare hikes are necessary to make up for years of neglect and mismanagement.\Despite concerns about more and higher tolls, it's difficult for lawmakers to tell state and local governments not to pursue greater tolling when Congress isn't providing a comparable alternative source of funds.\Jones, of the tolling industry association, predicted that as traffic congestion worsens, people ""are going to demand, `We need better roads, we need more efficiency,' and they are going to ask for tolling and direct user fees to build the transportation that they need.""\AP photo Newly constructed roadways are being built in Fairfax County, Va.

193,"The Associated Press\LAS VEGAS - The Hoover Dam, one of the world's great engineering feats, is marred by roads with traffic so jammed along the Nevada-Arizona border that it tells a different story about the political will to maintain 21st century infrastructure.\The road leading to the dam cannot accommodate the torrent of tourists and spills them into the overwhelmed little town of Boulder City. Nevada lawmakers are trying to find a private company to build a $400 million bypass because the state can't afford it.\The phrase ""you can't get there from here"" is increasingly apt nearly everywhere one turns. America's roads, highways, bridges and transit systems are falling apart. Even those not in disrepair are often so crowded that a horse and buggy might seem faster. Cities and suburbs are outgrowing their infrastructure far faster than local governments can find the money to fix them.\While the problem is plain to all, the money and the political will to fix it isn't there.\Two congressionally mandated commissions and a slew of experts and committees have said the nation needs to double, even quadruple, what it spends each year to maintain and repair its aging transportation infrastructure and expand to accommodate population growth.\So there's the rub. No one likes traffic jams and potholes. No one wants people to die because an unsafe bridge has collapsed. But raising federal gas and diesel taxes or boosting tolls and fees isn't popular, either.\Pew Center polls in the last year show that 67 percent of those questioned said their state should not cut money for roads and public transit to balance its budget. But only 38 percent want federal spending increased and only 27 percent favor an increase in the gas tax that often pays for it.\At the same time, three-quarters say more spending on roads, bridges and other public works would help create jobs.\""The American public has turned selfish. They don't really want to invest in this stuff,"" said Robert Atkinson, a technology think tank executive who helped lead one of the federal transportation commissions. ""It's akin to leaving your house to your kids when you die without fixing the roof because you wanted to spend the money instead on Florida vacations.""\In Delaware, officials have delayed dozens of capital projects, but still expected a $21 million shortfall in the state's transportation trust fund this summer. The deficit is seen as growing to $1 billion by 2016.\In Texas, a committee recently declared the highway system inadequate and warned lawmakers that congestion would worsen without money for road improvements. Gov. Rick Perry's plan for a toll road across the state was abandoned in the face of uproar from ranchers whose land would be seized to build it.\In Pennsylvania, 5,906 bridges, or about 27 percent of the state's total, are graded structurally deficient, the highest rate in the nation, according to the Washington-based policy group Transportation for America.\The emergency closure this month of the 50-year-old Sherman Minton Bridge, one of three spans that connect southern Indiana and Louisville, Ky., has snarled the daily commute for tens of thousands of motorists. Officials found cracks in the steel span, raising safety concerns. The two states have struggled for years to find the money to build two more bridges.\Maryland business leaders persuaded the governor and lawmakers to spend more on road construction after a state commission found nearly $1 billion in transportation dollars had been diverted to the general fund budget.\In Georgia, lawmakers approved legislation to allow 12 regions around the state to ask voters next year whether to raise their sales tax by a penny per dollar to pay for an approved list of transportation projects. Officials in the 10-county Atlanta region recently endorsed a $6.14 billion draft list of transportation projects, from light rail to new highways, to ease congestion that's among the worst in the nation.\The consequences of inaction are severe.\Atkinson's commission forecast ""unimaginable levels of congestion"" in the coming decades. Safety will be reduced. Goods and services will cost more. The quality of life will be eroded, and the nation's economic competitiveness diminished, the commission predicted.\The Federal Highway Administration predicts 40 percent of the nation's major highways will be congested by 2035 without major fixes.\""Our highways are clogged with traffic. Our skies are the most congested in the world. This is inexcusable,"" President Obama told Congress in a speech last week in which he demanded passage of a jobs bill.\""Building a world-class transportation system is part of what made us an economic superpower. And now we're going to sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads? At a time when millions of unemployed construction workers could build them right here in America?""\Despite the sense of urgency, federal highway and transit programs that underwrite about 40 percent of transportation construction have been in a kind of legislative limbo for two years, limping along under a series of short-term extensions because Congress can't figure out how to pay for them.\Republicans want the programs to be funded almost entirely through existing transportation taxes, primarily the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax and 24.4 cents per gallon federal diesel tax. But revenue from the taxes is declining as people drive less and buy more fuel-efficient cars.\GOP Rep. John Mica of Florida, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has proposed a six-year, $230 billion plan that would slash annual transportation spending by about 30 percent.\Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, who heads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has developed a plan that would last only two years and cost $109 billion. But it would maintain current spending levels with some adjustment for inflation.\Federal inaction is ""a big variable, right now,"" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said recently. ""You wouldn't have thought so because it's been routinely extended in the past, but some of these guys in Congress really do believe that bridges are like trees and if you leave them alone long enough they grow taller and stronger with age, so it's hard to say.""\At the state level, 21 states cut transportation money last year even with a $48.1 billion infusion of federal stimulus dollars for road projects, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. The proportion of spending on transportation at the state level has held steady at 9 percent since 1995.\""People need to understand all across America what's at stake,"" said Tony Dorsey of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.\Ed Garcia does.\The 24-year-old travels from Arizona to Nevada once a month to visit his girlfriend and often gets stuck in traffic near the Hoover Dam. The federal government last year opened a four-lane bypass that routed traffic from a bottleneck near the Hoover Dam to a new U.S. 93 bridge. But traffic remains severe west of the span, near where U.S. 93 connects with U.S. 95 in Boulder City.\""You sit in traffic for hours not moving,"" Garcia said. ""There's this one road that goes through town, and everyone is on it.""\State legislators aren't any more eager than members of Congress to raise their gas tax to fix roads. In Maryland, Delaware, Utah and Wyoming, lawmakers rejected gas tax increases to pay for new roadwork because, they said, residents couldn't afford higher taxes.\""If I got a pair of worn-out Levis, I don't go out and buy another pair just cause I need them,"" Republican state Sen. Chris Buttars of Utah said last spring as he argued against raising that state's gas tax by 5 cents per gallon. ""I've got to have the money.""\About two dozen states are making do with the same fuel tax they charged in 1996, according to the federal government. But in California, for example, inflation has eaten away half the value of that state's gas tax, which has remained at 18 cents per gallon since 1994.\In the absence of new revenue, states are borrowing their way to better roads, with bonds accounting for about one-third of state transportation money. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell recently won passage of a $4 billion transportation plan, more than half from bonds.\The spending needs are just to maintain roads from normal wear and tear and get ready for population growth.\Credit: Christina Silva and Joan Lowy"
194," With a gallon of gas breaking $3 and voters unhappy, state leaders across the country are taking a sudden, sharp dislike to gasoline taxes, proposing to eliminate the levies that are a mainstay for road programs - or at least suspend them for the summer.\ Governors have floated ideas to trim or suspend state gas taxes in Maryland, South Carolina and Connecticut. State legislators are pushing similar measures in Georgia, New York and Nevada. The proposals are winning vocal support from Republicans and Democrats alike, though none have yet become law.\ ""We think it would have real bottom-line benefit to a lot of working families who are struggling with the price of gas,"" South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said on Wednesday, when he proposed suspending the state's 16.8 cents-per-gallon tax for three months.\ Critics say the proposal is a mistake, questioning whether drivers would actually see the tax cut, the potential to undermine necessary road and transportation programs and the larger environmental impact.\ Still, with elections later this year, the popularity of the idea was made clear in South Carolina when the Republican governor - who's been unable to win support for a number of other proposed tax cuts - quickly won bipartisan support for his proposal.\ ""I feel like I'm the evangelist who's been singing at the country tent. Welcome to the tent,"" Sanford said after a news conference that grew so jammed it had to be moved from his office into the statehouse lobby outside. ""There's a lot of energy around this issue.""\ In other states:\ * New York lawmakers agreed Wednesday to cap the sales tax at 8 cents per gallon, freezing the tax at the rate paid when gas costs $2 a gallon. Lawmakers said that would save consumers $450 million a year.\ * North Carolina Gov. Mike Easley, a Democrat, wants to cap the gas tax and said he'll include a proposal in his budget proposal this week.\ * Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican, threatened to call a special session on energy issues and said she is open to a legislative proposal to suspend the state's 25 cents-per-gallon tax for the summer.\ * Georgia Democrats are demanding GOP Gov. Sonny Perdue suspend the gas tax, as he did after the spike in prices that followed Hurricane Katrina.\ Other states where the idea has been raised include Texas, Minnesota, Delaware and Idaho.\ The gas tax is the most widespread target as constituent anger grows over gas prices, but it's not the only measure being considered.\ California zeroed in on oil companies when a key legislative committee approved a windfall profits tax aimed at oil producers. Several state attorneys general have begun investigations into price gouging, and governors in California and Maryland have asked state officials to examine potential gouging.\ But as prices in many parts of the country top $3 for a gallon of gas, states are looking hard at the one part of that cost they can control - the state tax.\ On average, states add 28.1 cents to each gallon of gas from a combination of excise taxes, business taxes and state and local sales taxes. It varies from a low of 8 cents in Alaska to a high of 49.5 cents in New York, according to the American Petroleum Institute.\ The federal government adds 18.4 cents to each gallon.\ ""It's very easy to point the finger of blame at the oil companies,"" said Pete Sepp at the National Taxpayers Union, which supports the cuts. ""But government is making a killing on these high prices, too.""\ In South Carolina, Sanford estimates a three-month tax suspension would save a family $63. It would cost the state $134 million.\ But consumers might have a hard time noticing any savings at the pump, especially if prices keep rising, experts said.\ That's because retailers pay the tax when they buy gas from their distributor, and prices, as everyone has seen, can change quickly, said Rayola Dougher, manager of energy market issues for the American Petroleum Institute. So a spike in oil prices could easily swallow up a break from the state. Besides, prices often vary a few cents from station to station.\ A small tax cut like the one being considered in New York, which would be at least 4 cents, would be hard to see in day-to-day price shifts. A bigger cut like South Carolina's 16.8 cents would be easier to notice, depending on the price of crude, Dougher said.\ ""The prices have been changing a lot harder and faster than 4 cents these days,"" Dougher said. ""If you get up to 15, 20, 30 cents, sure, you're going to see it. But it's going to be hard to see four for all the noise.""\ Others argue it's a misguided step for bigger reasons, like the nation's dependency on oil or the impact of fossil fuels on the environment.\ ""Cutting the gas tax is a false solution. I don't think the public is fooled,"" said Rob Sargent, energy analyst with the environmental coalition called the State PIRGs. ""It just delays the inevitable - dealing with the bigger problem - and that is our overreliance on oil.""\ Associated Press writer Mark Johnson in Albany, N.Y., contributed to this report.\ Credit: The Associated Press"

I love committee work and know how to lead and seek cooperation for positive outcomes. Former chair of WVSU Alumni Advisory Board; currently alumni vice president. I teach parliamentary procedure and am an educator, entrepreneur and employer. 1. Encourage AMAs initiative! Empower and cover as many folks as we can.\Give incentives to employers who provide care to full-time and part-timers. Allow West Virginia Insurance Commission better ability to regulate and encourage ERISA-Trust Plans and MEWAs provide competition to insurance companies and control by workers and employers. 2. Stabilized in-home care (like former Shawnee Hills) would provide jobs and lessen the need for as much overcrowded institutionalized care like the state hospital in Huntington. More qualified providers would help statewide and we could get people to work (transition programs like Goodwill.) The best therapy is to work. 3. Education, energy, environment, safety, job-stability and housing come first, but as well work on those issues, we need to get up to speed on many issues where other states lead the way. Save lives and insurance premiums! Privatize and require drivers education! Create new jobs! Sell more insurance and cars! 4. Shouldnt the question be taxes? Finish phasing out the food tax, but also the taxes on inheritance and school supplies. There shouldnt be a special holiday for kids to afford to be prepared!; caregivers and adult children should not have to scrimp and hedge to keep familys legacy and home place intact! Bonnie Brown (D) South Charleston Attended Oregon State University and the University of Idaho. Received a bachelors degree in English from Morris Harvey College. Work experiences include retail, instructor, project director, executive director, lobbyist, consultant and legislator. 1. At least make it possible not to hinder the ability to access medications from the free clinics. I have always supported adding more children to the CHIPS program. 2. I co-sponsored legislation for the creation of a state mental health plan, which is being undertaken. We need to provide services to those who need them ... especially youth. 3. Its a vicious circle; high drop out rate and low college-going rate, uneducated work force for quality jobs. The national economy adversely affects West Virginia. We havent the funding for our infrastructure needs. I support programs to address those issues. 4. Regressive taxes, such as food tax.

Of course a national health care plan crafted similarly to the Social Security program would provide immediate coverage for all. However, while we wait, the West Virginia Legislature is examining Vermonts successful state health care plan hoping to adopt the best practices to phase in the remaining 200,000 uninsured. 2. Mental Health care treatment needs to be administered on par with physical, behavioral, and primary health care. More capacity is needed to provide local service to people with mental health care needs. Also needed is equal treatment, equal insurance coverage, and an increase in prevention programs statewide. 3. Maintaining and improving our communities and our standard of living in the face of rising costs and falling wages is the greatest challenge West Virginians face. I suggest the Bucks for Brains appropriation be equally invested in existing and new energy, health sciences and manufacturing technologies for new job creation. 4. With costs rising beyond the publics ability to pay, I would suggest eliminating the food tax altogether while expanding the industry sections exempted from combined reporting. Additionally, I suggest we examine some form of tax relief for citizens on monthly utility bills.

Continue to increase childrens coverage and expand pilot programs for basic coverage for others. As a starting point for reform, the recently legislated Health System Redesign Group is aggressively researching a medical model of care that would be available to all and would insure primary and preventative care. 2. Behavioral health must be integrated into the improved medical model allowing for a holistic approach to primary health mental health care. As a member of the behavioral Health Commission, I am working to provide community based prevention and early identification programs that are available and accessible across the state. 3. As the national economy plummets, West Virginians will be hit fast and hard. Legislators must work quickly and closely with the governor to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable, and to sustain jobs and promote job growth. 4. Continue the process of eliminating the food tax. Beyond that, we need to continue studying the whole tax structure and revise the tax code to create a fairer and more uniform system and begin to eliminate regressive taxes. Look for some relief from the gas tax. Mark A. Hunt (D) Charleston Graduated from the University of Charleston with a bachelors degree; received a masters degree from Marshall University and a law degree from the University of the District of Columbia; attorney for 14 years; served four terms in the House. 1. I support government sponsored free clinic programs across the state like Health Right of West Virginia providing preventative care, referrals, and prescription drugs. Federal universal healthcare is probably the answer, however, West Virginia cannot afford the failed Massachusetts program of state universal care that is now insolvent. 2. Include mental health care into the free clinic programs across the state, again like Health Right in Charleston. Further support should be given to the various county health departments for not only mental health but all health needs. 3. Lack of good paying jobs place our people in poverty and diminish the overall tax base. We need to continue to build infrastructure, clean water and sewage programs, better schools, with good teachers that are paid a fair wage. Build it and they will come. 4. The food tax is a very regressive tax and should continue to be phased out. Doug Skaff Jr. (D) South Charleston Graduated from South Charleston High School. Received a bachelors degree in marketing and a masters degree in industrial labor relations from West Virginia University. Currently employed as a district manager for Norandex Building Material Distribution. Formerly employed as a sales manager with Owens Corning and as a sales manager with West Virginia University. 1. I will fight for new initiatives towards a universal health plan for all uninsured West Virginians, lower premium cost for small employers, and control cost. Use research to require all plans to provide appropriate preventive services, encourage employers to offer long-term care, and provide governments coverage for uninsured children. 2. I would work towards establishing parity in the insurance industry between medical and mental coverage especially when it comes to preventive services. Also provide more access through our schools for students by having more clinical personnel. Create regional rehab centers for preventive, substance abuse, speech, and occupational mental services. 3. Our current energy crisis is one of the biggest financial challenges we have as West Virginians. People cannot afford to buy gas. Oil has caused all raw materials cost to inflate and makes it hard for people to live their lives comfortably, buy groceries, and provide for their families. 4. I would take a serious look at reducing our gas tax. West Virginians cannot afford to pay for gas and we must look into our gas tax to see if we can provide any relief as long as it does not interfere with maintenance and upkeep of our roads.

Our problem is that we have a sick care system instead of a healthcare system. We emphasize treatment after the fact instead of front-end prevention. We must expand our rural health initiative and provide increased accessibility to service delivery for CHIPS, free clinics, proper placement, and senior facilities. 2. There is an unfortunate stigma attached to mental health services. Emphasis on dealing with mental health issues as a legitimate illness must occur at all educational levels. Public education and increased training of mental health care professionals is important to support. Sincere public health education deserves our complete legislative emphasis. 3. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices are having a major negative impact on all segments of our economy. Food, clothing, home products, business operations, and ultimately all of our citizens must then respond to such pressures. Relief must be provided by emphasizing alternatives, such as clean coal technology for liquid fuels. 4. Most problems will be solved with increased employment and employer opportunity. Regressive taxes, such as the food tax, should be replaced with a realistic and equitable tax system. Downward tax adjustments for business franchise, corporate net income, major inventory, corporate aircraft, and senior property and income rates, also are justified. Danny Wells (D) Charleston Graduated from Charleston High School and West Virginia University. Worked 43 years at The Charleston Gazette. Also worked five years as a substitute teacher and two years at the information booth at the Capitol. 1. Primary and preventive coverage should be provided through state subsidy in an attempt to keep untreated illnesses from growing into chronic conditions which are more expensive to treat. Also consider adopting the Vermont plan that enforces mandatory participation based on income in a universal plan. 2. A legislative Behavioral Health Committee is studying this problem. There are obviously not enough facilities and not enough providers in rural areas. Increasing the reimbursement rate for providers must happen. The legislative committee study should prove valuable in finding solutions. 3. While increasing costs for fuel, food and utilities are obvious concerns, West Virginians also must be aware that future revenue projections for the state show a decline is on the way. Government must operate more efficiently in order to deal with future revenue short falls. 4. We should continue a gradual responsible reduction of taxes on food, the business franchise tax and the corporate net income tax. We should always be conscious of the financial deficits that result in tax reductions and act accordingly in this area. Todd Carden (R) St. Albans Graduated from West Virginia State University with a bachelors degree in business administration. Utility analyst for West Virginia Public Service Commission; appointed for a five-year term as PSC Representative on Cable TV Advisory Board; served as chair of National Regulatory Accounting Sub-committee. 1. I would support a move to earmark a higher percentage of gambling revenue to support and make available health services not now available, both physical and mental. 2. See answer to above question. 3. The export of our talented youth to other states where jobs are more plentiful with higher pay. An example of this is certified teachers. Other example is auditors and engineers at the Department of Highways and the West Virginia Public Service Commission where skilled personnel are difficult to attract and retain. Higher wages is part of the solution. 4. I would cut the state corporate tax rate to that of surrounding states with the proviso that utility rates would reflect the lower rate. The present rate is 8.75 percent whereas surrounding states are in the range of 6 percent to 6.25 percent. Such a cut would serve to attract corporate business here and would reduce utility rates for public and businesses. The economic growth would serve to make up the tax loss. Victoria Casey (R) Charleston Graduated from West Liberty State College, West Virginia University Graduate School and West Virginia University College of Law; registered Nurse (critical care); university instructor of nursing; lawyer, residential landlord. 1. Develop a program similar to Vermonts. Vermont provides comprehensive health insurance, administered by private companies. Beneficiaries pay premiums based on income. Employers pay quarterly premiums based on number of uninsured employees. Gambling revenues and cigarette taxes could provide additional funds. Screening and health promotion are provided at no cost. 2. Mental health care would be provided in the health care plan outlined above. As a former nurse, I am aware of the low priority mental health services receive. Qualified professionals interested in caring for mental health patients must be recruited. Recommend: tuition reimbursement for professionals who will work in areas of need. 3. Balancing their budget with increased cost of gasoline and food. Micro: eliminate food tax; continue freeze on tax based on price of gallon of gasoline. 4. Food tax, business franchise tax. Food is a basic necessity for life and must be purchased by persons of all income levels. Business franchise tax discourages a business to grow, especially small businesses, since it is a tax on the businesss capital. Fred H. Joseph (R) Charleston Graduated from Charleston High School and attended West Virginia University and West Virginia State College. Experience includes the U.S. Marine Corps; 35 years as a private business owner and 70 years of life experience. 1. An improved health clinic program would allow many that need basic health care to receive the necessary care. This type of care would be accessible to employers at a much-reduced cost and allow them to offer this care to employees. Reduced taxation would be allowed to employers that offer this assistance. 2. A system of care is about partnership a partnership made up of service providers, families, teachers, and others. We need to make sure that the several departments that deal with this issue are communicating. Combining the caregivers into a single entity would assure care is received by the person in need, and is not lost in the system. 3. The citizens are burdened with excessive taxation. The regressive tax on food and property places a hardship on many families. State, county, and city taxes and service fees of all sorts, reduces take home income. The best way to allow for reduced taxation would be reduced spending by government. 4. Complete the elimination of the food tax. Eliminate the tax on homes of seniors. Eliminate the state income tax for Social Security payments to seniors. The elimination of the business franchise tax would allow for the increase in business development. This would result in better business environment and would create more and better paying jobs. John H. Miller Jr. (R) Charleston Graduated from Charleston High School and received a bachelors degree from West Virginia State University and a masters degree from Marshall University. Experience includes teaching science and biology in Kanawha County Schools, EEO Officer of Department of Highways. Currently a Charleston City Councilman since 2003. 1. We must get help from the federal government. Federal participation is imperative, because we have limited resources. I would be supportive of a state plan as much as our state can afford. 2. We need to get help for increasing the number of beds, and employees and other resources allocating funds to mental health care. Highland Hospital in Kanawha City appears to be making progress in this area. 3. The biggest financial challenge we face is lack of employment. We need jobs. We need to create a business-friendly climate to bring more business. Reduce taxes that would create the most jobs. Hopefully, the economy will improve."
196," A key Senate committee has approved legislation restoring highway construction money eliminated after gas tax revenues dipped.\ The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Tuesday approved a measure to increase next year's highway spending to $28.9 billion, nearly $6 billion more than President Bush proposed. West Virginia, which would have lost $80 million of expected federal highway funds, would receive more than $40 million in restored funds. That would have translated into hundreds of jobs, an association representing state highways officials estimated.\ The House approved similar legislation last month."
197," WASHINGTON - The Republican-controlled Senate brushed aside a presidential veto threat Tuesday and passed a $295 billion highway bill, arguing that massive spending on bigger and better roads was necessary to fight congestion and unsafe roadways.\ The administration, while pressing Congress to pass a new highway bill, said the Senate version was too expensive in a time of war and debt and could result in the first veto of the Bush presidency.\ The vote was 89-11 with a majority of Republicans joining Democrats in approving the six-year package that the administration said was $11 billion above what it would accept. Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., voted for the bill.\ Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, described himself as one of the most conservative members of Congress but said he was at odds with the administration because ""there are two areas where we need to spend money. One is national defense and the other is infrastructure.""\ The Senate now must work out its differences with the House- passed bill, which in addition to approving less money specifies thousands of specific projects requested by lawmakers, from bike paths to sidewalks to parking lots. Almost all of the Senate money is divided among the states by a complicated formula.\ In addition to granting money to states to repair and build roads and bridges, the bill would provide more than $50 billion for public transit, fund recreational road programs and promote highway safety.\ ""This bill will have an impact on every city and every town and every state."" said Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., the minority leader on the Environment Committee. ""I urge President Bush to reconsider his veto threat against this legislation.""\ The Senate vote was in some ways a repeat of last year, when the senators approved a bill well above what the White House deemed affordable. In the end no compromise was reached with Congress, and lawmakers have had to pass six temporary extensions of the old 6- year act, which expired Sept. 30, 2003.\ The House in March passed a $284 billion bill, the maximum amount the White House says it will accept without a veto. The Senate, in adding $11 billion, said it came up with new revenues for the highway trust fund - the principal source of money for federal highway grants to the states - without adding to the deficit.\ White House press secretary Scott McClellan repeated the veto threat Tuesday, saying the president was ""very serious"" about following a fiscally responsible budget.\ Before the final vote, the Senate rejected, by 84-16, an amendment proposed by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., that would have shrunk the bill back to $284 billion.\ With 20 months gone since the last highway bill, there is growing pressure to come up with a compromise. The latest extension runs out May 31.\ ""We've already lost one spring construction season in Michigan and we certainly don't want to lose another one,"" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.\ ""We are going to get a bill,"" said House Transportation Committee Chairman Don Young, R-Alaska.\ Senate leaders sought to pass the highway bill before entering debate over the use of the filibuster to block judicial nominations.\ There was no dispute over the need for a new highway program: Poor road conditions are a factor in one-third of the 42,000 traffic fatalities every year, and road congestion costs the nation billions in lost productivity and wasted fuel, studies indicate.\ The legislation funds many relatively small programs - bike routes to schools, covered bridges, ferry terminals - as well as programs to promote fuel-efficient vehicles.\ Cantwell, D-Wash., won voice vote approval of an amendment that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to update fuel economy testing to reflect real-life driving conditions. Gas mileage stickers on new cars now inflate true fuel economy performance by 10 percent to 30 percent.\ The Senate also adopted, 86-14, a provision that would increase grants for safety programs to states that allow police to stop motorists who don't wear seat belts even when there is no other traffic violation.\ The House bill, unlike the Senate version, includes some 4,000 specific projects, worth some $12 billion, that were requested by lawmakers for their districts. These projects, cited by fiscal conservatives as ""pork,"" will be one sticking point as House and Senate negotiators try to work out a compromise.\ Another difference is the formula by which the federal government divides up highway trust fund money for the states. The trust fund comes from the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax, and about half the states, mainly from fast-growing or heavily traveled areas, complain that they pay more into the fund than they get back.\ Of the 11 senators who voted against the bill, two are Wisconsin Democrats, Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold. They were joined by Republicans Jon Kyl and John McCain of Arizona, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Judd Gregg and John Sununu of New Hampshire, Jim DeMint and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.\ The bill is H.R. 3\ On the Net:\ Congress: http://thomas.loc.gov/\ White House: http://www.whitehouse.gov\ Credit: The Associated Press"
198,"A panel charged with finding a way to come up with the $1.13 billion a year West Virginia needs to maintain and upgrade its 36,000-mile highway system heard a pair of highway finance experts outline a wide range of revenue-raising possibilities Thursday.\""Today, there's not a [state] department of transportation in the country that's adequately funded,"" said Pete Rahn, former transportation director for both Missouri and New Mexico and now national transportation practice leader for the engineering and architecture giant HNTB Corp.\Rahn was speaking to members of the Governor's Blue Ribbon Commission on Highways' revenue subcommittee, formed last year to come up with a plan to finance the gap between maintenance and construction needs and current levels of funding income.\State highway construction and maintenance costs, once covered in large part by funds raised through the 18.4-cent per gallon federal gas tax, have risen more than 30 percent during the past 20 years, while the tax rate has remained flat and gas consumption has recently begun to decrease.\""Most states now believe the federal highway program won't ever be what it has been. It won't be riding in on a white horse to provide funding,"" Rahn said. ""Looking at the political environment, it's certainly questionable whether Congress will be willing to borrow billions more"" to keep the federal Highway Trust Fund funded at or near current levels for years to come.\While all 50 states have fuel taxes of their own, Rahn said, some have begun indexing them to inflation, or making them a percentage of sale price. Pennsylvania and New York have also imposed franchise taxes on petroleum distributors, and nine states have added a sales tax on fuel.\Five other states now channel a portion of vehicle-safety inspection fees into their highway funds. Drivers' license and vehicle registration fees are also possible targets for diversion into highway programs, according to Rahn.\New funding initiatives taken by other states include channeling lottery and personal property tax income to highway construction, and selling the naming rights to roads and bridges.\Among potential funding sources yet to be implemented, Rahn cited service fees that could be charged to patrons of drive-through businesses, state taxes on tires, payroll taxes for regional highway projects, and a tax on vehicle miles traveled, based on odometer readings taken during annual safety inspections.\Rahn said states that have allowed tolls to expire after construction bonds have been paid off have regretted the move, because it removes a stream of revenue that could be used to maintain the former toll road, or to pay off construction bonds on other projects.\""A renaissance is happening in tolling,"" said Jim Ely, the former director of Florida's turnpike system and now HNTB's vice president of toll services. ""One third of all new limited access highways are paid for with tolls. ... In some states, it's the toll road or no road.""\On the other hand, imposing a toll on a freeway segment that had previously not been tolled ""is one of the most challenging things you can do,"" Ely said.\While the national average cost per mile for vehicles traveling on toll roads is 8.3 cents per mile, Ely said, the cost of traveling the West Virginia Turnpike averages 6.8 cents per mile.\Whatever new funding sources the subcommittee comes up with, the need for new taxes or fees, and the rationale used to recommend them, must be thoroughly explained to the public, said Rahn and Ely.\""People don't want new taxes or tolls,"" Rahn said, ""until their roads and bridges start to crumble.""\Subcommittee member Fred Burns, owner of a Marlinton-based trucking company, said those in his industry would prefer a fuel tax increase to fees based on load weight and miles traveled, or increases in Turnpike tolls. Burns said his company annually pays the equivalent of about 17 percent of its gross revenue in fuel and road use taxes, tolls, excise taxes on tires and other fees, or about $22,000 per truck.\Burns also suggested conducting an efficiency audit on the state Department of Highways to help assure the public that any new taxes and fees are being prudently spent.\With Gov. Tomblin now entering lame duck status and legislators not immediately facing re-election, ""this is the year to make proposals and get something done,"" said subcommittee member and Delegate Margaret Anne Staggers, D-Fayette.\Brenda Nichols Harper of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce wondered whether she and other subcommittee members should focus on finding ways to pay for the maintenance of existing roads and bridges, and defer action on building new ones.\""I'm concerned that we may have been tasked with coming up with a funding goal that's impossible to meet,"" she said. ""We're talking about squeezing out the equivalent of 25 percent of the general revenue budget on an annualized basis.""\""Whatever tax or fee increases we come up with to produce what we need should be realistic,"" Burns said, ""but we need to take care of our infrastructure."" Putting off needed repairs and improvements would end up being much more costly in the long run, he said.\""Finding a solution is going to be a process,"" said Delegate Ron Walters, R-Kanawha, and a member of the subcommittee. ""I think it will end up being a series of things, done incrementally, and not just one approach. But I think it will happen.""\Chairman Bob Orders, CEO of Orders Construction Co., asked subcommittee members to present what they consider the best funding approaches during a Feb. 28 meeting.\Reach Rick Steelhammer at rsteelhammer@wvgazette.com or 304-348-5169.\Credit: Rick Steelhammer Staff writer"
199,"RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina is joining a growing number of states exploring new fees for hybrid and electric car owners to help make up for revenue those drivers aren't paying in gas taxes on their fuel-efficient vehicles.\The proposal strikes many owners of alternative-fuel vehicles and some advocacy groups as a wrong-headed approach to balancing priorities of promoting U.S. energy independence with sustainable infrastructure funding. But policymakers and some experts argue taxing hybrid and electric vehicle owners is a matter of making sure all drivers help maintain the roads they use and construct new ones.\Gas taxes are the most vital source of transportation funding, making up nearly 40 percent of all state highway revenues and more than 90 percent at the federal level, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But those revenues haven't kept up with rising construction costs, falling 41 percent in real value at the federal level since they were last increased 18 years ago, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The same nonpartisan research group estimated state and local gas-tax revenue fell 7 percent to $38 billion between 2004 and 2010.\Many transportation organizations and other groups said an overhaul that moves the system to a tax based on miles traveled is needed, but those reforms come with their own hurdles, and for now, states are looking for other fixes. At least 10 states are considering or have passed legislation to collect fees from owners of electric or hybrid cars.\""I think so far, what we're seeing is the trend seems to be either an additional annual fee or some type of registration fee seems to be much more popular than the miles-driven tax, because that is a newer technology and raises some privacy concerns,"" said Kristy Hartman, a transportation and environment analyst at the NCSL.\New Jersey scrapped a plan to charge vehicles by miles traveled amid pushback from media and legislators, opting instead for a flat fee on electric cars.\North Carolina senators included an additional $100 annual registration fee for electric-car owners and a $50 fee for hybrid drivers. They estimated the new fees will raise $1.5 million annually. The Senate's provision would have to survive budget negotiations with the House, which is expected to release its full spending plan in the coming days.\Sen. Neal Hunt, R-Wake, a chief budget-writer, argued the policy ensures all drivers are contributing their fair share toward maintaining the roads and services they all use.\""I just seems logical to me that they should pay a small fee for the use of the highways and the wear and tear they put on the highways,"" he said.\But that policy, along with the end of a pilot program offering four interstate plug-in stops, is troubling to many drivers of fuel-efficient cars.\Ryan Turner, an IT professional in Chapel Hill, said he and many other drivers of alternative-fuel vehicles chose their cars because they're concerned about the environment and the country's dependence on oil. The Chevrolet Volt driver helped advocate for a statewide plug-in vehicle readiness plan.\""On its face, it's reasonable for electric owners to contribute toward road tax in some way,"" he said. ""I think what's suspect is that, given all the issues we have in this state, given the state's woeful effort so far to promote electric vehicles as part of some statewide agenda, it is suspect that this vehicle tax is a priority, given the small amount of the revenue it will bring in.""\The policy looks especially arbitrary when more and more conventional cars are achieving fuel efficiency comparable to some hybrid cars, Turner added.\Jay Friedland, legislative director for the advocacy group Plug In America, has asked legislators in other states to phase in special fees after the number of alternative-fuel vehicles reaches 100,000, arguing administrative costs make such policies counter-productive before states reach a critical mass.\""We generally say this is a period of time when you should be incentivizing these vehicles, but after a while, yes, everyone should be paying their fair share,"" he said.\North Carolina has an estimated 30,000 hybrid and electric cars registered in the state.\Plug In America supports a vehicle-miles tax, and Friedland said his organization swayed Washington lawmakers to include a study of that policy in the state's own bill targeting alternative-fuel vehicles.\""Fundamentally, the mechanism exists (for charging a miles-traveled tax), but I don't know of any states that are currently doing that yet,"" he said. ""We're really on the edge of this, because we're for once actually watching fuel consumption going down, and that's why we're watching these taxes come up.""\Berry Jenkins of the Carolinas Association of General Contractors said bigger reforms are ultimately needed to address infrastructure in the long term. He's part of a coalition of businesses and regional transit groups that endorses miles-traveled taxes. The problem, he said, are concerns that they system would require intrusive new technologies and that fuels apprehension among political leaders.\""It's never going to be a convenient time to ask people to pay more for infrastructure,"" he said.\AP photo An electric/hybrid vehicle charges at a public charging station May 29 in Chapel Hill, N.C.

200,"Prescription bill only hurts the honest\Editor:\I read in the paper where the Legislature is thinking about proposing a bill to make pseudoephedrine a prescription drug. I was troubled about this so I went to a pharmacist and asked the pharmacist what she thought. She felt it was a good idea because it would be a little less hassle on the pharmacy end of things. Granted, it may reduce the meth problem a little but it would be a costly inconvenience to the honest person who would have to pay a doctor for a prescription for the medication. \Now, here is where I find it a little ironic. The number one drug problem in our state for the past 10 years or so is the addict who is addicted to prescriptive medications. So I guess this law will enable more people to get addicted to drugs. There is not an easy solution and I am saddened that the current rules that are in place to obtain pseudoephedrine are not working, but making it a prescriptive medicine is not the answer. It would only hurt the honest working person who needs the medication.\Charles R. ""Chad"" Shaffer\Kenova\Outsourcing still business as usual\Editor:\The recent article ""State buys new $98M computer system"" by Eric Eyre was well written but somewhat naive in that there was no mention of any independent audit or oversight to track this money. This is $98,000,000 - a lot of zeroes. A ""steering committee"" made up of Earl Ray Tomblin, Glen Gainer and John Perdue was mentioned, but these are the folks that need watching.\This strangely resembles the ""computerization"" of the Legislature in the late 1980s. A firm out of Colorado was ""awarded"" the contract of $1 million, even though, as now, there were competent West Virginia firms that would have welcomed the business. This time it is a firm out of Canada. Anytime we encountered problems, and they were often, one or more technical representatives had to be flown in from Colorado. Now it will be from Canada.\With no competent oversight, we will be wondering where this money is going. Keep in mind, every household in West Virginia could be computerized for this amount of money.\I realize this is ""business as usual"" and, after all, I voted for these folks.\Jack Miller\Madison\Delegate is not helping land owners\Editor:\Forced pooling does not protect property owners.\In response to articles on Jan. 6 citing Delegate Tim Manchin, O, my gosh! Is Delegate Tim Manchin serious? After months of meetings he failed to secure meaningful landowner rights. I suffered having my private property taken, damaged and destroyed by an oil and gas company with permission of the state. I consider Gov. Tomblin's horizontal drilling law a complete failure. It limits and reduces landowner rights and it does nothing to return or defend constitutional landowner rights.\Now, Tim Manchin wants to ""help us again"" by eliminating even more property rights. Tim Manchin's plan would not only force owners to surrender mineral property to a private company, it would deny owners just compensation because they would receive LESS royalties than others in the same mineral pool. How does Tim Manchin's plan compensate for the lease bonus under forced pooling? This is just another bad example of West Virginians being denied constitutional rights to property, just compensation, equal protection and due process.\Tim Manchin should stop telling property owners he is going to ""help them"" and instead protect our constitutional rights. It's difficult enough to oppose property invasion without his ""help."" People like me don't want to stop oil and gas development. But, we do oppose any ""forced taking"" of our property, government supported or otherwise. We oppose mineral development without regulatory enforcement that protects the environment. We want fair and equal protection under the law! Property owners are being ""legally"" robbed and our constitutional rights are being denied in plain view.\LTC Rick Humphreys, USA-Ret.\Mannington\Rep. Capito should back mass transit\Editor:\We need federal money to fix roads and bridges, but Rep. Shelley Moore Capito fails to tell us in her Feb. 2 Gazette column that her H.R.7 would cut Amtrak by 25 percent, deny gas tax funding to mass transit and eliminate funds for sidewalks and bicycle trails.\In toeing the party line, I doubt she considered constituents who ride the Amtrak Cardinal and the KRT buses. Or those trying to connect Charleston and South Charleston with a bicycle trail. Or motorists facing even more congestion if transit riders are forced to drive. Or people who can't afford to drive, with $3.50 gas.\The Senate has a somewhat better transportation bill, MAP-21, and I hope Rep. Capito, who has voted for Amtrak and transit in the past, will urge the conference committee to come out with a bill that gives us broad transportation choices. We can't keep gobbling up all our land, polluting our air, and wasting our fuel on new highways. Trains and transit are the engines that will provide construction jobs and move us, and our economy, into the future. Better places to walk and bicycle around our towns are also needed for healthy transportation.\Bonni McKeown\Charleston"
201," As the tax deadline edges closer, taxpayers frantically completing their 1040s may be wondering just what their hard-earned federal tax dollars pay for, anyway.\ Washington will spend $23,760 per household in 2006 - the highest inflation-adjusted total since World War II, and $6,500 more than in 2001. The federal government will collect $20,044 per household in taxes. The remaining $3,716 represents this year's budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.\ Here's a breakdown of how Washington will spend that $23,760 per household:\ Social Security/Medicare: $7,875. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. If nothing is done, taxes eventually will need to be raised by the current equivalent of $11,000 per household to pay all promised benefits. The unpredictable costs of the new Medicare drug entitlement could add thousands more to each household's tax bill.\ Defense: $4,701. The defense budget covers everything from military salaries to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies. Lawmakers drastically reduced defense spending following the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the $1,900 per household increase since 2001 has returned defense spending to its historical levels.\ Low-income programs: $3,579. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child- care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. Despite recent rhetoric about ""cuts for poor,"" anti- poverty spending now tops 3 percent of GDP for the first time ever.\ Interest on the federal debt: $1,930. The federal government is $8.2 trillion in debt. It owes $4.9 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raid annually). Despite rising debt, record-low interest rates have limited costs. As interest rates rise back to normal levels, these costs will spike.\ Federal employee retirement benefits: $870. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.\ Education: $732. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. Federal education spending has surged 137 percent since the 2001 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.\ Health research/regulation: $671. This spending is up 78 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. This category includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.\ Veterans' benefits: $618. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 56 percent since 2001.\ Community and regional development: $456. The $300 per household leap in this category since 2004 comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is financing much of the Hurricane Katrina relief.\ Highways/mass transit: $402. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached. Some economists suggest it would be more efficient to let states collect this tax and decide how to spend the money themselves.\ Justice administration: $363. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law-enforcement grant programs. New homeland security costs have added $80 per household to justice spending.\ Unemployment benefits: $338. Unemployment costs fluctuate based on the number of unemployed Americans. This year, unemployment costs are decreasing as job growth continues.\ International affairs: $305. This includes foreign economic and military assistance, operation of American embassies abroad, and contributions to organizations such as the United Nations. International spending has doubled since 9/11.\ Natural resources/environment: $287. This includes national parks, federal lands, water projects and environmental clean-up.\ Agriculture: $235. Despite rhetoric about supporting small family farms, the vast majority of farm subsidies are distributed to large farms with average household incomes over $135,000.\ The programs listed above cover $23,362 per household. The remaining $398 is allocated to all other federal programs, including social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.\ Taxpayers must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.\ How government will spend $23,760 per household: Social Security/ Medicare: $7,875 Defense: $4,701 Low-income programs: $3,579 Interest on the federal debt: $1,930 Federal employee retirement benefits: $870 Education: $732 Health research/regulation: $671 Veterans benefits: $618 Community and regional development: $456 Highways/mass transit: $402 Justice administration: $363 Unemployment benefits: $338 International affairs: $305 Natural resources/ environment: $287 Agriculture: $235 The programs listed above cover $23,362 per household.

The privilege is to serve them; the challenge is to get West Virginia moving again.\ The people demand that we no longer accept the idea that West Virginia should take last place at the nation's table.\ They demand that we educate our children so they can have better lives and take advantage of the job opportunities we will create, and, at the same time, they demand that we teach by example and by word the values that have made this a great state and a great nation.\ They demand that we improve our health care and that we provide the means for each citizen to have access to health care.\ They demand that we make our economy stronger and that we participate fully in the new economy based on information and technology.\ They demand that we protect the special places that make West Virginia what it is and preserve our water, our air and our land for future generations to enjoy.\ They demand that we conduct the business of government in a way that reflects the trust they have given us, that we are good stewards of the taxes they pay, that we conduct the people's business with their best interests in mind at all times and that we treat citizens as the customers of government, not as its subjects.\ Our job is to apply the resources of this wonderful state to one mission: to secure a better future for our people. This will require investment. It will require hard decisions. And it will require that we apply the values that make West Virginia great - hard work, fairness, honesty and humility.\ West Virginia must keep its best and brightest here at home and bring home the productive people who have left in recent years in search of economic opportunities they could not find here.\ Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to be home. I am happy that our family is together in West Virginia and it is with great happiness that I recognize my wife, Sandy, sitting in the front row tonight with our children, Robert and Alexandra.\ It gives us great pleasure as a family to know that our children's future in West Virginia is bright. But it is our responsibility to make it better.\ Getting West Virginia moving again will not be easy, my friends.\ Since taking office, I have instructed my department heads and staff to help me study the financial status of our state government. Ladies and gentlemen, the cupboard is bare. Despite the 3 percent budget cut, which I was forced to impose on the first day of my term, we are looking at a state budget with minimal growth for the next year.\ We're paying the price for some reckless decisions by state government. We have about $9 million in unpaid phone bills, some of them 3 years old. There have been massive overcommitments on highway projects, which we must now fund. The contingency fund that we need to keep in reserve for emergencies has been depleted along with several other funds.\ We now are at what appears to be the waning days of the longest period of economic growth in our nation's recent history, and West Virginia has precious little to show for it.\ I am presenting you tonight with a budget that is in balance, and that begins to make the investments we must make. It is a budget with no fat, no frills, and no nonsense. It is a budget that makes tough decisions. It is a budget that says the irresponsible practices that got us in this situation will not be tolerated again.\ I will not ask you to increase the tax burden on business. With the exception of eliminating the tax loophole that exists for smokeless tobacco, I will not ask for any change in existing consumer taxes. Our people's tax burden is high enough.\ It's also important to remember the health care we owe our veterans. That's why I support not only building a veterans nursing home, but speeding up the schedule for funding this home so that we can serve our aging veterans, as they served us.\ Our passport to prosperity is education, and education is the centerpiece of my program.\ Education is crucial to the future of our children and our state. Despite the state's financial condition, we must make some new investments in education. We cannot have economic development, we cannot fulfill our other responsibilities, without first making West Virginia truly the education state.\ My first priority is funding for the PROMISE Scholarship Program. This will provide each qualified student who works hard and plays by the rules with a scholarship at one of our state colleges or universities, or an equivalent scholarship to be used at a West Virginia private college, technical training center or other accredited program.\ This Legislature has already passed the basic legislation that created the PROMISE.\ But there hasn't been any money provided to keep the PROMISE.\ It has to happen. I'll tell you why.\ Very simply: West Virginia needs to build the kind of educated populace that is the key to participation in the new, information- based economy. Talk, as I have, to the executives at the High Tech Consortium in Fairmont. They will tell you that finding the qualified and educated work force is their greatest challenge.\ In order to do that, we must make our colleges, universities, technical training programs and other post-secondary education programs more accessible to our students. We need to change the expectation level of students and parents so that each child knows that by working hard, he or she can, and will, get the education and training needed for a good job.\ Some argue that needs-based scholarships should get top priority. Guess what? I agree. That's why this budget, for the first time in the history of the state, includes an additional $6 million to provide a West Virginia Higher Education Grant to every student who qualifies.\ But that's not enough. There are many West Virginia families just above the income limits who aren't eligible for assistance, yet have trouble paying for their children's higher education.\ The son and daughters of the Boone County coal miner - the Martinsburg schoolteacher - the steel worker in Weirton - the Putnam County truck driver - the Clarksburg police officer - need these dollars. If you work hard, you should be able to get some help.\ We've looked at every other state program that grants aid based on achievement. We've seen some tremendous successes, and we have noted that there were some problems and some growing pains. West Virginia can, and will, learn from the experience of other states that have established such programs in their higher education systems.\ The voters of West Virginia last November elected a governor whose No. 1 commitment was to make good on this promise. Every time I visit a school or meet with parents, they ask me if we're going to follow through.\ West Virginia students need this opportunity and incentive. It's time to quit talking and take action. The states we compete with are leaving us behind.\ I am delivering to you, today, as my first legislative priority, a budget which funds the PROMISE Scholarship for students in the fall of 2002. No student will be left behind. If you are qualified, you will get help from the state of West Virginia.\ Ladies and gentlemen, you made a promise. Working together, we are going to keep the promise!\ But that is not all.\ If students are going to make it in college, they will need to be prepared for college. Our top goal in this area is to reduce the number of students who are unprepared when they enter college. I have created, by executive order, a statewide council on college preparation that will look at the entire system, from preschool through graduate school, and recommend changes that will help all levels of education work together to benefit the students.\ A top quality educational system depends on all the education community - the school service personnel, the teachers, the principals, the administrators.\ Teachers are the heart of the educational system. All of us know a teacher who has made a difference in our lives. Tonight, I'd like you all to welcome a special guest - someone recognized for clearly making a difference in her students' lives. Donna Ream of Lewisburg Elementary School, the West Virginia Teacher of the Year.\ We must honor the work of our teachers. I have asked some of our business leaders to join me in that. And so, tonight, I am pleased to be joined by Greg Smith of Mountain State Blue Cross and Blue Shield and David Copenhaver, Tammy Hamby and Eric Sylvester of Toyota Motors. These two companies value education. They're creating good jobs that will employ well-educated people.\ Because they know how important teaching is, Mountain State Blue Cross and Blue Shield is awarding this West Virginia Teacher of the Year a check for $5,000.\ There's a brand new Toyota Avalon sedan parked next to the Governor's Mansion. For the next year, Ms. Ream will have the use of that car, courtesy of Toyota, as a token of its appreciation for the work of all West Virginia teachers. And, by the way, the three Toyota team members here tonight helped build that car's high quality engine at Toyota's plant in Buffalo, West Virginia.\ I wish we could do the same for every hardworking teacher, school service worker and principal. Unfortunately, when we began preparing this year's budget the declining economic conditions forced us to consider granting no salary increases. But when we are asking for even more effort, I simply can't do that. Therefore, I propose to increase the salary of every West Virginia elementary and secondary teacher by $1,000, and increase every school service worker's salary by $756, effective Jan. 1, 2002.\ We will continue to help teachers who want to do better in the classroom. The education bill I will bring before you tomorrow also adds an incentive for teachers to improve their teaching skills and achieve national certification. Each teacher who obtains this certificate, and it is not easy, ladies and gentlemen, will get a salary increase of $2,500.\ Let me speak directly to our educators. This pay increase is not adequate for what we ask you to do. Several years ago, your salaries were raised to 30th in the nation. But we have been losing the momentum that brought you there. In just the past four years, you have fallen to below 40th place.\ I commit to you tonight a multiyear effort to begin moving you back up the national ladder. I can't guarantee an exact amount for future years, because nobody knows what the economy will do.\ We need to do more to keep the best and the brightest educators in our schools. I will commit to working with you on a strategy to develop incentives to keep experienced teachers in class longer.\ I feel so strongly about this because of my personal experience as a parent. Recently, both our children have been involved in weekend academic competitions. It may be a Saturday, but their teachers are there. Several teachers even came into school early three days a week, or stayed late to coach their team. There is no extra pay, no financial reward. They are committed, and this commitment is in every school in our state. I would like to say to our principals, our teachers and our school service personnel, from Sandy and me, and on behalf of all West Virginia parents, ""Thank you for what you do.""\ Our schools must also reflect and reinforce our deeply held values. We can do a good job of teaching the Three R's ... reading, writing and arithmetic. But it's time to add two more ... responsibility and respect. Character education begins with parents. We're adding three-quarters of a million dollars in this budget to help teachers reinforce the lessons in character that children learn at home.\ We also must do more to ensure safety for everyone in our schools. I will guarantee that the toll-free School Safety Hot Line operates statewide 24 hours a day, and we will fully fund it at the state level for the first time.\ One thing we should do as we move toward becoming the education state, is to create a State Science Camp, modeled on West Virginia's successful National Youth Science Camp. I intend to work with the Legislature to make this happen.\ We also must ensure that school personnel and students work in modern schools. We need to get education out of trailers and into real classrooms. I will propose a bond package for capital improvements in public education.\ I served with pride in this Legislature 20 years ago, and we balanced our budget. I served in the United States House of Representatives for 18 years, during which we changed the philosophy of the Congress toward the discipline of a balanced budget. So I will not make proposals for new scholarship funds or pay raises without tying them directly to a source of revenue or to savings in other areas.\ We can fund these investments in our future, and, at the same time, address an issue that troubles many West Virginia families, by imposing restrictions and regulations on video gambling.\ West Virginia is drowning in a sea of video poker machines, better known as gray machines. Some estimates I have seen tell us there are, today, 20,000 to 30,000 of these machines in operation in our state.\ Our convenience stores and gas stations are becoming unlicensed casinos. Children wander past gambling on their way to the candy counter. And, for years, the government of West Virginia has sat idly by and let this happen.\ Every attempt to regulate this industry has been stopped, sometimes by people who claim that regulating it would ""expand gambling."" It would be difficult to devise any way to expand gambling any more than has happened in the past four years. It can't get worse. This illegal industry grosses as much as a half-billion dollars a year.\ The current situation, more than anything else, breeds disrespect for the law. When the state gives a wink and a nod to an industry that is clearly in violation of the laws, it sends a message that we are not serious about the rule of law. If we expect to raise up a generation of West Virginians with the character to build a better society, we must set a better example.\ Whatever our personal views on gambling might be, it is crystal clear that the time has come to remove thousands of machines from businesses frequented by children, to stop the development of unlicensed gambling parlors and to limit the number and location of new gambling machines.\ Together we can do this.\ The bill I will introduce tomorrow will reduce, restrict and regulate video gambling in West Virginia, and will do so by taking the following steps:\ - The number of video gambling machines will be limited to 9,000 statewide.\ - These machines will be prohibited in any part of a business open to young people, and there will be a limit of five machines at any one location.\ - Operators will have to pass a strict criminal background check and have been state residents for at least two years.\ - Anyone who operates an illegal gambling machine after Jan. 1, 2002, will forfeit not only that machine, but any and all legal and illegal machines under his or her control.\ My proposal will do something no one has done before - reduce, restrict and regulate the gray machines - and provide a steady new stream of income to finance the PROMISE Scholarship, other education efforts and the infrastructure necessary to build West Virginia.\ I appreciate those who say they oppose any expansion of gambling. So do I. But every year they stopped any regulation, they only made it possible for even more gambling. I look forward to working with you. But this must be the legislative session that finally acts to control these machines.\ Let's talk about economic development.\ If you want to take the temperature of our economy, I suggest you look at the license plates of the cars in your neighbors' driveways at Christmastime. You'll see their grown children's cars, their brothers' and sisters' cars, with Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland license tags.\ All these people think of West Virginia as home, because it is. They come back whenever they can. They're here for the holidays; they're here for college football games. Many plan to retire here. But they're making their living, and contributing to the economy, in our neighbor states.\ It doesn't have to be this way. Like we read in the Bible, in the Book of Jeremiah: ""There is hope, saith the Lord, that your children shall return to their own borders.""\ At the end of my time of office, I want West Virginia to be a destination for ambitious people. I want our state to be a magnet for investment. I will be West Virginia's number one salesman. I'm going to be on the road - around the state, around the country and around the world if needed - spreading the word about our abundant power: our electricity, our coal and gas, our timber and our water. I'll spread the word about our open spaces and our clean air.\ But most of all, I will tell investors we have the one thing that cannot be mined, manufactured or purchased anywhere: us. It's who we are, our people. We West Virginians, with our work ethic, our traditional values and our willingness to help each other out, are the best source of our own future prosperity.\ The state must be an active partner in economic progress. As a candidate, I presented the people of West Virginia with a detailed economic plan. They endorsed it. Now we must put it into action.\ We must remove the barriers that stand in the way of businesses large and small. We must move quickly when we have opportunities - or when disaster looms - to see that West Virginia is at the table when deals are being struck.\ Economic uncertainty abounds in the steel industry, in the chemical industry, in coal and gas, and many West Virginians are worried about their future. We can do better at anticipating change and in making West Virginia an attractive location for industry.\ I will create and chair the West Virginia Jobs SWAT Team. It is not enough to respond when a shutdown notice is issued; by then, it is usually too late. State development officials must be monitoring and anticipating these situations well in advance. Our Jobs SWAT Team will include the director of the Development Office, the secretary of Tax and Revenue, the commissioners of Employment Programs and Environmental Protection and others.\ We also will call on local and regional leaders and regional development groups like Advantage Valley to protect the jobs we have and attract new, high-quality jobs all over West Virginia.\ We don't have all the resources some other states may have, but we can work harder and smarter if we work as a team.\ We need to work as a team to take advantage of a historic opportunity that is before us in the energy market. This is the traditional backbone of West Virginia's economy. But it's a different world now. We have the energy resources the country needs, but we must work intelligently to harvest those resources and develop them in an environmentally appropriate way.\ I have established the Governor's Energy Advisory Task Force, with the help of the National Energy Technology Laboratory and others, to develop new strategies to make our coal, gas, electricity and other power sources work for us in the long term.\ We're also going to continue to build roads in West Virginia. Our congressional delegation has worked overtime to secure funding for Corridor H and Corridor D, and we will complete these roads and others crucial to our future. As a person who spent nearly 20 years on the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, I will continue to work to bring good roads to West Virginia communities.\ The Legislature already has authorized the issuance of $440 million in road bonds. Unfortunately, the previous administration overspent this authorization by $33 million. In order to meet these obligations, I am asking you today for authorization to issue the final $110 million in road bonds already approved by the voters. After meeting our existing obligations, the balance of this road fund will be used to match the greatest number of federal dollars.\ Obviously, to keep our road-building plans moving, I will ask you to renew the 5-cent gas tax. This is not a new tax, but simply continues an existing tax, and that $55 million is necessary to keep our road program going.\ I ask you for some important economic development legislation this year: the long-awaited reform of the West Virginia Capital Company Act. The Legislature created this act to stimulate new businesses.\ But many well-established companies, that could have obtained funding in the traditional marketplace, have tapped this fund and tapped West Virginia taxpayers.\ This has gone on too long.\ The bill before you will restrict this money to creating new jobs and new opportunities.\ I also am asking you to pass legislation to create a Sunny Day Fund, so that when a company is at the point of making an investment decision to create jobs in West Virginia, the state immediately can come in and put some financial muscle into the negotiating process.\ I will conduct, before the next regular session of this Legislature, a complete top-to-bottom review of the various tax incentives that have been developed for business over the past several decades. We need to see which ones work and strengthen them; we need to see if any are ineffective, and direct those resources elsewhere.\ And we need to study the tax incentives available in other states and countries and see where we can be more competitive. We will remove obstacles in state government to business start-ups. Through cooperation among state agencies, we will provide one-stop shopping - available 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the Internet - to entrepreneurs who want to do business in West Virginia.\ Most new businesses are started by people who already have a day job and can't afford to take time off to stand in lines at state offices.\ I also am ordering a review of the state's regulatory rules and practices. Regulation is important and can be a shield against unfair practices if it is effective and if it is not burdensome. West Virginia cannot allow outdated regulatory practices to slow down our economic growth.\ I have established by executive order the West Virginia Motorsports Council to begin to capture much more of the motor sports revenue that originates in this state. I also have created a Film Development Council to dramatically step up the effort to bring more motion-picture industry jobs to West Virginia. I'm sick and tired of watching movies about West Virginia that are filmed in other states. We're going to be in the driver's seat and in the movies, folks.\ We also must recognize that tourism has become an irreplaceable part of our economy. I love to bring business leaders to West Virginia for raft trips, or to a ski resort, or to one of our state parks. They fall in love with West Virginia, and then they want to move here. For thousands of people up and down the East Coast, and, increasingly, around the world, West Virginia is becoming a top tourist destination.\ I have included in the budget an improvement package to make crucially needed investments in our state parks. And we will find the funds to continue development of the Hatfield-McCoy Trail.\ West Virginia's congressional delegation has pledged to continue to work with us to get our economy moving again. Sen. Robert C. Byrd and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, and Congressman Nick Joe Rahall, Congressman Alan Mollohan and Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito have made it clear to me that they make this their first priority.\ My priority in working with our delegation in Washington will be to stop the destruction of the steel industry by illegal imports. West Virginia's steel industry has developed efficient processes and adapted to the new international marketplace. But it can't survive against an onslaught of subsidized and underpriced steel from abroad. This country must have a strong and vibrant steel industry to remain an industrial power, and West Virginia will be a part of it.\ I already have met with the top executives and union leadership of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel and Weirton Steel. The state will work closely with them to keep them strong. As our congressional delegation fights unfair foreign steel, I will join that battle.\ One step we can take immediately to preserve steel jobs is to require the use of U.S.-made steel in state-funded projects. I have prepared a bill to do just that. I respectfully urge you to take up this legislation at the start of business tomorrow, and to move it through both houses of this Legislature in record time. I promise to sign it the minute it arrives on my desk.\ We're in this fight, and we're in it to win for West Virginia.\ Let's talk about health care because we must improve the health of our people.\ This Legislature has acted wisely in establishing a Children's Health Insurance Program to help the uninsured children of working families. But this program has yet to reach many eligible children. Immediately after my administration began, we signed a contract with the state's primary-care clinics to promote CHIP in doctors' offices and other health-care settings.\ We will do even more to get the word out. Just this weekend, one of West Virginia's true native stars, Kathy Mattea, taped a public service announcement urging parents to call and sign their children up for health care. Let's thank Kathy Mattea and others like her for helping us reach out to thousands of children and get them the care they deserve.\ I have included $1.5 million in the budget to cover additional children. And we will work aggressively and cut through red tape to make sure every child in West Virginia has access to coverage, whether under CHIP, Medicaid or private insurance. Every child. That's my goal.\ We have a patient bill of rights law, so they say, in West Virginia, but patients will tell you it does not grant them very many rights. I want to fix that. I will present for your consideration a new Patient Bill of Rights, which includes a fast, impartial grievance procedure for disputes, independent reviews of coverage denials and the right to sue an HMO for negligence that results in harm to a patient.\ Senior citizens, the chronically ill and our state health budget all are being battered by rising drug prices. Upon taking office I summoned to the Capitol the representatives of the nation's drug manufacturers to meet with our state agencies that deal with prescription drugs. We now have a strategy to contain these costs: We're going to create a pharmacy benefit program for our poorest senior citizens. We're going to expand the discount program for seniors above the poverty level. We're developing a drug benefit plan that could be an add-on for people on Medicare and employer-based insurance. And we're going to pool the buying power of all the state agencies that purchase medicine and use this to drive a harder bargain with the drug companies.\ And while we're talking about health, I ask you to close the tax loophole that exempts smokeless tobacco from the same excise tax we have on cigarettes. Smokeless tobacco is sold to young West Virginians at an alarming rate. We have the highest consumption levels of this product in the country. This is a dangerous situation, particularly for our children, and raising the price of smokeless tobacco is a sure way of reducing its use by young people.\ I also have prepared for your consideration a bill to lower the blood alcohol standard for impaired driving to 0.08 percent. This is not only a public health and safety issue, but also will bring us into compliance with the federal standard and avoid the loss of highway funds that are contingent upon this action.\ Public employees deserve a stable, dependable health system, too. I am determined to keep the Public Employees Insurance Agency solvent. I also am proposing a measure to contain costs for agencies and for employees in our Public Employees Insurance Agency. We will improve service to employees and move to more efficient processes. The bill I will offer to you does not harm the benefit plans of any current employee, but will eliminate, for people hired on or after July 1 of this year, the option to trade unused sick leave for months or years of health coverage after retirement.\ Let me take a moment to talk about another challenge our state faces - how to achieve balance between developing our economy and protecting our environment.\ We will have a strong economy. We will continue to mine coal, to produce electricity, to manufacture quality goods and to create high- technology jobs.\ It was the prevailing wisdom in the last century and in previous generations that economic growth carried the price of environmental sacrifice. We in West Virginia often divided ourselves into two camps - energy on one side, environment on the other. In so doing, we lost sight of a basic truth: We will share the future of West Virginia together.\ It is my goal to put behind us the era of divisiveness on the issue of West Virginia's environment. All of us who love West Virginia, whether we work at a desk or in a coal mine, in a school or a factory, love our hills, our rivers, our woods and our valleys. We must preserve them for our children and their children.\ We can have a clean environment, and we can have good-paying jobs. And there must be no higher economic development priority; therefore, I ask you to elevate the director of the Division of Environmental Protection to the post of secretary, and add this official to the governor's Cabinet to emphasize the importance of environmental protection to this government and to our people.\ Every action DEP takes affects our environment and our economy.\ We can move beyond confrontation. We will. We strictly will enforce state and federal laws for the protection of the environment in the mining industry, so that citizens will know that the excesses of the past will not return. And we will work with all sides to have a reliable, uniform and predictable permit process.\ We will protect the places West Virginians hold dear. We cannot afford to have our natural treasures, like the Blackwater Canyon, slip out of our hands. I will, in the near future, announce a land conservation plan for West Virginia that respects both the private landowner and the public interest.\ We do not do this simply out of nostalgia or emotion. It's an economic investment as well. One of the treasures we have in West Virginia, that is increasingly rare in this country and the world, is the opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors just a few miles from the centers of our cities.\ Access to these lands is a prime drawing card for the high-paying jobs of the new economy, not tied to a single place by access to ports, railways or raw materials. With high-speed access to the Internet, many information-based jobs can be located anywhere. We want them here.\ One of the best selling points for West Virginia, the reason so many of our people wish they could come home, is our low crime rate. This always has been one of the safest places in America.\ This, too, is a reflection of our values: respect for each other, respect for God, respect for the law and rejection of violence. But there are some who do not respect these values. Our state, county and local police and our correctional officers guard us against crime.\ I had the sad duty a few days ago of traveling to Berkeley County to meet with the family, friends and fellow officers of Deputy Sheriff John Lewis Burkett III, who was killed in the line of duty, transporting a prisoner from Pennsylvania back to West Virginia. He was the third brave officer to fall in the line of duty since this Legislature last met.\ In June, Morgantown Police Officer Frank Fidazzo was killed in a training accident. In September, Nicholas County Sheriff's Deputy William Giacomo was shot and killed. Their deaths are a reminder of the price the men and women of our law enforcement agencies are willing to pay for our safety. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a moment of silence to honor these officers and all who have paid the ultimate price in our defense.\ Although we value their work, those who guard us against crime are paid far less in West Virginia than in our surrounding states. This is particularly true in the correctional system. After completing the required training, the starting salary for a correctional officer is $18,000. Severely understaffed and overworked, our correctional officers are spending long days in close quarters with dangerous and unpredictable criminals. I ask you to pass legislation that will provide a $2,000 annual raise for correctional officers.\ Our State Police, too, are not paid adequately in accordance with the burden they carry. And we are unable, in this tight budget year, to give them all they deserve. But I have set aside $1.5 million in the budget to offer an adjustment in the trooper longevity schedule that will reward our troopers for remaining on the job. It will be a down payment, I hope, on a salary plan that will encourage young officers to attend the State Police Training Academy and for senior officers to continue providing their much-needed experience.\ We will remain a safe state for families and for business. And friends, this is one reason I'm very glad to be home and to have my family here in West Virginia.\ There are many others who work hard for West Virginia. Our state government is made up of hard-working, competent and dedicated people. I have visited many of the departments of state government since taking office, and I am impressed by the people who serve us in those departments.\ I am proposing tonight a $756 annual increase in salaries for all state employees, effective Jan. 1, 2002. Once again, this is not adequate for what our public employees do. Unfortunately, it is all our state can afford.\ Our government does not always look as good from the outside as it does from the inside. Our policies and processes of government are often confused and contradictory. We make it difficult to do simple things.\ Businesspeople have learned that the marketplace no longer tolerates poor service. The economic battlefield is littered with the corpses of once-proud companies that didn't make the transition from a product-based marketplace to a service-based marketplace.\ Our state government must adopt a customer-service mentality, from top to bottom, to meet the needs of all citizens.\ Our citizens need 24-hour, seven-day-a-week service from government. Companies like Ama zon.com, which are creating new jobs in West Virginia, have shown that people can and will make transactions around-the-clock. If we can buy books and CDs at 10 p.m., why can't we buy hunting and fishing licenses, reserve a cabin in a state park, renew a license plate, apply for a business permit or check the status of a tax return?\ I have directed my Office of Technology to launch an e-government initiative. We will identify, from the consumer's perspective, the government services that can most easily be carried out online. If you're a customer of a state agency, write to me or send me an e- mail and tell me how we can serve you better.\ Because of what we have discovered in the last month about how West Virginia government has sometimes operated, I am presenting you with a bill to create, within the governor's office, an Office of Internal Audit and Risk Assessment. For too long, problems that developed in the administration of state government were allowed to fester until they became unmanageable. We have lost millions of dollars in correcting old mistakes, paying bills that somehow were forgotten, and otherwise cleaning up messes that easily could have been avoided.\ West Virginians expect and need better service from government. They deserve it. And they will get it from this administration.\ I am honored to serve West Virginia. I pledge to get us moving in the right direction. We must make some strategic investments. We must set aside our conflicts to shape our future together. We must create opportunities for our children.\ Tonight, as is customary, I present my budget to this Legislature.\ But these are extraordinary times.\ So tonight I take the extraordinary step of submitting not just a budget, but also all of the bills that are required to take the actions I have proposed.\ We have worked hard to get these ready in the 30 days I have been in office. We will work twice as hard with you to get them enacted in the next 60 days.\ I ask your help and your prayers as we set about to make this great state a better place for all of its citizens.\ Every West Virginian senses at some time an evident truth: God walks among these West Virginia hills. From the smoky mist rising from every hollow - to the deer raising her head from the mountain stream - to neighbors that gather 'round in times of hardship and grief and in times of joy.\ West Virginia is a special place.\ There are times in special places we can rest and rejoice in what we have. And there are times we are called to rise to the challenges. My friends, you and I know that this legislative session summons us to great effort.\ Our challenges are great, but our opportunities are boundless. Working together, we will answer that call.\ Thank you, and good night. And God bless West Virginia."
203,"U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller has proposed legislation that would provide low-income families with a monthly stipend of $100 to $165 to offset soaring gasoline costs. \Rockefeller's bill would mirror the eligibility requirements for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helped 79,493 West Virginia households last year with home heating costs.\According to the West Virginia Democrat's plan, recipients would have to show that they drive 30 miles a day, or 150 miles a week, for work, education or health care. Recipients also would have to fall between 110 percent to 150 percent of the federal poverty level. In West Virginia, that means a family of four could receive the gasoline stipend only if the household income was less than $26,845. For an individual, the cutoff point would be $13,273.\""Congress must take action now to provide immediate relief. This is about people and families who are struggling, and many of them have no choice but to drive far away because that's where the jobs are,"" Rockefeller said. ""A monthly check of $100 to $165 will help those who are really doing everything they can to find a way to pay for the increasing costs of gas, and now food.""\The average price of gas in West Virginia today was $3.71, according to AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. Charleston's average was also $3.71, but the price differed throughout the state. Gas in Weirton cost $3.60 while the average price in Parkersburg was $3.61.\In a speech before Congress last week, Rockefeller discussed how gas prices have burdened average West Virginians.\""West Virginians are hurting,"" Rockefeller told his colleagues. ""West Virginians will always find a way to persevere - always - but right now many are struggling to juggle expenses, making enormous sacrifices to feed and clothe their families while trying to pay the cost of going to work.""\He later added, ""Today, if you are lucky enough to live or work near Sam's Club in Vienna, which is on the Ohio River, and you can afford to become a member there, you can get a gallon of gasoline for $3.49. It is hard for anyone I know in West Virginia to think of that as cheap, but it is the lowest price reported in the entire state.""\The senator also noted that the high cost of gas is keeping West Virginians indoors and away from contributing to the local economy.\""People pretty much have canceled the occasional splurge for a movie,"" he said. ""In other words, if it is a non-emergency purchase, they bypass it. It takes away from their happiness, their stability as a family, but they have no choice.""\Rockefeller's program would be subject to the annual appropriation process with an initial authorization of $2 billion a year.\Each state would receive an amount tied to income eligibility and current gas prices. West Virginia would receive roughly $21.7 million a year.\The revenue could be offset through a windfall profits tax or a rollback of the tax cuts on the top 1 percent wage earners, Rockefeller said.\He said his plan is more economically feasible than the proposed gas tax holiday, which was originally proposed by U.S. Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential frontrunner. McCain's proposal would cost $9 billion.\A gas tax holiday would also slash revenues for highway projects while the low-income gas plan would not, Rockefeller added.\Rockefeller also called on Congress to increase fuel efficiency standards, suspend deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and impose a tax on windfall gas profits.\He also supports oil and gas exploration in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which could add 1.26 billion new barrels of oil to the domestic supply, according to his office.\But Rockefeller still opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which he fears would be expensive and possibly damaging to the environment.\Contact writer Jake Stump at jakestump@dailymail.com or 348-4842.\Credit: DAILY MAIL CAPITOL REPORTER"
204,"DAYTON, Ohio - On the road in a tour bus this week, the U.S. transportation secretary is spreading some bad news: the government's Highway Trust Fund is nearly broke. If allowed to run dry, that could set back or shut down projects across the country, force widespread layoffs of construction workers and delay needed repairs and improvements. Anthony Foxx kicked off an eight-state bus trip in Ohio to whip up public support for congressional approval of legislation to keep federal transportation aid flowing to states for another four years, and possibly longer. But Congress will have to act fast. The Highway Trust Fund - the source of much of the aid - is forecast to essentially run dry sometime before the end of the federal fiscal year Sept. 30, and possibly as early as late August.\If that happens, the government will have to slow down or even halt payments to states, which rely on federal aid for most major highway projects. Uncertainty over whether there will be enough funds in the coming months is already causing officials in states like Arkansas, California and Colorado to consider delaying planned projects.\Foxx's warnings this week echo ones by President Barack Obama, who cautioned in February that unless Congress finished a bill by summer's end then ""we could see construction projects stop in their tracks. But there is little interest among politicians in an election year to consider raising gasoline taxes.\Many transportation insiders, including Foxx's predecessor, Ray LaHood, predict Congress will wind up doing what it has done repeatedly over the past five years - dip into the general treasury for enough money for to keep programs going a few weeks or a few months, at which point the exercise will have to be repeated all over again.\But keeping highway and transit aid constantly teetering on the edge of insolvency discourages state and local officials from moving ahead with bigger and more important projects that take many years to build. In 2012, Congress finally pieced together a series of one-time tax changes and spending cuts to programs unrelated to transportation in order to keep the trust fund solvent for about two years. Now, the money is nearly gone.\""Tell Congress we can't slap a Band-Aid on our transportation system any longer, Foxx urged state and local officials at a stop Monday to view one of Ohio's biggest construction projects. Other states on the tour are Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\Foxx is promoting Obama's four-year, $302 billion plan to shore up the trust fund with savings from proposed changes to corporate tax laws. The White House has said as much as $150 billion could come from its proposal to close corporate loopholes, such as ones that encourage U.S. companies to invest overseas.\""I feel it's clearly a crisis, Fox said in an interview, ""but we have a responsibility to put a proposal out there that casts a longer-term vision, that helps Congress and the country quite frankly think past our noses, and that's what we're doing.\It would also be a one-time fix, but it would generate enough money to ratchet up transportation for several years. Rep. David Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House's tax-writing committee, has also proposed a one-time, $126.5 billion infusion into the trust fund over a period of eight years. But his plan is part of a much broader rewrite of corporate laws, which would require heavy-lifting from Congress at any time, but especially in the hyper-partisan atmosphere of an election year.\""There doesn't seem to be much of an appetite to go after corporate tax reform this year, which is the only long term funding source that has been proposed by both the administration and Congress, said Joshua Schank, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington transportation think tank.\But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told reporters last week that ""what seems to be coming forward as a consensus is a piece of tax reform rather than shifting money from the general treasury or fuel taxes.\Foxx cited the modernization of Interstate 75, which rumbles through the heart of this middle-sized Ohio city, as an example of the kind of much needed improvements communities want but may have to forgo. The $381 million project is intended to expand the highway's capacity, reduce traffic congestion, and eliminate dangerous and confusing left-hand exits. More than a third of the project's cost is being paid with trust fund dollars.\The interstate highway program, launched in 1956, has been funded primarily through federal gas and diesel taxes under the principle that users of the system should pay for its construction and maintenance. But it's been clear for nearly a decade that fuel taxes haven't been keeping pace with transportation needs as the nation's population grows and its infrastructure ages.\The 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax was last increased in 1993 as part of a deal between President Bill Clinton and Congress to raise money to help reduce the federal deficit and pay for transportation programs. Clinton was fiercely criticized by Republicans as a tax-raiser, and the issue was one of several reasons Democrats lost control of the House and Senate the following year.\It was a lesson lawmakers in both parties took to heart.\""People don't want to vote to increase the gas tax, LaHood, a former Republican congressman, said in an interview.\With encouragement from Congress, some states are stepping up their use of tolls to help pay for projects. But tolls aren't practical for all projects.\""Congress is stymied, said John Horsley, former executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. ""We're all scratching our heads.\Credit: JOAN LOWY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"

A comprehensive approach must be made to address the issue of any West Virginian without health care. For too long we have made changes in a piecemeal effort, depending on those in the health care and business fields to provide the solutions. The state must look at this issue from the grassroots level.\2. First, by implementing a plan to erase the stigma attached to mental health. Once we understand the challenges faced by those seeking the care, a streamlined approach to diagnosis and treatment could be put in place in more health care facilities. I also feel there is a need for a defined curriculum at the higher education level. 3. Balancing their budgets at home. With the ever-rising cost of health care, fuel and the basic cost of living, we all are challenged with what to cut from our individual budgets.

Third, if the uninsured uses his/her voucher on a yearly basis, the State will cover the costs of serious medical conditions that may develop. If the uninsured does not use the yearly vouchers. 2. The Ombudsman of Mental Health has recommended another large facility be built. Currently there are three, each over capacity. I recommend that at least one facility be built and that rural areas have easier access to mental health treatment. Most do not seek treatment because they cannot afford to put gas into their cars, do not have a cars or a license to drive. 3. The biggest financial challenge West Virginians face is high energy prices. The dramatic increase in the cost of transportation; increases in heating and utility costs; and inflation that has increased the basic needs, such as food, has reduced the ability for most West Virginians to live on the current pay they receive. 4. I would cut taxes on all prescription medication, medical treatment, utilities and food.\successful only if reforms efficiently provide needed services at minimum cost while complementing already available services and financing sources. 4. Continue the Business Franchise Tax phase out and 28% of the Corporation Net Income Tax rate.

Mental health care should be included in health insurance coverage, so that more people can take care of both mind and body. 3. West Virginia has a varied and energetic workforce, but access to good paying jobs is limited. I would work with the governor to attract more business to our great state.

Herb Snyder, D-Jefferson, who led an interim committee that studied the tire problem for a year.\""It's going to cost a substantial amount of money to clean it up,"" Snyder said.\""This is an aggressive waste management program,"" Snyder said. ""In the House and in the Senate, we have to make a decision, are we going to belly up to the problem and charge a fee or are we going to walk away from it?""\The bill would impose a $2 tax on every new tire sold, including those that come on new cars. Tires on bicycles, wheelbarrows and other human-powered objects would be exempt.\The tax would remain in place for five years and proceeds would be used to clean up tires strewn throughout the state.\The DEP could use 7 percent of tax collections to manage the program. The Tax Department would receive 1 percent. The rest would be used to clean up tires.\Sen. Mike Ross, D-Randolph, tried unsuccessfully to amend the fee out of the bill, which Snyder said would ""gut"" the measure. Another amendment by Sen. Frank Deem, R-Wood, to reduce the fee to 75 cents a tire also was defeated.\Ross warned senators that tire dealers and auto dealers would post signs saying, ""These senators voted for this tax."" Similar signs were posted the last time the Legislature raised the gas tax and some of those who voted for it were subsequently voted out of office, Ross said.\But Sens. Brooks McCabe and John Mitchell, both D-Kanawha, said they would be proud to have their names posted as having voted for the bill.\""This appears to be a well-thought out, methodical way to deal with it,"" McCabe said.

207," WASHINGTON - Congressional negotiators are trying again to move a massive, jobs-creating highway bill, energized by White House concessions that eased a veto threat and opened the way for more generous spending.\ At a meeting with their Senate counterparts Thursday, House lawmakers are expected to float an offer of about $284 billion in spending over the next six years to fund highway and mass transit programs.\ That amount would concur with what President Bush, in an Oval Office conversation with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., indicated he would now find acceptable for a bill expected to generate tens of thousands of new construction jobs and give an economic boost to nearly every part of the country.\ For months the White House has insisted that the president would issue the first veto of his presidency on any highway bill that went much beyond $256 billion. At issue for the White House has been how to move the popular election-year bill and still maintain control over the growing budget deficit.\ The old six-year highway bill, funded at $218 billion, expired last September and has had to be extended three times to keep federal funding to the states from drying up. The latest extension runs out July 31, and Congress, which leaves at the end of this week for its August recess, will have to approve another stopgap measure, possibly until the end of September.\ Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on Tuesday proposed a compromise number of $289 billion in guaranteed spending, or $301 billion if contracts that go beyond the six-year period are included.\ With many senators from both parties pressing for a higher figure, Inhofe said his offer was ""the only compromise that is sellable"" and warned that failure of the House to accept it could kill any hope of passing a bill this year.\ Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, said the White House concession ""opens an opportunity to create further movement"" on the stalled bill, but added, ""I can't imagine the Senate accepting $284 billion.""\ The original Senate-passed bill was for $318 billion, compared with a $284 billion House-passed bill, and the higher number has wide support among both House and Senate members who argue that anything less would make it impossible to correct inequities in the current distribution system.\ Currently, states are guaranteed 90.5 cents back for every $1 they contribute to the highway trust fund, which is derived from the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax."
208,"Congressman Alan Mollohan sided with eight other Democrats in temporarily killing a measure that would have allowed expanded offshore oil drilling in an attempt to curb rising fuel costs. \But Mollohan's spokesman said the congressman actually supports the idea and voted against the measure for procedural reasons.\Rep. John Peterson, R-Pa., tried to pass an amendment to the Interior Department spending bill that would have lifted a 27-year moratorium on oil drilling in the outer continental shelf - which lies between 50 and 200 miles off U.S. coasts and is under federal government jurisdiction.\Peterson introduced the amendment during Wednesday's meeting of the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agenices of the powerful House Appropriations Committee.\The measure was voted down 9-6 along party lines.\Peterson slammed the Democrats for what he called inaction on the high gas prices. He vowed to continue pushing the issue.\""While the American people continue to endure the pain at the pump - begging Washington for relief - Democrats on (the subcommittee) voted to keep the status quo, and continue with 27 years of failed policy that restricts domestic production of oil and natural gas offshore,"" Peterson said in a statement.\Mollohan's spokesman, Gerry Griffith, said the congressman supports Peterson's measure, though some news accounts of the meeting showed other Democratic members of the subcommittee lobbing criticism at Peterson's amendment.\But Griffith said Mollohan, D-W.Va., simply felt the subcommittee wasn't the right place to consider such a measure.\""If Mr. Peterson offers the same amendment when the full committee meets next week, Mr. Mollohan will vote for it,"" Griffith said. Peterson has vowed to bring up the matter again when the appropriations committee meets on Wednesday.\Dealing with rising fuel prices has split congressional Democrats, who want to punish the oil companies for excessive profits, and Republicans, who want to expand oil exploration and suspend the federal gas tax.\Peterson believes his plan could have stemmed that division. ""The amendment I offered today was a clear opportunity for both Democrats and Republicans to come together ... to help stabilize the price of oil and natural gas, and eventually wean our dependence off foreign unstable countries,"" Peterson said.\Oil prices have grown steadily, reaching more than $130 a barrel this month.\Meanwhile, the average price of a gallon of regular gas has risen to an average of about $4.06, up from $3.73 a gallon a month ago, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report.\Peterson said allowing exploration in the outer continental shelf would yield 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\""Folks, that is the equivalent of 35 years of imported oil from OPEC,"" Peterson said.\Peterson was one of 115 representatives who sponsored legislation, which passed through the House in 2006, that would have allowed the Interior Department to authorize drilling in the outer continental shelf from 100 miles out.\But the so-called Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act never passed the Senate.\Mollohan and Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., voted in favor of the legislation.

210,"STAFF WRITER\A bill to fund a statewide cleanup of abandoned tire piles advanced from a Senate committee Tuesday, overcoming attempts to gut the funding source.\Called the Waste Tire Management Act, the bill would impose a $2 fee on new tire purchases to raise $3.6 million a year to clean up tire piles. The fee would expire in 2004.\In Judiciary Committee Tuesday, Sen. Mike Ross, D-Randolph, attempted to eliminate the proposed fee. He said most dealers charge customers a fee to dispose of their old tires already.\""I'm not against cleaning up the tire piles. I'm just against imposing more fees on the consumer,"" he said.\Sen. Herb Snyder, D-Jefferson, said nobody likes additional fees, but there's no other way to clean up the estimated 8 million to 20 million aban doned tires across West Virginia.\""Are we going to charge a fee and take care of this problem, or walk away from the problem?"" he asked. ""If we take the fee out there will be no tire cleanup.""\He noted that 92 percent of the funds raised would go directly for tire pile cleanup. The Division of Environmental Protection would get 7 percent of the fees for administrative costs, while 1 percent would go to the Department of Tax and Revenue for the costs of collecting the fees.\He said 40 other states have similar waste tire management laws, including every surrounding state.\Ross warned freshmen senators that voting for the bill could create a voter backlash. He recalled that when the Legislature last increased the gas tax, many service station owners responded by posting the names of local legislators who voted for it.\Kanawha County's freshman senators didn't see it that way, however.\""I think somebody ought to put a sign on the wall with the senators who voted to clean up the environment,"" said Sen. Brooks McCabe, D-Kanawha.\Sen. John Mitchell, Jr., D-Kanawha, agreed.\""In this case, I'd be proud to have my name posted as a senator who supported this bill,"" he said.\Committee members also rejected an attempt by Sen. Frank Deem, R- Wood, to lower the fee from $2 per tire to 75 cents.\Deem said that, in talking with the governor's office, the administration supports the bill, but believes the fee is too high.\Snyder said the reduction would gut the bill, making it impossible to complete the cleanup of tire dumps in the state before the fee expires.\The bill also includes a 10 percent tax credit for the purchase of equipment to prepare the tires for alternative uses.\It also makes it a felony to illegally dispose of 100 or more tires.\In other activity Tuesday, the Senate:\- Passed 34-0 a House bill that eliminates possible jail terms for a variety of misdemeanors.\The intent is to reduce costs for public defenders' services, as well as regional and county jail expenses.

211,"Ninety-nine days. That's how much later West Virginia's primaries are than Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses that begin on Feb. 1, 2016. And that's why most presidential candidates are going out of their way to keep Iowa's special interests happy, even if it hurts hard-working West Virginians in the process.\One issue in particular stands out: the Renewable Fuel Standard. The RFS is a 2005 federal mandate that requires fuel refiners to blend biofuels-primarily corn-based ethanol-into gasoline.\It's a big deal in Iowa, which produces much of the ethanol the rest of us are forced to use, despite higher costs and dubious benefits.\The RFS amounts to a regressive gas tax. It harms low- and middle-class families in West Virginia and across the country by driving up the cost of gasoline and pushing down total miles per gallon. And despite its intentions, it actually harms the environment.\Consider the RFS' effect on gas prices.\The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated the RFS could raise prices at the pump by 13 to 27 cents per gallon by 2017, and diesel by 30 to 51 cents.\With West Virginia gas prices averaging around $2.76 per gallon today, the RFS could raise them by close to 10 percent or more.\This comes at a bad time for West Virginians. Affordable gasoline has offered a lifeline to households currently struggling to make ends meet, providing the equivalent of a $700 tax cut per family since last June. The RFS will reverse this much-needed reprieve.\Making matters worse is that ethanol has a lower fuel economy than gasoline. So as the RFS requires increasingly more ethanol to be blended into your gas, it decreases the distance each gallon will take you. The result is more trips to the gas station and less money in your pocket.\And while the RFS was passed on promises that it would be environmentally friendly, in practice it has been anything but.\When factoring in the additional farming and refining ethanol requires, the World Resources Institute found that it does more harm than good.\Which begs the question: If the RFS is all pain and no gain, why would presidential candidates support it? Perhaps because Iowa's presidential caucuses, the first in the nation, come well before West Virginia's primaries-which supposedly makes their interests more important than ours.\The ethanol special interests in Iowa and Washington, D.C. are already betting the farm to keep the RFS alive.\Lobbyists at the Renewable Fuels Association recently launched a multi-million PR campaign they described as ""the most aggressive issue advocacy effort people have ever seen in the history of the Iowa caucuses. Their goal? To get White House hopefuls to support the RFS by dangling Iowa's votes.\Of course, Congress could easily take this issue off the table by repealing the Renewable Fuel Standard on its own. Half measures, such as legislation to repeal only the corn mandate, would make America's energy policy resemble California's, where gas prices are far and away the highest in the nation.\Americans may wish we had California's sunshine, but we don't need their high gasoline prices.\The only acceptable solution is to repeal the mandate entirely. U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) has already introduced legislation that would do just that. West Virginians should encourage their members of Congress to join him in passing it without delay.\Meanwhile, instead of focusing on how to get votes in just one state, presidential candidates should focus on what's good for the whole country.\With the primaries and caucuses still eight months away, there's plenty of time to make sure the RFS gets the national attention it deserves.\Opposing it should be an easy decision for principled candidates who side with American families over special interests.\Credit: Charles Drevna Contributing columnist"
212,"THERE are two iron laws of energy policy in the United States. Iron Law No. 1: A higher federal excise tax on fuel would efficiently reduce gasoline consumption and its negative side effects (air pollution, traffic congestion, carbon emissions, dependence on foreign oil). \Iron Law No. 2: Although economically rational, gas taxes are politically unpopular, so Congress will go to almost any length to avoid raising them, even if that means resorting to far less transparent policies.\Hence we have Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars, which take a Ph.D. in mathematics to comprehend - and increase the price of a new automobile by hundreds of dollars.\Hence, too, we have elaborate government mandates and subsidies for blending ethanol into gasoline, which cause farmers to divert land, water and capital into growing corn and other crops for fuel rather than food.\True, ethanol policy became somewhat less irrational at the end of 2011, when Congress finally allowed a $6 billion annual tax credit to expire.\But a 2007 federal law mandating ever-greater ethanol consumption remains on the books, and it is starting to create the economic equivalent of a multi-car freeway pileup.\Known as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the law requires refiners to blend 36 billion gallons of ethanol and the like into transportation fuels by 2022.\Alas, like many previous attempts at central planning, the RFS has run afoul of changing realities in the marketplace - specifically, a seemingly permanent leveling-off of motor-fuel consumption due to changing driving habits, the sluggish U.S. economy and CAFE standards, among other factors.\As it happens, gasoline consumption hit an all-time high of nearly 9.1 million barrels a day in the year that Congress passed - and President George W. Bush signed - the RFS. It has since dropped by half a million barrels a day, and the Energy Department forecasts that the downward trend will continue through 2040.\The result is that the fuel industry is about to hit a ""blend wall."" The 2007 standard calls for producers to blend more ethanol into gasoline than the market can absorb at the current standard rate of 10 percent per gallon.\Producers can still meet their regulatory obligations by buying obscure, tradable credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs.\Formerly a few cents per gallon, the price of a RIN recently reached $1.40 as businesses covered by the RFS - and speculators - snapped them up in anticipation of the ""blend wall.""\Industry experts expect companies to pass the cost along to consumers, to the tune of at least 19 cents per gallon at the pump, according to a study by the Energy Policy Research Foundation. The total cost would reach $25 billion a year.\Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency bowed to these realities, announcing that it would use its waiver authority to reduce the ethanol mandates for 2014. That provides industry a reprieve of sorts; it certainly may spare politicians of both parties the trouble of running for office in the middle of a government-induced spike in gas prices.\Still, the EPA's action is far from a permanent fix. The 2007 law allows the agency to grant such waivers for only a year at a time. Oh, and here's another perversity: Eliminating the ""blend wall"" would destroy the value of RINs people have bought to cope with it.\Meanwhile, a central purpose of the 2007 law - energy ""independence"" - is well on its way to being met through other means, chiefly a boom in oil production that Congress and the Bush administration never anticipated. The Energy Department projected earlier this year that the United States will be able to supply two-thirds of its petroleum needs through the next three decades.\The ethanol industry grouses that the whole mess with the RFS and RINs could have been avoided but for the refusal of ""Big Oil"" to invest in the production and distribution of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, or 85 percent ethanol ""flex fuel.""\I suppose they have a point - if you think it's plausible that any industry would have willingly invested billions of dollars to help sell a competing product.\This is the sort of argument between rent-seekers that occurs when government tries to meet public-policy objectives through complex subsidies and mandates - rather than by setting broad incentives and letting market participants respond to them.\A gas-tax increase would clean up the environment and cut oil imports, with the revenue going to reduce the federal deficit - as opposed to lining the pockets of various well-connected industries.

213," WASHINGTON - Defying a presidential veto threat, the Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a highway spending bill that would bring jobs and billions of dollars in new construction money to states across the country.\ The Republican-controlled Senate voted 76-21 to pass a six-year, $318 billion highway and mass transit spending bill, replacing the current six-year program that expires at the end of this month. The vote margin would be enough to override a possible presidential veto.\ ""Everybody agrees we need to put much more money into road, highways, bridges and mass transit,"" said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., a chief sponsor. ""This bill does that.""\ Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., were among those supporting the measure.\ But the $318 billion sought far outstrips the $218 billion approved for the current six-year plan and the $256 billion the administration insists should be the ceiling at a time when the government faces record-high budget deficits. The House has yet to act on its bill. Some House members say the Senate total is too low to fix the nation's crumbling highways.\ The administration says it would recommend that Bush use his veto authority for the first time in his presidency if the final bill is at the Senate spending level.\ ""This is the first test for the Congress when it comes to spending restraint,"" White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Thursday. ""We urge Congress to hold the line on spending.""\ But Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said conservative estimates are that the bill will create 1.6 million jobs over its lifetime. It is politically important to many lawmakers eager to direct federal spending to their states and districts.\ Showing their willingness to take on the president, senators voted 78-20 to defeat an amendment by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., to reduce the funding to the president's $256 billion figure.\ Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said that even as a fiscal conservative he believed in spending more in certain areas such as national defense and infrastructure. ""I know that's what we are supposed to be doing here.""\ With Democrats generally supporting the bill, the fight was mainly among Republicans.\ ""The party of fiscal sanity, the party of smaller government,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is supporting a bill ""when the president of the United States and the American people are saying enough, enough deficit spending.""\ At a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Treasury Secretary John Snow characterized the highway bill as a litmus test for the government's will to cut the deficit. A bill that exceeds the president's request, he said, ""would have a very, very, very corrosive effect in financial market confidence in all of us.""\ Senate supporters denied that it increased the deficit, saying all the money comes out of the highway trust fund paid for by the 18.4-cent federal tax that drivers pay at the gas pump. The Senate Finance Committee outlined several budgetary actions, some questioned by critics of the bill, to increase the flow of money into the trust fund.\ In a key vote Thursday, the Senate defeated, by 72-24, an attempt by McCain to declare the bill out of order because it exceeded previously set budget limits.\ Earlier, the Senate voted 86-11 to end a filibuster from conservatives who agreed with the Bush administration that the deficit- ridden government can't afford the highway bill. Both the budget and filibuster votes needed 60-vote majorities.\ Backers of full funding said 35 percent of the 42,000 people killed annually in vehicle crashes die because of road conditions. They also said congestion costs the average peak-hour driver $1,160 a year and the nation $67 billion in wasted fuel and lost productivity.\ Bill sponsors also turned back a rebellion from senators who claimed that their states lose out under a formula that guarantees that by 2009 every state will get at least 95 cents back for every dollar it contributes to the trust fund.\ Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, sought to shift $9 billion in unallocated funds in the bill to help rapid-growth states such as Texas, California and Florida with pressing infrastructure needs. Her amendment was defeated, 78-17.\ With little hope of getting a bill soon, the House voted Wednesday to extend the existing highway program for four months, through the end of June. The current program ended last September, but was temporarily extended through the end of this month.\ The House Transportation Committee is seeking even more money, $375 billion, and has proposed raising the gasoline tax, an idea strongly opposed by the White House and House GOP leaders.\ But one Senate conservative, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that ""probably over time conservatives are going to have to come to grips with the idea that a gas tax increase is going to be the only legitimate way, and honest way, to make up the shortfalls in terms of highway needs.""\ On the Net: Congress: http://thomas.loc.gov/\ Credit: The Associated Press"

215,"WASHINGTON - Faced with the threat that federal money for 117,000 transportation projects would begin to dry up in two weeks, the House on Tuesday approved a nearly $11-billion patch to extend funding through May. The stop-gap fix to avert a crisis imperiling up to 700,000 construction jobs won endorsement from the White House, but the Senate is likely to tinker with it before it reaches President Barack Obama's desk.\The bill, approved by a 367-55 vote, would transfer $9.9 billion from the general fund and $1 billion from a separate trust fund into the rapidly dwindling Highway Trust Fund, which is expected to run in the red starting next month.\The general fund transfers would be offset by extending customs fees and a process called pension smoothing, both steps that critics have denounced as gimmicks and ""smoke and mirrors.\""We shouldn't be paying for filling potholes by creating potholes in Americans' pensions, said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who voted against the bill. ""This is not a serious or sustainable response to the challenge of an underfunded highway program. Congress should bite the bullet and do its job.\The Senate is moving toward it's own short-term fix built around those two funding sources and tapping into an array of others. Rather than move forward with that bill, the Senate may amend the House bill to its liking and send it to the White House.\A small but critical difference between the two bills will have to be resolved. The House bill extends funding until May 31, the Senate bill, which contains a similar amount of cash, is open ended.\Pull back the covers on that discrepancy to uncover a largely partisan divide.\Senate Democrats, who say they have a few silent GOP supporters, insist that a long-term transportation bill must be considered in the post-election lame-duck session. They argue that extending the funding window until June could make transportation a pawn next year in larger debates about the debt ceiling or a continuing resolution on the federal budget.\House Republicans, with support from several GOP senators, including Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, favor giving the new Congress time to find its legs before tackling transportation.\The nub of the controversy is who will control the Senate after the November election. Democrats think they will retain it. Republicans think they may gain it.\If the GOP takes control of the Senate, they are sure to want to modify the six-year transportation proposal that won the approval of 10 Democrats and eight Republicans on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in May.\Some Republicans, particularly in the House, would like to de-couple funding for transit systems from the Highway Trust Fund, reserving the money road and bridge projects. They also object to about $820 million for alternative transportation projects, which include erosion-control landscaping and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.\""We are here with a questionable short-term fix because this Congress has refused to address its responsibility to fund our transportation infrastructure system, said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., who voted against the bill. ""Congress shouldn't duck its responsibilities, but should pass a six-year plan and its funding into law this year. Mark my words; next May we're just going to be back here again, debating the same issue, but deeper in the hole with a steeper climb out.\Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the public works committee, is strident in her insistence that a long-term bill be approved before Dec. 19, when Congress heads home for the Christmas recess.\Her leverage is an authorization bill. The current two-year authorization bill expires Sept. 30. If she refuses to permit extension of authorization to allow spending beyond Dec. 19, the May 31 funding allocation passed by the House may become moot.\While the White House endorsed the stop-gap measure approved by House, Obama said Tuesday, ""All this does is set us up for the same crisis a few months from now.\""So Congress shouldn't pat itself on the back for averting disaster for a few months, kicking the can down the road for a few months, careening from crisis to crisis when it comes to something as basic as our infrastructure, he said. ""Instead of barely paying our bills in the present, we should be investing in the future.\House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the president should pressure the Senate to pass a long-term bill.\""We'll take a look at it, Boehner said. ""But until then, giving speeches about a long-term highway bill is frankly just more rhetoric.\The Highway Trust Fund, the traditional source of funding for roads and transit projects, relies on the 18.4-cent per gallon federal gas tax, which was last raised in 1993. The tax has not been adjusted for inflation, and the fund has eroded steadily as vehicles have become more energy efficient.\Credit: ASHLEY HALSEY III and JULIET EILPERIN The Washington Post"
216,"Bloomberg View: Congress' endless gimmicks won't fix our highways\Congress's most recent fight over highway spending seemed awfully familiar. Once again, authorized cash for transportation projects was dwindling. Once again, no one could agree on a proper extension. And once again, Congress ended up passing a stopgap bill - the 34th in six years, in fact. By now, it should go without saying that this is no way to pay for public works. And many in Congress had promised that this time would be different. A long-term bill, they said, was sure to materialize. Yet paying for it proved as challenging as ever. The Senate hoped a witch's brew of budgeting gimmicks could be stirred up and transformed into cash. The House hoped more aggressive tax collection might do the trick.\What both approaches had in common was that they had nothing to do with highways. They thus negated the primary virtue of the Highway Trust Fund, which is that it's paid for by the very people who use the roads, via an excise tax on gas. And, for good measure, both approaches aimed to effectively cover operating expenses with a one-time cash infusion. It doesn't take an economist to spot the flaw in that.\Sadly, the substance of the Senate's long-term bill - the nuts and bolts of surface-transportation policy - was solid. It was bipartisan and requested only modestly higher spending. It would have improved freight shipment and alleviated congestion. And it sensibly boosted funding to fix battered bridges and interstates.\Now, optimists hope the two houses might still hash out a compromise once they reconvene, or that a separate plan - perhaps one corralling the proceeds of a one-time tax on corporate profits held abroad - can top up the trust fund when the stopgap expires.\There's a better way. That is to modestly increase the federal gas tax - which has been stuck at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993 - and index it to inflation. Then Congress should look for new ways to pay for highways, bearing in mind that Americans are driving less and cars are becoming more fuel-efficient. The goal should be to ensure that highway infrastructure is still largely paid for by drivers.\A federal tax on vehicle-miles traveled - an idea several states are considering - may be one path forward, once the technology is reliable and privacy safeguards are in place. Another might be to gradually wind down the trust fund and start taxing oil at refineries instead. Imposing more user fees on roads and bridges and expanding the use of public-private partnerships for construction projects would also help.\The main thing to avoid is yet more budget trickery - endless repetition of the same fiscal nonsense, while the underlying problems get worse. For a time, budgets can overlook some sleight of hand. Roads and bridges aren't so forgiving.\The Kansas City Star: Deliveries from the sky create earthly concerns\Amazon wants dedicated airspace for drones to deliver express packages to customers.\Facebook, which gave serious thought to launching its own $500 million satellite to provide Internet access to the developing world, instead may launch huge solar-powered drones with wingspans the size of a Boeing 737 to link the currently unconnected in remote areas.\Suddenly, it seems like the Internet is developing a serious footprint IRL - geek-speak for ""In Real Life.\Is this the future? Are we going to be ducking drones delivering the latest must-have gadget to the guy down the street willing to pay for Amazon Super Prime (or whatever they'll call the 30-minute delivery option)?\Will shadows from mammoth Facebook drones blot out the sun as they pass overhead on the way to make sure even the most remote shepherd can post a selfie with his dinner?\While it's unclear where the next online intrusion into the physical world might happen, it is clear that we need to be thinking about how to safely and securely integrate this developing technology into a world that heretofore has tried to keep the Internet safely confined to bits and bytes.\Amazon's proposal is to divvy up airspace access for drones based on the individual drone's mission and capabilities. Airspace under 200 feet would be only for low-speed, localized traffic. Airspace between 200 and 400 feet would be reserved for high-speed, autonomous drones with sophisticated sense-and-avoid technology. Drones in this lane would have to be able to communicate with one another and with automatic air control facilities.\All of this drone traffic would need to learn to co-exist with commercial, civilian and military traffic, and vice versa, especially in crowded urban areas. If Amazon is right, within 10 years there will be a lot more drone traffic than traditional air traffic.\The Federal Aviation Administration hasn't even begun to think at this scale, and that could prove to be a problem. The FAA's long-awaited proposal for commercial drone flight regulations doesn't even anticipate flights out of the pilot's line of sight - much less autonomous drones.\The government needs not just to catch up, but to get well ahead of the curve. Regulations need to anticipate where technology is heading, as well as how to mitigate risks that the private sector might not want to address - like what could happen if a hacker takes over a drone in a crowded traffic pattern over a dense urban area.\Government has not proven adept at such challenges, as the Internet has repeatedly proven. Regulations governing online activities - from banking to gambling to commerce to pornography - tend to lag way behind easy availability online.\Some would say that's a good thing and that it gave the Web time and space to grow and establish itself away from government interference. That may be well and good in the virtual world, but when technology has physical, real-world impacts, people cannot afford for the government to get caught flat-footed.\The future is coming, and it appears to be moving far faster than many, especially many in government, are prepared for.\The Dallas Morning News: Breaking a military glass ceiling\Army Ranger units are an especially closely-knit bunch. Every Ranger stands ready and able to protect their comrades and carry out extraordinarily difficult combat assignments under the most grueling conditions. Close doesn't count.\By the end of this month, two women could reshape the military's future as the first to complete Ranger School, which was open only to men until this year. The women, both West Point graduates, have met the same standards required of male applicants, including long hours of marches with heavy gear, sleeping in the field and other physical training. If they pass the final stages, they will have earned the right to be respected as full-fledged Rangers.\The Army Rangers is an exclusive club entered through hard work and personal achievement, and their success makes a strong statement about the ability of women to serve in the military's elite combat units. About 4,000 officers and enlisted soldiers start the humbling course each year, but only about 40 percent graduate. Those who don't make the cut aren't bad soldiers. To be a Ranger, however, is to be that extra special person who excels at tasks that humble all but the very best. If this is a glass ceiling, then these two women are poised to shatter it.\""First the naysayers said, They're not going be able to do this,' and then they did it, and then they said, They are not going be able do this part,' and they did it, says Col. David Fivecoat, commander of the Army's Airborne and Ranger training brigade.\Despite their accomplishments, it is not clear how these extraordinary women - as yet unidentified by the Army - will be allowed to practice their skills after graduation. Although the Pentagon ended the formal ban on women in combat roles in 2013, the Army and other services have until January to determine how far to include them in combat situations. Never mind that women currently pilot fighter planes, serve on ships in combat areas and perform intelligence gathering and other tasks.\We say these women should ascend as high and as far as their skills will take them. Not only are they achieving the physical requirements, male classmates have given the women strong marks for teammate and leadership skills, and praised them as soldiers they would want to be with in combat. Moreover, passing Ranger training is an unofficial door-opener for obtaining many infantry commands and for leading combat troops.\Many soldiers already accept women in uniform. These women should not be denied an opportunity to serve in combat missions in a Ranger unit.\New Orleans Advocate: Childhood obesity study examines physical activity\The notion that if you don't exercise, you get fat does not seem the basis for scientific study because the answer is obvious.\But looking under the headlines, a new study from LSU's Pennington Biomedical Research Center points out the dimensions of an issue that is important worldwide but incredibly so in Louisiana.\The insight gleaned from the study is that, while diet and exercise play major roles in health, ""physical activity makes an even bigger impact on children's weight than we previously thought, said Peter Katzmarzyk, an author of the study in the international journal Obesity. ""This study shows that obesity cannot be explained away by culture, class or status, and these research results reinforce the need for kids to engage in play time and other forms of physical activity each day.\The challenge of television and the gaming screen for American kids is one thing, but the giant study - international in scope and involving children in poorer and wealthier countries - showed that lack of exercise is a concern that crosses many lines of class, race or family situation. This research assessed associations between lifestyle behaviors and childhood obesity in a multinational setting, surveying both high- and low-income children.\Researchers collected data from more than 6,000 children between ages 9 and 11 from 12 countries, varying from Brazil to Kenya to the United Kingdom and United States. Previously, most of the data on obesity came from the wealthier countries.\What the text shows is, far beyond the obvious connection between lack of activity and weight, is that the temptations toward physical laziness in youth are univexrsal enough to give pause to those in public health who want to pin the problem on one behavior peculiar to, or one particular condition in, a rich or a poor society. Or, for that matter one particular solution like turning off the television.\The results ""reinforce the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles among children as an obesity prevention strategy across different cultures and environments. Easier said than done, as any parent of a pre-teen can tell you. But Katzmarzyk said it's also important to have the baseline data in this study to dispel notions that one factor - say, changing diet instead of exercising - can be a panacea for obesity.\What this study also illustrates, though, is how much Pennington's researchers take the lead in dealing with a crisis that not only has implications for Louisiana's children but those across the world. The Pennington study included researchers from major institutions from Helsinki, Finland, to Tianjin, China. This study helps document foundational knowledge about the breadth of growing children's bottoms, but also it reinforces the key role that Pennington has carved out in international scientific inquiry."

218,"WASHINGTON - Still bruised by the summer battle over the debt ceiling, Congress reconvenes this week for what could be an equally painful confrontation over how to put Americans back to work. \Lawmakers returning to Washington after a monthlong recess are in accord on at least one thing: Jobs policy must be at the top of the agenda. But there's scant hope they will put aside their differences long enough to come up with legislation that makes measurable improvements either to the unemployment rate or Congress' dismal approval rate.\Even the main attraction of the first week back, President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress outlining his jobs policy, had to be pushed back a day, until Thursday. Republicans balked at letting Obama pre-empt their party's presidential debate on the first day the House is in session.\When Obama does get to the House podium, he's likely to get a cool reception from the GOP side of the aisle. Republicans may go along with tax break proposals but won't be friendly to ideas to extend jobless benefits or spend money on new construction projects.\House Republicans have prepared an autumn jobs agenda that centers on repealing what they say are job-destroying environmental and labor regulations. The first bill, slated for the week of Sept. 12, would prevent the National Labor Relations Board from restricting where an employer can locate in the United States. It grows out of a complaint issued by the NLRB that Boeing Co. was punishing union workers with plans to transfer an assembly line from Washington state to South Carolina.\The anti-regulation bills are likely to hit a dead end in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But the threat of them prompted Obama last week to scrap tougher Environmental Protection Agency regulations on ozone, a key ingredient of smog that causes asthma and other lung illnesses.\While talking jobs, lawmakers will have one eye on the initial meetings of the supercommittee established under legislation enacted in early August to increase the federal debt ceiling. The bipartisan committee has until Nov. 23 to come up with at least $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts. If it fails to do so or if Congress fails to approve its recommendations by Christmas, automatic spending cuts covering both defense and domestic programs would be triggered starting in 2013.\More immediately, Congress must stop itself from actually causing unemployment. Obama, in his address, is expected to urge lawmakers to act swiftly to renew aviation and surface transportation programs and avoid shutdowns that he said could put 1 million jobs at risk.\The Federal Aviation Administration has been operating on short-term extensions since 2007 because the House and Senate can't agree on a comprehensive plan for the future. Earlier this year, the FAA had to shut down for two weeks, resulting in tens of thousands of construction worker layoffs and $400 million in uncollected airline ticket taxes. The agency will shut down again on Sept. 16 unless Congress acts.\Similarly, the law that authorizes federal spending for highway and mass transit programs expires on Sept. 30. A stalemate there could disrupt collection of the 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal gas tax and have a far more devastating effect on construction jobs.\House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., said at the end of August that he would agree to one more short-term extension, the eighth, as he negotiates with the Senate on a long-term bill. Mica has proposed a six-year, $230 billion bill financed entirely by gasoline and diesel taxes. The Senate is calling for a two-year, $109 billion bill that would rely on $12 billion appropriated by Congress in addition to the fuel tax revenues.\Not all is negative on the congressional job front.\On its first day back Tuesday, the Senate will vote to move forward on the most extensive revamping of the patent system in six decades. Senate passage of the measure, already approved by the House, would send it to Obama, who agrees with most members of Congress that the legislation will make it easier for inventors to get their products to market and thus encourage hiring.\There's also some optimism that Congress will soon sign off on free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that have been in limbo since the George W. Bush administration.\Before the August break, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said they had agreed on a path forward for renewing a program that helps workers affected by foreign competition and passing the trade bills, and House Speaker John Boehner also promised a vote on the worker aid bill which Obama says must be linked to the trade agreements.\The administration and supporters of the trade bills say they will generate tens of thousands of jobs. Some labor unions and other skeptics of free trade dispute that conclusion.\Also looming is the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, when Congress is supposed to have completed the 12 appropriation bills to fund federal agencies for the coming fiscal year 2012. So far the House has passed only half of those bills, and the Senate only one, and as in past years they will have to agree on temporary stopgap extensions to avoid a partial government shutdown.\Things are a little easier this year because the debt and budget pact sets the overall total for the 12 bills at $1.043 trillion, a $7 billion cut from current levels. Still, there will be heated debate as Democrats seek to restore cuts planned by Republicans to education, environment, foreign aid and other programs.\One such debate will be over funding the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has less than $800 million in its disaster fund as it faces the Hurricane Irene recovery operation. Democrats say emergency spending on natural disasters has never required repayment, but Republicans say that in this new age of austerity, disaster aid must be paid for with cuts to other federal spending.\Credit: JIM ABRAMS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"
219,"PARIS - The rumble of armored police trucks and the hiss of tear gas filled central Paris on Saturday, as French riot police fought to contain thousands of yellow-vested protesters venting their anger against the government in a movement that has grown more violent by the week.\A ring of steel surrounded the president's Elysee Palace - a key destination for the protesters - as police stationed trucks and reinforced metal barriers throughout the neighborhood.\Saturday's yellow vest crowd was overwhelmingly male, a mix of those bringing their financial grievances to Paris - the center of France's government, economy and culture - along with groups of apparently experienced vandals, who tore steadily through some of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods, smashing and burning.\Police and protesters also clashed in the southern French cities of Marseille and Toulouse.\The government's plan was to prevent a repeat of the Dec. 2 rioting that damaged the Arc de Triomphe, injured 130 people and tarnished the country's global image. But although Saturday's protest in the French capital started out quietly, by late afternoon at least 551 people had been taken into custody and 60 people had been injured, according to Paris police and hospitals.\Some stores along the city's elegant Champs-Elysees Avenue had boarded up their windows as though bracing for a hurricane, but the storm struck anyway, this time at the height of the holiday shopping season. Protesters ripped off the plywood protecting the windows and threw flares and other projectiles as they were repeatedly repelled by tear gas and water cannon.\All of the city's top tourist attractions - including the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre museum - shut down for the day, fearing the kind of damage that had hit the Arc de Triomphe. Subway stations in the city center also closed and the U.S. embassy warned its citizens to avoid all protest areas.\Yet in a sign of the financial disconnect that infuriates many of the protesters, within a block of the famed boulevard, people were sitting in Paris cafes, drinking cocktails and chatting.\Amid the melee, President Emmanuel Macron remained invisible and silent, as he has for the four weeks of a movement that started as a protest against a gas tax hike and metamorphosed into a rebellion against high taxes, eroding living standards and what many see as his inability to address the concerns of France's regions and ordinary people.\Before the clashes, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner had urged calm.\""I ask the yellow vests that want to bring about a peaceful message to not go with the hooligans. We know that the hooligans are only strong because they hide behind the yellow vests, which hampers the security forces, he said.\Even as blue armored trucks rumbled over cobblestone streets and police moved yet again against protesters on the Champs-Elysees, an even larger environmental march moved peacefully Saturday toward the city's distant Republique Plaza.\A scattering of yellow vests, as well as women, children and retirees, were among the 17,000 participants marching to demand action against climate change. One sign read ""No climate justice without fiscal and social justice. The march came in support of U.N. climate talks taking place in Poland.\National police estimated the number of protesters in Paris at 8,000, although the yellow vests said their numbers were far higher and Associated Press reporters saw city streets densely crowded with thousands of people. French authorities deployed 8,000 security officers in the capital alone, among the 89,000 who fanned out around the country\France's yellow vest protesters include people with views that range from the far right to the far left. The leaderless group is united primarily in its sense that Macron and his government are out of touch.\""We are here to tell [Macron]our discontent. Me, I'm not here to break things because I have four children so I am going to try to be safe for them, because they are afraid, said protester Myriam Diaz. ""But I still want to be here to say Stop, that's enough, this has to stop.' \Macron on Wednesday agreed to abandon the fuel tax hike, which aimed to wean France off fossil fuels and uphold the Paris climate agreement. Many economists and scientists say higher fuel taxes are essential to saving the planet from worsening climate change, but that approach hasn't defused the popular anger.\The renewed violence in Paris gave the impression of a government that is powerless against the uprising.\Protesters who came to Paris from Normandy described seeing officers block yellow-vested passengers from boarding public transportation at stops along their route. The national gendarme service posted a video on Twitter of police tackling a protester and confiscating his dangerous material, which appeared to be primarily a tennis racket.\Four people have died in accidents since the unrest began Nov. 17 and Christmas markets, national soccer matches and countless cultural events have been canceled due to the protests.\Protesters also blocked roads, roundabouts and tollbooths elsewhere in France and offshoot movements have emerged in Belgium and the Netherlands.\Belgian police fired tear gas and water cannon Saturday at yellow-vested protesters calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Charles Michel after they tried to breach a riot barricade. The protesters in Brussels threw paving stones, road signs, fireworks, flares and other objects at police and about 100 were detained, many for carrying dangerous objects.\According the ocean, U.S. President Donald Trump seized the moment to criticize the 2015 Paris climate accord, which he is pulling the United States out of, in a series of tweets Saturday.\""People do not want to pay large sums of money ... in order to maybe protect the environment, he tweeted.\---\Angela Charlton, Lori Hinnant, Srdjan Nedeljkovic, Philippe Marion and Milos Krivokapic in Paris contributed.\Credit: Elaine Ganley and John Leicester The Associated Press"

221," In a pinch\ * Fewer dollars: The government trust fund that pays to build and repair highways and bridges is facing a looming shortage of cash. * One source: The fund gets its money mainly from the 18.4 cents-a- gallon excise tax that drivers pay at the pump. The tax has not risen in 14 years and Congress is reluctant to increase it.\ * Cash crunch: States are already looking to toll road and consumption-based sales taxes for road-building money as they worry about how they will expand their highways and fill their potholes.\ WASHINGTON - A cash crunch is fast approaching for the government trust fund that pays to build and repair highways and bridges.\ The federal tax on a gallon of gas has not risen in 14 years and Congress is reluctant to increase it. People are demanding more fuel- efficient vehicles - less gasoline used, fewer dollars for the fund.\ States already are looking for other places for road-building money - toll road and consumption-based sales taxes, for example. They worry that the fund's looming shortage could hurt their efforts to address traffic congestion as well as environmental and safety problems caused by inadequate roads.\ The situation can only get worse in 2009, when revenues for the Federal Highway Trust Fund begin falling short of planned federal spending.\ The fund provides the overwhelming bulk of federal dollars spent on highways. It gets its money mainly from the 18.4 cents-a-gallon excise tax that drivers pay at the pump.\ Self-service regular now tops $3 a gallon. There is concern the price will reach a level at which people will get serious about cutting back on driving - sending less money into the fund. Fuel tax receipts did dip last summer when there was a spike in pump prices.\ About 45 percent of all highway spending comes from the trust fund. With less money available from the fund, states must turn elsewhere for money to expand their highways and fill their potholes. That prospect is making lots of people unhappy.\ * Indiana, facing a $1.8 billion gap in money needed for road improvements, negotiated a $3.85 billion deal with an Australian- Spanish consortium to lease and operate the Indiana Turnpike for 75 years. Voters expressed their displeasure, electing Democrats to replace a Republican-run House that signed off on the deal.\ * In Florida, with federal aid declining, more than 90 percent of new roads since the early 1990s have been toll roads, state Transportation Department spokesman Dick Kane said.\ * Voters in Washington state approved a 14.5-cent increase in state gasoline taxes over a five-year period.\ * In California, voters decided to borrow the money, approving bond issues totaling $19.9 billion to be used for highway and transit projects over the next 10 years.\ * Georgia increased its construction program from $911 million to $2 billion, largely through a sales tax on gasoline that rises with fuel prices, unlike the frozen federal levy.\ The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials says at least six states have adopted variable fuel taxes that are pegged to inflation.\ * Oregon is experimenting with a voluntary system in which drivers pay a user fee based on miles driven rather than gas consumed. Some environmentalists say this approach negates the benefits of buying fuel-efficient cars.\ * Texas, Virginia and Minnesota are among states that have built or are building high-occupancy toll lanes where drivers can pay to have a congestion-free path before them.\ With the population of Texas increasing by 1,000 people a day, ""we as a state don't really feel like we have an option to shelve projects or sit on our hands as the problems with the highway trust fund loom larger and come closer on the horizon,"" said Christopher Lippincott, a Texas Transportation Department spokesman.\ Revenues from tolls, bonds, federal loans and local contributions allowed most of a new turnpike around Austin to be completed more than 20 years sooner than if the state had relied solely on state and federal taxes.\ The Texas Legislature is trying to satisfy concerns of Gov. Rick Perry over a bill that includes a two-year freeze on most new privately financed toll roads. The freeze reflects opposition to the Trans Texas Corridor, a combined toll road and rail system from Mexico to the Oklahoma line.\ Of the 18.4 cents a gallon in federal excise taxes, about 15.44 cents goes to the highway trust fund, 2.86 cents to mass transit programs and one-tenth of a center to a leaking underground storage tank fund. The tax on diesel fuel is slightly higher.\ Close to two-thirds of the trust fund's $40 billion in receipts last year came from the gasoline tax.\ Gasoline was only 30 cents a gallon and the excise tax on it was just 3 cents in 1956 when Congress created the highway trust fund. As gasoline prices rose, so did the tax. But a tax-adverse Congress has kept it at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, when gasoline prices were about $1.10 a gallon.\ Two years ago, lawmakers proposed a 4-cent-per gallon boost in the fuel tax to finance a $375 billion highway bill. They backed off when President Bush pledged to veto any road legislation with a tax increase. In the end, the spending plan came to $286 billion.\ At the end of 2000, the highway trust fund had a balance of almost $23 billion. By the end of 2006, that balance had fallen to $9 billion.\ The Congressional Budget Office predicts the fund will run a deficit of $1.7 billion at the end of 2009 and $8.1 billion by the end of 2010, when the current highway program expires and Congress will write a new one.\ ""This crisis will be thrown in their lap right as they are rewriting the program,"" said Jeff Shoaf, senior executive director of Associated General Contractors of America.\ Because investment in new projects is spread over a number of years, every dollar of shortfall translates into a $4 drop in highway spending, he said.\ Thus in 2010, the government will have only $20 billion to invest on highways, half the current spending level and less than one- third of the $70 billion that Shoaf said is needed for real road improvements.\ ""A drastic cut in federal highway and transit funding will result unless Congress steps in,"" John Horsley, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, said in a report.\ Horsley's group said the fuel tax would have to be increased by 10 cents per gallon through 2015 to restore the purchasing power of the program.\ The Senate Finance Committee is looking into temporary ways to refinance the trust fund, including redirecting some transportation- related taxes that now go into the government's general account and clamping down on gas tax fraud. A Transportation Department commission also plans to issue recommendations by the end of this year.\ By the middle of the next decade, the highway trust fund will be providing $100 billion to $150 billion below real needs for building highways and bridges, predicted Rep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on highways and transit.\ ""In the long run we've either got to admit we are going to underinvest and accept more gridlock and congestion"" or find new revenue sources, said DeFazio, D-Ore.\ What is clear to him is that raising taxes of any kind for the highway trust fund is possible only if people are convinced that more spending will mean less congestion, safer roads and a cleaner environment.\ The public will not support new taxes ""just to throw money in the maw of the federal government,"" DeFazio said.\ On the Net:\ Federal Highway Administration: www.fhwa.dot.gov/\ American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials: www.transportation.org/\ American Road and Transportation Builders Association: www.artba.org/\ Associated General Contractors of America: www.agc.org/\ Credit: The Associated Press"
222,"cthomas@cnpapers.com 304-348-1232\As the nation's economy continues toward recovery, a survey of West Virginia's construction companies, conducted by the 475-member Contractors Association of West Virginia, shows that most feel job opportunities will remain at essentially the same level from last year into 2013. \In 2012, contractors who depend on public work were able to provide a degree of stability for their employees, partially through CAWV efforts to create consistent funding streams.\Mike Clowser, executive director of the CAWV, has stated that the number of construction projects paid for by the private sector has remained flat and is projected to remain that way for the foreseeable future.\With less federal and state funding for highways, Clowser said, fewer roads and bridges will be repaired this year and fewer new ones will be constructed. Declining gas tax receipts and Congressional foot-dragging on passing a highway bill have also hampered highway construction projects.\The West Virginia Division of Highways' 2013 planned construction program is estimated at $430 million, which will be influenced by federal and state funding levels. Under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century legislation, federal aid funding is provided to West Virginia for only the next two years (through mid-September 2014).\The West Virginia Parkways Authority will continue a major highway and bridge rehabilitation project begun four years ago. The project is funded largely through turnpike toll increases implemented in 2009. Two major projects will be advertised for pavement rehabilitation this year: paving of the West Virginia Turnpike between Mahan and Standard and mill and inlay work at high-priority areas along the complete turnpike.\Other Parkways Authority projects for 2013 include: bridge painting, bridge overlays, bridge and facilities retrofit, guardrail replacement, culvert repair or replacement, sign replacement, overlays, pavement striping and markings and more. In all, according to the CAWV forecast, the Parkways Authority will award nearly $30 million in contracts for major highway, bridge and facilities construction and upgrade projects. An additional $2.7 million in contracts will be awarded for bridge retrofit and pavement striping.\The Public Port Authority is continuing an approximately $28 million project in 2013, the construction of the Heartland Intermodal Gateway facility in Wayne County. Awarded to Kingwood-based Mountaineer Contractors Inc., the project is expected to be completed by the middle of 2014.\The CAWV has reported that the West Virginia Aeronautics Commission is overseeing infrastructure projects of more than $18 million in 2013. These projects include work at 18 airports throughout the Mountain State. (Yeager Airport is slated to receive nearly $7 million to remove obstructions at the Charleston facility.) Ninety percent of funds are provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, with the state supplying the final 10 percent in matching funds.\The State Rail Authority will oversee approximately $4 million in construction projects in 2013. These include work on the South Branch Valley Railroad and the West Virginia Central Railroad.\West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection Abandoned Mine Land Program funding is expected to be at the same level as 2012, via annual grants the program receives. According to the CAWV and the DEP, the total estimated money available for non-water reclamation, emergency reclamation and water line extension project construction from the 2013 grant is $44 million.\Water, sewer and school construction projects will stall or be neglected without government funding, Clowser noted late last year. However, he said, state Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council and Water Development Authority funds, as well as local fees, are available for some projects.\Military spending, which was a benefit to many state contractors last year, is expected to lessen. Mandated spending cuts are expected to reduce the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety's projects for bid. Some projects may be scrapped entirely.\Also forecast to submit fewer bidding projects are the Higher Education Policy Commission, the School Building Authority and the Department of Administration. According to the CAWV and the SBA, the SBA's 2013 bidding forecast totals more than $105 million (estimated cost) for upgrades or new school construction in Tyler, Preston, Pleasants, Mercer, Taylor, Pocahontas, Lewis, Gilmer, Logan, Wyoming and Hardy counties.\The state Department of Administration's 2013 construction forecast exceeds an estimated $51 million in projects, including roof replacement and electrical feed replacement for the Capitol building and other projects in Parsons, Welch, Moorefield, Point Pleasant, Summersville, Fairmont and Clarksburg.\According to the CAWV, the Higher Education Policy Commission anticipates more than $140 million in construction at state colleges and universities this year. The largest project is the $70 million Agricultural Sciences Building at West Virginia University, expected to get underway next month in Morgantown. Several other construction projects are planned at WVU this year.\The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources will reportedly launch construction bids for projects at Blackwater Falls State Park, Cacapon Resort State Park and Canaan Valley Resort State Park this year.\Encouraging projections from the CAWV include larger projects from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund ($148 million) and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund ($42 million). The CAWV also expects larger bidding projects, compared to recent years, from the Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council and the USDA Rural Utilities Service.\In its 2013 Construction Forecast issued in November, the CAWV said that private construction in West Virginia appears to be on the upswing. ""New restaurants are opening, hospitals and churches are renovating and building new and the energy sector is ramping up,"" the forecast reported.\""Jobs Count,"" the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy's monthly newsletter, reported that construction jobs fell by 1,200 in November. That was a 3.4 percent job loss, the construction industry's worst in more than three years, according to the newsletter.\Last October, Clowser wrote an article for the ""2012 Economic Outlook,"" published by the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research. In it, he said, ""While the recession officially ended in June 2009, the construction industry has continued to suffer from job losses and ever-tighter margins. West Virginia's construction employment increased from 33,300 in August 2011 to 36,200 jobs in August 2012. Until this year's boost in construction jobs, West Virginia's construction employment had dropped 19 percent during the three prior years.""\Clowser attributed a number of last year's new construction jobs to the Marcellus shale industry and related power and energy industries.\""West Virginia contractors are seeing a good market in the oil and gas industry that was not there a few years ago,"" he wrote.\""Federal investment policies are causing considerable uncertainty for construction firms,"" Clowser continued. ""This is due to Congress' inability to pass long-term investment legislation addressing the nation's aging inventory of water, road and aviation systems. Plus, State Highway Trust Fund revenues continue to stagnate, which is leading West Virginia's transportation system into a crisis situation, and, without action, the state's roads and bridges will continue to deteriorate.""\The CAWV executive director expressed a sense of guarded optimism about long-term renewal for construction industry growth, however.\""While many expect slow or sub-par growth ... in the construction industry, there is growing consensus that reviving demand for construction, particularly private sector construction activity, is essential to sustaining broader economic growth. That is because construction builds a more globally competitive economy, there is a direct connection between construction activity and employment levels, construction improves our environment by cutting waste and pollution by building and infrastructure efficiency, and a growing realization that investing in efficient water and sewage treatment facilities, good schools and a modern and safe transportation system improves our quality of life,"" he said.\""Congress, as well as West Virginia lawmakers, will realize that it will cost more to repair the nation's and the state's infrastructure rather than just maintaining it. This will lead to future funding of roads, bridges, schools, water and sewer systems and airports. This will boost the economy and will immediately improve employment levels. It will also lead to an increase in domestic demand for manufactured goods, shipping services and construction supplies and materials. And it will bring new vitality to many of our hardest-hit communities.\""One thing is very clear when we debate future funding for the nation's and West Virginia's infrastructure. We must either solve the problem or accept the consequences.""\BBL Carlton, LLC, of Charleston constructed the Kanawha Valley Community & Technical College Headquarters Facility in the West Virginia Regional Technology Park in South Charleston last year.

Brown\ 1072 Arbuckle Road, Summersville, WV 26651\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: B.A., South Dakota State University; Pre-Theology Certification, St. Mary's College, Winona MN; 3 years retail sales and management; 11 years insurance sales and claims; 5 years small business owner.\ League\ With the return to deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal budget?\ My priority is reflected in my platform, which is morality as it relates to law. If our current governmental spending is about to bankrupt our children's future for generations to come, then it is clearly immoral and must be addressed.\ What improvements, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ I believe the moral question to ask is - are the intended beneficiaries of this program getting what we, the taxpayer, are paying for? Few people I know can say with any confidence that they even understand this program and, more importantly, that it has benefited them.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ Yes, but only when a stable government is in place. It would be a grossly immoral act to pull out at this time. There would be immediate civil war followed by unimaginable suffering of any pro- government supporter left behind if we pull out prematurely.\ How would you extend health care coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ The short answer is, ""I honestly don't know."" My best answer is, ""to do what is just and moral."" There is simply no ""quick fix"" solution to this issue and we must address all sides of the problem, not just the politically correct ones.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ As in question 2 for the Gazette, I would do what is moral and just. Without looking into this matter in depth and seeking wise counsel, all I would be offering is an uneducated opinion.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investment of part of the money they pay into Social Security?\ I believe that is entirely moral to teach our children the wise necessity of saving for their future. Since they would not be able to withdraw the money for frivolous purchases, it would allow for multitudes of young Americans to see the compounding interest of long-term savings and investment.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ John R. Raese\ P.O. Box 872, Morgantown, WV 26507\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: West Virginia University with a degree in education; CEO of Greer Industries Inc.\ League\ With the return to deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal budget?\ I will push for a rollback of excessive regulations that have stifled job growth and economic opportunity in West Virginia. I'll push as well for the line-item veto and eliminate wasteful spending so West Virginia taxpayers aren't paying for bridges to nowhere in Alaska. I'll also push to make the Bush tax cuts permanent as they've helped stimulate the national economy, and so there won't be any tax increase on working families.\ What improvements, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ I have had some reservations about what is, essentially, a new government entitlement program (and you did note in your first question how we're already in deficit spending). As more seniors learn about the new drug benefit they will be able to use it - there is a learning curve somewhat and people have told me it's a bit confusing. Perhaps we could make it more understandable, but as a general principle I'm skeptical about growing government even bigger than it already is.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ I believe we should keep our troops in Iraq instead of cutting and running. We have good reasons to be in Iraq and we should stay there and finish the job, making sure our troops have everything they need to do so. We are better off fighting terrorists in Iraq than waiting for them to attack us again here. Cutting and running will be perceived as weakness by the terrorists and weakness leaves us vulnerable to attack. The President was very clear when we began striking back at the terrorists who attacked and killed thousands of our innocent citizens - he said this war would be difficult, it would be long, and it would require sacrifice. But he also said victory in the end would leave our country, and the world, more safe and secure and I agree with President Bush on this.\ How would you extend health care coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ The free-market approach to ensuring that Americans have affordable health coverage is the best way to reach that goal. Big government socialized medicine doesn't work and the American people have rejected it out of hand. What is working? For starters, Health Savings Accounts are where the market is trending as more and more insurance companies are coming out with HSA products. The number of people insured with HSAs has tripled in the last year. What would also work? We should look at tax credits for health insurance. This could be a win-win for working families who currently aren't insured. They would get a needed tax break and meet an important family need at the same time. There are already bills working their way through Congress on this.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ Yes, absolutely. HSAs are where the health insurance market is trending. HSAs allow people maximum choice and control over their health care while saving - tax free - for long term care.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investment of part of the money the pay into Social Security?\ Yes, absolutely. Any Social Security reform should first protect benefits for those who are retired and those about to retire. The reform should also modernize the system and allow younger workers to invest their retirement savings as they see fit so they don't get caught short when they retire. As trends stand now, young workers today will not have enough money from Social Security when they retire and provisions should be made for them now.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No response\ Rick Snuffer\ Prosperity, WV 25909-0757\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Beckley College - attended; Word of Faith Leadership Bible Institute - graduated; WESco Homes Inc. - laborer, painter, carpenter, head carpenter, bookkeeper, blueprint drawing, Vice President, Master Electricity Construction Supervisor; Metropolitan Insurance - numerous training; Combined Insurance Company of America; interim pastor; local pastor United Methodist Church - various training; radio host, producer.\ League\ With the return to deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal budget?\ Balanced Budget Amendment; Line Item Veto amendment.\ What improvements, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ Too early to tell. Must make sure the recipients (eligible to participate) retain the option to remain under current program for at least 2 more years.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ Not yet.\ How would you extend health care coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ In 2004, we offered the skeleton of 2 programs which would utilize our med schools and teaching hospitals to provide quality health care to the uninsured Americans.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ Yes.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investment of part of the money they pay into Social Security?\ Not until the trust fund is restored and fully funded. The Social Security Restoration Act of 2007 we have proposed would do this.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Hiram Lewis\ 416 Holland Ave, Morgantown WV\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Weir High School; West Virginia University (B.S.B.A. Finance, 1994); West Virginia University (B.S.B.A. Accounting, 2001); West Virginia University (J.D. Law, 2001); Iraq war veteran; Captain, JAG Officer, West Virginia Army National Guard; Member, Chemical, Nuclear, Biological Enhanced Response Force Package; attorney, private practice; Senate Counsel, 2002; Republican Nominee for Attorney General, 2004; bookkeeper, MCNB Banks; H.C. Lewis Oil Company, manual labor.\ League\ With the return to deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal year?\ I am fiscally conservative. I believe in lowering taxes and cutting spending. We should not continue to pass our financial problems on to our children and grandchildren. I would prioritize spending in two areas: 1) Job Creation/Economic Growth and 2.) Homeland Security and National Defnse.\ What improvements, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ Our Medicare system is plagued with fraud and abuse. In many cases, care is not being delivered to the ones that need it most. The new drug coverage is a good start, but it needs to be simplified. I will work to streamline Medicare and stop fraud and abuse.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ Absolutely not. The region is too important to the security interests of our nation to cut and run. We need to continue to fight the terrorists abroad rather than here at home.\ How would you extend health coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ The best way to assure that high quality healthcare is available to all is to lower taxes to improve the economy so that the private sector can expand and create high-quality jobs with high-quality benefits. We must continue to honor our veterans with high-quality healthcare.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ Yes. Healthcare Savings Accounts are an invaluable tool to manage healthcare costs. I would support enhancing and expanding Healthcare Savings Accounts.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investment of part of the money they pay into Social Security?\ Yes. I believe the majority of younger kids would prefer to control the investment of their own Social Security funds. We need to honor our promises to current recipients while working to maintain the solvency of the program into the future.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Zane Lawhorn\ 212 Old Bluefield Road, Princeton, WV 24740\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Union High School 1976; West Virginia University B.A. 1980; Southern College of Optometry Doctor of Optometry 1985; Optometrist 1985-present, self employed; President & CEO, #1 Domain Names International Inc. 1999-2005.\ League\ With the return to deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal budget?\ My priority is to stop deficit spending immediately. I will not support budgets that will continue raising the debt. I feel very strongly that America should not have deficit spending or a national debt, but instead should have a strong balance sheet with reserves to allow for emergency spending.\ What improvements, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ I would close the loopholes, restrict the plan to the neediest, prevent corporations from taking advantage of the plan and restrict the plan to providers that meet discounted pricing guidelines. Most importantly, I would listen to the people and work for improvement that resolves their problem with the plan.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ Have we forgotten? United we stand, divided we fall. Do we not think our enemies are watching? Shall we withdraw our troops and let the murder of innocent people continue? Are we not the defenders of freedom and liberty? It's time to unite behind our troops and their commander. No.\ How would you extend health care coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ By eliminating malpractice litigation. This benefits only a few at the expense of everyone. Litigation is the single most important 'fixable' solution. I have a plan that allows for lower priced health care to individuals who do not smoke, receive preventative health care and agree not to litigate.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ Yes. Expanding and making it easier to join. I support allowing for higher contributions. I also would like to see more people able to begin a HSA for future use or with lower deductibles. Individuals should be encouraged to plan ahead for their future and their children's future.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investment of part of the money they pay into Social Security?\ No. The average young American is not skilled enough to invest. They would do just as bad a job as the government now does. Instead, I do believe young Americans should have a 'say' in their investment. Young Americans should become more involved in their future benefits including Social Security.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Mike Callaghan\ 1591 Nottingham Road, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: 1985 graduate of the University of Virginia; 1990 graduate of West Virginia University College of Law. Served as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the southern district of West Virginia: head of the criminal division as the Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection and Chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party; currently an attorney with Tinney Law Firm.\ League\ With the return to deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal budget?\ Wars are costly, regardless of the withdrawal timeline. We must provide the necessary resources for national security. We must also prioritize our issues at home, like health care. We must have a fair tax system, not one skewed against working families and for the wealthiest 1% in this country.\ What improvements, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ The goal should have been to provide access to affordable drugs for our senior citizens. Congress sold out to the pharmaceutical industry. If we can't start over, we surely must change the law so that we can negotiate discounts for medicine. Our seniors deserve a system that is not as complicated or difficult to access.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ Yes, in an orderly fashion. I will never take a backseat to the Republicans when it comes to defending this country. However, the first step towards withdraw is for the President to fire Donald Rumsfield. Our top priority should be creating and executing a solid plan of action to bring our families home.\ How would you extend health care coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ This country is in a health care crisis, and solving it is my top priority. Solutions can only come by having all parties work together: nurses, doctors, family providers, hospitals, nursing homes, pharmacists, etc. We must consider ideas like single payer and universal health care so that every man, woman and child has access to quality care.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ These accounts are useful as a supplement to providing health insurance. They are more useful for people who do not have significant health care expenses, and they are a straightforward way for consumers to make contributions to the cost of providing health care.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investment of part of the money they pay into social security?\ No.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Mark Hunt\ 901 Edgewood Drive, Charleston, WV 25202\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Graduated from Stonewall Jackson High School in 1978; he earned a B.A. in political science from the University of Charleston in 1982; in 1984, he received a M.A. degree in public administration from Marshall University; in 1993, he completed his J.D. at the University of the District of Columbia. Mark worked for the Office of Legislative Services of the WV Legislature from 1984 to 1990; presently, Mark Hunt serves as President of Hunt & Serreno Enterprises Inc. In 1993, he became Counsel to the State Auditor. Currently he is a partner at the law firm of Hunt and Serreno.\ League\ With the return of deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal budget?\ The number one priority of the Federal Government must be to balance the budget. Our country cannot continue to raise our deficit into the high trillions, while at the same time providing tax cuts to our richest citizens. There is nothing wrong with tax relief, but we should focus our efforts on providing tax relief to working class Americans and working towards balancing our budget. Our children should not be left with huge debts to pay in the future because of today's mistakes.\ What improvement, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ We need to extend the sign-up period that will end May 15th. If we extend the registration period by six months, we can spend more time explaining the benefits and consequences to our senior citizens and allow more time for them to sign up for the program. Additionally, we must eliminate the Bush Administration's prescription drug tax that is imposed to any senior who does not sign-up according to their timeline.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ While it was wrong for the United States to go to war with Iraq, I believe that it is now our responsibility to ensure that we stay in Iraq until we can stabilize their new government. It would be irresponsible to simply withdraw our troops while the Iraqi people are living in a period of instability and turmoil.\ How would you extend health care to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ In order to ensure that we can extend health care coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans, state and the federal government must work together. The federal government should provide the basic financing and give states the flexibility and responsibility to lower the number of uninsured and improve health outcomes. We should work toward creating refundable tax credits for individual and job- based health insurance, voluntary purchasing groups, performance- based state grants, and individual responsibility for securing coverage.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ I do not support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts because these accounts will result in costing consumers more money and provide less health care. Health Savings Accounts require high out-of-pocket expenses, as well as encourage employers to abandon health benefits. Also, Health Savings Accounts discourage the creation and use of preventive care plans and facilities.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investments to part of the money they pay into Social Security?\ I do not support the privatization of social security in any fashion. Privatizing social security does not give an individual control over their private account. It will slash guaranteed benefits and leave our children with trillions of dollars of debt.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Richie Robb\ 1707 Massey Circle, South Charleston, WV 25303\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: BA from Marshall University, JD from Capital University Law School. Mayor of South Charleston from 1975 to present; practicing attorney; awarded Bronze Star in Vietnam.\ League\ With the return to deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal budget?\ To end the record deficit spending of the Bush administration I support eliminating the previous tax cuts for the wealthy and granting tax breaks to the middle classes in order to spur consumer spending.\ What improvements, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ I believe Medicare's new drug coverage is too confusing, unfair for seniors and a financial windfall for the pharmaceutical industry. For all health care I propose a single-payor, universal health care system accessible to all Americans.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ The U.S. should withdraw from Iraq immediately and solicit the rest of the World to report order there. The U.S. cannot shoulder the burden of fighting terrorism alone. The Bush administration duped the American people into this misadventure following the trauma of 9-11. We are only creating more terrorists there. It is their country.\ How would you extend health care coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ I would extend health coverage to the uninsured by adopting a single-payor universal medical system accessible to all Americans. This system would also include a strong preventive health care quotient.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ I believe American's first priority should be the adoption of a single-payor, universal health care system accessible to all Americans. If people wish to supplement that basic medical care, I would support health savings accounts to allow them to do so.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investment of part of the money they pay into Social Security?\ First, I support the retention of Social Security as it exists. If persons wish to supplement that system with more private investments I would be supportive.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Shelley Moore Capito\ 2 Comstock Place, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Duke University, B.S.; University of Virginia, M.Ed.; Career counselor at West Virginia State College; Director of the Educational Information Center for the WV Board of Regents, WV House of Delegates, 1996-2000, U.S. House of Representatives, 2001-present.\ League\ With the return to deficit spending, what are your priorities for the next fiscal budget?\ Washington needs to be a better caretaker of the taxpayers' money. When times are tough, we need to fund our priorities and cut waste, fraud and abuse from non-essential programs. West Virginian families have to make difficult choices when their budget is tight, and Washington shouldn't be any different.\ What improvements, if any, do you believe should be made to Medicare's new drug coverage?\ Medicare's new prescription drug benefit isn't perfect, but neither was Medicare when it was created in 1966. The benefit has growing pains, but I believe we are making progress and I remain committed to making this benefit work for West Virginia's seniors.\ Gazette\ Should the U.S. withdraw from Iraq?\ I believe that immediate withdrawal of our troops from Iraq would create an incredible amount of instability in the region that would make our country and Iraq less secure. I share the anxiety and heartache that many feel, and look forward to bringing our troops home as soon as the Iraqis are ready to stand-alone.\ How would you extend health-care coverage to 43 million uninsured Americans?\ We need to empower consumers by giving them more choice and portability, and we need to let doctors and patients make decisions, not insurance companies and personal injury lawyers. To start we should expand Health Savings Accounts and continue to crack down on frivolous lawsuits that are making healthcare more expensive.\ Daily Mail\ Do you support legislation expanding Health Savings Accounts?\ Yes. Health Savings Accounts are a great way to give consumers more portability and control over their healthcare decisions while saving tax-free money for healthcare costs and their retirement.\ Would you allow young Americans to control investment of part of the money they pay into Social Security?\ I have consistently opposed privatizing Social Security, but believe we need to continue to help young and lower-wage workers save for retirement. The Savers Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, and creation of the 10 percent tax bracket are examples of good policy I've supported.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Erik Wells\ 849 Maple Road, Charleston, WV 25302\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: B.S. Political Science; M.A. Corporate and Organizational Communication; Lieutenant, US Navy Reserves; married to Natalie Tennant, one daughter; I spent more than a decade as a broadcast journalist at WCHS-TV, WBOY-TV and WDTV. I'm co- owner of Wells Media Group LLC, a Charleston based small business specializing in public relations.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I support legislation that would improve the energy efficiency of products and appliances along with greater investment in solar and wind power. Providing greater weatherization programs to our senior citizens will allow them to better insulate their homes and reduce their energy bills.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ We all agree that reducing the number of abortions is most important. However, returning to the days when women died undergoing back alley abortions is not the way to reduce abortions. We need greater education and services to promote adoption. We should not restrict a woman's right to choose.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Health care should not be a privilege but a right of citizenship in our country. The rising costs are hurting our families and businesses. I would expand Medicaid for the very poor and look at every avenue available from a single payer system to expanding existing programs.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Enhanced penalties for certain crimes send a message to the community that it is not okay to victimize people simply because they are different from us. It's considered a hate crime to attack someone because of their political affiliation, but not their sexual orientation. We should extend it to gays.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I would first cut the business franchise/corporate net income tax to stimulate business development. Secondly, I would increase the homestead exemption for our senior citizens. Finally, I support reducing the food tax as long as we do it in a responsible manner that doesn't harm our budget.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ If we want quality teachers educating our children, we need to compensate them. I favor increasing teacher pay so we get teachers who are committed to excellence in the classroom. I consider this an investment in West Virginia's future.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Dave Higgins\ 18 Norwood Road, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Washington & Lee University, B.A. 1970; Washington & Lee University Law School, J.D. 1975; Attorney with Robinson & McElwee, PLLC - Member; admitted to practice U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Tax Court, U.S. Claims Court, U.S. District Courts - Northern and Southern Districts of WV, WV Supreme Court of Appeals, U.S. Army 1970-1972; Cannelton Coal No. 9 (Smithers) & Royal Sparks (Layland) 1967-1968; UMWA member.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ West Virginia is the heart of energy in America. But we must lead by example to keep our earth beautiful. Hybrid cars and those that utilize bio-diesel fuel should be encouraged through state tax credits. However, educating our children about conservation is our best assurance for the future.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose an abortion?\ I do not. I am a solid pro-choice Democrat, but I also believe that the restrictions already in place on final trimester abortion (except to save the mother's life) are necessary.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ The legislature took good first steps, but we must be vigilant. Prevention lowers the cost of healthcare. Access to affordable urgent care centers, barebones coverage for the uninsured, tax credits for responsible companies who provide catastrophic coverage along with health savings accounts and expansion of CHIPs.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Extending the law would not protect anyone. It would however further punish those found guilty. The law is written to give the public recourse to an action, not the motive behind it. In order to have true equality in society, we must treat every citizen in the same manner.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I would cut the Business Franchise Tax first to spur manufacturing jobs in Kanawha County. Next, we can eliminate the food tax. Shoppers in bordering counties will bring their business back in-state creating a revenue neutral move. We must look at exempting the first $40,000 of income for state taxes.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Teachers work for less every year because inflation rises. Schools are the centers of our communities and the foundation of our future. Our salaries must be competitive to neighboring states because we chance losing our best teachers - leaving us holding the bill for their training with nothing to show.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Mark Plants\ 626 Columbia St., South Charleston, WV 25309\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Graduated from South Charleston H.S. in 1995; graduated from WVU with B.S. in Business Administration with emphasis on finance and minor in economics; graduated from WVU College of Law 2004; employed at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Charleston, W.Va. 2000-2001; currently employed at the law firm of Kay Casto & Chaney for the past 2 years.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I don't have enough information to make or give an informed answer.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ Yes.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Deregulate insurance industry to allow low-cost insurance products to be offered to the public and create an environment to promote health care clinics with primary care physicians. It is imperative that a ""bare bones"" insurance product be available to the public.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ I support any laws that would deter any violence against any person - regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ Food tax.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Education is a priority. W.Va. needs an educated workforce to attract companies and industry to W.Va. I support a fund to help high growth areas keep teachers' pay competitive, especially in border counties.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Thornton Cooper\ 3015 Ridgeview Drive, South Charleston, WV 25303\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: South Charleston High School (1968); Yale University (B.A., Political Science, 1972); West Virginia University College of Law (J.D., 1978); retired state employee, 29 years of service, primarily as an attorney and administrator; currently self-employed as an attorney.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ The state should (a) better educate the public about saving money (and fuel) by adjusting cruise-control settings and thermostats and (b) increase, and better publicize, existing state tax credits for alternative-fuel motor vehicles. I get about 55 miles per gallon when I drive my Toyota Prius hybrid vehicle at 55 mph.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose an abortion?\ No, I'm ""pro-choice"". I'm also pro-adoption. To encourage the adoption of unplanned children, I support raising the current West Virginia adoption tax credit to $5,000 per child.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ American voters should elect enough new Senators and Congressmen to pass federal legislation making affordable health care the birthright of every American, including each of those 245,000 uninsured West Virginians. I would be willing to pay higher federal taxes to help finance such coverage.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ I do support amending W.Va. Code 61-6-21 to prohibit violence against individuals on the basis of handicap or perceived sexual orientation. The current law already prevents violence against individuals on the basis of ""race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation or sex"".\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I favor the immediate repeal of the state sales tax on food. I also favor expanding the powers of initiative and referendum to make it easier for voters to nullify tax (and ""fee"") increases imposed by state and local governments. I want to decelerate the growth of state government.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ My primary focus would be to protect existing health-insurance benefits. For my entire term in the State Senate, I would freeze PEIA premiums, deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance rates for state employees, teachers, and school service personnel at the rates that will take effect on July 1, 2006.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Brooks McCabe\ 1223 Staunton Road, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: University of Vermont, B.S. 1970; University of Vermont, M.Ed. 1972; West Virginia University, Ed.D. 1975; WV Governor's Office of Federal State Relations, 1976-1979; Home Finders, Inc., 1979-1980; McCabe Henley, LP, 1980- Nov. 2005; Independent Contractor with McCabe Henley LP, Nov. '05 to present.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ Construction of ""Green Buildings,"" hybrid cars, renewable energy resources such as hydro-electric, energy audits on homes, public buildings and commercial structures, recycling of building materials and beverage containers, inventory net greenhouse gasses so West Virginia can develop pro-active policies, and move toward a ""smaller is better"" philosophy for our state.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose an abortion?\ No. We need a ""consistent ethic of life."" We need to expend more effort on preventing unwanted pregnancies, dealing with prenatal care, health/life education, helping young mothers with child rearing and parenting skills. By focusing only on abortion, we are putting politics above the welfare of those individuals most at risk.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ The solution should involve a public-private collaboration consisting of some combination of Medicaid/Medicare expansion, employer and individual coverage mandates for private insurance, and premium subsidies. This will involve PEIA and creating affordable prescription drug programs. Although the State has a role, the Federal government must take the lead.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ ""Hate crimes"" show the underbelly of our society. It is the antithesis of ""love your neighbor as yourself."" Race, ethnicity, and sex are all categories where enhanced penalties are provided for criminal offenses. I would support adding sexual orientation to that list of enhanced penalties.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I would reduce the WV Franchise Tax, WV Corporate Net Income Tax, Personal Property Tax, and Food Tax, in that order. I would also like to increase the threshold for paying WV Personal Income Tax to $15,000.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ We need to get the average salary closer to the middle range. The problem is compounded by the underfunded Teachers Retirement System and constant PEIA cost increases. We need a five-year plan to raise salaries to that middle salary level, while using surplus funds to reduce pension liabilities.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Ann Calvert\ 1118 Shamrock Road, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Graduate of Pikeville Jr. College, Pikeville, Kentucky; elementary school teacher, credit company cashier, public relations for a utility co.; I have served four terms in the WV House of Delegates.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I support removing barriers to development of new energy resources, research for coal gasification, the use of hybrid cars. Let's renew our use of natural gas fueled automobiles and be a leader in the nation in use of native energy resources.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ Yes, I am in support of parental notification for underage girls seeking an abortion. This was introduced but, did not pass this past legislative session.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ We could start with helping small business provide health insurance for their employees with tax incentives. I support clinics and small medical practices providing preventive care with families paying a monthly fee, like the program in Clay County. This is a start.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ I favor protection of gays and all others from beatings but this would be a violation of the equal protection clause of the US Constitution's 14th amendment. We swear to uphold the Constitution so I could not support this.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ The food tax and several others. The personal property tax should be eliminated.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ I would streamline the education system eliminating layers of bureaucracy and pay our teachers on the level of surrounding states. West Virginia taxpayers are spending more per pupil than most states but the money is not managed well. This needs to change.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Louis P. Cervone\ 1206 High St., St. Albans, WV 25177\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Graduate St. Albans High School; currently employed as delivery driver for Standard Distributing and Exterminating.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I am very interested in the Department of Agricultures Forestry and Stewardship Program and would like to see them expanded to include ""dead fall"" removal and help for elderly homeowners. Keep our creeks and run offs clear of debris!\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ The right to choose should begin before conception! I feel bad for people that have to make life more complicated than that.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ If elected I will support Governor Manchin's Plan to extend Health Care to the unemployed. Controlling the market forces fueling growth can only control the rising cost of Health care.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ We have laws that cover assault. If the victim wished to expand the reasons of the assault it should be taken into consideration. Anyone who is a victim of an unsolicited assault is already a victim of a hate crime.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I would continue the cut to eliminate the Food tax. Look at your phone bill, car insurance bill, electric bill, all have state taxes on it. Maybe the State has more money than they let on! Eliminate USER FEE for a state-collected municipal divided amongst all our communities.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ I support pay raises for teachers and an increase in the state minimum wage. We must consider however that if we increase wages and the cost of living goes up we have only helped to fuel the same market forces that is ruining our health care system.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Sharon Spencer\ 1013 Pine Road, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Kanawha County Public Schools; University of Charleston (AB); WV Graduate College (MA+); Marshall and WVU (Doctoral Studies); FCC (Extra Class Amateur Radio Operator License KC8KVF); Mother, Educator, Consultant; Member, WV House of Delegates (1982-84, 1986-94, 1996-present); Assistant Majority Whip, Kanawha County Legislative Caucus (chair).\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ Protection of our environment and promotion of economic development can and should exist together. Every effort needs to be made to preserve and protect our natural beauty and resources. Recycling of trash materials, better insulation protection for dwellings, and clean coal technology are important. Better natural resource use is necessary.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ The U.S. Supreme Court has addressed this issue for the judicial system. I have been blessed with seven wonderful children. The right to an intenseley personal choice is fundamental. It falls upon women, with counseling from family, church and friends. Life is precious and more governmental interference is not helpful.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Our problem is that we have a ""sick care"" system instead of a ""health care"" system. We emphasize treatment after the fact instead of front-end prevention. We must expand our rural health initiative and provide increased accessibility to quality service delivery. Health Sciences and Technology Academy growth is important.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Everyone should expect fair and equitable treatment under the law. Enforcement of existing statutes on any beatings to any individual must prevail. Discrimination must not be tolerated at any level and all of our people should be respected as individuals. Anything less will be detrimental and hurtful to us all.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ Most problems will be solved with increased employment and employer opportunity. Regressive taxes, such as the food tax, should be replaced by a realistic and equitable tax system. Meaningful economic development occurs where there exists healthy, attractive and pleasant surroundings where good education, qualified workers, and pride are emphasized.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Our teachers must be treated as the professionals they are and given the support necessary to accomplish their mission. The present state aid formula funding should be reevaluated. There must be proper emphasis given to stable funding. I support meaningful dedication of resources from various sources to improve education.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Bob T.

Department of Natural Resources Administrator; executive director of South Charleston Convention and Visitors Bureau.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I would encourage continued research in alternative fuels and continued tax credits for development of synfuels. I would encourage expanded exploration of natural gas and oil in the State and would encourage usage of these products by giving State grants as incentives.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ I would not support any additional restrictions on women's rights.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ I would establish a state-wide program, preferably a public- private partnership to provide this coverage. I would use bulk buying power for supplies and operate the program similar to the CHIPS program. I would identify 10 areas in the State where the need is greatest and would set up community clinics seeking Federal grants and redirecting the revenue from tobacco products, beer, wine and liquor.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ I would strengthen the laws involving violent crimes on anyone. If it were extended only to cover gays then non-gay victims would be the ones discriminated against.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ Sales tax is the one tax that every citizen of West Virginia pays. To effect a true tax cut that everyone could benefit from I would support the gradual and total elimination of the sales tax on food, and replace those funds with any new revenue from lottery, racing and other gambling activity.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ I would first support a redirection of the coal severance tax for that purpose. I would set a minimum pay scale and tie increases in with an annual increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). I would support developing a ten year State budget plan with increases estimated.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Robert Palmer\ 1205 Dudley Road, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Bachelor's of Business Administration, The University of Georgia, 1984; McJunkin, Lead Systems Architect, 1984-present; American Software, Sr. Systems Analyst, 1988-1994; Blue Circle Cement, Systems Analyst, 1985-1988.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ Energy independence is required to help preserve our freedom and our Democracy. We should offer tax credits and development grants for solar, wind (especially small-turbine and low-noise), and clean coal technologies, while protecting our own State energy economy.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ Abortion is a tragic event no matter what the context. While I'm not prepared to add further restrictions on an already horrific situation, we should do everything in our power to ensure that all women and men in West Virginia understand alternatives to abortion, including prevention and adoption programs.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ We can encourage all businesses to provide health care to employees through subsidies. (The Federal government currently assists New York and Nevada with these programs.) The subsidy can take the form of a State tax credit or direct monthly cash payments to cover low-income workers and their families.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ These laws don't protect people from violent crimes, only to punish criminals more severely. My view is all victims of violent crimes are equal. However, our Legislature should send a tolerance message for all humanity. I support this protection if that is the best way to communicate that sentiment.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ All taxes that are punitive or obsolete must go (like the vehicle tax that requires a full sales tax payment on vehicles for anyone moving here). All taxes that discourage businesses from starting up or relocating here must go, as must any tax that limits investment and business success.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ An educated workforce helps to keep jobs in West Virginia and to attract new employers. We must invest heavily in education, including paying our teachers like the professionals they are, to maintain a quality workforce in this ever-shrinking world and highly competitive global economy ... before it is too late.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Bonnie Brown\ 2328 Woodland Ave., South Charleston, WV 25303\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Oregon State University; University of Idaho; Morris Harvey College - B.A., English; most recently, Executive Director of South Charleston Chamber of Commerce; Legislator.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I would support increased mileage requirements for vehicles, and incentives for increased use of solar panels for hot water heating.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ No.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ The governor's health-care bill is a step in the right direction, including pilot programs at clinics, and increasing the CHIPS program for children. We need more competition for providing low- cost coverage.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Yes.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ Food tax, and sales tax, in general. Both are regressive.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ They deserve adequate compensation, but we need to continue to address the pension debt.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Barbara 'Bobbie' Hatfield\ 3 Wilbur Drive, South Charleston, WV 25303\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Graduated from Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing, Charlotte, North Carolina as a Registered Nurse; have worked as a registered nurse in hospital, hospice, home health, rural health care as a health care consultant; I currently work with Hospice.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ We have already begun to work on the development of coal into liquid energy. This is an area in which West Virginia is uniquely qualified. We in the legislature need to do all that we can to support this initiative.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ No.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ The increased children's coverage is a good beginning. Recent legislation creates pilot programs to begin basic insurance coverage at a reasonable cost. We will study these programs to determine the most effective way to provide coverage for all. We must emphasize disease prevention and health promotion to decrease healthcare costs.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Yes.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ We are already phasing out the food tax. Beyond that, we need to study the whole tax structure and revise the tax code to create a fairer and more uniform system and eliminate regressive taxes.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ As we use the surplus to pay down the debt in the retirement fund, we free up funds that can be used for future teacher's pay raises. This is a fair and responsible way to give our educators the raises that they deserve.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Ted Boettner\ 2 Woodsview Heights Apt. B, Charleston, WV 25302\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Capital High School - graduated 1997; West Virginia University - graduated 2002; University of New Hampshire - expected graduation 2006; University of New Hampshire Research Assistant; West Virginia Citizen Action Group - Federal Issues Coordinator; West Virginia Environmental Council - Lobbyist.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I support raising the efficiency standards for certain appliances and lighting fixtures sold in West Virginia. I also support energy efficiency tax incentives, a public benefits fund for developing energy efficiency programs in West Virginia, investments in solar and wind power and energy-efficiency improvements for low-income households and schools.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ No. We should do all we can to help women avoid the need to face that decision.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ The best way to improve our health care system is to provide quality health care to all through a single administrator. This lowers costs for families, employers and providers, allows more investment in prevention and public health, and gives citizens more control over their own health care decisions.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Yes. Hate crimes have distinct features and effects and it's important that criminal laws recognize these differences.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I purpose we lift the state income tax threshold from $10,000 (second lowest in the nation) to $25,000, which would encourage and reward work by reducing the tax burden for low-wage families in West Virginia.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ A central reason West Virginia suffers ""brain drain"" is because qualified educators leave our state in search of higher paid positions. Our state economic livelihood depends on strong, quality education. I support bringing teachers' pay closer to the national average.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Danny Wells\ 34 Bridlewood Road, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Charleston High School - 1958; WVU - 1962; 43 years Charleston Gazette; four years substitute teacher; two years House of Delegates.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ 1) Incentives to encourage homeowners to install energy-saving products; 2) Incentives to encourage purchase of Hybrid cars; 3) Increase use of Ethanol mix with gasoline; 4) Stricter government rules promoting gas-saving cars (not just SUVs); 5) Development of more environmentally-friendly windmill energy; 6) Increase recycling.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ No.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Expand coverage that was authorized by HB 4021 which we passed in the last session. The bill establishes a pilot project (Preventive Care Clinic Based Plan) that provides basic health care services for a low monthly fee through designated clinics and physician offices.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Yes.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ The food tax should be further reduced from the one percent that was cut by the 77th Legislature. However we should be careful not to reduce taxes in a manner that would add to the financial burden the state already is facing.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Pay raises for teachers is a must. Pay for teachers in West Virginia should be at the very least competitive with salaries of teacher in surrounding states. This should be a priority of the governor and the next Legislature.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Corey Palumbo\ 1206 Williamsburg Way, Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: George Washington High School (graduate); West Virginia University (graduate); University of North Carolina School of Law (graduate); Lawyer - Bowles Rice McDavid Graff & Love, 1998-present.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I believe this is one of the most critical problems facing our state and nation today. I would support programs to encourage the reduction of energy consumption as well as other reasonable energy conservation measures.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ While I would like to see abortions be very rare, I do not support the erosion of women's rights that were granted by the United States Supreme Court.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Passage of House Bill 4021 was a great first step. This bill provides for basic health insurance and a clinic based primary care plan to be made available to all uninsured West Virginians. We also need to closely monitor all recommendations from the Interagency Health Council.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Yes.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ The first tax that I would cut would be the food tax because it is a strain on all working families. A close second would be the business franchise tax because this is a major hindrance to the creation of new jobs.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Teacher pay needs to be increased. We need to do this in a responsible way that the taxpayers can afford. I also support providing extra money to counties that have acute teacher shortages.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Nancy Peoples Guthrie\ 5300 Kanawha Ave., Charleston, WV 25304\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Pennsylvania State University - B.A. Degree, English Education, 1975; Capitol City Communications - President and Owner, established 1996; The Arnold Agency - Federal and State Relations, 1993-96; U.S. Forest Service - Assistant Director Information Management, 1992-93; Office of Senator Robert C. Byrd - Managed State Office, 1984-92; WVDO - Marketing and Research 1982-84; WOWK TV - Political Reporter, Bureau Chief, 1978- 82.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ Convert energy industry to 21st century technologies through new plant designs and modernization, capable of generating electricity, hydrogen and fuel. Technology exists to sequester and virtually eliminate harmful emissions deep below the earth, recycle through underground pipeline and connect to oil and natural gas fields to enhance oil recovery.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ No. Our laws are working fine as a protective safety net for desperate women. Our abortion rate ranks among the most improved in the nation, while the medical and judicial by-pass was used by only 19 young women who could not or would not tell their parents for whatever reason.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Without federal enactment of universal health care through a 15- 20% cut in defense spending we might explore the economics of replacing all state taxes - except sin, gambling, luxury, ecological, resource depletion - by phasing in a land tax over a five year period. Phase one could be earmarked for health insurance.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Yes if state statistics indicate a need exists to further protect citizens against this kind of brutalization. We're all equal under the law and entitled to equal protections. It's sad we even need contemplate extensions of basic fundamental protections to any human being or animal against brutality or abuse.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ Despite the current surplus, West Virginia remains billions of dollars in debt and other financial concerns remain unsolved - health insurance for uninsured West Virginians, pay raises for teachers and public employees. A fiscally responsible plan to remedy these shortfalls is needed before any taxes are cut.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ We might explore the economics of replacing all state taxes - except sin, gambling, luxury, ecological, resource depletion - by phasing in a land tax over a five year period. The second $100 per acre on our available 15 million acres could easily fund pay raises for teachers and public employees.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ John Amores\ 1301 Upper Dartmouth, Charleston, WV 25302\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: University of Notre Dame, B.A.; Loyola University of Chicago Law School, J.D.; Vice President, Private Banking J.P.

Also West Virginia should try to be a leader in coal liquefaction research.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ I believe the state legislature has a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable members of our society whether they are unborn babies, children, or the elderly. I would support legislation that restricted abortions except when the mother's life is in danger or rape.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ This is an important issue. However, the legislature needs to be careful and not create a huge bureaucracy that leads to tax increase on West Virginians. Before creating a new program we need to determine if the uninsured are eligible to participate in existing state programs.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ No. Our laws need to give equal protection to all West Virginians. I believe all violent crimes are ""hate crimes"". I would like to see tougher penalties for all violent crimes.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I would eliminate the Food Tax immediately. This would provide an immediate tax break to all West Virginians. This would be a good place to start, however West Virginia's entire tax code needs to be revised to make West Virginia more competitive.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Teachers have a very important job and should receive competitive salaries. The best way to provide the resources is to develop West Virginia's economy and broaden the tax base. Then the state would have adequate resources to give raises to teachers and public employees.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Judy Romano\ 4611 Country Club Blvd., South Charleston, WV\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Attended University of Charleston and West Virginia State University; graduate of Concord, Tourism Class.

I support increased funding in the area of research and development for clean coal technology and alternative uses of coal. I support research in the area of renewable fuel sources such as waste-wood products and wind-power generation.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ I am pro-life and feel abortion should only be performed to save the life of the mother, or in the case of incest and rape. Laws pertaining to parental notification should be strengthened to ensure parental involvement prior to an abortion being performed on a minor.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ The Leglislature made progress in the 2006 session authorizing medical professionals to contract with patients to provide basic health care services for set fees. Further research is needed to determine how other states have successfully addressed this issue so that the right decisions can be made for West Virginians.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ No. Any violent crime should have severe punishment regardless of race or sexual preference. All citizens deserve to be protected, and criminals should be held accountable and severely punished for their crimes.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ My first priority would be to cut the Food Tax. Then, an immediate reduction to the State's tax on gasoline/diesel fuel should be addressed. Let's remember, we have a surplus. Let's give it back to the taxpayers.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Competitive teacher salaries are very important to ensure our children have excellent teachers. Having a pro-business environment by reforming the judicial system and offering a trained workforce will entice industry to locate in West Virginia and provide the tax base needed for pay raises.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Ira Bostic Jr.\ 2358 Harrison Avenue, St. Albans, 25177\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Attended Marshall University; City College of Chicago; graduate Real Estate Institute at WVU Parkersburg; U.S. Army 8 years; Pipefitter; Owner/Broker ICI Real Estate LLC; commercial real estate broker; President Kanawha Valley MLS Service.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ I would explore any energy conservation measures introduced to see which would be the most effective. I believe there are many possibilities; and we should take the time to explore all of these and make an informed decision.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ I believe the Supreme Court was wrong concerning the Roe v Wade issue. I do not believe the constitution supports the decision of the court. I do however believe we should obey the ruling until such time it is reversed. I believe in parental notification, and against partial birth abortion.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ The healthcare problem could easily be solved by creating a business friendly atmosphere that would attract good paying jobs with health benefits. This would also increase the tax base providing more revenue for healthcare programs for those who are disabled and cannot work.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ I would not support any law that places one group of West Virginians above the rest whether it is black, white, straight, or gay. The laws should be fair and equitable to all and to do this would favor one group over the rest.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I would remove the franchise tax. I believe as many in the community do, that the elimination of the franchise tax would be the first step in creating a more friendly business atmosphere. This could be offset by the creation of better paying jobs and putting more people to work.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ I believe a good educational system starts with dedicated teachers. I do feel that we need to be competitive with our neighboring states to keep good teachers in West Virginia. I do not support across the board raises, I feel merit raises create better workers in any field.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Todd Carden\ 2324 Laurel Drive, St. Albans, WV 25177\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Graduate WV State University with B.S. in Business Administration, major in Accounting; utility analyst with WV PSC - retired.\ League\ What energy conservation measures do you support, if any?\ Enact state income tax credits for energy reducing heating systems and insulation.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ Yes.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ I would raise tax on tobacco products to aid in providing such relief. I would also observe how effective laws recently enacted will be and support needed changes.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ I assume that such crimes are already covered under existing laws. Such laws should be enforced with appropriate charges and penalties irregardless of sexual preference.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ Reduce Corporate Income Tax to 6% and require utilities to reduce rates to reflect the lower rate. Elimination of Consumer Sales Tax on food should have equal preference.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ I would encourage border counties facing higher teacher salaries to supplement state salary levels through increases in property taxes. I would support changes in state law to permit counties to retain locally such increases. I would sponsor legislation to allow property taxes as an itemized state income tax deduction.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Michael 'Mike' Stuart\ 11 South Cove Lane, South Charleston, WV 25309\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Attended, Boston University School of Management; Graduate, J.D., Boston University School of Law; Graduate, B.S.B.Ad.

We need to invest in clean coal technologies and provide incentives for private investment into energy research and development. We must provide incentives to businesses and homeowners to invest in energy and water conservation and water recovery programs.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ The current 30th District Delegates have fought measures to limit abortions. Abortions should be rare and legal only in the case of rape, incest or danger to the mother. I support a parent's right to consent to an abortion by a minor child and other protections of the unborn.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ The 30th District Delegates have done too little. The majority of the uninsured own or work for small businesses. We need better jobs, medical savings accounts, electronic medical records, and association health plans where small companies can pool together. Medical billing procedures need streamlined so patients can demand greater accountability.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ All crimes of violence are crimes of hate. Justice must be blind to the sexual orientation and personal characteristics of victims. We need to strengthen laws against domestic violence, child abuse, and the predators who violate our children. Violent acts against any person must be dealt with severely.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ Taxes are too high and 30th District Delegates refuse to cut taxes. We need to grow our economy by abolishing the food tax, establishing competitive tax rates, reducing capital gains taxes, and passing a first-of-its-kind 'patent and copyright' tax exclusion to encourage research and development.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Our children deserve a world-class education and our 30th District Delegates have failed us. Teachers need competitive wages. Certain free-market principles must be introduced into education like merit pay. Excessive administrative costs must be shifted to the classroom. Our kids, not administrators, must be the priority.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Fred H.

While still self-employed, I served as an independent sales representative with a showroom and sales office in Atlanta, Georgia.

Electric lighting accounts for 20 to 29 percent of all energy used in buildings and about 5 percent of all energy used in the U.S. Lighting has a secondary impact on cooling and heating requirements.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ I do not support abortion on demand, abortion may be a necessary alternative for cases of rape, incest, and to protect the life of the mother.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ I would have a plan, to allow the small businesses to join a cooperative for the purpose of obtaining lower cost insurance. Offer tax credits and incentives to employers that offer employee health care.

Special laws for special interest groups are not necessary.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ I would eliminate the food tax immediately. For a family that spends $100 per week on groceries, it would save them enough to allow for free groceries for two and half weeks per year.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Student population has been on a decline for some years, the administration and educational bureaucracy continues to grow.

However, a workable federal energy conservation program is needed to foster this effort.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ No. Abortions should be rare, legal and safe. West Virginia has significant restrictions (i.e. parental notification for minors and a ""waiting period"" before an abortion can be performed.) Further restrictions will likely result in unsafe, back alley abortions and place the health and lives of women and young girls at risk.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Passage of H.B. 4021 creates a plan to expand the CHIP program, develop a pilot program where health clinic providers can offer primary and preventive health for a prepaid fee to uninsured individuals and families; and authorize limited health benefit plans for uninsured individuals or those who have lost their coverage.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Yes.

This credit would result in a tax refund and reduction for our state's poorest if their ""credit"" exceeds the amount of taxes owed.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ The Legislature recently approved a multi-year teacher pay increase for the first time in 15 years. This $1,350 annual increase also includes additional incremental increases over the next three years based upon years of experience.

They can't afford high gas price and buy medicine and food on fixed income. Tax out of state landlords like our citizens.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ If we give our children a good education, we need to eliminate some of the county offices by consolidation and pay our teachers more.

Individuals should be informed as to methods of energy conservation and our responsibility to reduce our energy consumption.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ I am pro-life. Furthermore, parents should know if their minor daughter is going to have an abortion. Parental consent is required for ear piercing, tooth fillings and tattoos, but not for abortions. This makes no sense. Children need the love and advice of their parents during the abortion decision.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ As a member of the Health Committee, I attended nearly 20 hours of health care meetings dealing with this issue. I support the low cost insurance program and prepaid program passed by the Legislature this year. These programs will make healthcare more accessible and affordable.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ No. We should protect the life and safety of all people equally.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ The food tax should be repealed immediately. The working poor pay a higher portion of their total income in food tax than the wealthy. The food tax simply punishes people for being poor. We should then completely rewrite the tax code in order to promote job growth and economic prosperity.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Teachers deserve our respect and gratitude for teaching our kids. But we also have a responsibility to taxpayers to control costs. We must grow our economy so that taxpayers can afford to increase teachers' salaries.

Our State should explore innovative development of coal liquefaction and other means for providing energy to our State and Nation.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ Yes. I strongly oppose abortion and believe abortion should only be legal to save the life of the mother. Our current parental notification laws should also be strengthened to further ensure parental involvement before a minor can have an abortion.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Government's most productive role in ensuring accessible health care is to create incentives for private employers to provide their employees health insurance. The recent initiative adopted by the Legislature authorizing medical professionals to contract with patients to provide basic health care for minimal monthly costs is also a positive step.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ I oppose adding sexual orientation to the current hate crimes law. Those who assault or beat any West Virginia citizen should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. The severity and nature of their punishment, however, should not be determined by the sexual orientation of their victim.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ First, we should entirely eliminate the sales tax on food in order to provide all West Virginians immediate tax relief and help in meeting the economic burdens they face. We should also reduce the State's tax on gasoline and cut certain business taxes to create jobs and encourage economic growth.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Ensuring that our state's schools are staffed with qualified teachers is vital to the future of West Virginia. We should strive to make teacher salaries competitive in a responsible manner within existing budgetary restraints, while ensuring that such steps are taken without increasing the tax burden on our State's citizens.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Ron Walters\ 1308 Vienna Point, Cross Lanes, WV 25313\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: B.S. degree in economics, University of Michigan; six term member of the House of Delegates; owner of R.N.

I understand the budgetary process and its importance in controlling costs, keeping taxes low, and setting the direction of the county.\ If money were available, would you use it for upgrading our sewer systems or on beautification of the banks of the Kanawha River?\ Upgrading our sewer systems.\ Gazette\ Would you close meetings to the public to discuss sensitive or controversial issues?\ No.\ What are the county's most pressing priorities?\ Providing programs and services to our senior citizens and children, economic development (including expansion and improvement of water, sewer and storm water systems), and public safety.\ Daily Mail\ What concerns do you have about home confinement and day reporting programs?\ Ensure there are enough officers to monitor the participants and allowing only nonviolent offenders to participate.\ What is the county's biggest budget challenge, and how would you deal with it?\ Allowing for increases in large expenditures such as fuel, prisoner jailing and health insurance while at the same time working to provide services which supports our communities and promotes growth. I would do this by beginning the budget with our fixed costs (like those above) and then funding projects in order of priority.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Kent Carper\ 25 Pinnacle Drive, Charleston, WV 25311\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: West Virginia State University, graduated; Ohio Northern University School of Law, graduated; West Virginia Air National Guard, aircraft technician; West Virginia State Department of Transportation, administrative assistant; West Virginia State Auditor's Office, deputy commissioner; Kanawha County Prosecuting Attorneys Office, assistant prosecutor; City of Charleston, public safety director and chief of police; self- employed, Hill, Peterson, Carper, Bee & Deitzler, P.L.L.C., attorney; and Kanawha County Commissioner.\ League\ What skills do you have that would make you an asset as a county commissioner?\ I believe my leadership ability lends itself to my service as a county commissioner. I also think that having genuine core convictions and sticking with them is an asset in my service to the community.\ If money were available, would you use it for upgrading our sewer systems or on beautification of the banks of the Kanawha River?\ My record of public service shows extensive support for both of these areas. In addition, I am proud to say that I have always spent the taxpayers' money as frugally and productively as possible. Both sewer systems and beautification are top priorities.\ Gazette\ Would you close meetings to the public to discuss sensitive or controversial issues?\ The record will show that I have never been involved in a closed- door, executive session during my career of public service. I think there is too much secrecy in government. The public has a right to know what its public offices are doing.\ What are the county's most pressing priorities?\ The three most pressing priorities include job preservation, public safety, and infrastructure improvement. In many ways, the three work hand in hand in the improvement of our quality of life in Kanawha County.\ Daily Mail\ What concerns do you have about home confinement and day reporting programs?\ Having been one of the original proponents of the day reporting center, I want the program to continue efficiently. Those who should be placed in jail must continue to be and those who are eligible for alternative sentencing, within the jurisdiction of the court, should be in these programs.\ What is the county's biggest budget challenge, and how would you deal with it?\ Regional jail costs and health care are the biggest challenges. We have worked with the courts and law enforcement to avoid duplicate incarcerations as a way of saving costs there. We have also worked to restructure our health care plan to provide the best service at the least cost.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Bill White\ 5611 Starling Drive, Rand, WV 25306\ Party: Democrat\ Biographical information: Graduate St. Albans High School 1961; graduate West Virginia State University 1980; 28 years as Emergency Service Director.\ League\ What skills do you have that would make you an asset as a county commissioner?\ Able to get cooperation from others to make changes in society.

People skills - I am a great salesman for change!\ If money were available, would you use it for upgrading our sewer systems or on beautification of the banks of the Kanawha River?\ Water and sewer projects, including getting the commission staff to help the other municipalities in solving their water and sewer issues. This is a health and safety issue with me.\ Gazette\ Would you close meetings to the public to discuss sensitive or controversial issues?\ No - would also communicate with other commissioners on daily basis - would restore respect for others in our commission meetings.\ What are the county's most pressing priorities?\ Prevent total collapse of our financial stability. Coordinate metro government projects to better serve our county without destroying our community fabric so we financially serve the residence better.\ Daily Mail\ What concerns do you have about home confinement and day reporting programs?\ Want to make sure that it works. I grew up on the street so to speak - there are people that just mess up, good people, there are some that are just bad and need to be locked up.\ What is the county's biggest budget challenge, and how would you deal with it?\ Avoid total collapse. I am extremely good at getting things done, getting others to work together to be a part of the solution. Without a lot of hoopla. I am not interested in being a one man show. I much rather cause applause for others than be applauded. If you operate that way, the changes will last a long time after the flashbulb cools off.

I am willing to work hands on beside and with Kanawha County citizens to improve the quality of life in Kanawha County.\ If money were available, would you use it for upgrading our sewer systems or on beautification of the banks of the Kanawha River?\ I would upgrade the sewer systems. Infrastructure such as sewer, water and so on is very important to the economic well-being of the county. A good sewer system is important to the ecological health of the rivers and streams.\ Gazette\ Would you close meetings to the public to discuss sensitive or controversial issues?\ I am in favor of open meetings, where citizens of the county have a real voice and are actively encouraged to participate in government.\ What are the county's most pressing priorities?\ Opening new economic development opportunities to inhibit the departure of our citizens. We want to grow our opportunities and our population. We want to make Kanawha County the place people choose to live and where they have available employment.\ Daily Mail\ What concerns do you have about home confinement and day reporting programs?\ Does home confinement/day reporting centers put communities at risk? Is there adequate supervision? Are the systems cost- effective? I am in favor of these programs but I do have these concerns.\ What is the county's biggest budget challenge, and how would you deal with it?\ I believe the county has two big challenges. The cost of jails is one. Home confinement/day reporting programs are a good beginning solution. How to attract new business and keep existing business is another challenge that I would deal with through economic incentives.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Neil ""Thunder"" White\ P.O.

The first priority is to enhance our curriculum to compete in the global market. The next priority would be to enhance communication skills between the Board and the rest of the population.\ What values should our children be taught in public schools?\ Values are supposed to be taught in the home. The primary values are ethics, morality and respect. If students are not taught values in their respective homes, then all we can do as educators is guide them and lead by example. Students seem to emulate emotions being shown by educators.\ Gazette\ Do you support the teaching of intelligent design in biology class?\ In a short answer: yes. All theories should be openly discussed with equal time allotted to each. Allow the students to use what we are trying to enhance: THEIR BRAINS.\ What is your opinion of the No Child Left Behind Act?\ I believe this act has its ups and downs. It seems to try to bring up remedial students to a higher level while cutting back on programs designed for advanced learners. I think there is a better way to accomplish what this act set out to do.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ Making reference to the previous question about values, if these are taught at a young age, we can deter any issues. However, when they do arise then the only way to teach a lesson is not to show anger, but rather convince the student to repair what was vandalized.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal days to a minimum?\ I am sure that all of the early-dismissal days are a bit confusing to parents and perhaps some staff members. I would like to reevaluate the purpose for these dates and open lines of communication for parents and staff to be heard on this issue.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Bill Ferrell\ 2701 Fairlawn Ave. #7, Dunbar, WV 25064\ Party: Non-partisan\ Biographical information: Albion Rd K-6th; Hillcrest Jr. High 7th- 9th; West High School 10th-12th; University of Kansas at Pittsburg, KS, attended 74-76, major - English, minor - Public Relations; attended Marshall University 1982; law enforcement officer for county Sheriff Dept.; also city police in Madison and Danville WV; Supervisor of Accounting section; handled 20-50 million dollars in accounts payable and receivable for Gov.

Teach in class (not on TV).\ What values should our children be taught in public schools?\ Respect, Attitude and Discipline along with Integrity. Do what they can do to the best of their ability.\ Gazette\ Do you support teaching of Intelligent Design in biology classes?\ No, the biology classroom is for the teaching of science not the cavemen theory vs. Adam and Eve theory.\ What is your opinion of the No Child Left Behind Act?\ It is worthless piece of law with really no purpose but to spend money hand over fist. It also hurts the child they do not learn all they should.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ Suspend the child, make them clean the act up of whatever type of vandalism and if they do it again expel them from school for that year and put on their record in office.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal days to a minimum?\ Change the two hour early dismissal until the last days of school and also revisit the issue of doing it at all during the school year until the new year starts over.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Becky Jordon\ One Norwood Rd., Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Non-partisan\ Biographical information: Stonewall Jackson graduated 1979; WVU School of Social Work Bachelors graduated 1983; WVU School of Social Work Masters graduated 1988; psychiatric social worker Thomas Hospital; drug/alcohol counselor, WV Division Corrections; Child Protective Service worker, DDHR; social worker, nursing home.\ League\ Please list your priorities for improving public education in Kanawha County.\ We need to regularly carefully review the curriculum content and time on task to help optimize classroom learning for all students. Second, we need to work with the superintendent to insure we have strong educational leaders in our schools and hold them accountable.\ What values should our children be taught in public schools?\ I believe in teaching strong character development in partnership with parents. I support the character education program in our schools, which teaches honesty, integrity, respect for others, unselfishness, personal responsibility, the virtues of hard work, self-sacrifice, and helping those less fortunate. Character education reinforces good moral behavior in children.\ Gazette\ Do you support teaching of Intelligent Design in biology classes?\ No, this is a philosophical and religious theory and should not be taught as science in biology classes. There is nothing wrong with giving students the opportunity to explore the theory of Intelligent Design outside of science class, but it should not be included in the science curriculum.\ What is your opinion of the No Child Left Behind Act?\ I support the No Child Left Behind Act, because it focuses on learning for all children regardless of their socio-economic background. However, it holds schools accountable for some things out of their control, such as student absenteeism, transient students, students with learning disabilities. The act also is not funded fully by the federal government.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ I believe we should use every legal remedy to hold the students and their parents accountable for vandalism by juveniles. All repair costs should be paid in full to the school system, including the full cost of any classroom time that is lost. The vandals should also be required to do community service.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal days to a minimum?\ I am committed to reduce early-dismissal days to an absolute minimum. It is a great waste of taxpayers dollars to significantly shorten class time for students. It is also not fair to parents or students. Early dismissal days should only be used as a stopgap, short-term measure.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Pete Thaw\ 227 Hayes Ave., Charleston, WV 25314\ Party: Non-partisan\ Biographical information: Graduate Pine Crest Academy; three and a half years at Kent State; graduate Morris Harvey (now University of Charleston).\ League\ Please list your priorities for improving public education in Kanawha County.\ My priority remains the same, to stop wasting money by feeding the administrative bureaucracy; and rather, put the taxpayers' money into the classrooms where it will benefit students and teachers.\ What values should our children be taught in public schools?\ ""Values"" are more the province of parents and home than the school system. However, one would expect children to learn in school about the benefits of being well educated; ethical behavior and integrity; good citizenship and how to be a contributing member of our society.\ Gazette\ Do you support the teaching of Intelligent Design in biology classes?\ I advocate the teaching of both the Theory of Evolution and the Theory of Intelligent Design so that students, with their parents, may decide for themselves which is reasonable and right for their lives.\ What is your opinion of the No Child Left Behind Act?\ While the NCLB Act was, (I'm sure) good intentioned, it is a waste of money. It sets up unrealistic and unfunded goals and objectives.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ I assume we are speaking of vandalism of school property. I would recommend a 1-year suspension with the proviso that any student found guilty of vandalism be required to help clean up or repair the damage done in order to return to classes at the end of his/her suspension.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal days to a minimum?\ I will not vote for any additional early-dismissal days.

NCLB prevents hiding children who are not receiving an adequate education within the average of a larger population that is doing acceptable work. There are problems with NCLB, but the positives far exceed the negatives.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ The parents should be held accountable for the total cost incurred and the students disciplined.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal to a minimum?\ There is one, two-hour early dismissal per month. This time is used for teachers from different schools to assess/strategize efforts to improve student performance. These meetings should be justified based upon results obtained.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Robert Johnson\ 5221 Chesterfield Ave., Charleston, WV 25304\ Party: Non-partisan\ Biographical information: Charleston/Capital High School; Marshall University; West Virginia State; West Virginia Radio Corp; Marketing and Advertising.\ League\ Please list your priorities for improving public education in Kanawha County.\ No response.\ What values should our children be taught in public schools?\ Respect, responsibility.\ Gazette\ Do you support the teaching of intelligent design in biology class?\ No response.\ What is your opinion of the No Child Left Behind Act?\ It is working as far as test scores go but is an enormous extra workload on teachers.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ Treat them harshly and accordingly the first time and make them do community clean up service.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal days to a minimum?\ Cancel them!\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes.\ Tifney Terry\ HC-36 Box 52, Charleston, WV 25306\ Party: Non-partisan\ Biographical information: Charleston High School; Carver Career & Technical Center, area of study computer science; University of Charleston, WV State College, area of study accounting; CAMC, Women & Children's Division, financial services/admitting; McJunkin Corporation, industrial sales; LabCorp, data conversion and cytology; President, ""West Virginia Wants to Know;"" currently employed by the City of Nitro.\ League\ Please list your priorities for improving public education in Kanawha County.\ I would start by letting teachers teach. Put focus and emphasis on elementary education - reading and math. Work to reduce the number of children who leave elementary school with deficiencies in reading and math. In reducing this number you reduce the number of students who require remediation in middle and high school (which the number of is increasing every year).\ What values should our children be taught in public schools?\ Values should be reinforced in schools. It is difficult enough for teachers to teach the children in their classrooms the curriculum without having to teach them values. Values need to be taught and formed in the home and positively reinforced in the school system.\ Gazette\ Do you support teaching of Intelligent Design in biology classes?\ I support educating children. At the appropriate grade levels all thoughts that are in the public arena should be taught. It is only by giving our children all the information available that we better prepare them for life.\ What is your opinion of the No Child Left Behind Act?\ I think it sounds great on a campaign trail - but falls short in implementation. The harsh reality is that there are children who are left behind no matter what program is implemented.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ I think the school system should focus on educating students and leave acts of vandalism to law enforcement.\ What would you do to keep early dismissal days to a minimum?\ I would work to reduce the number of faculty senate and OSE days.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Barbara Burdette Welch\ 7012 Kanawha Farm Circle, Charleston, WV 25312\ Party: Non-partisan\ Biographical information: 1957 graduate of Stonewall Jackson; business courses through Adult Education; 2 1/2 years Diamond Department Store, Charleston in sales; five years Firemans Group Insurance, Charleston, WV and Atlanta, Georgia.\ League\ Please list your priorities for improving public education in Kanawha County.\ Recruit math and science teachers.

This technology contains many aspects which will help conserve energy and lead to a healthier environment.\ Do you support further restrictions on a woman's right to choose abortion?\ As someone who believes human life is sacred and precious, I believe we must continue to find ways to make sure mothers and fathers-to-be understand through education that there are better options than abortion. I also believe that parents have the right to know if their children are considering an abortion.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ We need to do more to reform our tort system and bring down costs. Competition is the best answer. Also creative lower cost primary care plans, health savings accounts and more responsible access strategies will help the cost shift problem.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ Hate crimes legislation sends the message that some crimes are worse than others based solely on who the victim is.

Hardworking West Virginians should not be taxed at the grocery store. We also need to look at eliminating the unfair property tax on automobiles.

The hate crimes law should encompass any individual or group that is specifically targeted in violent crimes.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ We need to look carefully at our budget before cutting any taxes. We have a financial obligation to the people of this state to maintain a balanced budget, and pay down our state's debt. I would however like to see the gas tax be more equal to surrounding states.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ I feel our teachers need the time to learn new and innovative ways to deliver curriculum, I believe we could research the possibility of providing them time for additional professional development and rewarding them for their time, thus providing them with an increase in pay.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Patti Eagloski Schoen\ P.O.

Implement preventative care and wellness check-up programs in our local communities. Educate our citizens and encourage pro-active health and nutrition.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ No. A violent assault against a citizen of our state is wrong and must be dealt with assertively. The motive for the assault does not and should not minimize the penalty.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ The franchise tax is considered to be the main tax that is keeping business from being successful in West Virginia or is preventing business from locating in West Virginia. Removing the tax would send a strong message to the business world that West Virginia is interested in real economic growth and living wage jobs.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Our economic future depends on our ability to provide an educated work force. Most of the task falls on teachers. Our state has made promises to our teachers which we have not kept in reference to their retirement. We must keep our present promises (funding retirement) before we make more promises.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No.\ Troy Andes\ 8 Meadow Ridge Drive, Hurricane, WV 25526\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Graduated from Hurricane High School; attended Marshall University; graduated Virginia Tech; manager of public and community relations, Massey Coal Services, Inc.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ By lowering taxes and drastically reforming our legal system, we can attract employers to West Virginia who will create good-paying jobs with health insurance.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ No. All West Virginians should be treated equally.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ The food tax should be eliminated immediately to provide relief to West Virginia families.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Wasteful government spending should be eliminated to increase teachers' pay. The recent discovery that more than $1 million is missing from a southern West Virginia Regional Education Agency is a prime example of how our tax dollars are being misspent.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Dan Holstein\ 61 Mill Creek Crossing, Hurricane, WV 25526\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Graduate of Teays Valley Christian School; graduated from University of Charleston; graduated from WVU College of Law; nine years experience as an assistant prosecuting attorney enforcing criminal law; engaged in private practice as solo practitioner since 2003.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Most of these uninsureds are from working families that make too much money to qualify for a state medical card. I would give tax credits to employers as an incentive to provide health insurance to these families. I would also expand CHIPS to cover the remaining children in that number.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ No. Hate crimes legislation is misplaced. As a prosecutor, I can tell you that is hardly ever used. Further, the penalties provided by our criminal laws are usually adequate. Rather than create new substantive crimes, we should give judges broader discretion at sentencing to treat convicts differently, considering motive.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ The food tax. It is regressive. It penalizes families with children, especially those where one parent chooses to stay home and rear the children. A close second is the business franchise tax, because it discourages new business from coming to West Virginia. Both taxes should be eliminated.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ We should do a comparison analysis with surrounding states, taking into consideration the cost of living and benefits allowed in those states. Our teacher salaries should be adjusted accordingly. Performance based reviews should be incorporated, with financial incentives for good performance.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Rich Holtzapfel\ 255 Frazier Way, Scott Depot, WV 25560\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: West Virginia University (J.D., 1998); Marshall University (M.A. counseling and rehabilitation, 1994; B.B.A. marketing, 1990); lawyer current Holtzapfel Law Offices, PLLC - Hurricane; previous experience, Kay Casto & Chaney PLLC; Farrell, Farrell & Farrell, L.C.; Steptoe & Johnson PLLC; also former professional counselor and former full-time youth pastor.\ Gazette\ How would you provide health insurance to 245,000 uninsured West Virginians?\ Work with the Insurance Commissioner to allow insurance companies to sell more affordable plans to West Virginia employers, especially small businesses where health care programs are financially unfeasible. I also think the viability of re-insurance should be explored as a means of reducing health care costs.\ Would you extend West Virginia's ""hate crimes"" law to protect gays from beatings?\ No, but my answer should not be interpreted to mean that I condone such crimes. Common sense tells us that all beatings involve ""hate"" by their very nature. Therefore, I believe that everyone who unlawfully beats another person should be punished in a manner commensurate with the crime.\ Daily Mail\ What tax would you cut first?\ Either the food tax, the business franchise tax or the corporate net income tax. My goals include eliminating the first two and reducing the third. Eliminating the food tax will provide needed relief to all West Virginians, while eliminating/reducing the others will improve West Virginia's business-friendly climate.\ What would you do about teachers' pay?\ Raise it until we are competitive wither other states. We must have quality educators in the classroom who will prepare our greatest resource, our children, to compete in a global environment. I also favor merit pay for every teacher who does his/her job well.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ Gary O. Tillis\ P.O.

I serve as Chairman of the Pension Fund and my responsibilities include reviewing actuary reports to ensure the fund meets department of Labor and Erisa standards.\ Gazette\ Would you close meetings to the public to discuss sensitive or controversial issues?\ Absolutely not. The Putnam County Commission routinely meets in executive session and this practice is unnecessary and needs to stop. If elected, I will propose scheduling at least one monthly meeting during evening hours to encourage citizen participation.\ What are the county's most pressing priorities?\ The biggest priority is attracting new business that will provide citizens economic security and benefits, while increasing the business tax base without placing excessive demands on county services. In addition, increased funding for public safety to crack down on meth-labs and focus on child abuse and neglect investigations.\ Daily Mail\ What concerns do you have about home confinement and day reporting programs?\ Day reporting programs and home confinement for nonviolent offenders, who are not a threat to the community, saves taxpayers money. However, criminals convicted for violent offenses, child abuse and neglect, and sexual misconduct need to be in jail because public safety is the top priority.\ What is the county's biggest budget challenge, and how would you deal with it?\ Providing essential basic services; such as, expanding water service, addressing water run off problems, adequate emergency services and appropriate funding for public safety. This can be achieved by attracting new business; thus, increasing the business tax base and by making government more efficient through bulk purchasing and joint purchasing.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No\ James H.

Pleasant. The extension of water and sewer service to unserved areas of the county. Finally, maintaining the high quality of life that Putnam County citizens have come to enjoy.\ Daily Mail\ What concerns do you have about home confinement and day reporting programs?\ Both of these programs are doing very well in Putnam County. The cooperation of the Court systems, both Circuit and Magistrate Courts, Sheriff's office, and the County Commission has made for exemplary programs.\ What is the county's biggest budget challenge, and how would you deal with it?\ Regional jail costs is our biggest challenge. We are dealing with jail costs by utilizing both home confinement and day reporting programs. At this writing, Putnam County has 38 offenders on day reporting which equates to a monthly savings of over $55,000.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Robert Lloyd Duff\ Star Route Box 299, Poca, WV 25159\ Party: Republican\ Biographical information: Greenbrier Military School, Scientific Diploma; The American College, chartered life underwriter designation; West Virginia State College, general diploma; Department of Public Safety, almost two years; Aetna Insurance (adjustor); Mass Mutual Life Insurance Co.; Green Acre Cable Company, (owner); Duff Ambulance President.\ Gazette\ Would you close meetings to the public to discuss sensitive or controversial issues?\ I feel that meetings should be public with the exception of issues dealing with personnel. I feel that should the county government be dealing with issues such as possible purchase of items which are ""time sensitive"" these should be on an individual basis. After the decision has been made I feel the general public should know before the decision is voted on.\ What are the county's most pressing priorities?\ I spoke with the citizens and almost all agree that we need jobs. The mention was made that our children have to drive to Huntington or Charleston for part-time work. As for our adults - we are looked on as a ""bedroom community"" and we all know how far they have to drive in order to feed their families.\ Daily Mail\ What concerns do you have about home confinement and day reporting programs?\ I feel that an excellent job is being done with the home confinement and day reporting. I feel it keeps our jail costs down substantially as well as forces some of those convicted of smaller crimes to take training and to further their education. This has a long-range benefit of reducing our future jail costs.\ What is the county's biggest budget challenge, and how would you deal with it?\ I feel that budget oversight is lacking. There are some contracts, which are given and have not been put out to bid. Some of them are paid on a monthly basis to escape the limits. Citizens I have spoken with are complaining about the home growth and no business growth. This necessitates more infrastructure with a smaller return on taxes than a business would pay. We need more businesses in this county.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Craig C.

However, the jury is still out as far as implementations. Some adjustments no doubt will be made. Also appropriate funding is an issue.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ Due to specific laws as to rights of minors, each case must be handled on an individual basis. In some cases, the school system must wait until legal proceedings play out.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal days to a minimum?\ First appropriate planning of each year's calendar must be a priority with this in mind. Also there must be a well-established and understood county policy toward this end. Both classroom time and teacher planning must be given their appropriate due.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes\ Virgil F.

There are two schools of thought on creation and evolution. Students should learn both.\ What is your opinion of the No Child Left Behind Act?\ It has been a good step in the right direction, but changes need to be made to give more local control.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ If vandalism occurs on school property the school system should make the offenders pay for damages and some type of community service to the school.\ What would you do to keep early dismissal days to a minimum?\ No response\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ No response\ Sam Sentelle\ 38 Poplar Hills, Hurricane, WV 25526\ Party: Non-Partisan\ Biographical information: EdD, University of Tennessee, 1969; post graduate work Marshall University; Superintendent of Schools, Putnam County, 1989-2004; Superintendent of Schools, Logan County, 1981-87; teacher, Logan County, 1987-89; High School Principal, Elizabethton, TN, 1976-81.\ Gazette\ Do you support the teaching of Intelligent Design in biology classes?\ No.\ What is your opinion of the No Child Left Behind Act?\ Mixed opinion. Improperly weighed favoring small schools; evaluation should be at state level.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in cases of vandalism by juveniles?\ All actions should be consistent, and fair; weighed against impact on general school population.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal days to a minimum?\ Change state attendance law through legislative action.

It is however, difficult to meet the requirements especially in the area of special education student attendance. Teachers also carry a higher administrative burden due to reporting requirements. More federal funding should be made available for school systems to meet the acts requirements.\ Daily Mail\ What actions should the school system take in case of vandalism by juveniles?\ Schools should follow the law in regards to students and expulsion. It should prosecute those who have been identified as causing the damage. Putnam has installed video cameras in schools in an attempt to catch vandalism when it occurs. We also have a security attendant in residence on the school campus to deter vandals.\ What would you do to keep early-dismissal days to a minimum?\ There is a provision in state law that allows a county to bank time and dismiss early for staff development. Putnam County meets staff development requirements without using banked time. We try not to dismiss school early.\ Have you signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices?\ Yes"
224,"My introduction to solar technology occurred in 1973.\As a young Air Force communications technician assigned to the missile silos in Montana, I watched in fascination as engineers from General Dynamics (as I remember the vendor) assembled a number of solar systems as part of some field testing program. By today's standards, the technology was primitive. The modules were huge and not very efficient.\But they did produce direct current electricity to charge big battery banks. I was fascinated by the idea of harvesting power from the sun, and every break I was out there bugging the engineers and techs and trying to understand how it all worked.\One thing I remember still: When I asked if this would ever be possible for the average home, one of the engineers just laughed and said ""not until the electric companies figure out how to put a meter on the sun.\Fast forward more than 40 years and look where we are. Thanks mostly because of a concept called Net Metering, and also evolving technology, solar on your home is quite possible. Our company has installed solar systems all over the state from the town hall of Man in southern West Virginia to the municipal building in Beech Bottom, looking down on the barges going up and down the mighty Ohio River.\Many of our systems are in the Eastern Panhandle, but we have customers in every region on the state. Some are big systems, some are small systems, and some feature battery backup.\Customers install solar for varied and very individual reasons. Some wanted to reduce their carbon footprint and help protect the environment; some just to reduce the annual electric bill; many for the peace-of-mind of having stored energy available during grid outages.\Many customers cite a combination of the listed reasons. But they all made the investment - which is considerable.\And, there is another other thing they all have in common: They all want their elected representatives to protect them from a power grab by the utility companies that would undermine their investments. House Bill 2201 is an example of this kind of power utility power grab, and it is now heading back to the desk of Gov. Tomblin.\HB 2201 is not a good bill. Good bills are written to fix a well-defined problem. The purpose of HB 2201 is obscure to both legislators and the public.\To those who understand solar energy, it is clear that HB 2201 boosts profits of the utility companies at the expense of the public and to stifle competition to the monopoly.\I respectfully request that Gov. Tomblin veto this bill again.

225,"An attempt by the Legislature's Republican majority to pass legislation repealing a 2009 energy law has cleared its first hurdle in both the House and Senate, but one critic of the measure says the action provides no benefit to the state. Both chambers are working on bills to do away with the Alternative and Renewable Energy Portfolio Act, the so-called cap-and-trade bill, originally passed when Sen. Joe Manchin was governor. Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, told members of both the House Energy Committee and the Senate Energy, Industry and Mining Committee his organization supported the original bill, House Bill 103, but has had second thoughts as the industry has changed over the past six years.\""It came about as one of those things we thought would be a good idea, looking at Longview being built and Mountaineer plant doing its carbon sequestration project and a number of things, Raney told the House committee, referencing two large-scale projects aimed at improving energy efficiency across West Virginia. ""I think at that point, the (Manchin) administration felt like that would be a great idea. If you recall, the original bill was passed but then it was brought back to amend in clean coal technologies that would provide for different generations' abilities of plants around the state. We figured it was a foregone conclusion so we tried to get it fixed as best we can to protect our people, protect those generating electricity with coal. We've been all over the board with this. We defended it, but today it's a different world than it was in 2009.\Raney said Environmental Protection Agency regulations and rules implemented since then have changed how the Coal Association views the bill, which passed in special session.\""It becomes even more critical now not to dictate what fuel is used. We should let the free market determine that, Raney told lawmakers. ""We don't think West Virginia ought to be in the business of advocating or mandating a certain amount of electricity be generated in a certain way.\The 2009 bill establishes standards for the sale of electricity generated from alternative and renewable energy sources. Manchin said the Legislature heard from industry leaders, coal miners and environmentalists to pass a bill that takes advantage of all of West Virginia's energy resources.\""Our law showed the country that coal could continue to lead our nation toward energy independence, while also reducing emissions, Manchin said in a statement issued Thursday. ""Coal will be a part of our nation's energy portfolio for the next several decades, and West Virginia must lead the way in showing other states how to produce and burn coal more efficiently and cleanly. This law struck a balance between our economy and our environment, and has reduced utility rates for middle class West Virginians, something all of our elected officials should be focused on.\Sammy Gray, a lobbyist for FirstEnergy, told both legislative committees the utility company can meet the standard set forth in the bill through 2025. He said repealing the bill isn't necessary, but such action wouldn't harm the industry.\""We've never been favorable of picking winners and losers, he said.\House Bill 103 didn't do anything to change FirstEnergy's business plan, but regulations handed down by the EPA since then have, Gray said. He noted several states have a similar law, but he thinks the market should determine the pools from which power utilities draw energy rather than set that in policy.\Gray said FirstEnergy already gives a credit to customers for energy they produce from sources such as windmills and solar panels. That's a regulation handed down by the Public Service Commission, and House Bill 103 simply codifies that regulation.\No one from the PSC was present at the House Energy Committee meeting to answer questions. The committee unanimously passed the bill, which will now be sent to the judiciary committee.\A portion of the discussion in the Senate committee focused on an amendment put forth by Sen. Herb Snyder, D-Jefferson, on net metering, a practice that provides credits to solar energy system owners for electricity added to the system's grid.\After some discussion, Sen. Mitch Carmichael, R-Jackson, who was one of the bill's sponsors, agreed with the concerns of his colleague and asked for an amendment to the bill to include a provision on net metering.\The bill will now be worked on by committee staff members to address issues with net metering, said Sen. Jeff Mullins, R-Raleigh, who serves as committee chairman. ""We want to make sure that people who have invested in that type of energy be able to maintain their credits, he said.\Mullins said he has not heard any resistance from anyone else, beyond the net metering concerns, regarding the bill and that its repeal will benefit the state's coal industry.\""Repealing this bill will basically make the markets dictate who wants to use what type of energy. So if people want to use more coal they can, he said.\But not everyone agreed with the potential impact the legislation could have on the state.\""The bill doesn't make anyone do anything, said John Christensen, who lobbies on behalf of Mountain View Solar. ""This bill is not a West Virginia bill. It's an ALEC bill, he explained. Christensen said the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, has drafted bills for state legislatures throughout the country to advance its conservative agenda.\Christensen said the bill's purpose is not what West Virginia lawmakers are making it appear to be.\""This is not about traditional energy versus renewable energy. This is about keeping the rules for net metering in their place, he said.\Christensen said dozens of concerned West Virginians spent time on Thursday to call lawmakers to urge their support of keeping net metering rules. While he remains hopeful that their concerns will be heard, Christian said the proposed legislation was nothing more than the new Republican majority putting on a show.\""It's them flexing their muscles so they can tell their people that this is what we want to accomplish, he said.\Carmichael dismissed the notion that the bills were coming from the American Legislative Exchange Council. ""In no way shape or form, he said. The majority leader said state lawmakers have made similar attempts dating as far back as when the original law was passed. ""It had nothing to do with ALEC, he said.\Contact writer Joel Ebert at 304-348-4843 or joel.ebert@dailymail wv.com.

226," Katrina's impact will be felt by all of us in waves of emotion and cost. Rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf Coast is only the beginning. Here's to doing it wisely, for a change. Take out the surge in profits now slamming into all our wallets. We watched and paid, helplessly, as gasoline prices barreled up before Katrina. The storm's immediate impact was to give even more fuel to the price rise.\ Now we are being told that Katrina's impact will affect heating prices, because 80 percent of American homes are heated with natural gas, the bulk of which comes from Gulf Coast offshore platforms. Government models say we could see a 70 percent increase in our residential gas bills this winter.\ Not to be outdone, West Virginia's contribution to the energy poker game is raising bidding prices right along with the oil boys - on speculation. With oil so expensive, experts see a rosy future for coal as America searches for lower-cost energy from domestic sources. Coal owners, too, see record profits - at our expense.\ The vast majority of us will not profit from these soaring energy prices. But what choice do we have? Are there alternatives?\ One of the biggest customers for West Virginia's coal has already said ""Enough!"" The government of Ontario studied alternative energy costs for the past two years and concluded that Ontario cannot afford coal. In May, officials announced that they were phasing out all their coal plants and beginning an ambitious program of switching to renewable energy - biomass, wind and solar. How can that be? Everyone ""knows"" that coal is the most inexpensive form of energy - or is it?\ Why can't Ontario afford coal? Because its government also pays for all the health care for its citizens. The cost of coal pollution- triggered health care (children's asthma, heart and lung diseases, cancers, mercury poisoning) outweighs any savings from coal. Even though Ontario owns almost 100 percent of the Provincial Canadian power plants, including some of the largest coal-fired power plants in North America, and is the richest province in Canada, it determined that renewable energy is cheaper.\ Ontario also looked at the future and realized that global warming is quite real. Its leaders decided they must accept their share of responsibility and begin to reverse that trend. They must stop emitting the greenhouse gases that are causing it. The hard fact is that global warming demands that we slow down and drastically reduce our burning of fossil fuels, and burning coal is the largest source that has been identified.\ Alternative renewable energy is the answer. If the millions of politically motivated investment dollars currently being put into ""clean coal"" technology were placed in solar research, we, and our children, would be a lot better off. After all, the sun delivers enough energy in one day to give us all the power we need for a year. Yet, another $50 million is being thrown at carbon sequestration - a fancy term for shoving greenhouse gases down into the ground or the ocean bottom, and telling them to stay there. Why not invest in the one consistent and free energy that is now, always has been, and will be in the foreseeable future ready and available - the sun?\ Visionary technologies are already available. For instance, you can buy photovoltaic-cell roof tiles. When you reroof your home or build a new one, these tiles will provide most of the power you need. At certain times of the day, normally at peak summer heat, they will generate more than you can use. In states with net- metering plans, you sell your surplus to the local utility and it avoids burning fossil fuel. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, for example, where there has been exceptional economic and population growth, avoided building any new generating capacity by making their customers their partners instead of their victims. (Look up www.SMUD.com.)\ But West Virginia doesn't have net metering - unless you are a huge corporate user with a co-generation plant on-site. State officials are ""studying"" net metering. Net metering has been studied to death everywhere else, and been adopted in many states as a reasonable method of gaining added generating capacity while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\ Looking at the Ontario decision and the renewable energy plans of many states is critical to any discussion of West Virginia's energy future. When I gave the Legislature a proposal to study an REP for West Virginia earlier this year, I was told by open-minded senators that there is definitely ""no interest.""\ In Flatwoods this week, a few visionary folks will gather to look at all the energy alternatives for homes and businesses. The 2005 West Virginia Conference on the Environment is timely, in view of the recent events and their impact on fossil-fuel energy prices. Come to the Days Inn on Wednesday and Thursday morning. The luncheon speaker is from Ontario, a gentleman who was part of Ontario's analysis that determined that renewable energy is the future.\ There is hope - even for job creation in West Virginia. Many studies have determined that renewable energy creates more jobs than fossil fuel does. As mountaintop removal has mechanized the mining of coal, while wrecking the landscape, it has also wrecked the job market, reducing West Virginia to 15,000 miners today, from 125,000 a half-century ago.\ A renewable future is coming. I believe it is inevitable. Fortunately, I'm not alone.\ Tweddle is an Ontario-born engineer who retired to Charleston in 1998. He is a leader of Republicans for Environmental Protection, the Coalition on the Environment in Jewish Life, the West Virginia Environmental Council and the West Virginia Environmental Institute. The latter group is sponsor of this week's conference in Flatwoods."
227," DAILY MAIL STAFF\ American Electric Power Co. believes that carbon dioxide causes global climate change and, as a consequence, the utility will not build any more conventional coal-fired power plants, a company official said.\ Dale Heydlauff, AEP's senior vice president for environmental affairs, said Tuesday during the West Virginia Environmental Institute's annual Conference on the Environment that the company instead is investing in President Bush's FutureGen project.\ The proposal would spend about $1 billion in federal and private money to build a prototype of a zero-emissions coal-fired power plant. The plant would achieve its zero emissions through a combination of pollution controls and injecting carbon dioxide into an underground storage area.\ ""We're convinced that coal is going to stay in the energy picture,"" he said.\ Members of the audience questioned why AEP isn't doing more to push conservation measures like utilities have in California. Heydlauff said the company supports conservation measures, but they're a tough sell in a state with some of the lowest electricity prices in the country.\ California customers, for example, pay about three times as much for electricity as West Virginia customers, so they have more incentive to look for ways to save money, he said.\ About 75 people attended the morning session of the conference at the Charleston House Holiday Inn. The number fluctuated throughout the daylong conference as some people left and others arrived.\ While the formal subject of the conference was to look at the state's options in a future where climate change policies have put restrictions on the use of fossil fuels, much of the discussion consisted of arguments in favor of those policies.\ Rafe Pomerance, former deputy secretary of state for environmental affairs during the Clinton administration, said West Virginia faces the choice of continuing to fight the implementation of any climate change policies or to participate in the drafting of policies that will be as favorable as possible for the state.\ Jim Kotcon, of the West Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, said one of the worst options would be for the state to ignore the issue and take no action.\ Adapting to climate change will require a shift from an ""economic growth"" paradigm to a ""sustainability"" paradigm, he said.\ Kotcon gave the audience a list of 20 things he thinks the state or its residents should do. No. 1 on the list was to encourage wind power, and Kotcon said he disagrees with many other environmentalists in the state who want tighter regulations on the construction of wind farms.\ No. 2 on his list was allowing net metering in the state. Net metering would allow people and businesses with their own power sources to have meters that turn backward when they're generating more power than they're using.\ Some of Kotcon's other proposals include setting up a carbon trading market, encouraging carbon sequestration, ending exemptions that prevent older power plants from having to meet new air regulations and encouraging the use of solar panels.\ Writer Brian Bowling can be reached at 348-4842 or by e-mail at brianbowling@dailymail.com."
228,"Installing solar panels on your roof is not just for tree-hugging environmentalists. The increasing ease of the process and the financial returns have made going solar practically mainstream. ""By the end of 2020, the amount of installed solar capacity will be 300 percent higher than today, said Dan Whitten, vice president of communications at the Solar Energy Industries Association. ""Nationwide, it grew 10 times between 2008 and 2015.\In Washington, residential solar installations have tripled since 2011, said Chelsea Barnes with EQ Research.\Sun shining on solar panels generates electricity that goes directly into your home's breaker panel, which supplies electricity to power your appliances and devices.\The power that panels produce but don't use goes out of your meter and back into the grid for later use. A net meter - installed by your utility company in place of the standard meter - rolls backward, and at the end of the month calculates your ""net usage from the grid. This is called net metering.\Power generated from the sun is meant to offset your electric bill. How much offset you get depends on how many panels are installed and how much electricity your family uses.\Whatever the amount is, your household remains connected to the grid and you receive an electric bill from the utility.\The goal is to reduce your utility expenses as much as possible.\Eventually, the savings on the electric bill will add up to what you paid for the system, which means from then on you're basically getting free electricity. The average return on investment is 5 1 / 2 years in Washington, said JD Elkurd, executive director at Solar Solution.\The process starts with a site evaluation.\""We go up on the roof. We look at the direction of sunlight, take measurements of the space, see obstacles like air conditioners, vents, ducts, compressors and skylights. Then we know where everything is, how many panels can fit, and we can set them to maximize sun exposure, Elkurd said.\""People assume solar panels have to be on your roof, but they can be on an adjacent structure, said Chris Pierce, who lives on Capitol Hill in Washington. ""Our roof is slate, which can't accommodate panels. But the garage is shingled, and Solar Solution said we could put up 18. They made a computerized drawing on the spot to show us what it would look like.\Installers told Washington resident Greg Crist that based on the sun's position, a porch would be ideal for panels. So as part of a house renovation, he added a front porch and 13 panels were installed on it.\The navy blue, 250-watt, 3-by-5-foot glass panels are manufactured in the United States, China and Mexico. The aluminum racking system Solar Solution uses is made in North Carolina and California. California-made micro-inverters attached to the back of each panel convert the solar energy from a DC current to AC so that the electricity can be used in your home. Panels and micro-inverters have 25-year warranties.\***\Tax breaks and other incentives reduce the cost of electricity and cover a large portion of a system's cost. ""That's why 90 percent of our customers are in the solar business. For financial reasons, it makes sense, said Elkurd.\Here are ways to defray the cost of your system:\* Federal tax credit: One nationwide incentive is an FTC equivalent to 30 percent of the cost. This credit was supposed to expire in December 2016 but was extended for five years.\* Solar Renewable Energy Certificates: Government policy has further incentivized solar on a state level with SRECs.\SRECs are a credit homeowners get when they supply power to a brokerage market and can help offset the initial cost of the system.\Customers can sell SRECs to Solar Solution. ""We'll buy - in advance - eight years worth of SRECs and apply that money to your project cost, bringing it down about 35 percent [including federal tax credits], Elkurd said.\The average system size installed in Washington last year was five kilowatts, with 20 panels and costing $16,000, he said. After a 30 percent tax credit of $4,800 and an upfront credit of $5,500 for the SRECs, the cost would be $5,700. This size system typically provides an electric savings of $950 per year at today's rates.\A homeowner can instead broker their SRECs independently (via SRECTrade.com or another brokerage) and receive a check each time a credit is produced. That's what Crist did.\""I chose to go with a brokerage because I ran the numbers and thought I could make more than the $11,000 Solar Solution offered, he said. He said he hopes to pay off his system in a couple of years and make a profit on SREC sales.\* Property tax exemption: In Washington, a property tax abatement ruling allows homeowners to exclude the added value of a solar system from their property value. For every dollar of electricity savings per year, property value is estimated to increase by $20, said Elkurd. The property value of the system described above increased by about $19,000.\* Income-based grants: The federal government sets qualifying income levels. For a household of two, the maximum annual income is $40,967; for a household of four, it's $60,245.\Solar Solution obtained support from D.C. Sustainable Energy Utility, a nonprofit contractor to the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment. DCSEU provides grants to solar contractors who provide and install solar systems for low- and moderate-income District residents at no cost.\In 2014, Solar Solution installed 80 systems under this program; last year, 130. ""We expect to put in 150 this year, Elkurd said.\* Option to lease: If you don't want to buy a solar system, you can lease one for a small application fee. Solar providers own the system, so you don't pay for installation. You pay for the electricity, but at cheaper rate than the utility charges.\""We sell you back the electricity but at about 35 percent below Pepco's [the regional utility] rate, Elkurd said. ""And we don't raise the rate. You lock in the cost of electricity for 15 years, which is the lease contract term. Then ownership reverts to you at no cost. So leasing is actually a delayed purchase. Electricity typically goes up about 5 percent annually.\""From a money perspective alone, I don't know why everyone in D.C. doesn't have panels, said Washington resident Neha Bhatt. ""Financially, solar roofs are becoming a no-brainer, even if you're not trying to save the environment.'""\Credit: Audrey Hoffer The Associated Press"
229,"On Sept. 26, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's administration opened up the process to allow private companies to bid on oil and gas leases located 14 miles beneath West Virginia's section of the Ohio River. The only way to get to these precious reserves is by hydraulic fracturing. A mixture of water and chemicals and pressure will allow the wells to spew forth all that black gold. An opening bid of $17.8 million from one company would include 18 percent in royalties on extracted oil. In what I feel is completely related news, the Koch brothers recently rolled out a new nylon pipeline aimed directly for the fracking industry. Coincidence? No room for coincidence when millions of dollars are involved.\Did we suddenly forget the giant mess Freedom Industries put us in this past January? More than 300,000 West Virginians were directly affected by a leak at a chemical containment facility along the Elk River. The facility was to safely contain MCHM, a nasty, carcinogenic, coal cleaning chemical. One leak from one container containing one chemical systemically shut down the Kanawha Valley.\The fracking industry utilizes closer to 750 different chemicals in its process. Not all 750 chemicals are present at the same time or in the same place being fracked. This in itself makes trying to pinpoint a weak spot virtually impossible, thus making any place on this stretch of the Ohio River susceptible to another potential mishap. The components used in fracking range from relatively harmless (salt and citric acid) to extremely toxic (benzene and lead). At least 29 of these chemicals are proven human carcinogens.\I'm no Pollyanna. There is a load of money to be made in this business. Jobs will be created and our economy may improve, but at what cost? Ten or 20 years from now, when the negative effects of injecting poisons (into or beneath our river beds), comes full circle, our children and grandchildren will be left with an even more fracked up environment and related health issues.\Before we begin depleting the Mountain State of the natural resources that remain, let us also take bids on erecting wind turbines on mountaintops scarred by decades of mining. Wind energy is renewable, has no fuel cost and allows consumers and utility companies a lock in electricity rates that remain constant or lower for decades. Jobs would certainly be created. Jobs that will take West Virginia forward technologically. The caricature of barefoot, dirty hillbillies scrounging around in the bowels of the earth would begin to erase itself.\Wind energy not doing it for you? Let us consider solar power, which as an alternative energy source, is growing so fast, oil and gas businesses would love to shut it down. Forty-three states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands all have adopted net metering policies that require utility companies to buy excess solar power back from homes and businesses.\The fracking gist is this. We have choices. We can choose to take a chance of polluting our water, air and land or move forward technologically and socio-economically. Give our beautiful mountains time to heal and leave a cleaner legacy for future generations.\Lynn Rousseau lives\in South Charleston.\Credit: Lynn Rousseau"
230,"Rick Wilson's op-ed ""More leadership, less posturing on Sunday (Aug. 31) is right on. He raises good questions. I have a few more. There is a total lack of leadership in West Virginia dedicated to the reality that a coal dominated future will not return and not be there for West Virginians much longer. None of the leadership is contemplating, let alone planning for, a diverse energy economy in which retrained miners can have safe clean jobs.\1. Why not? As coal declines, due as Rick and so many others have clearly documented, to economic forces, coal's total cost is uncompetitive with all the cleaner alternatives.\2. Is there really a ""War on Coal? Ranting about the EPA, (whose mandate was confirmed by the Roberts' U.S. Supreme Court, stating it has the legal authority and it is the obligation of the EPA to address climate change), is disingenuous at best.\3. Why sue the EPA when they are backed by the Supreme Court? Sen. Byrd recognized the trends before he left us, and Sen. Manchin is showing some minimal signs of accepting the fact that the true economics of cleaner safer alternatives to coal are certain to continue to drive it down on a death spiral. It did for asbestos in the last century.\4. Can we not learn from that parallel example? Coal and its added legacy costs of health care, documented higher cancer and premature death rates near MTR operations, and the horrific environmental damages like the MCHM spill, and multiple coal waste spills, to say nothing of poisoning the planet with greenhouse gases make coal-fired power too costly in reality.\5. Is your health and mine, and that of our children, our grandchildren and the planet not more important than the coal company's profits? Solar energy is now being generated at $0.05/KW elsewhere in the world, while we are paying $0.09 /KW here in ""low cost energy West Virginia.\6. Why are we so opposed to solar energy, especially when one of the basic raw materials for PV Cells is silicon mined and refined right here in West Virginia?\But the transition to renewables is happening in jurisdictions that have a clear vision of a brighter day with clean renewable energy. Germany has less available sun than West Virginia, but has shown leadership in creating incentives for citizens to embrace and install renewable energy. As a result, it has created 135,000 new jobs by doing so. Last year, it has been recorded that on several days they generated 70 percent of their energy by renewables and are on track to achieve a consistent annual average of 50 percent by 2020.\7. Why is the West Virginia leadership ignoring these global trends and economic opportunities?\Germany originally had hoped to achieve a 20 percent level by 2040, but by offering citizens incentives and choice, their progress has surpassed their modest plans.\8. Would West Virginians not embrace such incentives?\Revenue neutral carbon taxes are also proving their value. British Columbia, a mountainous mineral rich mining province of Canada has had an economic boom that is now documented and directly attributed to implementing a carbon tax.\9. Why is the leadership opposed to proven economic policies that create jobs and clean up our environment.?\West Virginia leadership, including the Legislature, have denied, even removed a pilot program of incentives called net metering.\I have a friend in Arizona who has a ZERO cost of electricity in that hot climate because he has a 20-year lease with a solar installation company who paid for the installation on his house. It sells the excess power back to the utility, and will grant him title to the solar array at the end of the lease. There was no money up front. His lease mirrors his pre-installation electric bill, and is now frozen at that rate for 20 years.\10. How many would like such a deal?\Well, it's not yet available in West Virginia thanks to the leadership and Legislature.\Protecting coal company profits and their political funds is all the current leadership is doing. They are not thinking about planning for the future by retraining displaced miners, or giving people a choice for better health, only preserving their political jobs.\Ask them during this election cycle, ""Where is their vision for beyond coal?\Tweddle is an engineer in Charleston.\Credit: Allan Tweddle"
231,"MAN - The Man Town Hall neighbors the offices of Cliff's Logan County Coal, a branch of an international mining company, and many of the town's residents work as coal miners.\""All of Man, and Southern West Virginia, is coal,"" said Mayor Jim Blevins.\But that doesn't mean there isn't room in a town like Man for renewable energy sources.\A 69-panel solar energy system is being installed on the rooftop of the Man Town Hall and is expected to produce at least half of the electricity the building needs.\""We need every lump of coal, every gallon of oil and every solar panel we can get for energy in this country, if you ask me,"" Blevins said. ""The people of Man are proud of this, and that includes coal miners. It's a pioneering idea for a small town.""\The new grid-tied solar system, provided by Milestone Solar Consultants of Martinsburg, will generate about 20,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in one year, saving $250 a month in the town hall's electricity costs. The system is expected to last for 25 years.\The system's special net-metering feature allows any excess power produced to be sent to the electric company as credit, so that power can be easily accessed at night or on cloudy days.\A meter is programmed to run backwards when that excess electricity is produced, essentially turning the power company into a storage system for the solar-powered building.\The unit was bought for about $80,000 with a grant through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act under the West Virginia Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program.\Man Councilman Darrell Mangrum got the idea to use the available grant money for the new solar system. He worried about the public's response, but said all attention has been positive so far.\""I considered what sort of feedback we would get right in the middle of coal country. I wondered if it would hurt people's feelings or give them the wrong idea. But this is an alternative, not a replacement. I support coal miners 100 percent,"" Mangrum said. ""I think the people know it's good for everyone.""\Mangrum said while the monthly cost cuts may seem minimal, the potential for long-term savings is invaluable.\""Even though it might sound small now, it may make a difference in each person's pocket down the road. Somewhere in the future, especially with rates going up, it may allow us to not raise property taxes and save citizens of our town a lot of money,"" Mangrum said. ""Because of the grant, this didn't cost the town of Man anything. It's a lot of something for nothing.""\Bill Anderson, president of Milestone Solar Consultants, acknowledged his solar energy business is rare in the midst of coal country, but doesn't view coal and solar energy as opposing ideas.\""I don't see any issue with solar power in West Virginia. Renewable energy is absolutely no threat to the coal industry because it's a tiny amount of electricity in comparison to the coal-fired power plants here,"" Anderson said. ""Coal is going to be a dominant source of energy for decades.""\He said because his systems are large investments, all of his customers show important reasons for going solar.\""They're all passionate about something. Some customers want to feel like they're making the world a better place, some want to reduce dependency on the power companies and some just appreciate new technology,"" Anderson said.\No matter the reasons, the savings are always a factor, Anderson said.\""If you've got a commercial system, you get 30 percent as tax credit from the federal government. That means you can depreciate that entire capital asset, and we're talking about $90,000 depreciation in year one. You're going to recoup a lot of that investment,"" Anderson said. ""Most people I talk to are doing it to go green. But, the bottom line is, it still needs to make sense for them financially.""\Anderson said though solar energy systems are catching on, a state like West Virginia is slow to jump on the bandwagon - and not just because of coal.\""One of the things we don't appreciate in West Virginia is the electricity cost. We have one of the lowest rates in the country with a statewide average of about 8 cents per kilowatt-hour. In parts as close as Pennsylvania and New England, the same electricity costs you more than twice that,"" Anderson said. ""That makes the solar proposition a little more dicey because we have relatively inexpensive electricity.""\Anderson said it's crucial for customers to make an informed decision when considering residential systems. Customers should consider how much space they have available, their percentage goal of energy production and their budget.\""There are only a few people doing it in West Virginia right now, but the people that are doing it really want it to improve the environment and their own situations,"" Anderson said. ""You've got to want it, and you've got to have confidence.""\Jim Blevins, mayor of Man, stands on the Man Town Halls roof last week to show off a newly installed solar power system.
